 equals one of my balls being the size of a clementine  




 Thanks for the figurative slap in the face you are right but emotions are powerful things 




 Think I'm gonna retaliate with doxycyclin and learning from this experience sorry to disappoint you 




 This seems to be the general consensus of the thread and I would like to thank all of you for not letting my emotions get the better of me 




 Drunk plus how good sex feels without a condom equals I'm a dumbass 




 I let my emotions get the better of me cause I'm fucking pissed off. Everyone in this thread is right doing anything to him is childish and not going to change anything in the long run 




 Then I find out I'm a horrible judge of character and lose faith in humanity 




 A little fucking callous but you make good points. 




 You could be completely right but I'm usually a very untrusting person because I have had the shit manipulated out of me before. She has proven herself to me thus far but of course she could just be a manipulative bitch and be incredibly good about it. If i find out that's true goddamn I don't know if I could trust anyone ever again. 




 Like I said i trust her a lot and I'm usually a very cynical person. You could definitely be right but I think I'm a good judging people and she has proven herself to me though. But everyone in this thread saying to be the better man are correct. I'm letting my emotions get the better of me. 




 She figured out he was cheating on her about a week after she had gotten an STD test and was clean. She dumped him immediately afterwards and we met about month later. I now have chlamydia and epididymitis because of an admittedly lapse in judgement on my part(bareback).

Her last boyfriend was obviously a huge piece of shit. I trust her story 100% because she got an IUD and had to get tested before that. I had also gotten tested recently and the only girl I have fucked since then is her. I am 99.9999% sure that I am the only guy she has fucked since the breakup, we have a very open and trusting relationship.

I just found out about the STD so obviously emotions are running pretty high. He not only cheated on this girl that I care for a lot but also gave us both chlamydia. What would you do in this situation reddit?

**EDIT**: One of the first times reddit has actually been productive for me instead of counterproductive. Y'all are right I am letting my emotions getting the better of me and this is mostly my fault 




 be afraid 




 I suggest watch the documentary When you're strange. It's narrated by Johnny Depp and tell the story of the Doors in a very entertaining way. Although I guess you'd have to fuck up hard to make something about Jim Morrison's life not entertaining.

If you like that read the biography No One Here Gets Out Alive 




 a little? 




 Just remember definitely has "finite" in it. You'll never spell it wrong again 




 Wow that's really lame 




 Are you sure you're not just a dick? Personally anyone who describes themselves as "speaks charismatically" comes off as a bit narcissistic to me...  









 What really helped me to learn to snap my fingers is that the sound doesn't come from rubbing your middle finger with your thumb. Instead the thumb is used to build up the tension in this finger and the sound actually comes from your middle finger hitting the base of your thumb/palm after it is "released" by your thumb.

 I still wanna fuck I just can never finish. This leads to the somewhat weird situation of faking it(I'm a guy) which I have done multiple times. Would NOT recommend.  




 Ah thanks, shoulda noticed that, I figured it was something to do with "Low" but english wasn't exactly my best subject 




 Dumb question but what is the typo? 




 If anyone else is like me and read this as "albino cow" here's a picture to satisfy your curiosity: http://i.imgur.com/ZmJE8.jpg WARNING its incredibly fucking boring

 I really wish MMOs had followed the route Asheron's Call paved instead of going the EverQuest route. It's kind of sad to think what could have been 




 I've been hoping for years that some day someone will start up a private server that's only patched up up to how the game was around 2002. It's just not the same game anymore, you can be a tumerok, shadow, olthoi, etc. now and they just have added so many useless features. Macroing also has taken over and if you want to compete you basically have to do it 









 i wouldnt do gamea id do drugs that way i always win

 The algorithm iPhones use to take pictures captures the light first at the center or the photo and then moves radially outward. The picture is takien over a period of time, not instantly so effects like this occur when you take pictures of fast moving objects. 




 Oh hey I know I'll start writing in the middle of the paper instead of the side and the first four lines will get gradually more indented. Then for no reason I'll do the exact opposite with the next two lines, hmm now it's time to spice things up and indent again and I'll bring together all together with final 2 lines actually aligned. What a masterpiece

 When I'm done eating a Mulligan's meal, for weeks afterwards, there are flecks of meat in my mustache. And I refuse to clean it because every now and then a piece of meat will fall into my mouth.

 Thank you! This combined with the adenosine receptor mediated modulation of the permeability of the BBB seem like huge breakthroughs. 




 Wow thank you, that is such an amazing breakthrough in so many ways. I can't believe I've never heard anything about it 




 I'm quite in to chemistry myself and have been doing research on this topic for a while because Alzheimer's runs in my family and this kind of stuff interests me. It seems the gene mutations causing AD have been located but as of now there is still no real treatment. How far away are we from being able to actually cure this disease, if one of my parents develops AD will there be a cure?

Also please don't dumb down your responses for me, I have taken biochemistry and cell physiology so I can understand a lot of the jargon. 




 A couple years ago i stumbled across an incredibly weird webcam video of a very strangle looking guy covering creep by radiohead. I remember he had a spotty, disgusting moustache and was terrible at singing. If anyone has the link to this video I would be forever grateful 









 Also I'm pretty sure the main riff was just something slash would do to warm up on guitar and practice skipping a string or something like that. Axl heard him playing it and told him that that was going to be their next song

 I remember Animal was the first to hit 100 and he was on Thistledown right? I saw him ingame once and was starstruck. He also sold his account for $10k if I recall correctly, that's ridiculous.

Then Tim the Enchanter hit 126 still hunting in BSD. God I can't imagine how much grinding he did and how long that took just killing tuskers for like 15k xp a piece.

 I grew up in central texas and moved to atlanta for college. I can safely say Texas summer weather is much more bearable than atlanta summer weather. If you would have told me that 4 years ago I would have slapped you in the face but it's true 




 I love mold. Moldy, mold, mold. Here it goes down, down into my belly...  




 I'm a BME taking 18 hours this semester and I beg to differ... 




 Let's face it, this school is fucking hard... especially when professors refuse to give out practice tests or only give out one(*cough* physics department *cough*). I think it would benefit everyone if we put together a r/gatech word server where anyone could upload materials from classes they previously took(like a fraternity or sorority word). I could probably set something up if there's any interest... 




 Oh all the time. One time a few friends and I were tripping on acid and we decided to throw milkdrop up on one of the projectors. Got a few weird looks from the kids trying to study(fucking nerds) but it was a great experience 




 I don't think reddit would benefit from people ignoring this so much as not misinterpreting it. It's not saying plagiarize and copy, it's saying take things that speak to you from various sources and make them your own.

 For some reason, my hands and feet sweat excessively at all times. Even as I'm typing this now, I can feel the grimy, clammy sweat building up on my hands and it's really uncomfortable. This always makes handshakes pretty awkward, I definitely would be pretty grossed out if I shook someone's hand only to find it wet with sweat. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this? Of course I know the ol' wipe your hands on your pants trick, but that just doesn't quite cut it for me any more... 




 **Emily:** Really Charles, people will think-...

 FUCK FUCK FUCK

You can say fuck here... there's no need to censor it 




 Yes because making billions of dollars is petty 




 I'm from the US and honestly I'd kill for an english accent. I can do a decent posh accent(or so I've been told by actual british people) and I've thought about just one day starting to talk in a british accent and never stopping. Sure I'd loose all my friends probably but eventually I could make new friends who wouldn't know I'm actually american. I'd get so many more chicks that way it'd be awesome 




 Hmmm, how about saying it was an interesting movie made me think about things I never would have thought about before? Does that make me sound stupid?
 









 Jim Morrison for sure 




 Yeah, he has a ton of really mind blowing videos. My favorite is where he somehow subconsciously convinces like 30 mall goers to raise their hands in the air at the same time with just a few announcements over the loudspeaker.

Honestly, I can't help but be skeptical that he didn't stage some of his videos but everything I've watched paints him as a honest down to earth guy who wouldn't stage things just to increase his ratings.

Here's the video if anyone's interested: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOEKdaXIEHc 




 This interview of him with Richard Dawkins is really interesting and informative if you want to find out more.

 Get outside man. Go hiking or something. Go look at nature and try to comprehend the trillions of complex organic reactions that are occurring right before your eyes. Look at the stars and imagine what those little balls of light actually are... how many other planets filled with life must be out there, how insignificant you are in the grand scheme of things. That stuff always trips me out when I'm on acid.

 BP's Managing Director, Bob Dudley, reacts to the seeing for the first time the viral hit video "BP Spills Coffee" in a PBS interview

What a fucking terribly worded sentence. How could you start an article like that? 




 What do you do in a situation like this? Theres no way I could just keep driving, I'd have no choice but to watch just to see how long it went on for. Now I understand the term unwilling dog voyeur 




 Wow I never knew how much of an asshole Edison was. Electrocuting an elephant in front of a crowd of people proves nothing and I'm sure he knew that, its just the general public didn't have much of an understanding of electricity at the time. History certainly doesn't paint him as the type of powerful person who will lie as long as it makes him money. 




 Ah damn that sucks...

 Hmm well whoops I never saw that and I just saw the video today. Sorry I don't read reddit 24/7 and that search is shitty...

 personally i think a poop camel is worse than an old faithful type pooper but thats just my opinion  




 I don't get this viewpoint at all. Technology has progressed enough so that things like instant replay can be used in soccer. Sure coming up with rules so that this could be implemented without drastically changing the game play will take a bit of thought but I believe it is possible. 

In this world cup, in almost every single game I've watched, the refs have made at least one bad call that would have been overturned by an instant replay. Why would you resist trying to make the game more fair? That goal England scored yesterday would have drastically changed the game. The disputed goal this article talks about would have drastically changed the game. 

Change is a good thing if it's done right.

 My favorite movie I've watched on acid was horton hears a who. The visuals are crazy and its a simple children movie so its easy to follow but it also has a really deep and uplifting message. Dr. Seuss was a god damn genius to say so much with so few words 




 I filled up at $2.55 just a second ago in texas 




 i prefer icefilms over ninjavideo or stagevu honestly it has more movies 




 I started doing this this summer and I have no regrets at all. The best websites I've found are:
http://www.icefilms.info
http://www.ninjavideo.net
http://www.stagevu.com

They all stream videos and if you're trying to keep up with a current show they usually put shows up hours within when they actually air.
