 If you were to boil down 5 things that make an outstanding NCO, what would your five pieces of advice be? 

Also, what books do you highly recommend for someone getting ready to pick up their stripes? 




 Hey y'all, 

I'm looking for more books with academic wizards. I loved *Jonathan Strange   Mr. Norrell.* I also really loved the portion of *The Name of the Wind* where Kvothe was attending university. I'm looking for more books where wizarding is seen as an academic pursuit, full of Latin phrases, obscure references, cool robes, classes, and **books!**

Can you help me out? 









 What if a group of wealthy individuals bought a large mass of land. Seeing as it is private property, they can do what they wish right? So they establish a government, much like the US but smaller. They "rent" property out to anyone who wishes to "immigrate". They then regulate environmental practice on this land "it is their private property" and regulate guns, the market, and such (I.e. if you don't obey they kick you off their "private property". They leave a will that states every four years the people must elect a fixed number of people who become "property owners" of this land mass.

Wouldn't this be a state, but completely agreeable with ancap philosophy? 




 I'm the Army vet who posted the question about tattoos recently. I'm looking to become a Middle/High School English teacher in the South (I'm from Alabama). I had some more questions, I'm sorry if there are too many.

* Will being a male put me at a disadvantage?

* How difficult is it to secure a job after I get accreditation?

* What is Summer like for y'all?

* Are you allowed to present ideas for electives you'd like to teach?

* What are some good resources (books, articles, and websites) related to education you would recommend to a young teacher?

Thanks in advance for your help. I've found this sub super friendly.

 




 I'm pursuing a degree towards education, with the intent to be a Secondary English teacher in the public school system. Obviously I'm not a fan of the system, but kids need to be taught even in our messed up system.

My questions are thus;

* What has your experience in the public school system done for your libertarian philosophy?

* Do you ever find conflict between your career and philosophy?

* How do you deal with the world of public education as a libertarian (especially unions, standardized testing, federal interventionism etc).

* Any other thoughts, tips, or tricks about being a libertarian in the public education sector? 




 Hello, I currently have some gold bullion coins from the US mint, but I'm curious if it's possible to buy gold bullion coins from other nations? 




 Hello, I'm a Confessional Presbyterian (OPC). I'm looking for someone to have some discussion with regarding Worship, Ecclesiastical Polity, and the nature of the Sacraments. These are three things I am conflicted about, and am between my confession's view, and the view of historic Reformed Anglicanism. I'd really like to carry out the conversation via PM if that is ok. 

 




 Hello,

I'm not sure if this is the correct sub forum for my question, but here goes. I'm an Army veteran about to go back to college for English Education. I'd like to teach Middle/High School English. The thing is, I have tattoos. My arms above my elbows are half sleeves, and I have four on my lower arms. Will this pose a problem for me?
 




 To all my fellow bibliorganizationophiles out there. How do you organize your home library? I have a pretty extensive library, mostly dealing with literature, literary criticism, and theology. I'm looking for a more detailed way to keep it organized, as it is getting rather out of hand (i.e stacks of books with no shelfly home). 




 Caliban is my favorite Shakespearean character. I've always been baffled as to who he is exactly. At various points reading and watching The Tempest I've seen him as a mentally handicapped person, a cannibal like native islander (his name is an anagram of the Spanish word for *cannibal*) and various monstrous sub-human characters. 

What's your speculation about the nature of Caliban? What's your favorite way to see him portrayed?  




 I understand that each major category has a 100's place, but behind that how exactly does the system work? For example, you get a book on Elizabethan history, it would go in the 900's place, but how do you determine the rest of the Classification?

 









 Do you feel society in general owes you anything?

Put another way, do you feel you are entitled to anything by virtue of being born?

Why does society owe you these things?

 




 **I was reading *The Theology of Prayer* by the great Southern Presbyterian Benjamin Palmer, when I came across this quote. Pairs wonderfully with the first question of the Shorter and Larger Catechisms I think.**

"Upon this soul is stamped the seal of the divine attributes. In his intelligence man dimly reflects the divine wisdom; in his affections, the divine benevolence ; in his conscience, the divine rectitude; in his will, the divine power. Such a being can find his true sphere only in God. All these endowments point to that august source from which they are derived, as the only goal to which they can aspire; and the comprehensive act in which they all embark is the homage of an intelligent and eternal worship."

~ Benjamin M. Palmer, The Theology of Prayer 




 Theoretically, could we ever base the US dollar on a cryptocurrency standard comparable to the gold standard? Obviously we would have to eliminate the FED and the Keynesian stuff. Obviously the cryptocurrency would have to be non government controlled. We all agree that we need a strong dollar backed by some resource (gold, silver etc). Also we agree that the market should decide said resource. What if the market chose cryptocurrency?

Is it feasible? What steps would we have to take? 




 First, forgive me for being an ignorant American here.

If the U.K. is one country, why are England, Scotland etc separate national football clubs? Why isn't there just one U.K. football club? 




 It seems that the presbytery in whose geographical bounds Leithart is currently ministering in (Evangel Presbytery) has sent a second letter to the presbytery Leithart is a member of (Pacific Northwest Presbytery) regarding his laboring outside the geographical bounds of his own presbytery. 

http://theaquilareport.com/pca-evangel-presbytery-asks-peter-leitharts-presbytery-to-deal-with-his-ministry-status/

I have a few questions.

1. If Leithart is a TE at a CREC church, why is this an issue for the PCA presbytery in whose geographical bounds he is ministering in? Restated; since he isn't working in a PCA church, how does this affect Evangel Presbytery? 

2. Why does it seem the presbyteries are more keen to address his unconformity with the Book of Church Order, while still not addressing his unconformity with the WCF (FV)? 




 Curious as to what y'all think about the concept of indentured servitude as punishment for nonviolent crimes. To clarify I don't mean *slavery*, at least not in the antebellum sense.

What I mean is, if someone violates your property rights (fraud, theft etc) then they have to work without pay for a period of time.

This could be done two ways

1. The criminal could work for whoevers property rights they violated.

2. The criminal works at a special labor camp.

Of course, it would have to be done humanely. No violations of NAP upon the "prisoners". Feed them, etc. But instead of sending them to a prison where they simply are turned into more violent criminals, we send them to work without wages for a period of time relative to their crime.

Is this a wacky idea? 




 I mean this as a friendly question, but this sub is so diverse that I was curious what the general consensus was.

Are you TR? (TR=Truly Reformed; Strictly Confessional, Old School, Strict Regulative Principle of Worship, Cessationist, Not a broad Evangelical, Hodge-ian) 

If you don't fit into these categories, what is the definition of *Reformed* according to your systematic theology?

 I want to join one, but can't decide which community is best.

Not beer advocate. The ratings seem soo amateur..

I'm really leaning towards Beer Citizen.

Any others? 









 Other than a good beer selection (which is a given).

In my town, there are *zero*. Everywhere only has the typical adjunct "party beers". I usually just buy my beer to drink at home. But I'm going on a road trip soon, and I'm looking to visit some good bars on the way. I want to know what qualities I should look for to determine whether a bar is worthwhile before I spend too much time/money without the best experience? 




 I've only been to two. Both weren't exceptional. The food was great, but the beers were average (still better than adjunct lagers). The concept is interesting to me though. Reminds me of old medieval taverns where the local tavern keeper brewed their own beer.

Anyways, what has your experience been? 




 "Let us therefore hold it for certain and firmly established that the soul can do without everything except the word of God, without which none at all of its wants are provided for. But, having the word, it is rich and wants for nothing, since that is the word of life, of truth, of light, of peace, of justification, of salvation, of joy, of liberty, of wisdom, of virtue, of grace, of glory, and of every good thing. It is on this account that the prophet in a whole Psalm (Psalm cxix.) and in many other places, sighs for and calls upon the word of God with so many groanings and words.

Again, there is no more cruel stroke of the wrath of God than when He sends a famine of hearing His words (Amos viii. 11), just as there is no greater favour from Him than the sending forth of His word, as it is said, "He sent His word and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions" (Psalm cvii. 20). Christ was sent for no other office than that of the word; and the order of Apostles, that of bishops, and that of the whole body of the clergy, have been called and instituted for no object but the ministry of the word."

~ Martin Luther, *Concerning Christian Liberty*

P. S. I don't know if this sub is a fan of quotations, but this one hit me while I was reading the aforementioned work. 




 What beer related bucket-list items do you want to accomplish before you die?

Mine follows:

1. Drink a pint of Guinness in a Dublin pub. (Which Dublin pub is the best?)

2. Drink *Calvinus* which is brewed only in Geneva.

3. Drink at the Wittenberg brewpub in Wittenberg Germany.

4. Visit all of the Belgian Trappist breweries. 




 I've heard Guinness is better from the tap. I like their stout (the import version). I was just curious is tap Guinness kegged with nitrous? 




 Me, I like traditional beer styles. Stouts are my favorites, and I also love the traditional ale styles. I rarely ever try cutting edge, innovative, or nontraditional styles (odd combinations/ingredients, hard liquor in beer etc) beers. They just don't interest me. Plus, with all the stouts out there to try, I have enough on my to-drink list! About as nontraditional as I typically go is something like a peanut butter milk stout.

What about you? How often do you venture into the new styles of the beer world?

Edit; sorry about the spelling mistake in the title. I cannot type well on a tablet. 




 I love watching YouTube beer reviews. I'm a big fan of *The Albino Rhino* and *Chadz* beer reviews. I'm looking for other quality reviewers. 

Who do y'all recommend? 




 I'm gonna be honest. I do the unthinkable... sometimes, I drink Budweiser. Now I usually drink craft beer. But sometimes, is there anything wrong with just drinking a cold one the same way you'd drink a coke? 

Sometimes my more snobby craft beer friends hate on my for drinking Bud or Yuengling while watching the game or barbequing. The fact is, when I'm doing those things I intend on drinking more than six beers, and drinking them easily. I'm not drinking them for complexity etc.

anyways, how do you feel about the snobbier side of craft beer? Do you avoid macro's at all times?  









 I'm just curious what the various approaches are. Do you have a regular time for family worship (devotions)? What do you do during that time?

Our family does every night. We open with a psalm or hymn, then we will read either a question from the Larger Catechism or the Heidelberg. Afterwards we will get into whatever we are studying. Sometimes we go through a book of the bible, sometimes we explore a particular topic, sometimes we use a book or other material (notably Paul Miller's material). We usually close with prayer time for various and sundry requests. Though we don't have kids yet, when we do we are considering using the New City Catechism. 









 It is very hard for me to choose, but if I had to narrow it down it would be a toss up between Thomas Watson, Thomas Brookes, and Samuel Rutherford.

1.  Watson's *Art of Divine Contentment* was phenomenal.
2. Brookes's *Precious Remedies Against Satan's Devices* has probably had more of an impact on my walk than any other book.
3. Rutherford's *Letters* taught me a lot about compassion, and still provide a continual source of comfort and pastoral encouragement when I am away from home.

What about y'all? 









 Consuming alcoholic beverages, yay or nay?

As for myself I'm all for them in moderation. I believe beer is one of God's greatest physical gifts.  




 I recently started reading Chomsky for the first time. Up to this point I've never paid much attention to him, instead favoring more Rothbardian authors. Now that I've read him, he seems...inconsistent. How can someone who supports liberty, anarchy even, support the welfare state and the UN? Am I missing something? 









 The only responses everyone is throwing out are;
1. Gun Control - obviously a bad idea. I shouldn't even have to expound on why.
2. Lock away mentally unstable folks who "seem" violent. - Another obviously idiotic and oppressive idea.

What are some common sense ways to approach this subject without violating liberty? 









 I'm looking for something quirky, with realistic characters and great relationship development. Something similar to "Tell the wolves I'm home" by Carol Rifka Brunt (which I just finished and *adored*).  




 They can, apparently digest the wood pretty well, and consume it at a rate of 361.9237001 cubic centimeteres per animals per day according to the "Annals of Improbable Research".(1995) 




 Just curious how offer y'all contact your representatives?  














 Obviously not a question for anarchists, but do you think secession is legal? If so, under what circumstances is it legal? 









 There's a lot of interesting/high quality ones out there, and I love collecting them. What's the most interesting one in your collection? 




 Hey y'all, forgive me if this is a super amateur question, but I'm studying for my tech license and thinking about putting a 2m in my car for my first radio.

My question is, what antenna do you use? Do you use the default antenna on your car? If so, how do you connect it to the radio? 




 When he lost to Santino, Sandow's outburst seemed legit to me, they sure seemed to avoid acknowledging it happenef 









 I'm 21, planning on opening a Roth IRA target date fund. I've narrowed my choices down to either Vanguard, Charles Schwab, or T. Rowe Price. I'm leaning towards Vanguard. What do y'all think? 









 Originally, we were founded on the basis of the Articles of Confederation, until some of the federalists had their say. It seems to me the AoC established a more decentralized government. Do you think we should have stayed under it? If so, how would America look today? 









 I am a buy and hold investor, how exactly does an ETF work, and what can it do for me? 














 I'm 21 years old, trying to start my long term investment vehicle. I'm seriously considering a Roth IRA because of the tax benefits. (I am sure my tax bracket is lower now than it will be when I retire). I've heard a lot lately about Indexed Life Insurance policies and Annuities. It seems they give you a floor so you won't lose money, and you can withdraw the cash benefit anytime. It seems like flashy smoke and mirrors to me. 
   My question is, what do y'all think? Which investment vehicle performs better, and is likely to leave me in a better position at retirement? 




 Stick with me and you'll go places. 




 Because young men need good role models that spend time with them. 














 It has been explored in a variety of SciFi books/series, but what way do you think it would happen? Through radio? Physical contact? 

I tend to think radiowaves are probably the most likely way they would make contact. Our radio signals are easily picked u and clearly signify intelligent life, and would be one of the first thing a scout would notice about our planet. It makes sense that they would try to contact us through this medium. What do y'all think? 




 I know I know, wacky topic. Just thought I'd throw it out there. Has anyone you've known experienced electronic voice phenomenon? Do you think it is possible for paranormal stuff to be on the radiowaves? 
























 I have a few questions about who y'all think are the best pitchers currently in the MLB?

1. Who is the best all around pitcher in the league?

2. Who is the most diverse pitcher in the league? (Pitcher with biggest and best developed arsenal)

3. Who is the best technician? (Pitcher with a mastery of a single pitch) 




 I'm currently out of the country and I'm using the utwente WebSDR for some listening. Unfortunately, I've never used a waterfall display before, and I'm not sure how to read it. Are the lighter lines radio waves?

 I'm specifically interested in the fashion/lifestyle of the country side of rockabilly. I love Hank William's fringed suits, pearl snaps, and twang. Are there any websites/resources that deal with this subgenre of the lifestyle at all?  









 I'm currently out of the US, and last night was listening to my Grundig shortwave, I picked up an odd signal for someone who said "this is Oscar the engineer" like three times before the signal got too bad. Odd thing is, I've heard the same transmission before while I was in the states and thought nothing of it. Does anyone know who Osacr the Engineer is?? I know it is a longshot, but I thought I'd ask yall 




 I know several times throughout his career Tesla claimed to have recieved raidiowave transmissions from Mars. Does anyone know of a book/resource that further elaborates on the story behind this?

 I really love good biographies. And I love classical music! Have any of y'all read a great composer biography that you really enjoyed? 




 Specifically one dealing with the philosophy of work/work ethic, a history of blue collar work,  sociopolitical aspects of blue collar work, etc... Can anyone help me out? 




 There were many composers who wrote deliciously melancholy pieces, but on the whole who do you think captures this emotion best? Also, which work by your suggested composer exemplifies this emotion best?

My answer would be Chopin. His melancholy pieces are among my favorites. I think his "Prelude in e minor" or perhaps "Nocturne in C# minor" best exemplify what I mean. 









 I'm not talking how-to books, or electrical books, but history books. The only two I've read so far are 

Hello everybody! The dawn of American Radio by Anthony Rudel 
 
And

Empire of the Air: The Men Who Made Radio by Tom Lewis.

Any more suggestions? 









 I know, odd request. I'm looking for either a history/nonfiction book about early country music (1930's to 1960's) or some good biographies of early country musicians.

 As a book lover my local library is one of my favorite places. In fact, I prefer my local library to my local bookstore. I think libraries stand as bastions against the overwhelming illiteracy of our culture. What about y'all? 

1. Is your library well stocked?

2. Are the librarians helpful?

3. How frequently do you go to your local library?

 I listen to the Tom Woods show regularly, and I'm looking for more libertarian or even an/cap radio shows/podcasts. Can y'all help? 












































 I know it's an odd question, but my favorite characters have always been the tinkerers/mechanics. I love the guys who play with cool scifi toys, keeping even the most junky stuff running long past its prime. Can anyone think of good novels somehow related to this theme? 



















 Hi y'all, I'm pretty new to amateur radio. I've only built a few crystal sets, and am just now getting into tube radios. I am curious about trying to build a simple homemade transmitter. What types of transmitters are the simplest for home build? 









 I'm looking for some libertarian imagery to incorporate into a tattoo. Maybe y'all could help? Specifically something I can incorporate into an old school style tat. All I've come up with so far is somehow using the Guy Fawkes mask (and I know he wasn't libertarian so don't even go there). Any ideas? Something that'll make a statement? 









 I know it's a huge selection, but fantasy is chock full of magical swords, staffs, wands, and other enchanted goodies each with their own characteristics. Often I find that the props become characters themselves. So If you had to pick a personal arsenal, what items would you have in it?  




 What's your favorite vehicle of any kind from SciFi? Or, what SciFi vehicle do you think plays such a big part in the story that it becomes a character itself?
