 Oh so sorry m'lady, it's not often you see a beautiful woman such as yourself on sites such as these. You must be very intellectual, are you an atheist by any chance?

 Here's the thing. You said a "black person is in prison."
Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.
As someone who is a scientist who studies blacks, I am telling you, specifically, in Ebolatology, no one calls black people prisoners. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.
If you're saying "negro family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Niggerae, which includes things from niggers to negroes to lightskins.
So your reasoning for calling a black person a prisoner is because random people "call the black ones prisoners?" Let's get sandniggers and mexicans in there, then, too.
Also, calling someone a nigger or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A nigger is a nigger and a member of the negro family. But that's not what you said. You said a black person is a prisoner, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the negro family niggers, which means you'd call lightskins, sandniggers, and other races prisoners, too. Which you said you don't.
It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?

 I just learned of this recently in my high school history class. At the Battle of the Granicus, Alexander the Great was about to be killed by Spithridates, a satrap, from behind. As his arm was striking, Cleitus the Black severed his arm just before he could deal the finishing blow. Cleitus the Black was a commanding officer of Alexander. I did a project on the battle. It was really like out of a movie. What's ironic is, later in Alexander the Great's conquest, he killed Cleitus in a drunken quarrel.

 I am from Canada as well and I have seen commercials for the Canadian army. They were really high-quality too. 




 So let's say episodes 7-9 all turn out to be successful, what would you think about a remake of episodes 1-3 (assuming that is legally possible)? They would stick to the same storyline and plot relatively, but get rid of things that were quite obviously failures, and maybe add some new things in to make it feel like a different movie, and fix George Lucas' problems. Then these prequels would replace the old ones as canon, and the old ones could be called the "Jar Jar Trilogy" or something and will basically be referred to as Star Wars' blunder years. 

I think it could definitely work if done correctly. The prequels are actually a great story, just not told very well, in my opinion. What do you think about this? 




 Because I still haven't seen Star Wars: The Force Awakens. And yes, I'm being completely serious.

 Hello folks, I am pretty new to after effects so bear with me. 

I followed [this guy's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx0bKB9aL08) tutorial on how to make smoke in after effects, using the particle playground effect. So I got my desired smoke effect, and all is well, except for one problem. At the start of my 5 second composition, there is no smoke, but as you play the composition, the smoke emerges from the position at which I put the producer (or whatever you call the point of origin for the particles). What I want is for the smoke to already be at its maximum height at the start of the composition. I can't figure out how to do that. 

I hope you guys understand what I mean by that, and if not, I'll add screenshots from my composition. Can anyone help me out and let me know how to make it so that the smoke is already at maximum height at the start of my composition?

Thanks in advance.

 A real human bean 





























 If we are talking about opening scenes, I gotta say Inglorious Basterds. I was holding my breath with anticipation for those 15 minutes and what was on the screen was a guy drinking milk. 




 Yeah, Pratt would basically be Andy Dwyer looking for artifacts. 




 That's also one of the reasons you can't have Chris Pratt. He is Chris Pratt in every role. I agree with you on Bradley to a degree though, I just think he looks a lot like young Harrison Ford.  




 JUST DO IT! MAKE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE! 




 Bradley Cooper looks the part. Chris Pratt has got the charisma but he's basically one big goof and I wouldn't want to see him as Indiana.  This Matthew Davis guy looks acceptable, but I don't know if he has the charisma or the star power or the acting chops. 




 Deckard being a replicant undermined the film a little as well.
 




 I just pray we don't have a complete copy of the OT with Kylo Ren being Darth Vader and Snoke being the Emperor pulling the strings from behind the scenes. It would be lazy writing. Hopefully the story is significantly different. 




 This is bullshit - you're oversimplifying a complex situation to the point of no longer adding anything useful to the discussion. 




 MAD MAX: FURY ROAD!!! 




 Making a full planet of Boba Fetts was definitely a terrible decision on George Lucas's part.

 Just watched Ex Machina. Thought it was absolutely fantastic. Isaac and Gleeson are some of the best actors working right now, for sure.

 I suppose we all have different senses of humor here. I for one, would not laugh at someone kicking BB like a soccer ball. 

IMO the only comedic relief that should be in star wars is C3P0. 




 The whole point of the new trilogy is to tell a new story, not retread the exact same story as the OT. They might as well clone Vader, and Sheev, and then we can have the exact same original films all over again! 




 They tried slapstick comedy with Jar Jar. Look how that turned out. 




 Clone of Tarkin sounds stupid and leads me to think this is just fan fiction. 




 I hope there's no cringey "jokes". Kicking BB-8 would not be funny. 




 You'd think they learned that "funny" characters don't work with Jar Jar 




 That would be so awful. It'd be like Han Solo turning to the camera and winking. 




 When you say it will dispell many rumors, do you think it will confirm the general plot that MSW has come up with or disprove it? 




 I'm pretty sure in the upcoming Battlefront game you will be able to fly TIE fighters on Hoth.

Another question, how did they get the AT-ATs onto the ground in the first place? Just drop them from orbit? 




 I've always wanted to be a Y-wing pilot, even though everyone else would probably rather fly the X-wings. 




 Yes but Boba died (in terms of the film canon). And I wouldn't want to see him shoved in the new one just to be like "Hey guys, you love this character, here he is!" Too many old characters already. 




 The point is that Luke was swayed by the dark side, but ultimately triumphed over it and learned balance. It would be annoying to unwrite all of that for the sake of the new trilogy. 

When I said I could see it under certain circumstances, I was thinking more along the lines of he goes a little insane while in exile. I just don't think his character would be the kind of person to drop all that he's learned throughout his journey and become evil. 




 I know but seeing people well past their prime when we didn't really want to is what I'm saying.  




 Boba Fett has no place in Ep7. THAT would be lazy storytelling. I can see Luke going to the darkside under certain circumstances, despite the fact that it is a retread of Vader, and goes against his character. I'm not hoping for that though.

What I do want to see is good writing, as in dialogue that doesn't make you cringe. I also want to see some new and interesting characters, things we haven't seen before. My worry is that JJ will try too hard to focus on the OT and the past, that he won't be able to move us forward enough.

In terms of the returning cast, I really only care about Luke. Han and Leia seem like they are characters who were never meant to get old. I don't really want to see old Leia in a slave outfit or old Han struggling to catch his breath while walking.

All in all, I want to see something written well that is not too hung up on the OT. 




 Its quite likely  




 If anybody has something to discuss then make a new thread cause I'm hungry for some star wars talk. 




 No proof, but considering the amount of characters it's entirely possible. I just wanted to hear the opinions of others. 




 It's like poetry, it rhymes.  




 I dont understand this new meme 




 I assume too bloated as in too many characters, not enough time to develop them, resulting in a mess.

[Link to thread.](http://boards.4chan.org/tv/thread/58347456) It's mostly shitposting but there is a little bit of discussion.  




 I was in a SW thread on 4chan and someone said that a test cut was shown to the guys at Disney and no one really knew what to make of it because it was very bloated in terms of characters.

Now obviously we can take this with a grain of salt because there was no source or explanation, but it got me thinking that he may be right considering the amount of characters which will be featured in TFA. I would list them all but I'm sure everyone here is well aware.

So I wanted to know your thoughts on this. 




 This looks fun. Does anyone know if there will be an actual story mode? Or at least missions of Star Wars battles we already know? It seems like single-player Stormtrooper zombies could get boring. 




 I agree with this guy. Sometimes it's nice to see what other people think and speculate in this sub.

I don't know about you but I much prefer films as art, and I believe Star Wars films have been art for the past 30 years or so. The MCU is entirely forgettable, and that's what Star Wars will become. Soon, Star Wars won't be special. It'll be another peg on the Hollywood machine, and it makes me sad to think about. 

Telling the backstory of every character cheapens them. You know what Obi-Wan did while on Tatooine? Nothing. He was a hermit who hid around watching Luke grow up. That's what I think. Maybe you think something different. But if we get a trilogy of Obi-Wan films, then both of our personal backstories are rendered void. And instead we get some generic blockbusters about how Obi-Wan secretly dueled with a Sith or something. I don't want that. 

I know I'll get downvoted for this but I'm speaking my mind anyway. What you call enrichment of the Star Wars universe, I call the cheapening of the great original story. 




 So has comic con started? What are the important dates and times to remember? 




 I don't know if I'd have the balls to be a smuggler. I'd probably drop my cargo at the first sight of an imperial starship. 




 Do your patients frequently lose the will to live? 




 I think I'd like to be a droid mechanic. Building new friends and having fun at markets on Tatooine would be quite the life. 




 The point of this question is what would you be if you were just a typical citizen in Star Wars, not special like Jedi or particularly talented like Bounty Hunters. Not everyone can be unique like them. Some people just have to be moisture farmers and stormtroopers and cantina band players. 




 Coruscant. That's the place with the most adventures to be had. 




 Can't wait for a remastered version when the soundtrack for TFA comes out. 




 Yeah but the good thing was that you could dismiss it. I, as well as many other people, only care about the films. The EU was great because it allowed for the people who were hungry for more SW content to have access to it. But let's face it, if you made a movie about a cloned Palpatine, or whatever other ridiculous, glorified fan fiction makes up the EU, it would be trash, and it would also detract from the original films. But that's just my two cents.

Same goes with Rebels and Clone Wars. Disney can say that Ashoka is canon, but most people would agree that no, Anakin didn't have an apprentice. 

I don't want to know what happened to Han before ANH. Let the viewer decide, because it doesn't matter. I don't want to know how Boba Fett came to be, the mystery that surrounds him is his best part. Don't shove characters into movies based on the fact that people like them, because it can destroy the artistic integrity of their story. 

Star Wars is a vast universe of endless wonderful possibilities. Tell a new story for Pete's sake. 




 This question of "What happened between this episode and this episode?" and "What happened to this character before this episode?" will ultimately destroy the Star Wars franchise. It's fine as books but we're seeing it start with films like Han Solo. Soon there will be a Greedo movie and a Wedge Antilles movie and a young Lando movie and a movie that took place between ANH and ESB starring Leia and Chewie. Or maybe it's just me. 




 If they had a trailer they would show it at Comic Con, then do an online release after the panel. You just have a confirmation bias. 




 "There's 100% a trailer this friday guise!"
  No new trailers at comiccon - EW

"Oh, I'm being told something from my source... There's gonna be something big this friday! It will bring down the internet! But I can't say anything about it."

Yeah, I don't buy it. He's obviously riding on the assumption that they will show something important at SDCC, then he can say he saw it two days earlier. 




 The Star Wars twitter account said that they had been following him ever since he did a live read of a Star Wars script as Luke Skywalker. I doubt he's attached to the role of Han Solo.

 The more that is revealed about the anthology films, the less optimistic I am. 




 This is one of the scariest things for me. We get so many Star Wars movies that it loses its magic. 




 We had three Han Solo films. They were called the Original Trilogy. We don't need any more. 




 I'm really hoping for unknown actors. It's pretty much a Star Wars tradition. 




 Anthony Ingruber, the guy who played a younger version of Ford in Age of Adaline. Or Tye Sheridan if they wanna go really young like Marvel and Peter Parker. 

If they cast Chris Pratt I will lose my mind. 




 Adam, are you looking forward to Star Wars: The Force Awakens this year? What are your hopes for the movie? 




 We are not getting a trailer guys. Occam's razor. It's much more likely that we're not getting one than JJ and EW pulling off some elaborate surprise. 




 Usually people want to know if a film is good before they buy merchandise. Imagine getting a Jar Jar Binks toy 6 months before TPM came out. 




 I wasn't an avid leak follower back then either but I can tell you that the novelization of TPM came out at bookstores over a month before the film even came out. 




 Imagine this announcement: TFA IS HAVING ITS RELEASE DATE BUMPED UP TO OCTOBER!

I'd be fine with no trailer if that was the case 




 Just a friendly reminder that if you are wrong come Friday, we will all grab our pitchforks and you will be dead within the hour. 




 I think what they really want to avoid is important plot details getting out, then the general public getting spoilered, then everyone getting mad at JJ. 

They know that people will stop at nothing to figure out the whole plot. 




 He's not dead. [He merely became one with the Force.](http://i.imgur.com/ixjWbqS.jpg) 




 That's exactly what someone would say if they wanted to surprise us with a brand new trailer
 









 Ok good, dont want to let Steve Jobs take my money 




 Wait, is it exclusive to iPhone? 




 Very cool stuff. One thing I hope for the new trilogy is that there aren't too many Jedi. The OT was great cause there was only a few Jedi remaining, and the PT kind of took away from that with the crazy amount of Jedi. An oriental actor with a samurai style is very intriguing though. Also good to see that Asians actually exist in this universe. 




 Nowhere. The comment is merely discussing this post. 




 According to a few leaks, Kylo Ren is Han Solos son.

He also [](/s "kills Han in TFA.")

edit: don't know why I'm being downvoted it's the established truth in the TFA leak community. 




 I think having MVS die wouldn't give as much of an emotional impact as Han dying so I think he should be the one to go. Keeping the old guys around too long could soil this trilogy IMO. 




 I think it will happen in TFA, and I hope it does, because I think it's a great plot point. However, I am mad that I won't get the full effect because I'm already expecting it. That's what happens when you browse this sub I guess. 




 Just got done watching About Time, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and 500 Days of Summer. I was wondering if there are any other similar movies in this genre. Bittersweet, romantic, melancholic, and make you think about your own life. It's not just typical Nicholas Sparks romance crap, it has some quality to it. Thanks!  




 **About Time**. It's very melancholic and romantic, and gives you that funny bittersweet feeling inside. Would recommend for anyone who likes romcoms. Also, I would love to hear some other people recommend me some films based on this one. 




 I feel the same way, but "You are not my father" honestly sounds like something they would do. 




 Yes witty banter is fine. I was referring to the CGI Nyong'O that is described as "funny". Sounds reminiscent of Jar Jar. 
























 Petition to have Christoph Waltz to play every villian in every movie from now until the end of time, please. 




 I have a dream that I want to pursue, I want to be an animator. I want it real bad. But I find myself trapped in an endless cycle of browsing the internet and laughing at memes and so forth. Is there any motivation you have that you could share with me? How do I just stop wasting time on reddit and go work on my dream? Please help me, I really feel bad about this internet addiction.  




 [Another angle](http://imgur.com/Pwtxlkb)

It's also stated in this [official Star Wars article](http://www.starwars.com/news/the-cinema-behind-star-wars-2001-a-space-odyssey).  









 IMO there's no point in buying merchandise if the movie hasn't come out yet. What if you hate the movie? Imagine all the people that bought a Jar Jar Binks toy before the movie even came out. 




 What you're describing is Rogue One. And I don't know about you but I don't want it to be too "techy". Star Wars (the original trilogy) had a visual theme of "aged future". That's more appealing to me then bright and shiny Clone Wars. 




 I've never seen any of the Star Wars movies on the big screen however I absolutely love it. I was only 7 when RotS came out, so that was too young for me to see it in theatres. I would love to see Star Wars IV-VI on the big screen before I see TFA, because I plan on marathoning them before the new movie anyway. 

I reached out to Cineplex (Canadian movie theatre chain) on Twitter to ask if we would be getting some screenings, but to no avail. I was wondering if anyone here had heard about theatres planning on playing it, news articles suggesting something, or if you think it's likely/unlikely to happen. 




 This here is what I hate about Reddit. A man expresses his views and gets downvoted because it goes against the hivemind circlejerk... 




 op's mom's pussy 




 I hope no one in this thread is narcissistic enough to believe that they are "super-smart"...  




 when i banged op's mom 




 Reddit is basically a hugspace already. The "circlejerk" as it is called.  




 This was actually not done with CGI like you'd think. The whole city is built of miniature buildings, and the flying police car is also practical effect. I believe this is just bait to get everybody rowdy. 




 This is too different from the Joker we know! It's shit!

This Joker is so unique, I'm glad they're doing something new! It's great! 




 I'm heading off to university this fall where I will be hopefully learning some valuable skills in the field of film. The course I'm taking balances both film study and also hands on moviemaking. From there I hope to get a job in the industry I love.

So, I was wondering if some former students of film or people who would consider themselves well versed in film could recommend me some movies that are sure to be discussed and studied by my class. Or films that you personally think that everyone should watch before they try their hand at making their own. 

Thanks! 




 It would definitely be in the character of Han to pull that kind of thing... 




 It was an obvious mistake in the script and they covered it up with some EU story. If it seriously pisses you off when someone points that out then you might need some help. 




 I'm in a movie xD epic 









 Who is champ? 




 Why are you being downvoted? Jesus Christ the circlejerk is strong around here... 




 On a serious note, does anyone know how I can apply to be an extra in the background of a Star Wars movie? I'd literally pay to do it. 




 Now I kind of do want to see her in a slave outfit... 




 Not 100% sure on this one, but I think it's a possibility that they used practical effects in this movie. 




 Carrie Fisher is much funnier that I thought she'd be, Adam Driver seemed like he didn't really want to be there, and of course it's great to see Harrison Ford happy despite how he allegedly hates his character. 




 Guys, I'm wondering, did they use any practical effects on this movie? 




 I would honestly freeze myself in carbonite and miss out on 6 months of my life just to see this sooner. 




 Guys, guys, have you considered this?....

PRACTICAL EFFECTS 




 Threepio with a red arm is confirmed! And damn, Leia looks so much better than I expected! 




 Mods? May he be banned? 




 Will this footage be up on youtube later do you think? 




 No footage as in they're not showing any or people aren't allowed to videotape? 




 /u/00-----00, you created another account? 




 The entire cast of TFA is skydiving into hall H 




 That's nice but I'm here for SW leaks, not to partake in some random guy's power trip. 




 Petition to ban this guy? At this point I don't care whether he's right or wrong I just don't want this petty subreddit drama in the way of actual content. 




 So basically, if a black bear attacks you, you're fucked. 




 Can we just ban this guy? Whether or not he's right this subreddit is about SW leaks, not petty user drama. 




 "Hey guys you wanna see something?"

*crowd erupts in cheers*

The room goes dark. Footage begins to play.

It's Kylo Ren. He removes his mask to reveal Benedict Cumberbatch.

"MY NAME IS KHAN!" 




 Thanks, watched it and thought it was great! 




 epic troll friendo 




 I'd rather get nothing if we're not gonna get a trailer. I mean what's the point of seeing the behind the scenes of scenes we've never even seen the front of? 




 Nah, 4chan says ebin not dank. 




 What's "current" depends on where on the internet you are. For people on Facebook, they've never even heard of "dank memes". For people on Reddit, it's current. For people on 4chan, they would cringe if they heard someone say "dank". 









 Yeah, I've heard, but I'm not about to watch a romance movie to find out!
