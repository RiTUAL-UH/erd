 Found the issue! CPU-Z is saying the Multiplier keeps jumping from x16.0, all the way down to x4.0 - which is bottlenecking the GPU, now what's causing the CPU Multiplier to drop?

Edit: 'Underclocking' the CPU seems to of solved the issue. Hm. Could it be PSU related I wonder? 




 I've looked at any recently installed programs and removed them all - Issue persists. :( 




 Hmm. My long guess is that the GPU 'crashing' aka no signal caused by GTA has upset something in the windows files, as I've had to force the computer to shut down, due to having no display.

Hmm. I'll try booting windows disk and checking for any issues. Thanks for the brainwave.

Edit: No issues found 




 Hmmm. Nothing installed recently, I'm also running windows 7 in Aero mode, and have turned off all unnecessary processes and services. =o 




 Any game, any settings - Issue persists :( 




 That's what I was thinking, but then I remembered that it was working fine a few days ago... With the same CPU, so there has to be an issue somewhere. :\ 




 **Edit: FIXED. I don't know exactly how this resolves it, but I noticed the CPU temps going high, and the CPU multiplier bouncing all over the place, so I 'underclocked' the CPU to x12 instead of x16, and it seems to of solved the issue. I'm not sure how this fixes it... but It did =o**

[THE ISSUE (Reddit didn't wanna link)](https://imgur.com/JOHznwS)

Okay, hey guys, so I'm having an issue with my GTX 980, as are some others, and I just can't figure it out. It was working flawlessly a few days ago. #Sadface

This has happened before, I just switched the power cables to the ones provided with the GPU, and it was solved. But now it's back.


As you can see, there are multiple drops that keep reoccurring every X seconds. It happens in every game on any settings.

****
**Things I've tried so far:**

* Set Nvidia power settings to performance

* Set windows to performance

* Set pre-rendered frames to 3

* Turned off Vsync and put everything to low (still happens)

* Ran Microsoft Troubleshooter.... hah just kidding.

* Ran it at different resolutions

* Looked for Driver updates (even though it was working fine on the same update before)

* Running on Win 7 Aero

* Shut off services and processes that are not needed

* Full defrag on all hard drives (except SSD)

* Checked over wires, nothings lose

* Ran Windows 7 Disk searched for errors - none

* Removed recently installed programs

Extra note : Problem seemed to have started when the GPU crashed a few times on GTA (the system kept running, the GPU was turned off though, no signal.)
I'll post the solution when I figure out what's up, for anyone else having this issue.

 I'm with you here. 




 Hello Timmy,

What specs are you using, more specifically, your motherboard name.

Try the following

* Ensure that your hard drives inside of your computer case are **properly connected.** Look for the name of the hard drives as well for the next possible solution.


* In the BIOS boot sequence, make sure that the hard drive with your operating system installed on it is first in the boot sequence. If you are not sure how to do this, it may be in your "advanced bios features". or you can boot up the computer and spam (usually) F8, depending on your motherboard, to tell it which hardware you want it to boot up from (select your OS hard drive)


* If you find this too confusing, try unplugging all your hard drives and optical readers, except for the one with your OS installed. And ensure your HDD is first in the BIOS boot sequence.


* If the boot sequence is not the issue, then I'd recommend updating your BIOS, simply google your motherboards name and look for the latest BIOS drivers. You may need another computer and a USB stick in order to do this. There are many tutorials on how to do this. Check your BIOS version and write it down before doing so, in order to save time, incase it's the newest version.


* Finally, if all else fails, try clearing the CMOS, this can either be done in the BIOS menu somewhere, or usually there is a small black button on the motherboard itself. Press it while the computer has turned on, and it will restart, hopefully fixing your issue.


Goodluck! Any help you need, ask away! 




 Windows 10 :s.

I don't think there will be any privacy on Windows 10. NSA. 




 You should get some sort of monitor [bracket](http://www.amazon.com/Mount--Freestanding-Widescreen-Monitors-Horizontal/dp/B00FQU7CPU/ref=sr_1_14?ie=UTF8 qid=1433086085 sr=8-14 keywords=monitor+bracket), will save alot of desk space! :) 




 Or the one after that... 




 The more you pre-order and buy stupid things like EA's BF4 PREMIUM. (Aka buy the game twice to play) The more they'll do it, and you help ruin the quality of games. 




 Also the GCHQ/NSA are spying on you, just saying like. Nothing too important. x) 




 Still searching...
Nothings came through yet. :( 
























 God damn, just spent all this time trying to install it, finally I install the damn thing, then the network adapter is being a complete dick. It says it's in there somewhere, but whenever I run ifconfig, wlan0 isn't there, there no enable wifi in the connections menu, and it's not doing anything. ugh.

Edit: fixed after running around with an ethernet cable :) 




 Doing it! :D 




 Already got Debian, Kali and Ubuntu in a VM :D I was just unsure whether or not to go for a dual boot. I think I'm going to use Windows as gaming / production boot, and Ubuntu Linux as personal / files / general internet browsing :D I love the fact how secure Linux is, and how you can set it up to do anything! 




 Aha, very clear, I'll look into WINE and see if it can run the programs I'd like! :D Thanks for your reply :)

Edit: wow, runs everything I use on Windows apart from 1 or 2 things. *starts downloading Ubuntu* 




 Download [Speccy](http://www.filehippo.com/download_speccy) (by clicking that blue link)

Run it, and then click on Summary to the left, then click file  save as text  open it up  copy and paste the bit under Summary, all the way down to Audio. And post it to us.

Then we'll find you updated drivers, as it looks like a driver issue. 




 How on the earth have you got 200mbps interwebs? Teach me senpai. 

I'm sat here with a 6mb ADSL2+ connection crying at the sight of this screenshot.
 









 The catch - Your privacy belongs to the NSA.

No thanks!

 1) Don't learn about CPU, GPUS, MBS or anything that's actually about computers.

2) Learn everything about Microsoft office to show you're a trainable monkey who can work in an office one day.

For real. 




 This should be absolutely fine. 

I play Arma 3 myself, and know how CPU intensive it can be when online, the chosen CPU should be able to handle it without losing performance, and can possibly be overclocked if needed. (Arma 3 coding is terrible, I'd stick with that cpu he's chosen.)

In my humble opinion, I'd say lose the windows 7 OS and *cough* ~~*cough*~~ buy it from *cough* [**somewhere else**](http://wallpoper.com/images/00/40/56/34/pirates-jolly_00405634.jpg) *cough* - sorry I've got a cold.

Nice computer case. If you drop the OS, you can buy some lights to put inside it, which will automatically *make everything run at least 3.4 times faster.*

* CPU-Z
* GPU-Z

And umm... some others! 




   Rebooting won't fix your shit

Found this out the hard way. x) 




 Um, I'm running Linux now and can confirm, for Ubuntu at least, it's apt-get, same on Debian too.

It may vary depending on what distro you're using :) 




 Just installed Ubuntu, and holy cow was that one hell of an epidemic. CPU failed initialization before I'd even installed it, required ethenet cable to download adapter drivers which should of already been pre-installed, and then the video drivers almost destroyed the entire OS, I'm hoping it's all fixed now. Took me 4 hours just to get the damn thing up and running properly. xD 




 Alot more secure than the new Windows 10. 

The NSA slapped their backdoors in last second before release. You can see the vunerabilities of Windows 7 simply by using Linux tools such as metasploit, most of them are listed there, and MOST, but not all, can be prevented with simple precautions such as anti-viruses and firewalls. Not only this, encrypt everything and your golden.

Now then, Windows 10 is going to be alot less secure with the NSA in mind from the very beginning is it not? Would you like Windows 7 or Windows 10? I'm using Linux as my personal OS, dual bootcamped with Windows 7 for games / production. GG NSA. 
























 Oh good thing you've spotted a Wikipedia page about insects and plants we **literally have all over the country.**

 There's so much detail in this post I've decided to give you a detailed reply.

* Is it plugged in? 




 With all this debate about Windows 10, it'd be wise to sit back and see what happens. Personally I think it's not going to have any privacy whatsoever due to the NSA, but we'll see. Reserve by all means, but I'll be upgrading (or not) if I know it's 'safe'.

If it has any privacy threat whatsoever, it can gtfo. 




 Depends what brand, go to the brand's website and contact them about it.


I know Corsair will do RMA, they did with me, PSU broke before Christmas, they sent me a freakin entirely different model worth 25% more than what I paid for! A modular upgrade!! 15/10 best customer service ever. Corsair all the way. 




 Why not just drop blank shells instead. Sorted.

* **Target Practice, not explosive demolition practice** *to see how many species we can wipe out in under 20 seconds, just because we can, f#ck the environment, we wanna blow sh#t up cos 'murica.*

Let's blow up an island instead of advancing biological understanding of biodiverse islands. 'murica. I'm so glad to be from the UK. 




 As if we aren't killing nature enough, nah lets just go drop some nukes here and there. Totally can't just use blanks now can we, nooo noo, that'd be common sense. 




 Causing a blackout...

Dick move. 
























 If it's saying your graphics driver crashed, then it'll be your video drivers. Try updating them or installing a different version. 

I have a 980 too, I haven't updated to the latest version yet (that hit yesterday). And you're a good example of why I don't update everything the second it's out. 




 With the computer being years old, I'd **strongly reccommend changing the MB** out for a newer one, even if it isn't very good.

From personal experiance, older boards tend to catch fire MUCH EASIER. Mine set fire due to a very small (and I mean very small) amount of dust which overheated a capacitor, blew it up and caused an internal fire. If i'd of left it running while I was out, my house would be gone.

Not only this, but it may not be up to date with the hardware it's running, check and see if the MB manufacturer are still putting updates out for it and get the latest one ASAP.

Other than that, epic upgrade! ;) 




 The GCHQ is also working with the NSA, and are doing the exact same things in the UK, yet no one here is batting an eye lid? Why? 




 Are you new to cable management too? :D 




 Shocking. 




 Nah, I'm boring.

Albeit I'm mediocre at making factual and logically thought out points though. 




 The irony is strong in this one. Was fun talking with you. GG. Bye.

10/10 logic 
























 yeah 14.04, think I'll give 15.04 a shot, I was actually going to get 15.04 at first, but ironically chosen 14.04 so I could avoid the bugs...  




 But I don't like the NSA and all the third party anti privacy backdoor stuff that comes with it :( 




 Computer is all new. I've got to reinstall the whole thing now, simply because I can't login or open terminal, which means getting the ethernet cable out and going through all that pain again. All I wanted to do was install Ubuntu. I'll try again probably tomorrow... thanks for the tip! :P 




 I've ran it in a Virtualbox with no problems. 

But dual booting it, it seemed to want to throw everything that could possibly go wrong at me.

Totally broken the OS now, like straight up broke it. Can't login, can't open terminal cos it goes black when I do. Fml. 




 The usb wasn't bad, it was another usb (LEDS.... some freakin lights....) that was causing the issue. Ubuntu thought the CPU had died...

Nvidia GTX 980, went onto the additional drivers menu, chose one of them (xorg), broke everything, selected another (532), partly works but buggy as hell. 




 A nightmare.

* - Spent 2 hours figuring out why it wouldn't boot the installer, it was caused by another usb.
* - Spent another 2 hours trying to connect to the internet, I used an ethernet cable in the end to get the drivers needed for the adapter to work (WHY THE FUCK WEREN'T THEY FUCKIN INCLUDED IN INSTALLATION?!?! WTF GOOD LOGIC.)
* - The wifi adapter kept going on and off, I fixed it finally though, somehow after half a day.
* - Spent over 3 hours trying to get the freakin video drivers to work, I'm running on a GTX 980.
* - Installed video drivers, buggy as fuck. Tried fixing the bugginess, broke the operating system.
* - There is no logical method of finding out what video drivers you need.
* - Couldn't login, would go black and return to the login screen. Opened the terminal and fix it that way.
* - Ran some updates. Broke it again.
* - Tried to login again, same thing as before.
* - Me being super wise thought I'd just put the backup I made in earlier. There's no option to do so via recovery.
* - Thought I'd repair broken packages in recovery, did literally nothing. Like enter ubuntu is now afk
* - Currently uninstalling this disease.


And they call this Linux with learning wheels?

Rating: 2/10. Very shiny. Requires a degree in space rocket launch sequences to get it simply in a running state. (And this is all using fairly popular hardware...)

Going to go cry in a corner now.

Edit: Installed 15.04 instead of 14.04. Installed flawlessly. Maybe there's hope? :O 




 ***EVERYTHING!!!*** 





























 Ironically I got 14.04 because it was LTS, and so it'd be bug free.

15.04 sorted that cocksucker out with one visit. ;D flawless. And the new background looks cool too! 




 I did. xD

Ran 15.04 instead now. No issues what so ever! :) 




 Should've gone to specsavers...

*10/10 marketing opportunity right there.* 




 No, but if you can put toothpaste back into the tube...

*Then you can put toothpaste back into the tube.* 









 Just installed 15.04

Not a single damn problem. Installed FLAWLESSLY. Video drivers and adapters were found and installed automatically via Ethernet.

I'm up and running with 0 problems.

 I've installed Kali, Debian, Ubuntu, Yosemite, Windows, multiple times, on HDD and VMS, and never had an issue. But today Ubuntu wanted to kill me. 
























 Yea but in terms of "the holy bible" (the book that used to say it's okay to sell your daughter for sex, and to own slaves, and that you cannot be homosexual) also says you're not allowed to eat shrimp, but we've all kind of forgot about all them bits... why? Why are we adapting the bible when it is said to be the divine perfect book of good and bad? Surely it shouldn't need changing? I'm not saying it's a bad thing that we're adapting something that's out of date and is no use to the advancement of humanity in the slightest, but why is it being changed when been written by man through the voice of god? 




 Well um sorry to break it to you, but the UK is nationally a christian country. (I'm not saying the UK should be only christians. It's open to everyone. The UK is technically speaking, nationally a christian country. Hence all our churches.) 




 It seems to me that the bible is constantly changing once proven wrong :\ 




 Kind of contradictory is it not? 




 I'd be very worried if they did.

Getting back to their instructor like: "Yeah... Drove into an oncoming tank." 




 Changing it by force will not change the quality, the quality will remain the exact same.

The image has it's own set of pixels, this is called the resolution. Making the image bigger will only simply make the pixels bigger, thus, not giving it any additional quality. A bigger image will require more pixels(Resolution) if you want to capture the detail.

The only way to get the image quality to stay the same while at a bigger size, is to make the image that size in the first place (with a high resolution)

Or if you're a tech savvy like me, can go into photoshop and just add more space to the work area, keeping the image the same, just adding more black space around it, and possibly using the clone tool to make it look part of the image for things that get cut off.

[In fact, I've done it for you. 1920x1080 just like you wanted.](https://i.imgur.com/bpjFxaz.png)

Edit: You fixed it while I was doing this. XD I'd still recommend using mine though, as it won't stretch the image due to the original being 1918x1080, and 'mine' being 1920x1080

Edit edit: I'm an idiot. Used the lower quality image and sized it 1920 for you. Send me the original image? 




 Great job! 




 I had Windows 8 once...

I upgraded to Windows 7.

Personally recommend sticking with 7. Using your Windows 8 key to upgrade your other system won't work, as they're one time use only. Nothing a pirate can't fix though. :) 





























 Humans are cancer to this planet, unless we hurry the hell up and progress in science and intergalactic travel. Religion sometimes holding it back... It's a shame we won't be around to see our species around the galaxies. Sci-fi movies will have to do for now! :)

This is the answer for everything! The human species have not yet matured! ;) 




 Yup, the big guys cause evil too.

ISIS? [Funded mostly by the US.](https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant ion=1 espv=2 ie=UTF-8#q=does+the+US+fund+isis)

.

Why?

.

Money. 




 [xD well it's true!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o28xBkVcpsw)

.

My dream is that humans will all wake up from this religious lie that has been cursed upon us since birth. Progress is being made! :3 




 Exactly my point. Raised to be a good boy and work for the big companies who take control of your life on a daily basis, being used to make money. And leading you into believing in this fantasy heaven, or you'll go to hell. 

.

"Be a good boy or else santa isn't coming."

.

Money. It's all money.

.

Why don't we all just treat each other nicely, remove religion (religion, not faith.) and progress as a species and stop bombing eachother? 




 Religion won't die out, for sure, there'll always be strange people who believe in magical small arab jews capable of answering over 7 billion prayers each day including on their day off, which is when most of the praying takes place, and who have big beards that also get eaten by fish and build big boats and live up to 9,000 years old 

(Wow if religion never existed, you'd think I was absolutely high as fuck right now.)

but I hope the main kind of 'religions' do die out and people start realizing that the evidence of life and all its answers are all around them. 




  "I'm Jewish"

 "I'm not religious"

 "I'm agnostic"

Make your mind up?

.

From a religious point of view (pretending i'm religious) from birth you grow up thinking santa is real, and thinking that religion is real. But with santa, you find out it's just your parents. And there's evidence for it. Thus making you no longer believe in santa.

.

Now I know that's a very blunt and narrow minded way to put it, but you get the jist of what I'm saying. In addition to how Christianity always needs money, doesn't pay taxes, and leads you to believe that after you've worked your entire life to make big companies money, you'll die, and go to this fantasy land. But when you die you'll realise that they all lied to you. 

Haha jk, you'll be dead. 




 I'm not on about Darwin, I'm straight up on about the fact that the UK is marked as a christian country. National religion type stuff. 




 "Modern society has decided that selling your daughter into sexual slavery and owning slaves isn't okay, so we don't do it. We've decided that there's nothing abhorrent about human sexuality, gay or straight, so we've tossed that out. "

So how did this bit manage to make its way into the holy bible? I'm not being sarcastic, but isn't that kind of... weird? To have a holy bible then to ignore it? Not that 'it' being rape is a good thing to do. [Bo hits on some good points too.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxc20saM8DA)

In terms of having Charles Darwin on the note, that's awesome. Showing science advancing the understanding of the entire human species all done by one person is an outstanding way of showing how well we can perform once our minds are free. 




 You grew out of santa.

Why not religion?

It sounds random and silly, but just have a little think about that 




 I'm atheist, thanks for announcing that you're a jew or I wouldn't of known that you are of higher status than myself.

So we've gone from asking a question about Darwin and religion, to me trying to look 'cute' 'bias' and 'clever'? Correct?

Science and religion can coexist side by side. I didn't say it couldn't.

The bible states that you can sell your daughter for sex, own a slave, cannot be gay or eat shrimp, and even goes on about living over 9000 years old. Tell me more about how we're not adapting the bible to fit modern society?
 




 Very much correct, though I'm unsure about the anti-science in terms of *SOME* believers / anti vaccines. 




 I'm aware of the percentages of religion, I'm not on about them. A quick wikipedia search reveals that the UK is tagged as a christian country. Dominantly. Hence why we have churches all over the place. The uk is a christian country. 

Finished high school. Your turn. 




 Well it's first of all not very easy to do, and there are many challenges faced in order to do so.

Firstly, the body or brain may choose to reject one another. Meaning that you'd die basically. Much like heart transplants, but precautions can be taken to try and minimise this risk.

Next we'd need to connect the brain up to the body, this will take hours on hours to complete, and it'd need to be attached to the spinal cord which is extremely / impossible to do as to date.

We need to connect all the of neurons, each of which contain up to 10,000 synapses EACH. And in some places such as the cortex, will even be in trillions. (Yes spelt with a T.)

And quite frankly, the technology needed is no way near to the advance level of the human brain.

While it may be possible to do a brain transplant. We simply don't have enough understanding and technology available in order to proceed. Though this may change in years to come.
