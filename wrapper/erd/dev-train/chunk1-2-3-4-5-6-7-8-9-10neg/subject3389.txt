Also assume that the leading economists studying this are correct in calculating that switching from fossil fuels to other energy sources will cost relatively little--about 1% or so of global GDP--so there is no question that the benefits far outweigh the costs.

How, as a conservative, would you then recommend we accomplish this fast transition off of fossil fuels? Carbon taxes? Carbon caps? Martial law? Make the Chinese pay for it all? What? 































































































































































































































































































































 Now that a [fossil free index exists](http://fossilfreeindexes.com/fossil-free-indexes-us/) and is outperforming the broader S P 500 over long time scales, why aren't the major fund houses offering such an index? Does anyone know of one?

This is actually one of the reasons I buy individual stocks: to cut out fossil fuels, given that all of the world's national scientific academies now agree that the burning them must soon end to avoid gigantic global economic and environmental risks, meaning that these companies stand to lose trillions in assets. 

































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































 When we stop *burning* fossil fuels, they'll be even cheaper and more available for other uses like medicines and plastics. 




 Article's content is about what happens if we *don't* stop using fossil fuels. And that's very scary indeed. 




 I invite anyone who thinks this is *not* a good idea to attend any trade show for investment professionals, and explore deals with some of the exhibitors. If, after that, you still think brokers and financial advisors have your best interests at heart, I have shares in an unobtanium mine to sell you.  




 The Interstate system's actual name is the Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways, which says much about its original intent. It was a military road system from the outset, originally planned under General 'Blackjack' Pershing in 1922, and later built under Eisenhower.

 Then there's [this guy](http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2015/feb/09/city-councilman-fagan-spreads-vaccine-conspiracy-s/). 

Conspiracy theorists muttering and drooling on basement keyboards are one thing, but when they get elected to city councils and appointed to health boards, we have a problem. 




 Simple: the positives of climate change are vastly outweighed by the negatives. That much we know. 

What we don't know is precisely how potentially horrendous the negatives are, but we know they are pretty damned awful, and they are already beginning to cost us. Unless we act soon, even midrange scenarios over just the next century likely result in the deaths of millions, a serious hit to the global economy and food supply, and rising warfare.

But don't take it from me. Read Hansen, Lynas, McKibben, Alley, Mann, Oreskes. Check out NASA Earth Observatory and Skepticalscience.com. Just beware of the fact that the fossil fuels industry is also secretly funding a bunch of crap science and misleading websites to confuse you. 




 Earnings for young college grads have been [declining for 15 years now](http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/economicsunbound/archives/2009/09/earnings_of_you.html), even as college costs continue to climb.

For many, the only rationale for making that ruinous investment is that the alternative is [even worse.](http://www.decisionsonevidence.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Annual-Earnings-and-Employment-of-Men-with-Only-a-High-School-Diploma.png) 




  Meanwhile, nurses are millionares, welders buy their houses with cash, trim carpenters set their own pay, electricians charge more than lawyers, computer technicians make more than their management staff, and engineers have more job offers than they can shake a stick at.

You do realize that nurses generally have bachelor's or master's degrees, right? Meanwhile, most welders make around [$36K](http://www1.salary.com/Welder-I-Salary.html). Senior-level carpenters pull in [$48K](http://swz.salary.com/SalaryWizard/Carpenter-III-Salary-Details.aspx) on average. Etc.

The myth of boundless opportunities and princely pay for blue-collar work is a repeated trope these days, particularly on the political right, but it just isn't true. Sure, there are lucky exceptions, but they are far from the norm.

Meanwhile, colleges and universities are hardly limited to cranking out sanskrit philosophy majors. A third of grads have associate degrees, usually in the kinds of hard skills you suggest, while the top fields for bachelor's degrees include business, nursing, education, criminal justice, engineering and accounting, none of which are exactly impractical.  




  "Positions on climate change have become symbols of whose side you are on in a cultural conflict divorced from science."

Thanks to very clever public relations efforts by the fossil fuels industry over the past three decades, which have focused on turning climate opinions into a political litmus test. And we fell right into it.

In the US, this almost guarantees that no matter how much you know about the science, your opinions will be determined almost entirely by your age, gender, political tilt, religious affiliation, occupation, television preferences, and place of residence. 



 




 But there is no wage growth for those with less education. 




 Seattle is a beautiful, friendly city, and more affordable than any major city in California. Being divided by hills and water it's very much a city of neighborhoods, each with its own little shopping and nightlife district. A new light rail line runs south from downtown through some affordable but nice places like Columbia City. Elsewhere, the West Seattle Junction, North Ballard and Maple Leaf are also worth a look. Capitol Hill is the traditional gay district, and there are some lovely, fairly affordable neighborhoods to the east and south of its center at Broadway and Olive. The suburbs are generally wealthy to the east and west (across the waters), middle class up north and lower income to the south. 




 Two things:

 The fact that college grads still out-earn the less educated does not mean their earnings are rising; some of the delta is due to pay for the less educated falling. More and more of the "benefit" of a degree is to simply avoid slipping into that yawning pit of decline.

 Gender skews the data. Because they started from farther behind, women have made much greater gains in both education and income than men have over recent decades. The [picture for educated men](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/rip-van-skillsgap/) isn't nearly so rosy. And, now that women have achieved parity with men in education, and near parity in income, we can expect their trend line to start resembling that of men.

 














 Get outside! Nothing deadens mood like a dark room on a dark day, especially if it keeps you from exercise. Speaking from experience here.

Go hiking with local clubs like the Mountaineers or Sierra Club. Some of the hikes are kid friendly. Check their websites for schedules. 

Join new-mom groups like PEPS, or get into a preschool co-op and meet other moms and kids.

Volunteer to do whatever outside activities you enjoy. Join in tree planting projects, trail work, clean-up projects. 

There's always church, too. And you needn't be religious to be an important part of church groups. Unitarians welcome all. 




 Avoid Centralia/Chehalis, which is a conservative town midway between Seattle and Portland. Also Longview and Mt. Vernon/Anacortes. And, surprisingly, Vancouver, WA, just across the Columbia from Portland, is a rather conservative enclave as well; it's where Portland-area conservatives move to dodge Oregon income tax.

Generally the most gay-friendly places are along the I-5 corridor about 70 miles in either direction from Seattle. The Seattle and Portland metros are very gay friendly and prosperous, as are Olympia and Bellingham. The northwest end of Tacoma is prosperous and progressive. Mountain towns like Leavenworth and Ellensburg have their attractions. To the east, Spokane is relatively tolerant and lovely. As anywhere in the US, rural areas and small industrial towns tend to be conservative and less tolerant, and many are economically depressed. 




 Most of the larger Cascade lakes would do: Lost, Olallie, Elk, Lava, Suttle, Diamond, Waldo, East, Paulina...and, if you haven't been to Crater Lake, that belongs at the top of the list. 

For quiet, swimmable lakeside camping, I prefer the central Oregon lakes that don't allow fast powerboats. Boat regs vary by lake, so check online. 














 A good article with an unforgivably childish headline. Yet another act of self sabotage by The Guardian. 




 It's not exactly news that the Republican Party opposes progressive taxation, nor that Krugman is partisan. But is he wrong about falling returns to education? 




 Yes, but but how is that due to the ACA? Seems to me that the ACA was more a response to the contractor economy than its cause.

As a consultant myself, I was thrilled to finally see affordable health insurance thanks to the ACA, but my industry's atomization into a million consultants and contractors predated the ACA by decades.  









 How so? 














 Fatburger isn't far from it. 









 In addition, the long fall in corporate tax rates has disproportionately benefitted wealthy shareholders while shifting those tax burdens to everyone else. 




 "First, they wanted my guns. Then my pickup truck. And now my steaks?"

(Grab some popcorn. This should be exciting.) 




 There is almost no free market competition in energy. Least of all in fossil fuels and nuclear. 




 Just as the Islamic State focuses on teaching the Koran and the Hadith, the sayings of Mohammed! 









 Meanwhile, both growing inequality and slowing productivity growth link directly to the growing share of economic activity consumed by the financial industry.

 Correction: single-walled railcars are *part* of the reason that Bakken oil trains explode. The other part is that Bakken oil isn't [stabilized before transport](https://www.facebook.com/BombTrainBuckStopsWithNorthDakota) because the North Dakota oil rush has outpaced construction of stabilization facilities there, which would remove the oil's most volatile compounds, and because the oil industry just doesn't want to spend the money to make this explosive oil safe to ship. 




 It's simple editing, really. Everything before 1865...out! The decades of native slaughter...out! The robber barons...out! The seizure of Hawaii...out! Vietnam and Iraq...out! Etcetera. 

Which, by my count leaves us with 1913, 1933-45, and possibly 2014. Who can't make a book out of that? 




 Two things: 

 *Any* rise this century will be back-loaded, with lower rises in the near term and much higher ones in later years.

 This is a high-end scenario. The researchers are simply saying that IPCC high-end forecasts are far too low. 




 That is just so unfair.  




 True. Kahneman's elephant and all that. However, it's not enough to simply say, "pay a little now or a lot later"; conservatives won't believe it.

This is about getting people to recognize their own capacity for evil, and there's nothing easy about that. 




 Conservative crowing about cheap flatscreen TVs aside, it's important to recognize that the material required to process data has shrunk to insignificance. Dematerialization is for real, and that's good news.

What's not so good is that people use the cost savings on each product to simply amass more products. 




 Cortical implants and synthetic biology, which may be entirely integrated. Very exciting.

Not so thrilling: hundreds of millions of redundant, technologically downscaled workers who will be *very* pissed if society tries to cut them out--and they'll have the tools to commit incredible mayhem. 




 Meh. Another libertarian attack on unions, and the only American unions left to attack are public employee unions.

Lissen folks, pensions still account for most employee benefits in most of the world, developed or developing. Americans have simply given them up to fund the private health care racket, but we are very definitely anomalous. The fact that public employees haven't been rooked the way private employees have been is no reason to hate them. We need more pensions, not less. 














 A wild guess: this was probably unpaid or low-paid, produced on the cheap by the PR guy, Berman, to attract oil company clientele.  




 Here's the Sourcewatch link: http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Big_Green_Radicals 





























 FDR also proposed a [100% tax on income above $25,000](http://flaglerlive.com/26685/gc-fdr-and-taxes/) per year (about $350,000 in today's dollars).   




 When it comes to nuclear waste, NIMBY attitudes are *always* the order of the day. I agree with you, but I certainly don't expect Nevada's leading representatives to like it. This is basically a question of secure storage at Yucca to end the insecure, inexcusable mess at Hanford. 




 And how does one sue a company that might have hired you but didn't because it automated the job or sent it to Vietnam? How does one sue a bank that bribed Congress to legalize reckless banking practices which then crashed the economy and cost you your job building houses, which then destroyed your marriage and your kids' college funds?

I think the comparison with the 19th century stands, with some adjustments for modernity. National laws are now minor obstacles for companies whose operations span sixty nations. Unionization is no longer much of a threat. Automation provides abundant and rapidly growing opportunities to bypass even highly skilled and professional labor.  




 Exactly. For many it's not only a cut: it's a chat, a personal interaction, a massage, some flattery, the sense that you're getting the talents of a certain pro. Pretty hard to replace that with software. 









 It gets better. As cities become increasingly dedicated to automated transport, traffic lights and traffic jams vanish. Travel smoothes, enabling travelers to be more productive in transit.  




 He had me right up to the last sentence...

And I think this future will have to happen because the only other alternative is an aggressive transfer of wealth from the rich to the poor by force of law. I dont see that happening.

 




 That was only slightly sarcastic. As large companies slash workforces and automation eliminates jobs, the opportunities left will be increasingly those that lend themselves to low-wage freelancing, personal services and esthetic expression, so... 




 Some headlines you just can't make up. 




 Think of it as the rise of Hairdressing Man.

 Ignore them. They are children in a prison of their own making, screaming and throwing shit to spark a reaction.  




 They're the terrorist equivalent of online trolls; if their last statement wasn't obnoxious enough they'll raise the stakes to see if *that* gets a reaction.

My response follows accordingly: ignore the childish fucks. 




 As someone who has worked on market segmentation for a state lottery, I can confirm. Essentially, lotteries prey on desperation, and the best lottery customers are about what you'd expect. 









 Why all the downvotes for this?  




 The current situation is weird only relative to the past 90 years, half of which were the most horribly weird period in world history. Pikkety and Saez say that we are simply returning to normal, and Schilling has been voicing a similar tone for the past three decades. I only wish I had followed his investing advice for more than a fraction of that time. 




 Which is only barely higher than the share of global GDP going to fossil fuel subsidies.  




 The only trouble with defined contribution plans is that those who need them the most use them the least. Left to their own devices, most people simply *do not save enough to retire.* Never have and never will. Meanwhile, we're still part of the same rich country and we still have obligations to keep one another from destitution, so the effect of reliance on defined contribution plans is to simply dump employer responsibilities onto lower income taxpayers through the most regressive Federal tax we have. 




 Desal takes immense energy and money. 




 We won't be unemployed. We'll all stay incredibly busy selling sex and pizza to one another! 









 Being in California definitely helps. However, every market is different, and some have restrictive rules.  Best strategy is often to contact managers through their websites in the off season. 


































 Like many environmental activists, Heinberg is a climate pessimist. Like many economists, Krugman is a climate optimist. It's been an [ongoing dialogue](http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2011/02/climate_policy) for some time. 

However, the studies that Krugman cites are merely two of several similar. Other researchers like Nordhaus and McKinsey Global Institute also agree that decarbonization is rather cheap (for now). There are three keys to this view: 1) Around 40% of the actions taken to mitigate climate (energy-efficient building codes, etc.) will save money; 2) Reduced fossil fuel burning produces other benefits (lower health costs, etc.) that also save money; 3) Continuing economic growth over time will reduce the relative burden of mitigation costs.

I do take issue with Krugman's reluctance to endorse nuclear power, which is part of any sensible decarbonization scheme. Still, on the whole, decarbonization is very affordable. 




 To me, the piece reads as a strong call to action to act on GHGs as we have on other pollutants, knowing that the costs of doing so, as before, are likely to be far less than conservative industrial interests claim. 




 No reference to GHGs that I can see.  




 Part of the cost--the low cost--is assistance to poor countries in their transition to clean energy. That would be the Green Climate Fund along with numerous deals like those that appear to have been proposed between the U.S. and India three weeks ago, in which India may have received some trade promised in return for agreeing to expand solar, probably using American panels.

 They're smuggling crude in all directions, selling it at half the going price. 




  Would politicians really want to nuke other countries and face inevitable massive nuclear retaliation against their own country and people over something as petty as oil or bad weather?

Climate problems lead to food problems which lead to war. Witness the effects of 2010's droughts and floods on global wheat prices, and the knock-on effects of those triggering the Arab Spring wars ever since.

  they are probably their own biggest customer for the oil.

Not with all their refineries destroyed and their storage facilities under concerted attack.  




 Sorry, didn't mean to attack you. I rephrased my post. 

However, mere human laziness won't prevent solutions once the stakes are clear. This is cheap and easy to solve, and global agreements are enforceable as long as the planet's major economies work in concert, as they are beginning to do. Count me optimistic. 




 If the oil is all burned, the world very likely incinerates in economic collapse and near-certain thermonuclear war. 

If you want to kill yourself with tobacco, don't let me stop you. But no one has the right to kill me, my kids, my grandkids and destroy everything I hold dear due to some psychotic need to drive an oversized pickup to the office. 




 I suspect the Pontiff is well aware of the Kochs. 




 Jennifer Francis? She says much the same. The polar jets will continue to "lose their way" in steadily more dramatic fashion. It stands to reason that the subtropical jets will as well, although somewhat less so as their amplitude is milder. 




 Well, spring has come a month early in the West, but you'd probably arrive just in time for another of our record wildfire seasons!  




 We aren't talking about all pollution; only carbon pollution.  














 Sure, the generation LBJ referred to was our grandparents, but now we are starting to see the catastrophic results of those alterations, we have done precious little about them, and we know that the US and Europe must lead any solutions.  









 What does the supply of oil matter if most of it must be left in the ground? That is now the [agreed global scientific consensus](http://www.carbontracker.org/report/wasted-capital-and-stranded-assets/), and it changes *everything*. 




 Poor headline. There's no *could* about it. The study finds that carbon emissions *do* dramatically increase the risk of U.S. megadroughts. 









 Nice piece, and it's also fun to read Matthew Yglesias' criticizing Ezra Klein for criticizing *him*. 




 "Killing the messenger." It's how conservatives most often deflect criticism; on climate, food safety, health care, wages, you name it. 




 [Here](http://theenergycollective.com/eliashinckley/2181166/oil-prices-saudi-arabia-and-end-of-opec) is my favorite explanation of the recent price collapse: threatened with coming climate regulation, low-cost producers are liquidating their assets while they can, delaying competitive energy sources in the bargain. Along the way, they also accomplish the geopolitical goals of hobbling Iran's ability to build nukes and slapping Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. 

In short, peak oil is now a rather irrelevant concept. We'll have to leave most fossil fuel reserves in the ground. The Gulf countries know this, and they are trying to unload oil before it loses most of its value. This will take decades, so expect low prices to continue. 




  Corp taxes are mostly paid for by labor not capital.

Got a cite?

Yes, I'm well aware of ongoing discussion on the degree to which corp tax divides between labor and capital. However, putting aside the fact that nearly half of US corporate taxes are entirely *unpaid*,  the remainder probably fall most heavily on [shareholders](http://gatton.uky.edu/Faculty/hoytw/704/Harberger.pdf)--a trend increasing over time as production automates. Giving those shareholders a windfall with carbon tax offsets just means someone else has to make up the difference, and that someone else will be those who own the least stock, who also happen to be those with the lowest incomes. *Voila*, a massive shift of taxes from rich to poor. 

That tax shift is especially egregious when compared to the other possibilities for making a carbon tax revenue-neutral: fee-and-dividend, offsets against regressive payroll taxes, etc.. 




 No matter how many times they're [debunked](http://www.skepticalscience.com/OISM-Petition-Project.htm), lies just never die on the internet. 




 Given that so many of these science-denying opinion leaders are directly funded by the fossil fuels industry, can we just go with "whores"? 




  Going down the rabbit hole this seems to be the $409b number that originates with IEA for 2010

Could be mistaken, but I believe this comes from IEA Energy Outlook 2014. IEA EO 2013 specified $547b.

 Extreme weather events will rise in frequency in the future, they have not yet.

Frequency, no. Severity, yes.

 US imposes a $24/t tax on all production and import with 100% tax credit available against corp tax. 

Nice way to shift the tax system in favor of the wealthy. Let's go with fee-and-dividend instead, rebating carbon tax revenues to all with Alaska-style dividend checks. 

As for your proposed $24/t tax rate to cover the social cost of carbon, that's merely a starting point in a graduated scheme, correct? SCC is now credibly estimated by the US EPA at around $40/t and is nearly certain to rise. 




 Did anyone happen to notice that the sample for this claim is a handful of California universities? News flash: Berkeley leans left, really left!

 Journalism is at its worthless laziest when falling back on false equivalency, airing "both points of view" on a non-debatable topic. Sure, it fills extra page space or airtime, and it allows media owners to escape taking a position, but it is the worst kind of chicken shit.  














 Forget water stocks and other commodity plays. Human ingenuity consistently finds ways around materials shortages of nearly any kind, and you definitely are not the first investor to read popular stories about future water shortages. 

Instead, I invest in technologies and systems that will endure, making money now as well as in the future. Renewable energy is one of those industries, by the way; especially solar (read up on "Swan's Law"). Others include railroads, insurance, consumer staples, technology, health care, urban real estate and energy efficient buildings. 

To a large degree, it's not a question of what you invest in as much as what you *don't*. For example, you'll do well with a broad basket of stocks that just avoids fossil fuels, so you could get into a sector ETF focused on something else like consumer stocks, healthcare stocks, insurance, tech, etc..

But beware of fad sectors. Look for reasonable PEG ratios, good ROE, strong competitive moats, durable product lines and good management. That usually means larger companies.  


































 Well, Greenpeace, if you really care so much about solving the climate mess, why do you continue to oppose the nuclear power that can help us do it? 




 What's with the giant hot spot in the middle of Russia? 




 Don't expect it to happen overnight, but I think we'll learn to overcome more of our violent, selfish, simian nature over time--provided that we can cooperate to more fairly distribute the benefits of prosperity, and to avoid destroying the environment that makes that prosperity possible. Challenges, but feasible ones. 




 It depends on two things: 1) how easily labor is displaced by technology, 2) who owns the technology systems and their output.

This is the "elasticity of substitution" debate that is such a hot economic topic now. I'm not optimistic about labor's value in a world bent on replacing workers with machines, and I'm even less optimistic about owners of those machine systems sharing a penny of their profits with their fellow citizens. Instead, we're seeing a retreat of the rich behind various kinds of moats: guarded, elite residential buildings in a few wealthy cities like London, Tokyo, New York and Hong Kong; wealthy tax havens like Switzerland and Singapore; gated compounds and neighborhoods; remote, expensive resort towns, etc..
 




 Around 20-25 percent the cost of a nuclear plant. 




 Iraq has been in the grips of a three-way civil war for generations. Saddam represented just one of those three factions and brutally repressed the others. So, when we destroyed Saddam and dispossessed his Sunni Baath followers, we naturally heard some limited gratitude from their enemies. But that wasn't enough to prevent many Sunnis from continuing the war, linking up with Syrian Sunnis, creating ISIS, etc.. 

To be clear, there was probably no way to prevent this escalation of chaos and fanaticism once we had invaded Iraq. Keeping Baathists employed and in some degree of power many have helped, but it is doubtful. The horrific regional drought was also a trigger that would have been hard to overcome. 




 After being installed and cultivated by the US for decades, Saddam Hussein broke with the West in the late 1980s after he (and we) learned that the Reagan and Bush administrations had been secretly selling arms to Iran during his bloody war with that country. He then become the Middle East's worst bad boy, invading Kuwait, launching missile attacks against Israel and Saudi Arabia, brutally killing his own domestic enemies in an ongoing civil war, etc.. 

After his defeat by the US and allies in the 1991 Gulf War, Saddam turned to spouting Islamic religious rhetoric and threats against Israel in a ploy to unite Iraq's warring Muslim factions behind him, which further alarmed the West. He also threatened to sell his country's oil only in Euros, undermining the US Dollar. And, to deter attacks from his neighbors, he also hinted that he manufactured chemical weapons and was building a nuke, which, although untrue, gave GW Bush a flimsy excuse to push the US into invading Iraq.  




 By Paul O'Neill's very credible account, Bush was so intent on finding any pretense to invade Iraq *before* 9/11 that he and his neocon circle jumped at the chance afterwards, and barely gave a thought to the consequences. Once in, of course, they discovered that there was no easy exit. 




 Too much, I agree, but don't forget that nearly all opposition to the Iraq invasion came from Dems.

 Not to grab Iraqi oil; to ensure cheaper *global* oil prices.

Look at the [2003 Brent crude price chart](http://classic.tradingcharts.com/historical/BC/2002/0/continuous.html). Can you spot the month when we invaded Iraq?  




 You'll have to ask Tony Blair about specifics, but I do recall that British support was rather key.  




 This was definitely my sentiment at the time but not that of many others. 




 Cheap oil from SA, Kuwait, the UAE, Egypt, Qatar... 




 Not "run by"; "protected by". Also "consumed by" (for example, the US Navy is the world's largest single oil guzzler). 




 Not for Iraqi oil. For Saudi, UAE and Kuwaiti oil. For low WTI and Brent prices.  




 Not where it matters, they didn't. 




 I'm just not as sweet as I seem. 




 Not a bit. 




 Different world back then. The US fracking boom hadn't yet happened.  Also, the desire to protect ME oil wasn't predicated on the desire to ship it to the US so much as to our allies, to keep the global economy ticking. 




 And then we had them sandwiched.  




 Don't be that guy. 




 Al Maliki? "The enemy of my enemy is my friend." There could be no other reason to support him.

However, the litany of Bush botches in Iraq is endless, so who knows? 




 Well, it cost several hundred thousand lives and at least $2 trillion, and it spawned ISIS. How did all that benefit us again? 




 Yeah, but the US at the time was in the act of retaliating against actual Al Qaeda and Taliban strongholds in Afghanistan, where bin Laden and company were hiding out in Tora Bora. We broke off that attack in order to invade Iraq, which Bush well knew had nothing to do with 9/11. 




 Iraq was in a state of civil war kept in check by a dictator. Saddam did not gas his own Sunni people; he gassed Kurds and Shia.  




 Indeed it did, although not through our mere presence so much as through our unforgivable blunders with de-Baathification, etc.. 




 I'll look up a vid. 




 I doubt that the intention was to grab Iraqi oil. Most accounts of the conversation, such as O'Neill's, indicate that plans called for Iraqi oil primarily to pay for reconstruction. However, the greater oil objective was to eliminate the threat that Saddam posed to the oil business across the region, as well as to Israel. 




 So did some Shias. But that was a far cry from any kind of general welcome, no?  




 Well, thanks...I think. Your reference piqued my curiosity enough to drive me to read one of his articles, and he seems interesting. However, I'm definitely not overly concerned with Marx and Hegel, as he seems to be. 




 The US and NATO have Russia surrounded as it is, including air bases, naval bases and missiles much closer to Russian borders than Iraq is. Pressuring Russian client Syria may have contributed to the Iraq decision, but I doubt that anyone was trying to piss off Russia itself. Just my inexpert quick take, however. 




 The Middle East oil patch has been politically unstable since its discovery. The 1990s saw widespread warfare there. 




 Just summarizing the article, with only a little editorializing. 




 Maybe, although one cannot dismiss deeper, oily motives. 




 Nope. Presbyterian. 




 I couldn't agree more. I merely pointed out what some *expected* to happen. Needless to say, they were blind to some key realities.  




 Depends on the cutoff date you choose, as well. If you mean just during and immediately after the invasion, 100,000-200,000. If you include the 12 years of bloody, escalating chaos that the US invasion unleashed, many, many more and still counting. ISIS is a direct result.  









 "Why would we want to reassure Saudi Arabia?!"

I dunno. Maybe a well-equipped, belligerent rogue nation spanning most of their northern border, just a few hours' drive from Ghawar and Riyadh? A rogue nation that had already demonstrated its ambitions by seizing Kuwait and spraying missiles all over the region, including more than a few at SA itself?

"Iran wasn't the target, it was Saudi Arabia." 

Tell that to the American and British conservatives who crowed during the Iraq invasion, ["Boys go to Baghdad but real men go to Tehran"](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/04/21/war-without-end).

"you've defined the situation without truly knowing all the facts...you can't fundamentally know what's really going on."

Enlighten me, then. Share your insights rather than just claiming to know secrets. 




 Let's just complete that headline:

"The biggest threat to Americas future is  American conservatives bent on wrecking the Federal government and fracturing Americans into angry tribes, while ignoring all foreigners unless they sell us cheap oil."
 




 This article asks exactly that real-adult question. 




 Stabilize the Persian Gulf oil industry and political landscape, reassuring the Saudis, Israelis, Emirates and so on, while creating a staging area for military pressure on Iran. Behind it all, an overarching desire to consolidate Anglo-American control, ensuring the continued flow of Middle Eastern oil and deeper military partnerships with key allies there. Basically, a greedfest for an American-run military-petroleum complex.

Much also has to do with the American conservative hard-on for World War Two, which led to the ignorant delusion that Iraqis would "greet us as liberators", and that the occupation would go as smoothly as in postwar Japan and Germany.  




  the person with the highest production values in their commercials and campaign will probably get the disinterested voters.

They already do, don't they? 




 [Half of Americans](http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=119358) do not have computers or broadband. That share is far higher among black and Hispanic households, as well as in poor states and counties, on Indian reservations, etc.. What about them? 




 Sometimes apathy, but often just very busy, hardworking people who forget to take time to vote before or after work, and who can't get paid time to do it. It's no surprise that 70-somethings vote three times as often as the young; younger adults are juggling school, work, childcare, military service, moving for jobs, and much else. So we have a government of the old, by the old, and for the old. 




 Let me know when you repeal gravity, and I'll move there for the flying cars. 




 Maybe *you* thought the idea behind basic income is to destroy the rest of the social safety net, but I call that a right-wing fantasy--just like the notion that we can have a functioning society in which all the rewards go to the rich. 




 Not if you think the purpose of basic income is to reverse rising inequality and to reduce the need for a police state. 




 Almost. To be durable, a UBI must indeed be *in addition to* basic human services such as education, healthcare and childcare. However,  the myth that all of the poor will blow every other spare dime on hookers, heroin and horse racing just doesn't bear out. 

Meanwhile, the alternative is inequality rising to intolerable extremes, with a massive police state growing in tandem. 




 Most of these systems are mounted in police cars, and static cameras are already becoming too ubiquitous to avoid. Next it'll be drones recording vehicle locations. Meanwhile, the vehicles themselves are becoming rife with location-revealing gadgets.

All your credit purchases already locate you as well. So do the RFID chips on the products you buy with credit cards. Then there's facial recognition software, which will soon tie into surveillance cameras in every store, every parking lot, every public square, every ATM. And so on.

By the time self-driving cars become cheap and practical, their records of your location will be the least of your privacy worries.

 And Oregon is a vote-by-mail state as well. This couldn't possibly have anything to do with Oregon having some of the [country's highest voter turnout](http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Elections/2012/1106/Voter-turnout-the-6-states-that-rank-highest-and-why/Oregon), could it? 




 Not necessary if you vote by mail, as every voter in my state does. 




 This. Every US city has flat corridors that should include dedicated bike infrastructure, but generally don't.  




  Washington benefitted a lot from attracting higher middle class people

Cite? I would argue that Washington income averages are skewed by its incredibly wealthy elite and relatively small population. The state also has a fortunate mix of hot companies in tech, biotech, aerospace, healthcare and consumer services, as well as the largest export economic share in the country.

Still, poverty rates have risen over time and inequality is extreme. Once you get beyond the glow of Seattle, there's a lot of life on the skids. 




 Is there really any difference between economics and politics? Nothing is more political than the distribution of money. 




 The WA B O tax rate for service businesses is quite high at .015%, and these are the businesses that employ the most minimum wage workers.

 That and the 1970s energy crisis, both of which spurred the Dutch and Danes to prioritize cycling infrastructure along with wind energy and much else. [Here](http://www.triplepundit.com/2013/10/brief-history-cycling-denmark-netherlands/) is a good piece on it. 









 That and the [other reasons](http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2011/10/newport_surfer_on_great_white.html). 




 The author seems unaware of the fact that fossil fueled Republicans *want* ordinary people to feel pain from EPA regulations, to generate fiercer opposition to them.

 Another attack on climate science from a paid oil industry minion.

Get used to this. It won't be the fossil fuel industry's last attempt to defund NASA's climate work. 




 It *is* global warming. The slowing, wobbling polar jet is being driven far north off the West Coast by a warm NE Pacific; the jet picks up cold Arctic air before lurching southward into New England. Result: the entire US West Coast has a record-warmest winter and ongoing drought even as Boston freezes.

The world just had another record-warmest year. This won't be the last time we see wild swings like this. In fact, this may be a recurring pattern. 




 A more likely possibility: Seattle has always been a boom/bust town, and property prices are currently booming, meaning that many restaurants are facing more costly lease renewals. 

The minimum wage boost is still years away for the vast majority of them. This story is just a local magazine's way to spin controversy. 




 Seattle Mag is a slick monthly, but I take your point. And the fact that very few of these restaurants will have to raise wages for years to come suggests that recent closures are for other reasons entirely--such as the fact that Seattle is positively crawling with restaurants. 




 Solar's cost is primarily in panels, infrastructure and transmission; not in land. It's also relative to electricity cost, which is generally highest in most populated areas. So simply providing land for solar in pipeline country, like the middle of Oklahoma, North Dakota or Alberta, doesn't make it worth anyone's while to buy the panels or to pay for transmission to distant cities. 




 "Thus, although CR do not contribute measurably to the 20th-century global warming trend, they do appear as a nontraditional forcing in the climate system on short interannual timescales".

 First, the recent oil price crash may not be a slump so much as the beginning of a long liquidation. The sheiks are not revealing their motives, but they know that oil will be outlawed as a fuel within a few decades.

Second, the primary beneficiaries of a price uptick would be the nationalized companies that comprise 80% of the oil industry, and which have the world's lowest production costs. 









 The study seems to clearly show that the rate of change is not constant at all; it is accelerating.

 Your posts here just explained why solutions to this must be broad and systemic. Leaving the matter up to individuals who are locked into high-polluting life investments simply doesn't work; we need to help one another move to something better.

 Pensions can be portable.  




 Mine, too. However, neither of us sound like the throng of low-paid, nonunion blue-collar workers in my area whose life savings couldn't buy a new Kia.   




 For those hyperventilating over the headline hype, it's helpful to know that this comes from The Stranger, Seattle's edgier alt weekly, and this is their typical tone. However, the message is a good one: a port commission that claims environmental leadership, yet is dropping trou for Arctic drillers, needs to be held to account. 




 Social Security and Medicare predated the loss of American pensions, while IRAs and 401(k)s were only intended to supplement traditional pensions, not to replace them. As replacements, they have been miserable failures, as this article and many others point out. 









 A very weak one, so far. 




 The fossil fuels industry and its business allies are behind most organized climate science denial, and they don't hate anyone. For these coldly calculating bastards, business is business, Mann is in the way, and riling up the peasants against him is simply an effective tactic.  




 The Republican Party sells out to the oil industry once again. 




 Yet pensions created and sustained a middle class, and they still do in the rest of the developed world, loosely speaking. Americans alone have abandoned them, largely to fund incredibly costly health insurance instead, yet we have replaced pensions with...nothing. 




 More evidence that voluntary savings will never provide enough for retirement. Hell, [half of American workers have saved nothing](http://www.providencejournal.com/news/economy/20141122-how-will-you-retire-half-of-us-have-nothing-saved-and-many-others-far-too-little-interactive.ece). They think they'll just keep working until they drop, as if any employer wants a creaky octogenarian tottering around. In many industries it's now nearly impossible to find a job after age 45, let alone in one's failing twilight years. Even Walmart employs few of its ancient greeters any more.

This is why the vast majority of employee benefits *outside* the United States are *pensions*, and, in rich countries, those are generally in addition to public safety nets more generous than those in the US. Let's face it: the American abandonment of pensions, with nothing sensible to replace them, has become an unmitigated disaster. 







































 Yes, but there is no shortage of plans for what to do with carbon taxes, yet this author doesn't mention a word about them, nor about the fact that absolute carbon pollution caps will ultimately be needed as well. It all seemed very short on saying anything other than, "l'm a conservative concerned about climate!". 




 From the article: But I think weve tried to explain that the connection from an extraordinary climate event to conflict is complex and certainly involves other factors. 
























 A very vague piece, as expected. Would be nice to know why minimizing the tax burden is such an important goal, and exactly whose tax burden would be minimized.  




 Tough. Fossil fueled whores have been harassing dozens of legitimate climatologists for decades, issuing hundreds of FOIA demands and dozens of lawsuits, attacking the word's best researchers in every way possible in order to delay evidence of the obvious--delays which will cost humanity millions of lives and trillions of dollars. Now they're whining? Well, fuck them very much. 




 Where did you get the idea that civilization will be gone in fifty years?

Yes, climate change is a severe threat, but few serious scientists forecast anything as dire as what you believe. It's a very long-tail probability.  




 Wherever the aims of capitalism and religion meet, watch out.  




 First, they think the American public is more conservative than it is.

Second, as true believers, they are blindly focused on destroying government.

Third, they know that the young don't vote and the old vote Republican, and that the old are the fastest-growing demographic segment, so fuck everyone else.

 



















 This has been underway for many decades in the more desirable corporate marketing departments and their ad agencies, where many senior employees once literally started in the mailroom, with no more than high school educations, then worked their way up into great upper-middle class positions, with plenty of company-paid training and mentoring along the way. Now the path to those great jobs is through selective graduate schools that cater to the privileged.

The result is a growing wall between less educated people and opportunity, with the scales tipping heavily towards those who can afford the high price of entry. 




 Read skepticalscience.com. Especially the list of scientific responses to denier claims. 




 The social cost of carbon is very likely much higher than $50/ton. It's been repeatedly revised upward, and the longer we dither the higher it goes. [This recent Stanford study](http://news.stanford.edu/news/2015/january/emissions-social-costs-011215.html) estimates the cost to be $220/ton.

I know that economists generally prefer carbon taxes to caps, but it's a false choice. The intense need to completely quit carbon within our lifetime means that we will have both taxes and caps, on graduated scales over time, with taxes rising while caps clamp down from above.  




 Good question. As far as I can tell, the answer appears to be: [we're arguing about it.](http://americablog.com/2014/06/climate-news-arctic-seafloor-methane-release-double-previous-estimates-matters.html) 




 [Chicken is pretty low carbon.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/vegetarian-or-omnivore-the-environmental-implications-of-diet/2014/03/10/648fdbe8-a495-11e3-a5fa-55f0c77bf39c_story.html) About 7 lbs of carbon emissions per pound of food. In contrast, it takes 27 lbs of carbon pollution to produce a pound of beef. That's versus about 3 lbs for rice or potatoes.
 














 Absolutely. However, those most able to change are those young enough to face lots of material life choices, who can easily decide to live in a city, in an efficient building close to work and transit, to invest in carbon-alternative stocks like solar and railroads, etc.. 
 




 It's all about the oceans. If any temperature data would falsify the climate change consensus, it would be extensive evidence of prolonged cooling at all depths in the oceans, which we could only get from a huge network of deep sea thermometers that we don't have. However, we *do* now have a pretty good network of ARGO floats measuring temps in the upper half of the oceans, and they show definite long-term warming proceeding from the top down. 

The PDO is only recently confirmed and remains poorly understood, but that appears to be the key to understanding long-interval warming cycles. 




  "The reason a carbon tax is popular is because it is easy to implement (people can pollute as much as they want, they just have to pay the unit price)"

That's why carbon taxation won't be enough. Sure, the dividend scheme solves the regressive nature of carbon taxes, but, ultimately, carbon pollution must end altogether within a few decades. Yes, fee-and-dividend taxation will be helpful and popular. However, in the end, the need here isn't to *reduce* fossil fuel burning but to *eliminate* it.

 The main benefit of this is that it solves the regressive nature of carbon taxation. 

However, carbon taxes will never be enough because, ultimately, carbon pollution must stop altogether. That means a cap on it that declines over time until fossil fuel burning is outlawed entirely, probably around fifty years from now. Carbon taxes help, but they can't replace the need for that coming ban. 









 Half measures. Fee-and-dividend is all well and good, but only if the fee is high enough to actually deter polluters, and that will be high indeed. 

We need carbon caps as well. And, ultimately, before this century is out, our grandkids must ban any and all burning of fossil fuels worldwide. Those are the simple facts if we are to keep the Earth peaceful and prosperous. 




 Merchants of Doubt, for sure. Also Desmogblog.com and Skepticalscience.com. 

Of course, most of the public relations strategies used by the energy industry today were pioneered by PR firms working for the tobacco industry fifty years ago. [Here](http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Tobacco_industry_public_relations_strategies) is a good page on that from Sourcewatch. And the tobacco companies adopted those tactics from the master propagandists of the 1930s, especially Joseph Goebbels. 

 




 Why not blame the developers? They effectively run most county governments, which is why the codes are so weak in the first place. 

As for buyers, they simply don't know what they're missing. Yet. 




 Right after you check your bias towards ruinous carbon pollution. 

By the way, I don't care if we kill carbon with solar, nuclear, wind or oyster farts, as long as we kill it soon. 




 And the worst free marketeers of all: suburban tract developers! 




 Everyone in Idaho: give away all your property, forgive trespassers, hand over your guns, then take in every drifter, bum and prostitute you can find, and don't forget to wash their feet with your hair. 














 Damn, that's three times now that we've botched our chance to get rid of Texas. 




 This. Most builders build energy efficiency only to the degree that code requires, so the key is to upgrade building codes to something like "passive house" standards. Airtight construction with heavy insulation and sophisticated ventilation. The beauty of it is that this doesn't cost a dime more than ordinary construction, due to eliminating big HVAC systems. It generally makes a better building, too; very quiet and durable, with much cleaner indoor air.

As for this article, I was disappointed that the author didn't really address insulation and temperature efficiency much at all. That, not electrical management, is most of the efficiency story. 




  No one expects rooftop solar to power the entire country. However, quitting fossil fueled power as soon as possible may be the greatest need that humanity now faces, so *all* economically viable alternatives need immediate development. Most economic estimates put the net cost of decarbonization at around 1-2% of GDP, but it won't be free. But erecting price barriers to distributed solar in order to shelter life-threatening polluters is unconscionable.

 Fossil fueled energy is indeed far more highly subsidized than rooftop solar is, and that's without considering pollution and health externalities, which add several multiples to that cost.

 Granted, the taxpayer buildout of the national grid was decades ago, but it remains one of the costliest national projects ever undertaken. It wasn't merely the BPA and TVA, either. It was the Rural Electrification Act, the construction of mammoth projects like Grand Coulee and Hoover dams, and much more. I have no idea what the total value of all that is in today's dollars, but it's probably in the trillions. And then utilities were given monopoly control of these market areas, which has enormous value in itself. It's no stretch to say that utilities are way out of line extorting fees from taxpayers who do the right thing in net metering. 














 A few questions:

 Quitting fossil fuels is an urgent priority, and switching to solar provides a low-cost means to do that, so why erect barriers to solar that preserve the fossil fuels monopsony?

 Fossil fueled electricity is much more highly subsidized than solar is, so why compound those subsidies by erecting cost barriers to distributed solar?

 Much, if not most, of core grid infrastructure was built at taxpayer expense, and ongoing maintenance by utilities has already been compensated by granting those utilities market monopolies, so why are they due anything more?   




 Note: quality vineyards take decades to come into their own, so rapid warming makes *any* vineyard investment risky. Prime terroir is now a quickly moving target, so the window of profitable production in any region will shrink. Still, it seems clear that the Columbia Valley and northwestern Europe will be among the best bets.

Still, for every new wine region opening there will be another closing, losing massive investments in infrastructure and old vines. This is likely to be a net loss to wine producers and consumers.

 Yeah, but they continue to be paid because their lying has worked for decades. 




 But you claim that multiple papers presented at Ringberg "suggest that 2C will be the high" by 2100, which they did not. To the best of my knowledge, *no consensus* at Ringberg or in credible climate science has said any such thing. If anything, the studies presented at the Ringberg Workshop project a likely warming of around 2.5C by 2100, which is both well beyond a "2C upper limit" and probably very conservative given [new data](http://news.sciencemag.org/climate/2015/02/cold-pacific-ocean-offsetting-global-warming) on oceanic warming. 




 I work with folks who place students in these jobs, and it's not necessarily as sunny as it sounds. "Huge" demand in skilled trades now is often tempered by modest pay, sporadic work and nonunion status that lacks benefits. A master welder makes about what a master secretary does, although bigger money beckons in underwater and overseas work. 




 Just like baby boomers when *they* were under 30!

(Let the downvotes begin...) 




  new research was recently presented at Ringberg that clearly demonstrates that making such a prediction at this time is speculative, at best.

Which presentation at Ringberg would that be? If it's any help, [here is a list](http://www.mpimet.mpg.de/en/science/the-atmosphere-in-the-earth-system/ringberg-workshop/ringberg-2014.html). 




 "Backing off the IPCC's 4.5C prediction?" First, 4.5C is the *high end* of the IPCC's current 1.5 - 4.5 degree temperature forecast for 2100. It's not the median. However, more [recent studies](http://phys.org/news/2015-02-evidence-ipcc-climate-sensitivity.html) suggest warming will be at the upper end of this range in a business-as-usual scenario. 

Second, China and India are poor, developing countries heavily invested in hundreds of new coal-fired power plants, their per-capita emissions are still far below ours, and they rightly point out that we westerners are responsible for nearly all of the carbon pollution cooking the climate to date. Still, both ([and especially China](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/02/04/3619026/china-gets-ready-for-national-carbon-market/)) are now making strides to reduce their pollution. 




 [No.](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate2573.html)

2C is one *hell* of a long way beyond natural variance in global climate within a single century, and most experts agree that we have already effectively locked in that amount of increase given that we are unlikely to completely quit burning fossil fuels in around 25 years, which is what it would take to limit warming to 2C.  We are more likely headed for [3-4C](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/31/planet-will-warm-4c-2100-climate) warming by 2100.

 "Renewables like wind and solar and biomass will certainly play roles in a future energy economy, but those energy sources cannot scale up fast enough to deliver cheap and reliable power at the scale the global economy requires. While it may be theoretically possible to stabilize the climate without nuclear power, in the real world there is no credible path to climate stabilization that does not include a substantial role for nuclear power."

 The line can be blurry. Fascism is always totalitarian, always very nationalistic and often insular. Socialism *can* be those things, as it was under Stalin and Mao, but it can also be democratic, culturally open, and blended with capitalism, as in the Nordic countries. 

Fascism rose as a reaction against socialism, led by nationalists like Hitler who hated the internationalism and pacifism of socialists, who many Germans blamed for  losing the First World War. Most fascist governments since have been similarly violent, nationalistic, anti-communist, and run by charismatic strong men.  




 we would see massive investments in solar by private industries to save money and become more efficient. They aren't doing that without subsidies.

[In many regions of many countries solar is now grid-competitive without subsidies](http://www.fastcoexist.com/3043473/in-much-of-the-world-solar-power-is-already-as-cheap-as-grid-electricity).The United States now has a [a few of those regions as well](http://www.hawaiireporter.com/big-rooftop-solar-panels-make-sense-in-hawaii-without-any-subsidies). Many more are on the way.

That's looking at world wide oil and gas and doesn't take into account the enormous difference in market size between oil and renewable. On a per capita basis renewable receive far more money in subsidies than oil and gas

Fossil fuels are the world's second-most-subsidized industry, after arms, and they are *vastly* more subsidized than renewables.  




 There isn't one yet. The world's governments are in preliminary negotiations leading up this summer's the big UN climate conference in Paris.  




 It wasn't enough that McConnell's Congressional Republicans openly tried to undermine the President's nuclear arms diplomacy with Iran? Now they're subverting his negotiations with the world on climate solutions?

Where's a firing squad when you need one?  




 "Solar isn't financially viable - except with massive government subsidies and grants.

First, solar is very economically viable without subsidies in some places right now, and its cost is dropping by half every five years, so it will soon be economically viable nearly everywhere.

Second, solar subsidies are dwarfed by the [$550 billion in annual direct subsidies to the oil, gas and coal industries](http://image.slidesharecdn.com/d2-am-s7-subsidies-petarvujanovic-ocde-141205102749-conversion-gate02/95/fossilfuel-subsidy-reforem-by-petar-vujanovic-2-638.jpg?cb=1417796944)--and that's without considering the trillions in annual *indirect* subsidies for fossil fuels, for things like military actions and automotive infrastructure. And these are subsidies for a mature, incredibly wealthy industry that needs no help with new infrastructure or development, and, let's not forget, this is an industry that every national scientific academy has identified as a major threat to global wellbeing, while solar presents one of our best opportunities to reduce that threat.

 Dodgy. 




 The last cycle measured was 2012, when Dems won.  




 Young people forty years ago didn't vote any more than they do now. Boomers didn't really begin voting in large numbers until the 1990s, and they've only recently begun to hit the late-life stage when people tend to vote without fail (which usually begins around age 65).

As for your feeling that the baby boom was defined by Woodstock and so on, with all due respect that view was manufactured for you by pundits looking for something to talk about at the time and afterwards. Don't get me wrong: the early boomers' coming of age in the late 1960s was big, but mostly because the generation followed the 1930-1945 baby *bust*. However, in economic terms relevant to this article, the boomers had their biggest impact much later than most think.

Truth is, the larger, younger end of the baby boom has much more in common with GenX: they all hit adulthood after the early boomers had taken many of the jobs and bid up the price of houses; all were part of the cohort that first lost employer pensions and lifetime job security.

 




 All correct, except that Portland's water comes mostly from snowmelt at those higher elevations. The climate is bone-dry most of the summer, when water demand is highest. 




 He's not saying screw driverless cars or anything. In fact he welcomes them.

Yeah, he basically says that insurance companies would be among the only losers, due to fewer accidents, which is obvious enough. We already know that Detroit hates self-driving cars for similar reasons.

For me, the most interesting bit in this is when Buffett hedges and wonders about 10% penetration by 2030. If that's a conservative figure, it says much.  




 [Here](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus.php?ind=E01) is the breakout: 90% of oil and gas campaign money went to Repubs in the last election cycle measured. 




  80% of oil money goes to Republicans and their causes.

That was then. [It's now 90%.](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus.php?ind=E01) 




 Now let's just see if Republicans in Congress can resist the urge to write yet another undermining letter to Iranian leaders. 









 Agreed, although I suspect the freeway median may have been used here partly to prevent the theft of solar panels. 




 This issue recurs from time to time, and it's always the same ploy: transfer the National Forests and other Federal lands to the states, where easily-bought politicians will then sell off everything to private logging, mining and real estate companies--who will then fence out the public. 

It's up to us to block these bastards. Every time this comes up, write your reps and say, "no way!". 




 I'm reasonably certain that more than one whip-wielding southern slaveholder also told his slaves, "at least you aren't living in Africa!". 









 We agree that most are only too happy to continue their lazy inattention, maybe while patting themselves on the back for switching to low-energy lightbulbs. However, I doubt that many have yet bought into the oil industry's latest craven pitch to abandon all hope. 














  Those are results of introducing intermittency into the system.

On the contrary. The smart grid is coming for a hundred reasons that have nothing to do with intermittency. Smart meters and smart buildings top the list, and those primarily concern cost control and efficiency, as outlined in [this ComEd overview](https://www.comed.com/technology/smart-meter-smart-grid/Pages/smart-grid.aspx) which lists everything *but* intermittency. 

The poorest countries don't have nukes

Pakistan *is* one of the poorest countries, and nuclear-armed. North Korea as well. Russia isn't exactly rich. Others will follow. 

I find that (warfare) scenario highly, highly improbable.

You must know better than US military leaders, then. Sleep well.

 




 Okay, Chris Mooney; *you* may not have been talking about this but plenty others have. Bad headline on an otherwise good article.

You're one of the best journalists writing about the disconnect between science and political preconceptions, but this is different: you're delving into the details of climate science, and this is clearly new territory for you. Step carefully. 




 The few people I know who say "it's too late; it's now hopeless" are people who never cared about climate to begin with. For them, this is merely the latest convenient excuse for continued lazy inattention. 




 I am aware of no single study that doesn't acknowledge the costs of integrating intermittency into the grid. If there were one, I bet you would have cited it.

http://cleantechnica.com/2014/01/24/forget-intermittency-nrel-says-wind-energy-can-boost-grid-reliability/

A smart grid exists for the sole purpose of dealing with intermittency.

No, the smart grid is needed for many reasons: resilience, smart metering, peak pricing, operational savings, etc.. 

I know it's popular to dream of a day when every home is it's energy castle, but it just isn't backed up by economic realities.

Who said grid power will vanish? Not me.

The purpose of warfare when caused by economic depression is to seize what others have. How can you do that if you nuke their shit?

Clausewitz disagrees with your definition of war's purpose, but history shows us that *any* rational "purpose" for war is usually quickly lost in gore, hatred, and the burned bodies of innocents piled to the skies.

To date the primary purpose of nuclear weapons has been defensive: "invade my country and we'll nuke you". However, conflicts and associated chaos will continue to escalate in the world's poorest, most climate-vulnerable regions as climate damage rises, both increasing temptations to incinerate enemies while also inevitably putting nuclear arsenals in the hands of victorious insurgents. ISIS, for example, sprang from the chaos of the long Syrian drought, gathered momentum by adding the excluded Sunnis of Iraq and now Yemen. They would dearly love to someday seize Pakistan and its nuclear missiles, and studies suggest that global warming is [adding to that very threat](http://www.dawn.com/news/1157200). And that's merely one of [many climate concerns](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2014/11/14/does-our-military-know-something-we-dont-about-global-warming/) that now worry US military leaders.

Let's just say that more desperation, drought, cultural friction and economic despair don't make a nuclear-armed world any safer.
 




  The more renewables grow, the costlier their impact to the grid.

Debatable, and most of these complaints are coming from old-line utilities trying to preserve their sweet monopolies.

With or without renewables, we'll need a smarter grid, so it's unfair to blame all of its costs on the rise of renewables. 

 Batteries are far too expensive for developing countries. 

[Not for long.](http://dqbasmyouzti2.cloudfront.net/assets/content/cache/made/content/images/articles/Storage_Cost_Drops_530_402_s.png)

 Yes, because nuking people solves economic problems. /s

You're probably right. When has economic depression ever led to world war?  




 Speaking of cherry picking, you're basing your complaint entirely on the wind graph, where newer Greenpeace forecasts contrast with older forecasts from other sources. But what about the other two graphs that show more contemporary forecasts from multiple sources? In those, the Greenpeace forecasts still outperform by wide margins.

Again, the point isn't that Greenpeace is perfect, but that most researchers, even theirs, have underestimated the growth of renewables. As in this excerpt:

*"The results for solar PV are even more dramatic...In this case, though, actual statistics proved higher, nearly doubling the optimistic Greenpeace formulation."* 









 Boomers alone didn't fuck you. Hell, Americans are still basically fighting the Civil War, with political loyalties persistently aligned by North-South geography and opinions on white, Christian supremacy.

Until recently, boomers didn't vote much either. The country has long been run by the very old, because only the very old vote without fail, in absolutely every little election. When it gets down to voting on fire commissioners and school bonds, the ancient are *three times* more likely to cast a ballot than 20-somethings are.  




 No need to tackle reams of peer-reviewed papers. Just read some of the many credible online digests of climate science. [Skepticalscience.com](http://www.skepticalscience.com) should be at the top of the list. Other good sources include [NASA](http://climate.nasa.gov), realclimate.org and climatecentral.com. 


































 There's no doubt that renewables are critical, and, taken together, they may be the single most important future power source, but they simply will not be enough, which is why several of the world's leading climate scientists recently issued [this joint letter](http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/03/world/nuclear-energy-climate-change-scientists-letter/) to world leaders.

The need to leave carbon fuels has now become an emergency. We need all hands on deck, and all the carbon-free power that we can muster...like, yesterday. 




 More common: skilled, experienced older workers thrown out of work are reluctant to take a big step backwards, and often for good reason. If your income plunges in your 50s, you may well lose your spouse, your house, your health insurance. Your kids may lose their college opportunities. Prospects for any kind of retirement can vanish. 




 The baby boom's peak birth year was 1957, meaning the heart of the baby boom is now 57-58; they were 10-11 when Woodstock happened, and they didn't really begin voting at all consistently until the Clinton years. (Reagan was elected by their parents.) 




 I don't think the article's point was to praise Greenpeace, but to show how growth in renewable power blew past all forecasts, *even* Greenpeace's. 




 The truth is, boomers didn't control much at all until 23 years ago, when Clinton was elected. Like every other generation, they didn't really begin voting faithfully until well into middle age, and the peak of the baby boom is now only 58. 




 Simply put, this article is a steaming heap of lies spread for years by oil industry flunkies. No matter how often they're debunked, they just keep springing back like a case of herpes. 

There was no 1970s global scientific consensus that the climate is cooling. There was no UN forecast of "50 million climate refugees by 2010". And so on. 

Do some real scientific reading, or, if you can't, at least accept the facts that all 97 of the world's national scientific academies, and 97% of publishing climatologists, are in complete agreement that we are responsible for warming the globe. 

And also be aware that the largest industry in human history is doing everything in its power to confuse you about that. 














 The TPP hasn't passed, most of its signatories would likely be part of any global climate agreement as well, and, frankly, getting sued by Peru is not at the top of American worries. 




 Ashton would be the wrong guy to ask about the economic details of decarbonization. He simply takes Shell to task for their refusal to acknowledge the need to do it at all, and good for him.

However, few in the know believe this will be accomplished with renewables alone. Nuclear will be part of the solution as well. Yet renewables will carry most of the weight, in both developed and developing nations. Solar/battery combos and microgrids, in particular, are well suited to developing countries precisely because they don't require existing transmission infrastructure. 

As for cost, two points: 1) The cost of decarbonizing is now low--about [1-3%](http://unsdsn.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/US-Deep-Decarbonization-Report.pdf) of global GDP--but will [quickly rise](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-05-11/power-decarbonization-cost-rises-22-to-44-trillion-iea-says) if we continue stalling; 2) the cost of *not* decarbonizing the economy is [potentially ruinous](http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s10414.pdf) (figures like 20% of GDP are often mentioned), and that's before we consider that economic collapse on that order would almost certainly ignite nuclear war.

The only possible conclusion is that we have no choice but to leave most of the world's fossil fuel reserves unburned. The good news is that we can easily afford to do it. The bad news: we cannot afford to wait. 












































 You're right, everyone wants "a throat to choke" when they suffer a loss. However, if that hypothetical kid who ran into the street was killed by *you* behind the wheel, rather than by a computer, there is little chance that you would be held liable unless someone could prove that you had been driving recklessly. Why hold the computer to a higher standard? 




 Thing is, these cars will crash less than human-driven cars will, creating a net benefit for insurers. The hard part is assigning liability, I agree, but should the company have to pay extra for a net benefit it delivers to third parties? 



















 Yeah, but Canada isn't forecast to be one of the countries most parched by heat and drought in coming decades. 




 True, but the Dems are still trying to govern. Repubs are simply sowing division, discord and mistrust in order to wreck the consensus needed for government.  




 Although this piece is clearly unpopular with techies on Reddit, thanks for posting it. Sure, many nations excel at mathematics and technical competency, but only the United States wows the world with companies that capture the imagination like Disney, Apple and Nike. 









 Yeah, lacking brains and a heart is hell on creativity. 




 This is worse than anarchy. This is pitchforks and torches as far as the eye can see.  




 Companies often drink their own Kool-Aid like this, rationalizing away their lapses and convincing themselves that they are actually engaged in something good and even *vital*, then being surprised when the public doesn't buy it.

After the public relations disaster that is *Blackfish*, Sea World's only real recourse is to phase out  orcas as amusement attractions. That is what they must now do, but not before earning yet another black eye in the process. 














 Agreed. However, if it walks like a sociopath and it talks like a sociopath... 







































 Who made you? 














 Commuted for years with a backpack myself because I didn't want a rack and pannier on my nice road bike, but always regretted it.  




 Sure it's depressing, but some people *are* intentionally evil, willing to actively lie to get what they want. They're called sociopaths, and they make up [2-4% of the population](http://www.amazon.com/Sociopath-Next-Door-Martha-Stout/dp/0767915828). They are defined by a strong personal sense of superiority, a reckless disregard for "little people's rules", a ruthless willingness to screw anyone for personal gain, and a psychotic confidence that they'll be able to lie their way out of any jam. Sound familiar? 




 Suggestion: rather than strapping a bag to the rack, get a pannier bag to hang off the rack. Much more secure. 

Second-best: get a small backpack.  




 Cruz strikes me as an opportunistic ideologue from oil country (Calgary) who followed the industry's money to Texas, which has a long history of backing oily pols for the Presidency. The fact that he graduated Harvard Law doesn't mean squat about his objectivity or ethics. 




 Still more bad news for beef. 




 We have a fossil fuels industry problem on climate change. That industry merely gives 90% of its campaign money to Repubs. 




 It's more that the main reservoir lies 3,100' above the city. 




 More to the point, we have a campaign finance and political media problem on climate change. When the largest industry in the history of mankind gives 90% of its political donations to Republicans, and the when party leaders depend on support from television and radio networks run by men with close oil industry ties, we shouldn't be surprised that loudmouthed lunatics from Texas are willing to sing their song.  




 But Senator Inhofe has a snowball. 














 Not a real climatologist, but SoCal isn't going away. 80% of California water usage is in agriculture, so farms will feel it first. LA basin residents will just face stretches without lawn watering or car washing.  









 Not in the Republican Party. 




 What do you expect from a media corporation run by men with deep [oil and coal industry ties](http://www.wnd.com/2013/01/is-saudi-prince-steering-news-corp-coverage/) who specialize in pandering to the most proudly carbon-polluting consumers in the US, Canada and Australia? 




 Why is this a problem? If we are serious about solving the climate mess, we need every carbon-free energy source we can get our hands on. 




 CCS looks more like nothing but a political talking point to salve swing states. Unfortunately, most big political swing states states happen to be coal states (Kentucky, West Virginia, Colorado, etc.) so CCS is offered to win their support for climate action. Attempts to make it actually work affordably, as with NextGen, however, have mostly failed. The only places where it shows even limited promise are places where coal-fired power plants sit atop deep oil fields with secure capstone, like Texas, in which power plant exhaust can be injected to squeeze out oil.  




 And meals, beer, cable, etc. 




 Bingo. Strelkov's men were very likely the bastards who shot down the Malay airliner. Against that kind of world-class asshole, even Putin look like a softy. 




 Can't say for sure, but I suspect that some of these fraternities began partly as secret societies of military cadets and other future Confederate officers who were networking for the war to come. 




 It's not surprising that they picked this up at a national conference. Those tend to mix young house leaders with older, retrograde racists who run the alumni wings of many old-line fraternities and sororities that originated in the antebellum South, [as SAE did](http://www.sae.net/page.aspx?pid=756). 




 Pretty much. A telling example is the current DirectTV spot featuring Rob Lowe saying "don't be like the other me...the 'peaked in high school' Rob Lowe" (who wears a letterman's jacket while serving fast food). 














 This could be a preview of coming attractions for other hydro-dependent regions in the world's warmer temperate zones as [Hadley Cell](http://www.goes-r.gov/users/comet/tropical/textbook_2nd_edition/media/graphics/ch3_overview_image.jpg) expansion dries them out. Look out Brazil, China, India. 




 "While there have been a few attempts to found liberal alternatives to ALEC, none have yet caught on."

This made me laugh. ALEC exists because it's backers want to wreck government so they can rule like feudal princes. How many corporations and billionaires are interested in backing a group that stands for *more* business regulation and wealth redistribution? 

Bribery cannot be solved by more bribery. 




 A quaint reminder of those dewy halcyon days before e-commerce and big data were worth trillions, before the Net became the province of spies, gangsters and terrorists. 

Anyone else find it funny that the largest company profiting from our fall from grace is called Apple? 




 In the interest of efficiency, you'll all stop this social interaction, networking, courting, coaching and mentoring shit immediately.  




 Take off in a recursive explosion of intelligence and boogie with the universal intelligences in this and other universes. 
























 In American high schools (grades 9-12), private companies sell [expensive jackets](http://www.vsacustom.com/images/varsityjacket_Blue.gif) for top-level athletes to display their athletic awards. If you make the top-level ("varsity") boy's basketball team, for example, you become a "letterman" who "lettered" in basketball, and you are entitled to buy and wear the letterman's jacket with the letter sewn on it.  




 Yep, an armed society is a polite society. 




 To be fair, the US had an underclass long before it had auto-centric suburbs. I'd argue that suburbanization (and GM's trolley destruction) merely put more distance between the *urban* underclass and other Americans, but remember that most American poverty [is rural](http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/rural-economy-population/rural-poverty-well-being/geography-of-poverty.aspx).  




 The smartest very definitely do *not* "always rise to the top". 




 This is a deeper, darker level than mere passport theft and indentured servitude. This is true slavery: buying people at market, locking them in cages at gunpoint, barely feeding them, forcing unpaid work in factories and fishing ships for life. 




 Call John Brown. 














 Cities are frequently on the hook for supplying utilities at low or no charge to new suburban developments beyond the city lines. 

It's a vicious cycle that pits city and county governments against one another like this: 

1) County government wants more tax base so approves new suburban development, free riding on burdens to city for water/sewer, connecting roads, etc..

2) City makes up for loss by annexing older commercial districts just beyond city lines, which costs county some of its tax base. So...

3) County government greenlights more development on suburban fringe to recoup tax base lost to city.

 









 It's the closest thing to a basic income program that exists in the US.

It's also something of a preview of the fee-and-dividend carbon tax that's likely coming on the national scale. 




 From the article:

"Bear in mind that a family of four collects four same sized dividends."

Alaska families collect a dividend for everyone in the household. 

A friend of mine comes from a low-income family of twelve. You do the math. 




 "The researchers found ten different frames used to communicate climate change: Settled Science, Political or Ideological Struggle, Role of Science, Uncertain Science, Disaster, Security, Morality and Ethics, Opportunity, Economics and Health. The first five frames were used to communicate the IPCC reports much more frequently -- whereas the latter frames were not used much at all."

In other words, the media tend to report on climate in the ways that are most contentious but least connected to our daily lives. 




 About time. Until the 1980s, and with additional damage from a 1978 Supreme Court ruling, we had usury laws that made these practices illegal. And with good reason: usury makes the middle class poor, and it makes the poor debt slaves, tearing apart society. That's why the Bible ranks it as a capital crime in the same league with murder and rape.

[Here](https://americansforfairnessinlending.wordpress.com/the-history-of-usury/) is a reasonably good synopsis. 









 We can be reasonably sure that any such game-changing, work-reducing new technology would benefit mostly the few engineers who corner the technology, and push the rest of us just that much closer to minimum wage. 




 First of all, your friend has poor taste in other friends, so you might look for better friends yourself. 

As for the link, it's all a pile of crap, but let's just address that first graph as an example:

 It cherry-picks a misleading time span, 1995-2010, which is one of the few in which *surface temps* (more on that below) were flat. To either side of this little window you'd see a rising temp trend.

 It ignores ocean temps. 93.4% of the excess heat from greenhouse warming goes into the oceans, and the oceans have continued warming unabated.

 We now know that the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and other long-cycle oceanic convection currents create multi-decadal cycles of heat capture and release to the atmosphere, so that warming will proceed in stair-step fashion. Right now we are in a PDO "cool phase" due to end in a few years, when atmospheric heating will again take off steeply as it did in the 1990s. 

 The HADCRUT dataset used here is not "air temperature anomaly" (The UK Met Office does not use that term) but "surface temperature anomaly". Because surface temps over the Pacific are not anomalously warm during a cool PDO phase, they make it seem as if global temps have gone flat. However, look what has happened over a [longer span](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/crutem4/), and, in particular, the steep warming in northern continental areas.

I could go on. Your "friend's friend" is putting his/her faith in an obscure conspiracy site created by a conservative lunatic, while ignoring the united opinion of every national scientific academy on Earth, after the largest scientific inquiry of all time? Again, avoid this asshole. 



















 I sure didn't see it. Sold Kraft six months ago. 




 DARVO, actually. Much nastier than mere projection. 




 I notice that some [long-range global drought forecast maps](http://www2.ucar.edu/sites/default/files/news/2010/2090-2099wOceanLabels.jpg) show especially dry future conditions in the Mediterranean Basin and the Mexico/Caribbean/Venezuelan region. What is the confidence interval for these projections? They are pretty scary.  




 The link 



















 Also a low regulatory bar for building codes, and the ability to cut deals with weak suburban municipalities for low property taxes. 









 This could kill someone. Holy shit. 




 He actually strikes me as more of a Jefferson Davis guy. 




 Usury. A term that's fallen out of use. Time to revive it. 




 give hospitals an incentive to compete on prices, and hopefully lower the cost of health care.

Unless you're shopping for a specific high-ticket procedure like a hip replacement, you'll probably find medical pricing too impossibly complex for comparisons. This just invites hospitals to engage in loss-leader pricing, gouging on everything else, and it encourages inefficiently duplicating costly facilities between hospitals because no hospital wants to miss a chance at rare but lucrative treatments.

The only thing that has demonstrably lowered care costs by wide margins is just the opposite: government control and near-universal risk pooling. 




 A likely candidate: desal powered by solar PV, which will be both crazy-cheap by then and well suited to the dry, sunny coasts where urban water shortages will be most acute.   




 I'm reasonably sure that Warren Buffett waited for me to sell my stock in Kraft before he pounced and drove up the price 35% today. 

Well played, Warren. Well played. 




 Should we be surprised that the longstanding outliers in satellite data analysis consistently originate with an evolution-denying Christian fundamentalist who serves on the boards of several oil-funded climate-science-denial organizations?

 You got that right. However, American utilities aren't exactly known to embrace change, they are legal monopolies, and they are politically powerful at the state/local level, so their first reaction is to block competition. 

If they were smarter, they'd avoid the fate of German utilities like RWE and E.on, which tumbled in value for years before finally selling off their worst coal plants to embrace renewables and DG. 




 Marketing creative slots have vanished in recent decades due to automation in a dozen ways.

Consider the ad agency art director, so called because that person once directed dozens of artisans: pasteup artists, typographers, photographers, film makers, illustrators, strippers, engravers, printers, etc.. Now the "art director" handles all those roles alone, using Abobe CS on a Mac, usually using stock images rather than producing original art. Goodbye to most of those other creative jobs.

The rise of retail is another example, replacing the need for much advertising and PR. The key to *that* was the development of retail databases and scanners. Hello to more minimum-wage Walmart stockers; goodbye to highly paid ad agency copywriters and account execs.

Then consider the consolidation of major consumer companies, which used to be widely distributed but are now heavily concentrated thanks to IT systems that allow fast real-time management of complex networks. That means that the marketing work once done by dozens of local ad agencies and marketing departments across the country is now handled by a handful of people in New York and Chicago.

So, yes, marketing creativity is still in demand, but it takes a lot fewer people to provide it. 




 Except owners of capital. They'll *always* be safe. 









 Opposition to distributed generation is coming mostly from the electric utility industry, but I take your point. 




 [This](http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?type=C cid=N00033085 newMem=N cycle=2014) explains much. 









 Bingo. CCS remains a pipe dream except in rare cases where suitable, deep, secure underground storage already exists. 




 Without global Keynesian stimulus spending after 2008, the world would have likely collapsed into a depression as bad or worse as the 1930s. Nations that invested in more stimulus, such as the U.S. and China, have generally fared better than places that invested less, like Europe. 




 True, but production forestry is not problematic; clearing forest for pastures is. A cap and trade system compensates landowners for keeping the land in forest, while a carbon tax does not. 




 What if the collapse of the American Dream is bigger than the baby boom, or bigger than America itself? This is a trend throughout the rich world, and it has been under way for some time. Blaming 1/4 of Americans for not singlehandedly stopping it is pretty harsh. Plenty of boomers are getting screwed as well. 




 Both, actually. We do still have time to prevent warming of 3C or above, and it'd take lots more than dikes to deal with the consequences of *that*. 




 There's a difference between wahoo and whoopee. 




 "So why not build renewable, instead?"

Because, despite all of its benefits, we cannot build enough renewable power to get the world off of carbon fuels in time. 




 Did baby boomers usher in Social Security or Medicare? Did they keep polluting and raping landscapes as previous American generations did? Did they leave Jim Crow racism to fester for a century as their elders did? News to me.

Sure, boomers leave a lot to be desired. So did their parents. And their grandparents. And so will your generation. 

That's the way it should be. Every generation should improve on the previous. But, God help me, there's always a slice of each generation coming of age that thinks their parents' cohort is responsible for all the world's ills. Unless you are 60-something and German, your resentment is misplaced. 




 I don't know you, but it sure sounds as if you worked your ass off more to build security you never had, and less to provide for a family that may come later.

Now that you have a little cushion, why not take those skills and that resume' to a job you'll enjoy more? It will vastly improve your chances of finding a great spouse and starting that family you want. 




 Not so opposite. When he said that, Keynes was countering economists who maintained that capitalism needs no interference because "imbalances work out in the long run". Instead, Keynes favored taking action to improve the future, much like planting a tree. 




 California will do just fine. There'll be fewer irrigated farms, but the cities will thrive, and they're built for quakes. 









 Note: these complaints aren't from Cubans, but from rich-world *tourists* whining about the impending commercialization of "dear, quaint Cuba". Reminds me of the very elderly rich reminiscing about the charm of old Hawaii when it was poor. 




 We richies may have farther to fall in a total collapse, but a total collapse is unlikely. And, in any economic crisis, the rich always do better than the poor. What concerns me most is the possibility of incremental decline in global prosperity and security leading to police states in rich countries, most likely with heavily nationalistic, fascist overtones. Many would welcome that, seeing it as protection from the brown barbarians killing one another in the real shit-holes farther south.  




 Yes, which is a primary reason why we'll probably have cap-and-trade systems as well as carbon taxes. For all their merits (and their popularity with economists) carbon taxes don't directly reward those who preserve vital carbon sinks such as forests.  




 Sure, the world is well past its agrarian-era carrying capacity, so we are *all* technologically and economically interdependent now. However, over the next generation or so, the greatest threats to rich-world citizens are likely to be from chaos in poor, subtropical countries hit by drought and food supply interruptions. Syria and the Arab Spring uprisings are just a taste. ISIS is as much a product of climate change as of the American destruction of Iraq.

TL;DR- Spreading, climate-caused violence and economic strife abroad is probably a greater threat to Americans than is climate-related collapse of domestic systems. 














 Generally speaking, citizens of rich countries are at far lower risk than those of poor countries; citizens of temperate and near-polar countries are at lower risk than those nearer the equator; citizens of militarily strong countries are at lower risk than those of weak ones. As the world's richest, strongest country, largest food producer and owner of rich temperate and northern lands, the US will do much better than most. 




 [The referenced Nature article.](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate2570.html) 









 A bit of both. The US still has a few further opportunities for large-scale hydro, and quite a number at small-scale, but damming many of those places (Yosemite, Canyonlands, Copper River, etc.) has been prevented by well justified environmental concerns. 




 And state officeholders, county council members, school board members and so on. If there is one thing the old/white/passionate conservative base does well, it's to vote in *every* election, no matter how tiny. That ensures they always have a deep bench of junior pols ready to move up, and it preserves the heavy state and federal advantages given to rural voters which allow conservatives to punch well above their weight.

 First, you are cherry picking. Oils outperformed the SPX in 2001-2011, but often lagged before and have definitely lagged since. 

Second, that was then. The global scientific community (all 97 national scientific academies, the UN IPCC, etc.) delivered the verdict on leaving most fossil fuels unburned only last year. The Saudi dumping of oil followed that announcement, not coincidentally. Meanwhile, coal stocks have been in decline for five years, and European utils are selling off their coal-fired generation businesses. This is no longer the *new* reality, but just the reality. 














 Did you check the MSCI link? Fossil-free indexes have been outperforming the S P for the past five years. That's the reality that exists. 




 All true, but most of the rest of the world is [driving up](http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/files/2014/01/14/beef_prices_chart.jpg) beef and pork prices as fast as they can. 




 Anyone who thinks these universities would endanger their endowments' performance by excluding fossil fuels, [see this](https://www.msci.com/resources/factsheets/index_fact_sheet/msci-acwi-ex-fossil-fuels-index-gbp-gross.pdf). 




 Based on data like [this comparison](https://www.msci.com/resources/factsheets/index_fact_sheet/msci-acwi-ex-fossil-fuels-index-gbp-gross.pdf) and [this](https://www.aperiogroup.com/resource/138/node/download), combined with the fact that the entire world scientific community now tells us that we must quit fossil fuels entirely within little more than a generation to avoid running insane climate risks, isn't it time to get out of oil, coal and gas stocks?

I've made this a cornerstone of my stock portfolio. Anyone else doing this? 




 [Relevant.](http://www.someecards.com/usercards/viewcard/1d59dbf3adff85344bde64dfe334603f) 




 So, a small fraction of what we just spent to bail out the corporate banks and pull the world back from the brink of depression and war. Got it. 














 True. However, the takeaway for me is the article's comment from Michael Mann: "the U.S. still needs to create a larger gap between greenhouse gas emissions and economic growth". In other words, relying on market forces to solve this problem over time is woefully insufficient. 









 True. A better headline would be, "Finally, a conservative with morals the oil industry can't buy". 














 The "crash" has already begun, but it's more of a slow crumple, like a supertanker hitting the rocks at low speed.

[This analysis](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/10/fossil-fuel-free-funds-out-performed-conventional-ones-analysis-shows) shows the new market reality: stock indexes that include fossil fuels underperform those that don't. 




 None of the fossil fuel majors are doing squat to diversify into renewable energy. The few that even tried, such as Shell and BP, have backed away. CEOs and directors don't last long, so each has a strong incentive to maximize short-term shareholder return, and screw the future. 









 One item to watch: standing on the pedals too much--as in hill after hill--can lead to leg cramps on longer rides, particularly in hot weather. Try to stay in the saddle, keep a cadence, and hydrate. 
























 Theres a volcano in Alaska, Pavlov, that only erupts during the autumn and winter. The 10cm or 15cm rise in sea level during the winter months, when low pressure comes over, is enough to bend the crust and squeeze magma out. Thats an example of how tiny a change you need, he said.

Fascinating. Thanks for posting this. 




 We need people who know the science but can speak to their tribe. 

Bingo. 




 Except when economists provide cover for pillage and political prostitution. There's *always* campaign cash in those. 




 A fanatic's first reaction to failure is always to insist that the policies tried weren't *pure* enough, so they need to be doubled.  







































 To be fair, Repubs have two approaches--tax cuts and deregulation--but only one ultimate goal: destruction of government. 




 "Washington State photon torpedoed the idea faster than a Borg could mutate."

Hah! 




 Ian, have you looked into the impact of raising cattle and cattle feed in California? [This Bloomberg article](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-04-13/cows-suck-up-more-of-california-s-water-than-almonds) suggests that it is the top single drain on California water supplies, yet it seems to get little attention.  




 "First, the government should eliminate energy subsidies of all kinds  for fossil fuels as well as renewable energy."

A very false precondition. "The government" cannot level the playing field by eliminating fossil fuel subsidies, because the vast majority of them come from scores of *other* governments in developing countries; $550 billion annually. We would also have to eliminate much larger *indirect* subsidies such as public money for fossil fueled infrastructure such as highways, airports and utilities, not to mention the vast military costs of protecting oil fields and transport routes.

Fee-and-dividend carbon carbon taxes are beautiful things in themselves. However, until all the world's nations stop subsidizing fossil fuels, renewables will still need subsidies to compete. 




 Consider the alternative: coal, pollution from which is already killing or sickening millions worldwide, making fish inedible, and cooking the climate. Which is the greater risk? 




 Hey, if it walks like a demon, and it talks like a demon... 









 Shoot the messenger? Lomborg has been hired by a fossil fueled front man to spread doubt about the global scientific community's dire warnings that we must quit fossil fuels very, very soon. That is the story here.

Jotzo is hardly the only economist (or climate scientist) critical of Lomborg's profitable grandstanding: *every national scientific academy on Earth* officially disagrees with Lomborg.

However, the fossil fuel industry just can't get enough of him.  




 You have spent some time building those walls. I won't waste mine trying to break them down. 




 You want credible economists? The IPCC is full of them, and, as a body, they completely disagree with Lomborg, who is no economist at all. 




 Lomborg is more accurately what used to be called a mountebank. Someone who makes a career out of calling attention to himself.  




 Put another way, polluters have learned that buying media and experts to craft messages for it it is a worthwhile cost of doing business. 

PR toadies have responded by creating front groups like the Heartland Institute, which specializes in market research and messaging to divert attention from any harmful business, from tobacco to coal. For a painfully accurate, darkly funny inside look, see the movie, "Thank You For Smoking". 




 Out of sight, out of mind. 














 "These prices" are now low precisely because Saudi producers know they won't have many buyers in the future. It takes decades to deplete a large field. They're dumping product while they still can, and before carbon pricing begins to eat margins. 




 Haven't we all. However, I think one of the better things one can do for humanity is to raise a wonderful person or two. And I don't buy the doomsayer's argument that kids will merely inherit a hellhole of a planet. Not at all. Sure, climate is a challenge we must confront, but I'm reasonably sure we will do so, and it will be neither the last nor the largest challenge humans will face. (Just wait until synthetic biology and artificial intelligence get rolling!) 




 This should be titled "Large *American* cities ringed by car-dependent suburbs are less green". Most European cities are far greener. 




 Then at least pay for your trash: dumping tons of extra carbon into the atmosphere cannot remain subsidized by the rest of us. 




 Bury it in secure storage.

We simply don't have time to solve the climate problem without using *every* tool at our disposal. 




  I don't want to live in a city they are fucking dangerous.

Some cities are dangerous, many aren't. For examples, look at the top and bottom of [this list](http://www.numbeo.com/crime/rankings.jsp). It's largely a matter of wealth and how invested a city's inhabitants are in its continued wellbeing. Not too different from small towns and rural areas worldwide: some are placidly safe while others are dangerous, also due largely to wealth and emotional investment. 




 We lack time. The world scientific community tells us that we have exactly 27 years, at present trend, to quit fossil fuels altogether if we want to prevent running crazy risks to the climate, peace, prosperity, and the lives of millions. This is now an emergency, full stop. We must develop *every* clean energy source we have, and that includes nuclear. 

But don't take it from some random natterer online. [Listen to the experts.](http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/to-those-influencing-environmental-policy-but-opposed-to-nuclear-power/?_r=0) 




 Suburbs exist because massive government infrastructure spending and subsidies, along with free carbon pollution, *enabled* them to exist.  




  It's called quality of life.

Its called free riding.  




 What do oil reserves matter when at least half will need to stay in the ground to prevent climate catastrophe? 




 The car itself, even if electric, requires a [huge carbon footprint](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2010/sep/23/carbon-footprint-new-car).

Worse, the kind of living that a car enables--big, inefficient, detached homes with thirsty lawns and power machinery, where every errand requires a long drive to still other inefficient buildings, whose occupants *also* depend on driving--is the most carbon intensive by far; several multiples more so than city living. Needless to say, it is also highly water intensive, materials intensive, etc.. 




 If you need a car at all, you are placing a massive strain on resources. It's nearly impossible to live a suburban or rural life without doing so. 




 Then pay for the true cost of [400% more carbon pollution](http://e360.yale.edu/feature/greenest_place_in_the_us_its_not_where_you_think/2203/).  









 The best way to *prevent* an outcome like that may be to do just the opposite: forget the cabin and [stay in the city](http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/22/earth-day-climate-change-column/26073883/). 




 Something else that does wonders for mental health is to join others who feel as you do, and raise your voices together in order to be heard. 

Citizen's Climate Lobby and 350.org are great for that, but nearly any environmental group will do. 
 




 Bleak? This is the most exciting, optimistic, important time to be alive that has ever existed, and I'm serious. 

As a species, we are overcoming warfare and injustice faster than ever before. Population growth will soon peak. Our grandchildren will live richer material, spiritual and intellectual lives than we do. 

We simply have this little climate problem to solve, which we can easily and affordably do, if we can just cooperate. Gaining that cooperation is the signature task of our time. So get to it! Just remember that you have two enemies in this fight who are determined to wear you down: one is named social inertia and the other is called the fossil fuel industry. Don't let either of those defeat you. 














 Ugh. If this blog lunatic had even *read* the Tyler Cowan article in question, rather than merely attacking its headline, he might have noticed its point: "Our more peaceful and  yes  more slacker-oriented world is in fact better than our economic measures acknowledge. Living in a largely peaceful world with 2 percent G.D.P. growth has some big advantages that you dont get with 4 percent growth and many more war deaths."

 Sulfates + water = sulfuric acid

Ocean acidification and acid rain are already massive problems that sulfate seeding would make much worse. 




 True, and the most cost-effective geoengineering scheme, sulfate spraying, will actually make ocean acidification and acid rain much worse. It's like a heroin junkie trying to compensate by smoking crack rather than by breaking their addiction.
 




 Lowering taxes on the owners of capital means shifting those burdens onto poorer taxpayers. Meanwhile, on current US trend, the benefits of any extra growth will go entirely to the rich.

Count me out. 




 1) Solar output peaks when much of demand does, during the afternoon air conditioning hours, so intermittency is less problematic than it may seem.

2) Battery storage costs are dropping quickly as well. For example, [this forecast](https://dqbasmyouzti2.cloudfront.net/assets/content/cache/made/content/images/articles/Storage_Cost_Drops_580_440.png) from three years ago actually *underestimates* the rate of improvement. 

3) While some think that solar or wind will be enough by themselves, most credible voices on the matter believe that we'll still need base-load generation from nuclear, biomass and the like. 




 Installation and other soft costs have rich opportunities to fall in the US. Those costs are [more than double](http://greenzone.co/2014/05/04/solar-pv-system-germany-roughly-50-cheaper-us/) what they are in Germany, and German companies are steadily lowering their costs as well. 














 Overcoming limited supplies of commodities is what human ingenuity does best. Don't bet on scarcity. 




  exponential modelling of any product is a fool's errand

So Moore's Law doesn't exist? Sometimes exponential product improvements *do* happen. In the case of solar PV, [Swanson's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swanson's_law) holds sway. It may not move at quite the speed of Gordon Moore's famous dictum, but the mechanics are similar.  





























 Nationalists who hate versus internationalists who love. Nothing new about that. ([Godwin's Law hereby invoked.](http://library.flawlesslogic.com/finance.htm)) 




 There seems to be either a Play It Again store or something like it in every metro of a half-million or more. Bonus if hockey is big in your area: it takes tons of gear, it's all-year, and kids start playing early, so parents are always looking for ways to economize. 
























 Google "Earth Day" and your location, and something will probably turn up. Also, just show up at a rally, or write a letter to the editor of your local paper. Those tend to capture the attention of political leaders.

 Four degrees warming isn't *likely* to cost more than half of Earth's people their lives, although it might. It would certainly crash the global economy, reduce the food supply and lead to much more warfare. If global nuclear war breaks out, it's goodbye civilization, and that means goodbye as well to the global infrastructure needed to feed billions.  




 They always are. Tribal hatred and all that. 




 Jeb Bush wants to represent a political party that gets fully 90% of the oil and gas industry's campaign money. Let's recall that his oily brother also acknowledged climate change while campaigning, then actively sabotaged and defunded climate science once in office.  




 And twenty years ago today, conservative fanatics killed 168, including an entire child care center, in the Oklahoma City bombing. Merely the worst of many deadly conservative attacks on America before and since. 

By contrast, the most notoriously violent socialist radical group of the 1960s, the Weather Underground, killed exactly one person. The Unabomber killed three. So much for left-wing terrorism. 




 If there was destructively irrational exuberance during Greenspan's tenure, it came primarily from raging libertarian egotists like him. 

I'd like to take a measured, sensible, economist's view of his opinions, but I can't. Not after seeing the massive pain and ruination that resulted from them. 

 




 Washingtonians and Oregonians have been battling Californian attempts to steal our water for generations. This is merely the first time they've brought Star Fleet to the fight. 




 But just try to insure those. 




 Better idea: rather than spending billions to move water from Washington to California, primarily to raise [cattle and their alfalfa feed](http://www.businessinsider.com/real-villain-in-the-california-drought-isnt-almonds--its-red-meat-2015-4), why not just raise the cattle and the feed in Washington where the water is now? 




 There are plenty of better places to grow water-intensive crops like alfalfa, almonds, pistachios, beef and rice than in the middle of a desert. 




 California has been trying to hijack the Northwest's water for generations, blithely ignoring the fact that Oregon and Washington fight over that water all the time, and they, too, are suffering from drought right now. 




  the ice has been melting for thousands of years because the earth has gradually been warming.

The Earth has actually been slightly, gradually [*cooling* for the past 8,000 years](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Holocene_Temperature_Variations.png), after reaching the interglacial peak. The past century's sudden rise looks like a wall on the right side of the temp chart. 














 Back when? 









 When did I say "painless"? You say that climate action, "involves simply taxing ourselves into economical and technological stagnation" and that "abandonment of fossil fuel use would bring about complete economic collapse". I simply quoted the global economic and scientific consensus that says your statements are completely untrue. Solutions are very *affordable*, but no one says they're free.

 




 There's the real objection: if the solution isn't painless, deny the problem. Rationalize it away. Foist it onto others. Shirk responsibility. 




 Upvote for all the above, although I suspect that dumping their oil before it is outlawed is a larger factor than most admit. After all, it takes many decades to really drain giant fields, future extraction technology will undoubtedly extend the life of those fields, and a global ban on burning oil is now inevitable, maybe even imminent. 

The only factor you haven't mentioned, and perhaps this qualifies as fresh thinking, is the degree to which the Saudi oil heartland is also the heart of the Kingdom's Shia population, and Sunni/Shia warfare is breaking out all over, so maybe the Saudis are also concerned about possible future national breakup and the loss of that territory. 




 Everyone's view of where "the other side" begins is relative to their own position on the political spectrum. Where do *you* stand? 









 The article's point is that continued global warming will lead to an economic crash which will then reduce the pace of further warming, although by that time both climate and economic conditions will be dire. 




 I do dismiss the left's solutions as they're often economically unsound

Which "left" is that? There's some range to consider. 




 Except that fossil fuels receive [$550 billion in annual subsidies](http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/resources/energysubsidies/), and have been heavily subsidized for generations. That $550 billion is about six times what renewables get, despite the fact that fossil fuels are the largest, richest industry on Earth, with well developed infrastructure that needs no assistance, and fossil fuels represent a global *problem* while renewables are a desperately needed *solution*.

That's the so-called "free market" you're defending. 




 You do realize that the IPCC is also comprised of economists, right?

I'll be moving along now. 




 Not only New Jersey. Coddling cops while attacking teachers has been Republican doctrine nationwide for at least a decade. 

Not hard to see why. More teachers are female, more cops are male. Teachers lean left, cops right. The GOP's geriatric base voters are worried about their own safety but indifferent about educating a generation they won't live to see. 




 Except that every national scientific academy, all 97 of them, agree that we must quit fossil fuels within 20-30 years at present trend, or climate damage will pose existential risks to civilization itself. How is the free market alone going to overcome the entrenched power of the world's largest industry *within that time window*? 




 Did I say that? No. So why did you? 




  I also agree with these scientists.

You agree with Idso, Ball, Lindzen, Singer, et al? Those are merely paid oil company shills singing for their supper, my friend. Others on the list, like McKitrick and Spencer, are conservative political ideologues.
 




  I'm skeptical of many populist solutions that involve simply taxing ourselves into economical and technological stagnation.

 "We cut renewable subsidies but not fossil fuel subsidies, and renewables lost ground to fossil fuels. Crikey!" 




 I certainly don't know what "Christians are for", do you? There's wide variation on that score. But I can easily see what *Christ* was for: sharing.

How is a voter who agrees to a tax for benefits to others not performing an act of charity? 




 It's much easier to calculate the cost of decarbonization, where variables are known, than to forecast future climate sensitivity where variables are less known. 




 I'm merely saying that Nordhaus's forecast represents the low end of a credible range, the high end of which is much, much higher.

Personally, [Weitzman](http://www.macalester.edu/~wests/econ231/Rev%20Environ%20Econ%20Policy-2011-Weitzman-275-92.pdf)   Wagner are more my breed of climate economists. 




 Rhetoric? No, scientific fact. It's called the [DICE model](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/documents/DICE_Manual_103113r2.pdf). 

You expected global climate risks to be cheery? 









  The climate changes during the pliocene are not well explained by carbon, it doesn't even account for a significant portion of the differential.

There is [little doubt](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v3/n1/full/ngeo724.html) that elevated carbon levels during the pliocene accounted for a significant portion of the higher temperatures and higher sea levels then. And that was merely one of [many such ancient episodes](http://www.whoi.edu/cms/files/zachos08nat_141144.pdf) that provide insights into what a high-carbon atmosphere does to life on Earth. And, in each of these episodes, the impacts to precipitation have been highly uneven, boosting extremes--drier here, wetter there--just as we now see developing.

We agree on the need for action, and on the need for credibility, but let's settle down with the knee-jerk attacks. 




  See, there you go predicting doom if humans don't act soon to decarbonize. How can you be so certain of the stakes?

I'm not predicting anything. I'm simply paying attention to the united opinion of *all* of the world's major research bodies, which say we *must* decarbonize due to the extreme risks involved.

Here's an analogy: we now find ourselves playing Russian roulette, while forcing our children and grandchildren to play as well, all simultaneously, but we don't know with real certainty 1) how many bullets are in the guns, 2) at what part of our bodies the guns are aimed. We do know that, over the course of the next few decades, the number of bullets increases, as does the likelihood of the guns being aimed at our heads. Every decade is a pull of the triggers.

That makes the modest cost of decarbonization (0-2% GDP, net) an essential investment. 




 And Nicholas Stern says 6C could cost [20% of global GDP](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130129110402/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/Executive_Summary.pdf)--and that's before we consider the costs of ensuing global warfare, where all bets are off. Look at the global cost of the Syrian drought right now. Needless to say, there is quite a range of possible costs, but any of them would be far greater than the modest cost of prevention. 









 No, not very comforting. 




 1) Very few "predict doom", because most believe that humanity will act soon to decarbonize. The stakes are simply too high not to.

2) The plea to decarbonize isn't coming from "a scientist" or "just *some* scientists"; this is the united judgement of the entire world scientific community, including endorsements from every one of the world's 97 national scientific academies, the UN IPCC, the World Bank, NASA and just about every other research authority one can name.

3) The fact that we don't know with certainty what to expect is exactly why these organizations and individual experts are all so concerned. Their position is that the likelihood of absolute catastrophe is too high to ignore, and growing higher as we dither, so the only reasonable action is to "buy insurance" by investing in decarbonization now. 




 That's easy, because it has happened several times before and we have abundant evidence of the effects. 

For example, the [last time we had 400 ppm CO2](http://scienceblogs.com/significantfigures/index.php/2013/05/10/the-last-time-atmospheric-co2-was-at-400-parts-per-million-humans-didnt-exist/), as we now do, it led to sea levels more than 100 feet higher than today, global temperature 5F degrees higher than today, with large deserts in the North American Great Plains (complete with camels, no less). 

Let's just say that would now be highly inconvenient--except for the camels, which would be somewhat cool. Yet that was merely a moderate warming event, due to atmospheric carbon levels no higher than today's. [Much worse](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/348/6231/229.full) have occurred. 




 Matthew 19:21 - "Go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven."

Luke 12:32-34 - "Sell your possessions, and give to the needy."

1 John 3:17 - "But if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God's love abide in him?"

Luke 3:10-11 - Whoever has two tunics is to share with him who has none, and whoever has food is to do likewise.

Acts 2:44-46 - "And all who believed were together and had all things in common. And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need."

Acts 4:32-35 - "Now the full number of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own, but they had everything in common. And with great power the apostles were giving their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all. There was not a needy person among them, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold and laid it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to each as any had need." 

Luke 16:19-31 - There was a rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day. And at his gate was laid a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, who desired to be fed with what fell from the rich man's table. Moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores. The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried, and in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side."

Etc., etc.. 




 All true, but nuclear meltdown is probably among the lesser worries, in my personal view, simply because the *last* thing any government will starve of water is a nuclear reactor; they can be powered down to reduce water consumption; and, even in the event of a meltdown, the damage is usually far more localized than that of war, drought, etc.. 




 The [last time the Earth had 400 ppm CO2](http://scienceblogs.com/significantfigures/index.php/2013/05/10/the-last-time-atmospheric-co2-was-at-400-parts-per-million-humans-didnt-exist/), as we now do, it caused the global average temperatures to rise to 3 to 4 degrees C warmer than today (5.4 to 7.2 degrees F), and polar temperatures to rise as much as 10 degrees C warmer than today (18 degrees F). The Arctic was ice free. Sea level fluctuated between 16 to 130 feet higher than today. Coral reefs suffered mass die-offs. Much of the North American Great Plains turned to desert and dry steppe, complete with camels. 

That's where *today's* 400 ppm is taking us, and never mind what the 550 ppm projected within fifty years would eventually do.  




 True, but it's a small quibble. Temuzjin's fears seem all too plausible. The idea that extreme warming will be delayed or prevented by global economic collapse due to moderate *near-term* warming is horrific. Because, as history shows, economic collapse leads quickly to the worst kind of warfare--which, these days, is as dangerous to civilization as anything a hotter climate can throw at us. 














 Meanwhile, low-cost oil producers like Saudi Arabia have responded by dumping their oil on the world market at half price, to unload their reserves before burning oil is outlawed and to delay the cost effectiveness of renewables.

That's the problem with fossil fuels: selfish-bastard nations with abundant fuel reserves can always undercut renewables if they choose, going by the logic that its better to sell those reserves now at low price than to see them stranded by the coming global bans.

The only solution is to ban these fuels sooner rather than later. The free market will *not* help. 









 The hardcore, unfailingly voting GOP base was born long before the 50s. 




 Millennials don't vote; fossils do. From a coldly calculating perspective, aren't Republicans shrewd to cater to cranky old reactionaries who *never* miss a chance to cast a ballot in every election from the Presidency down to the local school board, and to court lethal industries that most fear regulation?

There's only one solution, kiddos: vote, and organize your friends to vote.
 




 Agreed. This shows a race to scale up and consolidate in order to achieve bargaining leverage over labor, capital, vendors, retailers, you name it. 




 Hell *yes*! 




 "The government"? These subsidies are coming from scores of governments, mostly in developing countries. Very hard to control, hence the developed nations' subsidies for renewables to compete. 




  I don't understand why it would be viewed as a subsidy to the employer.

Because it rewards the worst-paying employers, lowering the floor for the lowest possible wages, speeding the race to the bottom.  




 Looks as if a Nestle boycott is gathering momentum over this, and not just among Californians. 

Nothing improves company reputation more than making yourself look like the greedy corporate bully in a lifeboat movie, guzzling all of the boat's water when the other passengers aren't looking.  









  I would like to see renewables take over without the help of government subsidies.

Wouldn't we all. However, fossil fuels are subsidized *six times* more than fossil fuels, despite being the richest industry of all time.  




 "Hey, maybe we can dump our oil on the market cheaply and sell the shit before it's outlawed, while delaying renewable energy so that we have more time to pump more carbon into the atmosphere!" 




 According to the IEA, we have only two years before a 2C rise is locked in. Time to make climate *the* central issue, whether elderly "perfect voters" are ready for it or not.  




 Been saying this for months: dumping oil on the the market is both a great way to drive out high-cost energy competitors (shale, renewables) and to sell more oil before carbon pricing and regulation kick in. For low-cost oil producers like SA, it's a win-win.

Unfortunately, for the rest of us it's a lose-lose, raising a higher price barrier to renewables and conservation. 









 Why the question mark in the headline? As the lead sentence says, "The world's glaciers are disappearing". 




 Sure, but it's all relative. Free healthcare, free university education, more than a month of vacation, $20/hr wages for McDonald's employees, and a government that taxes 44% of GDP are pretty left wing wherever you go. 




 Yes, we are in an interglacial period. No, there is [no danger of plunging into another ice age](https://www.skepticalscience.com/heading-into-new-little-ice-age-intermediate.htm), at least within the next several centuries, so definitely no need to "prevent" that. 




 Except that in economically comparable places where handguns are readily available, homicide rates are generally much higher, and most are committed with firearms.

In the US, for example, [69%](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_7_murder_types_of_weapons_used_percent_distribution_by_region_2013.xls) of murders are by shooting, and 75% of those are with handguns.

Oh, yes, the "right-wing government" of Norway...

That phrase just made my coffee come out my American nose. 




 Thanks for the great answer! 









 Isn't the model predicated on political differences among counties, states and Congressional Districts? So isn't the result really a map of overall political attitudes rather than anything specific to climate alone? It certainly looks that way. 




 "As Bartlett noted, Federal Reserve policy (slashing interest rates) and the stimulus from increased government spending were also important factors."

 It's being blamed for conditions in the Northeast as well. The polar jet pushed extremely northward off the West Coast then pulls Arctic air southward to the East Coast.

Hell, many American small towns are more violent than Glasgow. 




 Actually, more guns are smuggled from the US to Mexico than the other way round. Most illegal guns in the US were legally purchased at some point, then stolen or resold to felons, etc.. 

In my area, pickup trucks are magnets for window-smashing prowlers who know that pickup drivers are more likely to keep handguns in the vehicle. Those weapons are then easily sold to fences. 














 The House is the article's focus. As a counterpoint, I simply said that it fails to mention the greater bias against city dwellers in the Senate and the Electoral College.

 However, most U.S. shootings do not happen during the commission of crimes, and the guns are most often legally purchased. 









 "If we use all of the fossil fuels in the ground, the planet will warm in a way that is difficult to imagine. Unless the economics of energy markets change, we are poised to use them.

Unless the economics change...

Which is why no market-based approach will work. We are either willing to sacrifice a bit to maintain a habitable, prosperous planet, or we are not.  




 Good points all, except that killing "sprees" are pretty rare in the US. Most US shootings are in the heat of sudden disputes and confrontations, where, as you say, pulling a trigger is simply much easier than raging after someone with a knife, and with far greater certainty that you won't be killed or mangled in the bargain. But the typical death toll is one or two victims per incident. 




 What do you know about water supply challenges in Beijing, where, due to water stress, some are questioning the city's bid to host the Olympics? 




 True, but it's the second map showing opinions by state that's the most disturbing. All those barely populated, fossil-fuel dependent states like Wyoming get the same number of Senators as populous, progressive states like California. The Electoral College gives a similar (but smaller) advantage to empty states in Presidential elections. In short, the US Constitution ensures that each voter from remote coal and oil country gets three votes against every one for a city dweller.

 "it's doubtful that solar and other renewable alternatives can make up for the vast energy contribution of fossil fuels anytime soon. 

[Not so. And why leave out nuclear?](http://www.climatecentral.org/news/report-maps-out-decarbonization-plan-for-u.s-18362) 





























 To use a hypothetical example, say that Myanmar finds its crops are suffering from heat-related blight and drought, so it decides to spend a paltry $10 billion (Weitzman's estimate) to spew sulfates into the air, reducing global temperatures by a half-degree Celsius, improving its crop health and making its dictator more popular. Meanwhile, those sulfates become acid rain falling downwind all over neighboring India and Bhutan, destroying forests there, while the lower global temperature also causes crop failures in Canada and the Nordic countries. How do India, Bhutan, Canada and Sweden then recover from Myanmar? The military dictator there knows he has more to gain from popularity at home than he has to lose from a bunch of pissed off far-flung foreigners. 









 The IMF has done extensive studies on both positives and negatives of warming, like [this paper.](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2008/03/pdf/cline.pdf) Those findings are generally included in more recent reports. Unfortunately, where agriculture is concerned, the news isn't great. Warmer winters in Canada don't compensate for larger crop failures in the subtropics and tropics, where more than half of the world's people live.  




 This is what Weitzman and Wagner write about, and it's frightening. Their position is that geoengineering is simply so cheap that it is inevitable as a criminal activity, and must be treated as such by the global community.  




 Thanks for the nice reply, but, as the study says, in most cases these costs are born by local populations exposed to local pollution, which suggests greater accountability. The study identifies global climate damages as only about one quarter of the costs, while the rest are primarily localized effects of pollution.

It's just that those local populations happen to be concentrated in the developing world, particularly Asia, where recovering for such damages is nearly impossible. The basic trouble isn't how you or I define accountability or subsidy, but how courts do--and that varies tremendously by jurisdiction. This is less an economic matter than a legal one.

The IMF paper here simply identifies the costs, which, it seems to me, is as far as economics can go with this. Rather than quibbling over economics textbook definitions of subsidies, the real issue is how to enforce accountability in poor places with corrupt governance. 




 Shortest true answer: we don't know. 




 How so? Wouldn't a tax to recover for the damages both compensate taxpayers for their expenses and discourage polluters? 




 Why aren't externalities subsidies? If a given group of taxpayers shoulder cost burdens to benefit a specific local industry, it's a subsidy isn't it? 




 Well, no. Most of the damages detailed concern pollution and health costs, and 10-20 percent are direct handouts to encourage fossil fuel production and consumption, but don't let that get in the way of a good diatribe about traffic accidents. 




 Actually, direct subsidies (price supports, production subsidies, etc.) account for somewhere between 10-20% of the total. 




 Because insurance wouldn't pay out without a successful lawsuit in most of these cases, and most of the damages are in countries where that would be impossible. How does a resident of Guangzhou sue a factory or power plant for the death of an asthmatic child when there are so many factories and power plants spewing pollutants there? Which one was responsible? And how can the plaintiff win in a country with so many legal obstacles?

Even Union Carbide's killing of thousands in Bhopal resulted in nothing more than a modest judgement that hasn't begun to cover the costs there, where it was vastly easier to quantify damages and assign blame.  




  virtually all of it (outside say China, Venezuala and Saudi Arabia) are just tax deductions.

No, most of the [$550 billion](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/11/12/renewables-are-replacing-coal-just-not-fast-enough-to-save-the-planet/) in annual direct handouts to fossil fuel companies are consumption subsidies and production subsidies, and they are pervasive worldwide. 

The *indirect* subsidies--the externalities detailed in this paper--are predominantly localized effects of air and water pollution, especially on health costs, and most of those are in developing countries. See the graphs here:

http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2015/05/18/act-local-solve-global-the-5-3-trillion-energy-subsidy-problem/ 




 Here is a [blog post](http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2015/05/18/act-local-solve-global-the-5-3-trillion-energy-subsidy-problem/) on this paper from two IMF leaders. 









 [Here](http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2015/05/18/act-local-solve-global-the-5-3-trillion-energy-subsidy-problem/) is a related blog post by two of the IMF leaders vetting this paper, for those who want more detail.

Note that this is not the first time the IMF has issued a report like this. It's merely a large increase from the $1.9 trillion in subsidies and externalized costs that was the previous yardstick. 









 Sorry about the paywall. Here is the text:

WASHINGTONConsumers should be paying a whopping $5 trillion more a year for energy to cover the hidden health and environmental costs of using fossil fuels, the International Monetary Fund said Monday.

Vitor Gaspar, head of the IMFs fiscal affairs department, which produced the report, called the estimates shocking and one of the largest negative externalities ever estimated, referring to costs that arent factored into prices.

The fund said policy makers must start capturing those costsvalued at roughly 6% of global gross domestic productin fuel prices now to curb the damaging effects, encourage greater energy efficiency and prevent a mounting toll on human health.

The report said the costslargely fueled by the ballooning use of coal in China and Indiafar surpassed the savings gleaned in the past year as governments cut traditional energy subsidies.

Falling oil prices have given governments including India and Angola an opportunity to raise energy prices closer to their market values.

Cutting subsidies relieves a burden on state budgets and allows a government to channel revenue elsewhere, such as social services, health care or growth-spurring investments.

International Monetary Fund Fiscal Affairs Department Director Vitor Gaspar called a report on the hidden health and environmental costs of fossil fuel use shocking.
International Monetary Fund Fiscal Affairs Department Director Vitor Gaspar called a report on the hidden health and environmental costs of fossil fuel use shocking. 

But the IMF said the uncounted costs of pollution from coal, oil and natural gas also should be considered subsidies because economies are burdened with mounting costs resulting from their use. Based in part on new World Health Organization data, the fund estimates those post-tax subsidies will hit $5.3 trillion this year alone.

Around a quarter of that covers the theoretical cost of mitigating greenhouse-gas emissions.

The rest is from the health effects of local pollution as well as from traffic congestion, accidents and road damage.

It is important to put in perspective just how many health problems are linked to energy consumption and air quality, said Benedict Clements, a division chief in the IMFs fiscal affairs department.

For example, the WHO estimates more than one million premature deaths a year occur because of outdoor air pollution caused largely by burning coal, he said.

IMF economists acknowledge the figures are disputable, but say they provide some indication of hidden costs that should provoke debate.

They also accept that eliminating subsides by raising energy taxes would be costly for consumers, and so it recommends a gradual increase.

Moving to efficient energy pricing in one step would require very large increases in consumer energy prices, in particular for coal, with a global average price increase of more than 200 percent, the IMF warned.

Although higher energy prices generally tax an economys growth prospects, the fund said governments can use the increase in revenue to foster economic expansion, such as through cutting labor and corporate taxes, infrastructure investment and spending on education.

It also would create incentives for low-emission alternative energy.

The fiscal gains from subsidy reform are sizable and could be a game changer for fiscal policy in many countries, Mr. Clements said.

 That's part of it, but look at vote-by-mail states: turnout is better, but it's still heavily skewed by the elderly in most elections. High-profile presidential elections are the major exceptions. 




 These days, just a pinch. 




 Both. Fossil fuel companies get at least $550 in direct handouts each year, and very likely much more, but the price gets into the trillions when one adds the costs of health care, infrastructure and environmental damage. I don't know if this also includes the military costs of defending oil fields, transport routes and the like, but, if not, that would push the value of these subsidies still higher.  




 The article mentions a few, including Vitor Gaspar and Benedict Clements, head of the IMFs fiscal affairs department and one of its division heads, respectively. 




 How can hippy-crunchy Vermont be the most expensive? 




 About 5% of a gram.  




 It's a working paper, i.e. a preliminary report. However, it's already received public comments and support from several IMF leaders, so it's very definitely for real. 




 Yes, that is what a working paper is. However, this one has already been partially vetted by some of the IMF's fiscal affairs leaders, so it carries real weight.  
























 The problem is that the older they get, the more often they vote. 

Got a special election for your local school district replacement levy? They'll be there to kill it.

Time to vote on a new fire commissioner or local judge? They'll be there to ensure that he (and it will be a he) is a faithful Tea Party stalwart.
  
The rest of us sleep through these little contests and then wonder what happened.  




 I took it differently: as another example of how road funding is [a giant  subsidy for the trucking industry](http://truecostblog.com/2009/06/02/the-hidden-trucking-industry-subsidy/), as well as for the auto industry, rural residents and suburban sprawl. 














 Most fuel subsidies are price supports, exactly as you describe, and most are outside the U.S.. The rest are predominantly production subsidies.

Those are just the direct subsidies. Include *indirect* subsidies like health costs and climate damages, and, according to [this working paper from the IMF](http://www.wsj.com/articles/imf-estimates-trillions-in-hidden-fossil-fuel-costs-1431958586), annual fossil fuels subsidies top *$5 trillion*. 




 Right. I doubt that many of my graying host of Tea Party neighbors is going to tolerate anything like this degree of socialism as long as they can lift a pen to mark a ballot. The Age of Entitlement will have to await their passing. 




 Not coincidentally, we also heavily subsidize driving. Gas taxes now pay less than half the cost of roads, and the global oil industry gets around $500 billion in annual taxpayer handouts.  














 Not as many as are coming online. The [IEA forecast](http://mzconsultinginc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IEAWEONov2013a.png) is for nuclear generating stasis in the OECD but pronounced growth in the rest of the world. 

And, just between you and I, the IEA is very wrong to think that coal consumption will continue growing as it did. The world will soon enough acknowledge that coal must go much sooner, and that gas systems release intolerable amounts of methane, so it's back to nuclear and renewables once again. 




 That was then. As you know, the numbers have been recently skewed by Japanese and German pullbacks. The world now has 435 operable civil nuclear power nuclear reactors, with a further 71 under construction. That will be quite a boost in capacity. 

http://www.world-nuclear.org/Nuclear-Basics/Global-number-of-nuclear-reactors/ 














 Nuclear [continues growing worldwide](http://www.iaea.org/PRIS/WorldStatistics/UnderConstructionReactorsByCountry.aspx), but primarily in China, Russia and India. You're right about the US alone, however; nuclear is in a holding pattern here.

We can be sure that nuclear will soon accelerate again, however, because, as [these experts](http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/03/world/nuclear-energy-climate-change-scientists-letter/) correctly point out, we now have little choice but to pursue *both* renewables and nukes.  









 After all, where would *any* religion be without enemies of the faith to defend against? 




 Out of sight, out of mind! Much easier to dodge paying the true cost of fossil fuels, especially when that industry gives 90% of its political money to Republicans. 









 Much different in the States. Here, some drivers claim that bikes have no right to be on the road because they pay no gasoline tax. It's a shockingly common refrain--and completely wrong, due to the fact that less than half of road funds come from the gas tax (and the fact that nearly all American cyclists also drive). 




 All arguments against moral hazard go out the window when the major bank CEOs show up at Treasury, as in 2008, saying, "bail us out or suffer massive global depression that may lead to nuclear war".

The point is to better regulate banks so they can *never* back us into another corner like that again. 




 Minneapolis, Portland, San Francisco, Boulder...there are some decent bike towns popping up in the US now, but *none* even begin to approach the total commitment to bikes in cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam, in my humble view. 




 "I don't care much about climate, but if you'll buy off my wealthy sponsors with gigantic tax cuts that benefit only them, while we shaft everyone else with a regressive carbon tax, then maybe we'll talk". 
 




 Truckers do *not* pay "trillions a year to operate on the roads". They pay about [$35 billion](http://truecostblog.com/2009/06/02/the-hidden-trucking-industry-subsidy/), or about a third of highway taxes, but because trucks cause more than 90% of road damage they effectively get a subsidy of more than $60 billion per year (as noted in the linked article). 









 It's much more localized than that, as Bishop and Cushing detail in *The Big Sort*. Over the past fifty years, Americans have moved increasingly to be among people like themselves: lefties in cities and righties in rural counties, with individual suburbs falling heavily one way or the other, so that now most US counties are political "landslide counties" where one party completely rules. 

And, yes, that leads to violence: think of the attacks in Oklahoma City, Atlanta, Knoxville, Austin, Wichita, Spokane, Las Vegas, etc.. Notice that these places tend to be "border towns" where rural, right-wing extremists are in close proximity to small cities, which they assault whenever they see a hint of "tyranny" (a Federal office building, a Unitarian Church, a family planning clinic, a Martin Luther King Day parade, a Sikh temple, a liberal radio host, a couple of cops eating lunch...).  So one could say that we already have something of a low-grade civil war under way. We do indeed hate each other that much, sorry to say, and we've moved into opposing enclaves because of it. 




 The studies this article cites are merely a few of many, like [this one](http://www.uspirg.org/reports/usp/do-roads-pay-themselves), that show that tax money flows entirely the other way: from general funds to roads. Fuel taxes have never really paid for the roads alone. Forty years ago they paid *most* of the cost, but no longer. Now they pay less than half.  

Add the fact that vastly more road damage comes from trucks, and it's clear that road maintenance is essentially a gigantic taxpayer handout to trucking companies. Then add the social cost of driving (carbon pollution, injuries, respiratory ailments, etc.) which is in the trillions, and we can see just how much road construction really costs us. Bikes, on the other hand, cause almost no road wear and they actually reduce health costs.  




 Another example of how Republicans and Democrats are no longer neighbors, but now citizens of two geographically separate countries. 














 Better TL;DR. (I'm not a bot.)

The 5 stages of climate denial:

Stage 1: Deny the problem exists

Stage 2: Deny were the cause

Stage 3: Deny its a problem

Stage 4: Deny we can solve it

 [The Harberger Model.](https://www.law.upenn.edu/live/files/367-gravellepdf) 




 Most fossil fuel subsidies have little to do with production cost: they are simply price subsidies to make oil cheap, or handouts to build more coal-fired generators, etc.. Nearly all are in developing countries with low living standards, where governments stay in control by showing their people that affordable driving and electric power are within reach.  




 Just as gay men did all over the Western world until a couple of decades ago. 




 Fair enough. However, if one wants to make sense of this, its seems to me that one has to look at both the rising share of women in the labor force *and* their rising income. 




 Stopped reading as soon as I saw that only US subsidies are mentioned. The authors undoubtedly know that the vast majority of fossil fuel subsidies are beyond the US, and that those foreign subsidies very effectively prop up American fossil fuel companies as well. No commodity is more global than fossil fuels. 




  Perceptions are not a useful test for reality.

I was just addressing Wumbotarian's question about the perceived value of employee benefits. 

penetration rates have been declining for some time

And deductibles are not rising? Elective choices aren't shrinking? Let's face it: health insurance may be more costly, but it isn't adding extra value to compensation. 

All these points are wrong; The value of retirement plans offered by employers is not declining...DB as proportion of plans offered has been stable for the last decade.

In 1979, [38 percent](http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v69n3/v69n3p1.html) of private sector employees in the United States had a Defined Benefit Pension Plan. By 2011, the number had dropped to 14 percent. That isn't a decline?

What makes 401's crap?

Oh, maybe the fact that they plainly aren't working, with only the well-off being able to save sufficiently? Or the fact that they shift market risk onto employees? Or that promised employer matches are vanishing, leaving employees even less able to save? Or how about the simple truth that 401(k) plans were sold to employees as *supplements* to pensions, but then turned out to be mere stalking horses for the killing of those pension plans? Or perhaps the plain fact that voluntary saving for retirement never has worked before, and probably never will? We now have tens of millions of workers headed for old age with almost nothing to sustain them. To call that a kick in the teeth is a vast understatement, but what would you call it?

 [Day care has been] 7% of family income since the 70's.

[Wrong.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/04/08/rising-cost-of-child-care-may-help-explain-increase-in-stay-at-home-moms/)

 The college premium has risen faster then the cost of college.

[Wrong again.](http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-CU892_paydeb_G_20140515160642.jpg)

i'm not sure under what basis you can claim "many" folks are not better off.

See above.

 




 Look at participation rates or labor force share: both show a rising trend over the period. Women definitely continued to enter the labor force in larger numbers well after 1980. 

More importantly, women now [*make far more money*](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2013/12/SDT-gender-and-work-12-2013-0-03.png), which greatly amplifies the effect of their growing numbers in the workforce. That further disqualifies the use of overall household income as a point of comparison.

So why does the Booth School use such a bogus measure? Because it's the Booth School, of course. They have a conservative business agenda at stake. You're right: this *is* basic stuff. 




 The issue is the *shift* of the tax burden from corporate taxes, which are paid largely by shareholders, to carbon taxes that are paid mostly by consumers and which slam low income earners the hardest by far. 

One can't argue to switching from a progressive corporate tax to a highly regressive carbon tax is anything but a dumping of overall tax burdens from the rich onto everyone else.

Also, let's just say that Econlib is not the least biased source for opinions. 




 Women's share of US workforce: 

1972: 38%

2014: 47% 

What's more, women have moved into [much higher income employment](http://dpeaflcio.org/professionals/professionals-in-the-workplace/women-in-the-professional-and-technical-labor-force/) than they used to occupy, further skewing household income as a point of comparison. As "Creamyturtle" says, this obscures the fact that wages have been stagnant and men have seen real wage declines.

This article is simply another Booth School attempt to paint a rather gloomy economic trend as sunny, in order to blame the victims and obscure the long trend towards inequality. 




 All I'm seeing in that graph is population growth and a fairly stable workforce/population ratio.

Look closer. The graph shows that most women were *not* in the workforce in 1970, yet most *are* in the workforce now, and the trend has only recently begun to level off. This isn't exactly news, is it? 




 [This](http://www.gallup.com/poll/1720/work-work-place.aspx) may provide some insights. Declining health and retirement benefits are the chief complaints among employees. 

Yes, the employer's cost for health benefits is rising, but the perceived value to employees is *falling*: we all face higher deductibles, we're all being pushed into HMOs with fewer elective options, etc..

The retirement benefits picture is even worse. Defined benefit plans are vanishing altogether, being replaced with lousy 401(k) plans, and even the employer matches for those are disappearing.

Add the sky-high cost of daycare for children of working parents, and the skyrocketing cost of college for one's kids, and it's safe to say that many folks are *not* better off, no matter how much they may enjoy playing Angry Birds on their phones. 




 First, household income is a poor point of comparison due to the rise of two-income households over this period; this hides overall stagnation in wages, and declines among men. Median wages would be a better measure.

Second, inequality has gone through the roof, followed by the financial elite committing gigantic debt fraud and extorting massive taxpayer bailouts, which leaves most Americans feeling very, very screwed. Trends in perceived wealth and income *always* relate to the general sense of fairness in the system, which, it's fair to say, is now deep in the toilet. 




 Few surprises except Hawaii. If there is one place in America that should be bike friendly, that's it, but no... 




 Who the hell is upvoting this garbage? 'Fess up. 




 Most of the jobs are "indirect", meaning with suppliers, subcontractors, etc.. And that 22K probably doesn't include even broader spillover employment effects in nearby stores, restaurants, personal services, homebuilding, and so on. 

 




 From the article: 

"In March, he released a new policy brief, "The Conservative Case for a Carbon Tax," which argues for a steadily rising "revenue-neutral" fee on fossil fuel producers. Aside from a small portion set aside to cushion low-income households, all the revenue would be devoted to reducing other taxes. Taylor has in mind a deal that would impose a carbon tax in exchange for the removal of other climate regulations, notably EPA carbon rules and state renewable energy mandates.

Taylor is one of several renegade Cato/Heartland regulars who have spent several years beating the drum for a carbon tax as a means to cut progressive taxes on the wealthy--mostly the corporate income tax--as well as to hobble the EPA.  




  Actually, it sounds like he's pushing for a carbon tax "in exchange for liberals agreeing to cut other corporate taxes and eliminate federal fuel standards and greenhouse-gas regulations".

Sure, Taylor's position is "cut corporate taxes and regulations and then we'll talk". Given that corporate ownership is heavily in the hands of the wealthy, this is a clear ploy to benefit those wealthy shareholders--who happen to keep Jerry Taylor in luxury. That's the *only* reason why Jerry is interested in cutting corporate taxes and regulations. 

George Shultz is a much more worthy spokesman, precisely because he is *not* making his support of carbon taxation conditional on handouts to the wealthy at the expense of everyone else. Shultz advocates for fee-and-dividend while Taylor only wants tax and regulatory cuts for his rich sponsors. That is a very major difference.  




 Yes, but Taylor isn't arguing for a fee-and-dividend approach, which would counteract the regressivity of a sales tax on fuels. Instead, he would use the revenues to cut taxes on the wealthy, leaving lower and middle income people to shoulder more of the overall tax burden.

He isn't alone in this. A [growing number of conservatives](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/how-to-tax-carbon/) are beginning to see the need to price carbon as a chance to extort lucrative favors for their wealthy benefactors. Essentially, they've realized that they are losing the fight to ignore the climate mess, so now they are demanding payment for cooperation: "I'll support a carbon price, but only if you pay me while sticking it to everyone else".  




 And many of those students are [returning home after graduation](http://www.kauffman.org/newsroom/2012/07/foreign-national-students-in-us-plan-to-return-to-native-countries-post-graduation-kauffman-foundation-survey-shows). 




 Yes, and there are plenty of other conservative arguments for action: economic prosperity; personal accountability; protection of future political freedom; protection from high future taxes; stewardship of God's creation.

However, none of those seem to have been enough to move Jerry Taylor. Instead, it was the lure of shifting taxes onto the poor that drove him, because *that* will earn him a salary from conservative political sponsors. Ick. 














 "Would any member of the Bush family, whose ties to the fossil fuel industry resemble the mating embrace of the vampire squid, suddenly decide to kick that industry in the teeth by acknowledging the need to completely quit fossil fuels?"

Let me think... 




 Obama is expressly *not* targeting the mining of coal or tar sands. As the article says:

That paper, in particular, showed that the coal reserves in the Powder River basin in the West and the oil in Canadas tar sands had to be left largely untouched, and that there was no climate-friendly scenario in which any oil or gas could be drilled in the Arctic.

And yet Mr. Obama  acting on his own, since these are all executive actions requiring nothing from Congress  has opened huge swaths of the Powder River basin to new coal mining. Hes still studying whether to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, though the countrys leading climate scientists have all told him it would be a disaster. And now hes given Shell the green light [in the Arctic].

In other words, Obama caved in to the oilcos despite pleas from scientists to ban Arctic offshore drilling, completely contradicting his professed concern for the scientific consensus on climate, which says we have only a few precious decades to quit fossil fuels altogether.  




  I guess facts and progressives only go together when it ideologically suits you

Look who's talking. You misquoted cable stats, radio stats, newspaper stats. Your whole argument is merely a vague rage against "liberal media" when the fact is that only broadcast repetition really matters, and only rich conservative activists have the money to fund that. Face it: American media is now split between a beige, apolitical, old-school mainstream owned by giant corporations, and rabidly conservative propaganda channels run by activist billionaires and *their* giant corporations. The consequence is hatred now so intense that conservatives are bombing Federal buildings and Martin Luther King Day parades, assassinating liberal media figures, gunning down liberal church congregations, killing cops, and shooting up immigrant community centers, Jewish museums and medical clinics. All while calling themselves "patriots".  




  The most expensive part of running a business is personnel.

No longer. Each new industry seems to employ fewer than the last. Facebook is worth nearly as much as Walmart, yet it employs only 10,000 against Walmart's 2.2 million. When Facebook purchased Instagram for $1 billion last year, it got a thriving business with all of 12 employees plus the founder. That's the new world we're in. 




  First, the vast majority of Americans get their TV through cable

The "vast majority"? No, just [slightly more than half](http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/47812/cable-penetration-hits-21year-low).

Second, CNBC has several liberal commentators.

Heh. As fiercely liberal as Santelli and Kudlow are stridently conservative? Are you sure you want to go there? 

you completely ignored, ABC, CBS, NBC, and PBS.

No, I simply pointed out that none of those have a dedicated political following as Fox does. And, for all the conservative crap about whether Scott Pelley or Ann Curry is more likely to raise a left eyebrow while delivering a conservative political story, it's just that: crap.

Yeah, liberals watch PBS, but not often for politics: its big shows are Downton Abbey, Nova, Sesame Street, Ken Burns docs and--saints preserve us--Celtic Fire. Its news is radically vanilla. Moyers is the only show I can think of that's truly leftist, and he gets just a single late hour a week (if that; many affiliates refuse to air him). Most importantly, the PBS audience is small, ranking well behind all commercial networks, including Fox. Only Fox is all politics, all the time, all over the place, and all from one heavily slanted point of view. 

just about every major newspaper, and thus their online newspaper as well, is biased to the left.

You must not be familiar with the Chicago Tribune, The Wall Street Journal or many of the other conservative rags that populate the US landscape (yet in shrinking numbers, like liberal papers, because, as I say, newspapers no longer count for much). 

And radio? It's huge and growing, and the whole medium is incredibly, one-sidedly political. It's also an especially popular medium in the rural and suburban areas where more conservatives live, and among heavy drivers, which conservatives tend to be. In my town we have no less than five rabidly, hatefully conservative stations without a single voice from the other side, and that's rather typical. 




 Yes, it is. Particularly if you are enjoying a tax break that others are not. 

 




 Nope, "Funky Groove" is pretty accurate in hard numbers terms. Those unbothered by rising inequality are overwhelmingly conservative, and conservatives have been steadily inflamed since the legalization of one-sided political television and radio networks after the 1987 shredding of the FCC fairness Doctrine. Yes, this allowed the rise of a few weak, underfunded liberal counterparts like MSNBC, but they lack anything close to the money and reach of News Corp ($67 billion market cap) or Clear Channel ($4 billion). For example, MSNBC features only 8 hours of political programming daily while Fox News's is 24/7; MSNBC is available only on cable while Fox News is both cable and broadcast; MSNBC is available on only some cable systems while Fox News is on nearly all; MSNBC is difficult to find beyond the US while Fox News is global; MSNBC's parent corporation, Comcast, also owns stridently conservative CNBC (Santelli, Kudlow, etc.) while Fox News's parent corporation is Rupert Murdoch's personal, conservative crusade. And so on. It's not too much to say that the United States is now ripped in two, with a third of Americans (older, Christian, rural/suburban) making right-wing political venom the primary ingredient in their media diet while the rest of the country more or less ignores politics.  

 




 In other words, this conservative fellow Taylor denied climate science completely until he saw it as an opportunity to shift still more taxes from the rich onto everyone else. Now he's a believer. Scumbag. 




 Mooney is usually right on target, but this article leaves out a critical fact: elevated CO2 [benefits wheat](https://books.google.com/books?id=LUSC9lT5Q8IC pg=PA524 lpg=PA524 dq=co2+to+raise+wheat+yield source=bl ots=k-Dtrrx1pz sig=EyHR793ByERIgOkIIxERxxC2WMI hl=en sa=X ei=WSpSVbX2JILpsAXd_oCoBg ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage q=co2%20to%20raise%20wheat%20yield f=false) more than most crops. More heat and drought will certainly counteract this in hotter, drier wheat regions, but not in cooler ones. In other words, wheat farmers have much to fear in Texas but cause to celebrate in Washington State. 









 The better question: when are we going to notice that every national scientific academy on Earth now says we must leave half of present oil reserves forever unburned? 














 The other 36% was too busy voting. 




 Or, roughly the same share as thirty years ago. 




 Screenplays have taken over the niche. Television has replaced magazines as the dominant mass story medium, and writers who can create vivid, short-form tales have followed. If they're lucky, they make it into movies, although all too often posthumously (looking at you in the ground, Raymond Carver and Phillip K. Dick). 
























 Smile and ignore the [fugitive methane emissions](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/05/08/3656343/fugitive-methane-on-the-loose-on-public-lands/). 









 Welcome to a vicious cycle: technology creates inequality; which raises the share of low-wage, low-skill jobs; which are most likely to be replaced by technology. 



















 Your first questions you can easily answer with a few searches, so I'll attempt to tackle the last. 

How long will global warming continue if we stop carbon pollution today? The answer is generally [a few centuries](http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/03/how-long-will-global-warming-last/), but no one really knows because we don't fully understand the role of feedbacks that may continue to release carbon from natural stores like forests, peatlands, tundra and seafloor methane hydrates. Based on paleoclimate data, there appear to be tipping points at which these feedbacks could even accelerate warming into a runaway excursion that may take millennia to subside, but, again, we don't know where those tipping points are, hence the global agreement that 2C warming is the most we can reasonably, somewhat safely tolerate (and many leading lights warn even that is too risky). 









 The researchers aren't saying that solar is the only solution, but merely an important one. 




 No, there are ample reasons for Oz's high prices beyond minimum wages. From the viewpoint of a fond visitor to your topless shores, you get the best of both worlds: high economic growth plus a distinct lack of despondency and desperation. 




 Beer is cheaper in the States as well, thank God. Still, the median Australian wage is far higher than the American, and your high minimum wage must have at least a little to do with that. 
 




 Visit museums, and spring for a guided or audio tour. Nearly every country has a good museum or two that showcases its ancient art, culture and history. You won't get the whole story, but you'll gain some understanding of the area's roots. 





























 Vote. And organize to overcome the political power of global fossil fuel money. Individual changes among rich-country citizens in energy use, meat consumption and reproduction are valuable, but they don't begin to  substitute for the force of law to reduce and then ban fossil fuels worldwide, which is what every national scientific academy on Earth says we must do within our lifetime.

Even as oil rallies back above $60 a barrel, obituaries are being drafted. Oil majors face questions from shareholders concerned the threat of climate change means some of the reserves underpinning the companies will never be produced. In a recent report, HSBC urged investors to plan for this risk of stranded assets.

The risk is realand doesnt just boil down to efforts to curb climate change.

One warning: Saudi Arabias decision to keep pumping despite the drop in oil prices. Apart from taking market share back from higher-cost rivals, the countrys oil minister has indicated concern about long-term demand in the face of technological and regulatory threats.

Almost 1,400 climate policies had been enacted globally by 2013, according to the International Energy Agency, up from less than 200 in 2005. Meanwhile, although electric vehicles remain a tiny part of the global car market, they have grown phenomenally from virtually zero only five years ago.

One argument against such concerns is that oil-company valuations largely reflect the value of proven oil-and-gas reserves, likely to be produced before any serious disruptions happen.

Such thinking only holds, though, if you assume future cash flows will be distributed rather than reinvested. That is plainly not the industrys way. In the past decade, Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron collectively reinvested 66% of operating cash flow, according to data from S P Capital IQ; buybacks and dividends equated to just 46%. Reporting first-quarter numbers last week, Exxon and Shell barely covered capital expenditure with cash from operations while Chevrons free cash flow was sharply negative.

In addition, more than half the last decades capital expenditure was spent post-2010. While producers test project economics under different scenarios, much of that investment was made at a time of triple-digit prices and the sector was clearly blindsided by oils collapse.

The dynamics of this drop, coming amid a massive investment boom, bring the threat of stranded assets much closer to today. Surveying 37 large oil companies, Citigroup estimates as much as 40% of the current investment cycleabout $1.4 trillionmay have gone into or be going into projects that struggle to generate acceptable returns at oil prices below $75 a barrel. Oil sands and liquefied natural gas projectswhich require large upfront investments and long schedules before generating positive cash flowslook especially exposed. Right now, Brent crude futures for the next five years average about $74 a barrel.

Ultimately, the mismatch between those prices and project economics set up another cycle of investment falling, supply tightening, and prices rising again. But in this cycle, there are two added risks.

First, the shale boom, which helped generate the excess supply weighing on prices today, represents a deflationary force. Productivity gains have reduced break-even prices for U.S. oil output, making some shale basins more competitive than traditional sources such as the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea and Russia. And the recent rally on signs of U.S. production flattening out also enables exploration and production firms to finance future drilling.

Second, Saudi Arabias decision to prioritize market share is also deflationary. If Riyadh is genuinely worried about increasing regulatory and technological curbs on long-term oil demand, it has an incentive to keep pumping at high rates. Cheaper oil helps to deter or delay efforts to limit consumption. More important, if you produce a commodity and suspect its days may be numbered, then it is far better to get as much out of the ground now rather than wait.

This is the dilemma in which Big Oil finds itself. Having sunk billions into the ground in recent years, several majors are banking on a rebound to triple-digit oil soon. Such an outcome would offer relief initially. But it would also enable rival supply from shale producers with much shorter production cycles and spur greater efforts to make Saudi Arabias deepest fear a reality. Oil demand doesnt have to disappear altogether to leave a producer with stranded assets; they can just be sitting on uncompetitive ones. 





























 Big Oils Disruptive Climate Change: Oil majors face a real risk of stranded assetsand not just related to efforts to limit carbon emissions.

 Sorry, I'm only falsely sweet. 




 Naomi Oreskes nails it again. 




 Or automation's owners could just cut rich-country consumers out of the economic loop, selling to the rising middle class in more populous poor countries instead, while fomenting bitter political divisiveness among rich-country voters in order to neutralize their ability to interfere. 














 The difference would be that no one is *paid* to espouse atheism, but every one of these whores depends on the fossil fuel industry to keep them in office. 



















 Wha...? The last time atmospheric CO2 exceeded 1000 ppm, 56 million years ago during the [Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaleoceneEocene_Thermal_Maximum), the climate cooked by 6C and species changed dramatically, including a mass extinction in the oceans. Sea levels rose hundreds of feet, the oceans turned acidic and semi-putrid, storms were horrendous. And that was during a warming that occurred over tens of thousands of years, when life had time to adapt. Today, we are on our way to reproducing these effects many, many times faster. 
























 [Extremely unlikely.](http://www.epa.gov/climatestudents/documents/temp-and-co2.pdf) (See table on p.8.) 




  There are many degrees and related jobs that don't make enough money to warrant spending 10's of thousands or even $100k on a degree. That's why we've seen so many stories of Liberal Arts degreed people ending up working in low paying jobs

Agreed, a diploma is no guarantee of a career, but most smart young Americans of middling means reasonably see their choices as: A) A costly degree that *probably* leads to a good job and social status; B) Military service that *certainly* means personal debasement, physical hardship and celebration of violence, or C) A long struggle in limbo as a low-wage earner trying to train for something--anything--better. Given that choice, should we be surprised that most at least try to choose Option A? 




  We've beating it into people that you need to go to college to make a decent living. 

In the US, one *does* need to go to college to make a decent living. That's the driver here. The cry for public assistance follows. I admit, it's a chicken-or-egg problem, but the root cause has to be the undeniable *need* for a diploma to get most middle class jobs now.

 Trade schools and apprenticeships are good too.

Rarely. The US lacks three things that other nations depend upon to educate most workers: 1) Free, high-quality, universal trade schooling that begins in high school and continues beyond; 2) A dependable track to employment for trade school grads; 3) Job security and benefits for skilled labor.

For all intents and purposes, the US military is the nation's technical school, but it's a poor one, never mind the outrageous inequity of telling the poorer half of young people to go dodge IEDs in occupied countries if they ever want a decent job. 


































 Great comments from others here. I'll just add that I think it unlikely that future tax changes are much of a threat. Installing more solar is a state, national and global priority that will only grow stronger, and California has a huge number of existing solar customers who won't stand for being reamed. 














 Nothing new here. Let's face it: religion itself has been the leading cause of tribalism and violence since humans emerged from Africa, exterminating long-established populations of Neanderthals, Denisovans and likely other near-human strains across Eurasia. Every effort to move beyond that bloody history runs into yet another backward band of tribal, religious agitators. 
























 That's because the political party that's been running the country for most of the past forty years--the Republicans--may as well call themselves the "Cheap Gasoline Party". It's part of how they buy the loyalty of their rural/suburban base.  




 NYC may be the greenest central city, but it actually ranks number four among American metro areas for lowest per capita carbon emissions, although metrics are tricky, as [this list](http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0530-footprint.html) shows. 

Not surprising to see Honolulu number one, due to its density as well as its low needs for heating and cooling buildings.  




 I generally go with the experts on issues with cost/benefit analyses this complicated, and [here](http://thebreakthrough.org/index.php/programs/energy-and-climate/top-climate-scientists-urge-support-of-nuclear-power) is what many of the world's leading climate scientists are saying: we cannot dependably solve the climate mess fast enough without nuclear power as part of the solution.

 Think of it this way instead: 80% of Americans are not hardcore climate deniers, and at least occasionally listen to reason. If you had told me twenty years ago that the US would now have a black president, with most states legalizing gay marriage and several legalizing weed, I would have called you crazy, yet here we are. 




 And this is what makes arguing with an entrenched cynic like *you* pointless. Even your example table shows the nat gas share of generation slumping over the next two decades while renewables increase. This is from the highly conservative, fossil fueled EIA.

As for their longer-term contention that fossil fuel use--especially coal--will remain steady into midcentury, fuggedaboudit. Climate reality is biting us all, even the carbon bureaucrats at the EIA.  




 A country? Four countries, actually. Some would say five or six. 




 In other news, Republican politicians are [nine times](http://grist.org/politics/heres-why-the-gop-just-loves-fossil-fuels/) *more* likely to accept campaign money from fossil fuel companies.  




 I discovered a wonderful cure for that feeling: fight the fuckers. The more they hurt, the better I feel. 




 Very old news.

Still, I can hardly wait until they repeal the law of gravity so I can finally get my flying car. 




 "Coal and natural gas (both fossil fuels) are just as important in power generation in 2015 as they ever have been"

[Check again.](http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/steo/images/Fig25.png) Coal has fallen from 55% of total US generation to 36% today, and it's now dropping faster. Gas picked up most of the slack, but its share is forecast by the EIA to begin dropping now as renewables take up more of the total. Nuclear's share will grow soon after.

One needn't be a starry-eyed idealist to realize that when the entire world scientific community unites to warn that all fossil fuel burning must end within our lifetimes, that inevitably means trouble for fossil fuel companies.  




 Again, the point is not that solar and wind are wonderful investments but that coal is death itself. If you had invested in BTU, the largest US coal supplier, four years ago and held on, you would have lost roughly 90% of that money, including a 4.65% collapse today.  




 And where did those four chains come from? From underdog status, of course. 

This reminds me of those who said the US grocery market would soon be a Walmart monopsony. Didn't turn out that way at all.  




 Because shorting is a matter of choosing a narrow window of time, and fossil fuel prices will continue to wildly fluctuate while trending downward. Pick the wrong time period and you're screwed.

The MSCI and Aperio studies merely show that a slight but steady delta is opening, suggesting that just generally avoiding fossil fuel companies is profitable in itself, not to mention more morally conscionable.  




 Okay, but how many Americans actually *view* climate as a moral issue? How many Republicans do?  




 Air leakage is a biggie. Energy loss through windows, doors and roofs is another. Both are easily measured. Pressure tests can quantify air leakage, while heat imaging can pinpoint energy loss trouble points. 

Any firm that does building energy audits should be able to handle this.  




  They'll be the ones buying up renewable firms/developing their own renewables once it becomes profitable to do so. 

The few oilcos that tried diversifying into renewable energy have all backed away, often after locking up patents that could threaten their core business. 

Coal is now a dead man walking, and oil is next. That doesn't mean that overweighting solar is smart; it merely means that staying with fossil fuels is stupid (not to mention destructive). 




 It's all good. Very sound and solid.  




 Do you realize how many older investors in this sub *wish* they could have had $10-20K to invest in stocks at age 25? Don't wait. 

Also, don't forget foreign indexes. Be bold with 20% of your money, putting it into a hot sector fund that backs useful, growing industries (biotech, renewable energy, internet, etc.). If you can, avoid fossil fuels; they are a drag on the wider indexes, and will only become more so. 







































 Oddly enough, Worstall reaffirms Piketty here: the postwar 1920s, 1950s and 1960s (two wars, remember) strongly appear to be anomalies that interrupted the normal trend towards concentration of wealth and slowing growth in richer countries. Nothing disrupts norms like "blowing stuff up". 
























 "the Four Corners are in the San Juan Basin, the most productive basin for natural-gas production from coal in North America. Some 60,000 wells are at work there extracting methane from coal. 

Just a coincidence, no doubt. 




 Quick thoughts...

Insulation and window retrofits are very effective in most areas, although not cheap. Electricity efficiency may or may not be the most effective way to reduce emissions, depending on where your local power comes from and what your costs are (if you can save high dollars while reducing emissions, approvals are much easier). Recycling is a biggie anywhere, saving about 6% of carbon emissions nationally. Encourage kids and staff to walk or bike to school, and push for safe routes to do so.  




 "Along with the sage grouse provision, the bill would legislatively delist wolves in the Great Lakes and Wyoming and would limit the government's ability to regulate ivory and the use of lead in ammunition and fishing tackle.

So pandering to a few miners and ranchers, plus rural duck hunters who want their lead shot and ivory-inlaid shotguns.
 



















 TL;DR: It's all about TV.

Even of the 10% going to "digital advertising"--the second-largest category after television--a large amount is simply fundraising appeals to build the TV ad budget. Same goes for "events".

 




 "The measure provides $7.5 billion for the EPA, an estimated $717 million or 9 percent cut from its current appropriation."

 FutureGen is not a company; this was the long, multi-billion-dollar US government attempt to make CCS economical. Similar attempts at CCS have failed in other countries. 




 Yeah, this is a baby step, but we can be sure it won't be the last step. The mere fact that they've agreed on the need to quit fossil fuels, with most of that by 2050, is quite a landmark, don't you think?  




 From here on, we can be sure of one thing: no one who matters will ignore or deny the climate mess as they have done. But CCS has been an unmitigated failure, and not for lack of trying. [FutureGen](http://www.statejournal.com/story/28085707/futuregen-20-a-unique-clean-coal-failure) has failed--twice--and has now been cancelled again. The brutal fact is that CCS was never anything more than a sop to coal-dependent states, most of which also happen to be important political swing states (KY, OH, VA, WV, TN, NC, CO, MT, NM). Burying cubic miles of CO2 at high pressure in hundreds of sites, without possibility of any leaks forever, is simply impractical. It's just much cheaper to switch to cleaner energy and better energy efficiency. 




 Global environmental agreements can also work well, as Montreal proved. 



















 And how does one do that while continuing to burn fossil fuels? CCS shows no promise of ever becoming close to economical at scale.

 Some progress is better than none, and this is definitely not the last time we'll see world leaders stepping up their action on the climate mess. Stay tuned. 




 Not really. We already have four times more in known reserves than we can burn. 




 A false choice. SA can screw Iran, Russia and the US shale industry while also liquidating assets that will soon lose their value. 



























































 After everybody in the current G7 are dead. Convenient.

You do realize that it'll take a lifetime to phase out carbon fuels, right? I'm a fanatic about doing this, but even I realize that it requires several decades. The G7 leaders are talking about 70% emissions reductions by 2050, which is nothing short of impressive. 




 No. We actually have around four times more in present reserves than we can burn. 


































 Unfortunately, he will provide political cover to somewhat lesser whores to the fossil fuel industry such as Bush, Santorum and Cruz.

 Good points in other comments here, but don't lump "renewables" together if you want a good answer. Remember that the largest renewable energy source today is hydropower, which is definitely limited by the "extraction", so to speak, of a very finite number of suitable dam sites. Wind and biomass are also limited by available site constraints. Solar is not much limited by those, and will be even less limited as its efficiencies continue to improve. 




 Think again. The large majority of fossil fuel subsidies are [*consumption* subsidies](https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E3QQGObK-7eJPpXn3R5RR2MzUvM=/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3355188/Screen_Shot_2015-01-29_at_12.34.26_PM.0.png) - handouts to make oil, gas and coal cheap - and most are outside North America and Europe.

And those are just the direct taxpayer handouts. The *indirect* handouts to build fossil fueled infrastructure, to defend fossil fuel production regions and transport routes, and to deal with the health and environmental costs of pollution, are in the trillions per year. For example, [this recent analysis](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fossil-fuel-subsidies-cost-5-trillion-annually-and-worsen-pollution/?) quantifies only a portion of it, without considering the infrastructure and military costs. Roughly speaking, we spend 5-10% of the world economy to prop up the fossil fuel business.

That is the real cost of our addiction. The drug dealer analogy is a great one. 




 corporate tax incidence falls mostly on labor 

Again, that sounds suspiciously close to dodging the issue, which, again, is the fact that *much or most* of corporate taxes fall on shareholders, so, even if 51% of the burden falls on labor--which it probably does not--any corporate tax cut still disproportionately benefits major owners of capital.

Is corporate tax incidence controversial and debatable? Of course. But there is little doubt that it would take a very progressive tax hike elsewhere to offset a major slash of corporate tax, preventing a shift of tax burdens from rich to middle and lower classes.

 




 Well, it would be if drug dealers received $550 billion per year in taxpayer handouts, then spent some of that largesse on propaganda to convince us that drug addiction is beautiful and patriotic. 




  Less capital intensive firms have a higher labor incidence, even if you use the Harberger model.

Yet the trend is towards greater capital intensity, and has been since before Harberger.

We don't tax stock, we tax the income gained from holding stock.

We are discussing corporate income tax, which is an indirect tax on shareholder returns.

it would shift burden from low   middle income individuals to high income individuals. 

Only if shareholders bear little or no part of the corporate tax burden, yet they bear much or most of it. Any tax cut for them is paid by someone farther down the food chain. 




  Most of the corporate tax incidence is already on non-supervisory labor.

For Walmart, yes. For Facebook, definitely not. The future will bring more companies like the latter. And there is no question (Harberger, etc.) that shareholders generally bear *much* of the corporate tax burden if not most of it.

The reduction in net distortionary costs is large enough that a fairly small increase in the top rate of income taxation would be sufficient 

Except that the issue here is taxing wealth, not income. Shares are wealth. Substituting top-bracket personal income taxes for corporate taxes would simply shift burdens from the elite to the upper middle class. 




 Utrecht has a population of 331,000; Nantes has 283,000. That's not much larger than bike-friendly US cities like Madison, WI, with about 245,000.

In the States, the [most bike-friendly cities](http://guide.bicycling.com/ride-maps/featured-rides/2014-americas-best-bike-cities) tend to be larger university towns. Seems odd that none made the list.
 














 Sure, but those systems began as means to create larger tax bases, not as ways to shift burdens from rich to poor. Very different, that. 




 True, which is why none of these companies are American. BTW, ALEC *is* the Kochs. 




 Perhaps, but beware the means to that end. Do you think the US, for example, would readily embrace a wealth tax, or large raises in cap gains or estate taxes, to replace the corporate income tax? If not, abandoning the corporate income tax would simply shift still more tax burdens onto the middle and lower classes. Try that and you'd quickly see just how fast a strong political left can rise in this country.
 



















 Nice answer. Interesting that you should mention Suncor, however, which is conspicuously absent in this group--along with all the US majors and the worldwide nationals. 




 We agree! Hysteria serves no purpose. However, healthy concern does, and that was what led to the successful cleanup of rivers, to the Clean Air Act, to the Montreal Protocol. 

Now we have a far larger challenge before us, with much harsher penalties for inaction. Yet, as you may have noticed, a third of the population and half of our leaders insist that it is no problem at all. How do we motivate them without pointing to the dire consequences of this?  




 No, but the issue here is Federal subsidies and mandates, which only apply to US crops. 




 Encouraging palm oil is not an issue in the US, but oilseeds such as camelina are. They rotate well with other crops, especially dryland grains. 









 Okay, corn-based ethanol didn't work out and should be retired. However, biodiesel definitely does work, often without displacing food crops, and it accounts for nearly 20% of biofuel production. It's worth keeping that baby while tossing out the ethanol bathwater. 



















 It's Rupert Murdoch's WSJ. I'm surprised they didn't add horns to Kerry's helmet. 




 Precisely why conservatives so often want to leave decisions to the states and counties. Lower-level representatives are more easily bribed. Media oversight is poor. The poor are more easily ignored.  




 Mark Lynas, is that really you? If so, thanks for "Six Degrees"! 




 Imagine the cost savings if America returned IRS funding to operable levels in order to catch more tax cheats.  




 What is more political than the distribution of money and rewards? If anything confuses me, it's economists insisting that this discipline exists in a plane far above politics. 




 Precisely. Reminds me of a Tea Party-infested town hall meeting I once endured in a moribund, small, Western city, where all proposed economic solutions came back to the way tax cuts would supposedly attract major businesses because land was already cheap (because no one wanted to live there). Meanwhile, no one seemed aware that the area's largest employers were the Federal and state governments.

Brownback-style grandstanding definitely serves the short-term interests of those who sit at the top of the tight local hierarchy. They may talk about bringing the world to Kansas, but they are really much
more focused on keeping the world away, to remain the biggest fish in the pond. 




 Then again, God doesn't keep Inhofe in office. Oil money does. 




 "So, why are the Texas Three trying to cut funding to such a vital field?...they have chosen to punish the field that brought climate change to light and stifle future research in the discipline so they can sweep the study of the Earth under the rug (or just try to erase it from the record). They want to cast this as fiscal responsibility and prioritizing sciences but read it as it really is: political games that threaten the country and the planet.

Uh, they're from Texas, remember? They are bankrolled by the fossil fuel industry, which gives 85-90% of its political money to Repubs, with a bonus for *Texas* Repubs. They aren't playing games. To say they are whoring is an insult to whores, who don't endanger the lives of millions. 




 Time to face the fact that CCS was never anything more than a political boondoggle to keep U.S. coal states in the fold?

Ever notice that most coal-dependent states just happen to also be the most critical electoral swing states: Kentucky, Colorado, West Virginia, Virginia, Tennessee, Montana, Ohio? 




 There's only one solution for this asshole: death by snowballs. 




 That's false equivalency. Cleaning up some rivers and smog decades ago doesn't reduce the urgency of the climate mess now. I'm optimistic that we'll solve this before catastrophe and warfare break out, but there's a significant and growing chance that we won't.  









 Jeb will *never* shake off that monkey on his back.  




 Considering that the world's largest industry consistently gives 85-90% of its U.S. political money to Republicans, we can easily replace "GOP" with "fossil fuels" in this headline. 














 Our Saudi friends are hogging all the suicide missions against us? It may take me some time to get my head around this. 




 ARGO data is both relatively new and decidedly sketchy, not only because the ARGO float fleet was smallish until recently, but also because the mechanics of the floats' measuring devices were imperfect. To further confuse the matter, some studies have lumped ARGO measurements together with the old bathymetric data that was even less reliable, demonstrably erring on the warm side. That created the likely false appearance of a flat or even cooling trend.

http://www.skepticalscience.com/cooling-oceans.htm 




 A RICO suit against the fossil fuel industry and its allies? Yeah, it'll probably come to that, and the bastards at Exxon, Koch, Chevron, Peabody et al have been fully aware of it for years. But this will make the Big Tobacco suit look like a picnic. 




 Leave it to the Globe And Mail to shill once more for the Canadian fossil fuels biz. 




 Chris Mooney nails it again. And what a chart!

Who knew that Jehovah's Witnesses, who almost totally reject evolution, are among the more supportive of environmental regulation? 

  




 Your family member is simply reading to buttress his motivated reasoning, cherry-picking whatever data supports his preconceptions. He is [very far off](http://www.climatecentral.org/news/global-warming-ocean-heat-18905) with his statements about lack of excess warming in the oceans. 

However, you won't change his mind, because his objections are entirely political, not scientific. (First clue: rants about "warmists".) Would this family member be politically and/or religiously conservative, by any chance?  









 Another way to look at this is to ask what we are *not* investing in, and why. That's often a better question in that most stock investors hold a broad basket of stocks, so it's the missing pieces that are most telling.

For me, the largest missing chunks are:

 Energy: all energy stocks are in for a long, rough ride as carbon regs loom and low-cost oil producers like the Saudis liquidate their assets while they can. That will continue for decades. Meanwhile, coal is a dead man walking, shale gas is coming under growing scrutiny for both methane leaks and groundwater pollution, and all energy sources--even renewables--are being whacked by the oil liquidators. 

 Banks: more regulation, higher reserve requirements, and a global abundance of capital with nowhere to go.

 Tobacco: nasty business with little upside. 


 







































 I think you're on to the core issue: many of the world's young now identify as members of the global community at least as much as they identify as part of a given nation, tribe or religious sect. That's especially true in wealthier countries.

Chalk it up to globalization, pervasive electronic media, the spread of English, the advance of science, and the long worldwide outbreak of peace and prosperity. 




 Studies (Haidt, etc.) suggest they are acting more from fear and tribal loyalty. Cultural conservatives in many cultures tend to recoil from scary stimuli and violations of social norms. There is actually [strong evidence](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2011/09/07/your-brain-on-politics-the-cognitive-neuroscience-of-liberals-and-conservatives/#.VWinSGCkJG4) that this is linked to differences in brain structure itself. 
























 Not much different from previous generations. Except that they had employer pensions to cover retirement. 
 




 "The study also notes an 'increasing acknowledgment that religion is not consistent with scientific understanding' could be driving adolescents away from religion." 

Bingo. The author could have gone straight to this without all the bogus speculation about selfish social atomization. 

And the time period studied is also more than a little suspect. The U.S. went through a major religious revival in the early 1950s, so using that as a starting point will show a decline in religiosity in *any* subsequent decade. 














 Renewables are already profitable. See: FirstSolar, Sunpower, Tesla, Vestas, etc.. Most of those stocks have outperformed Exxon over the past three years.

Exxon has repeatedly vowed to stay out of renewables because, unlike tobacco companies buying pot businesses, renewables do not *complement* oil and gas; they directly compete with it. 




 Yes. Basalt floods, large meteor impacts and Milankovitch cycles (the Earth's orbital cycles that drive ice ages). But we understand the latter very well, and our species hasn't been around long enough to experience either of the former two. 




 Is a Google search too difficult? 

http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/science/indicators/weather-climate/heavy-precip.html 




 Notice that Goddard does not cite his graph's source. It completely contradicts those from [The National Climate Assessment](http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/our-changing-climate/heavy-downpours-increasing) and [NOAA](http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/science/indicators/weather-climate/heavy-precip.html). (That NOAA page was down so I linked an EPA page showing the NOAA data.) 

Unsurprising. Despite no background in science, Goddard/Heller is a regular with fossil fuel front groups Heartland Institute and the Science   Public Policy Institute. 




 Yeah, and those renewables will eat *Exxon's* revenue stream, so Exxon works to keep them down. 




 We have met the enemy. 




 Bias? In ranked lists of city rainfall stats?  



















 skepticalscience.com has most of what you seek. 




 It's Texas. They're clinging to the fossil fuels industry that defines the whole state and its sprawling, gas-guzzling ideal. 




 Of course, because the economy's size and complexity aren't increasing at all. 




 "This doesn't work. At the very least it destroys your EROEI, forcing you to extract more and lower EROEI carbon. 

Hey, it sure works if you're an oil exec desperate for a climate solution that brings you still more subsidies. 




 Unfortunately, this is just a pivot from denying the climate problem to insisting that the best way to solve it is to spend an ungodly fortune burying fossil fuel exhaust, handing yet another massive taxpayer subsidy to oil and coal companies. The much, much cheaper solution is to outlaw fossil fuels, but that would also outlaw Shell, which, like nearly all other fossil fuel companies, has dropped any serious effort to develop competing energy sources because those would cannibalize their core business lines.

 Yeah, but Repubs had more *room* to move to the extreme due to the unfair and increasingly antique extra voting power allowed to rural areas and sparsely populated states, which have become more conservative as the educated and secular young have moved to the cities.  




 Okay, it's 90% Republicans who are guilty of this. And the fossil fuel industry gives 90% of its political money to Republicans; what a coincidence. 














 Thanks, although I see that free-marketeer downvoters have already passed judgement on the headline alone. Figures.

The article does seem far-fetched, but I love the peacock tail analogy, and it's likely that competition will continue to dominate economics for that reason: the selfish desire to dominate rivals and attract higher-value sexual partners won't vanish from the human species anytime soon, and financial striving is the main proxy for both desires, so competition will always edge out cooperation until our descendants devise a way to better themselves (which they or their machine creations probably will, but not in my time).

 "Okay, I admit that I'm trashing the climate, endangering millions of lives and heaping trillions in costs on your grandchildren, but you'll have to pay me plenty to stop." 














 *If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it. The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the State.*

Substitute "political party" for "State" in the above, and it appears that not much has changed since Goebbels' day. 




 Bingo. Republican Party leaders aren't *blinded by* echo chambers; they *use* echo chambers to keep the rank-and-file blind. The leadership is all too aware of how real the climate mess is, and what a threat solving it poses to their oil and coal industry sugar daddies. They simply play dumb while knowingly screwing the world's poor and vulnerable. 




 Well, you've partly answered your own question, in that you've identified temperature as something other than atmospheric CO2 that has a long trail of ancient evidence. Is your friend familiar with things like the fossil record?

As for temperature trends since the 1850s, the slope of the rise has been [steadily steepening](http://jennifermarohasy.com//wp-content/uploads/2009/06/hammer-graph-4-us-temps.jpg) (with some "noise" along the way). And temps now have likely exceeded the heights of the past 10,000 years, which is particularly striking because until now, the trend has been towards [steady but gentle *cooling*](http://www.skepticalscience.com//pics/Holocene_Temperature_Variations_Marcott_500.png) over the past 8,000 years. 




 Your friend is hugely ignorant of the facts on this one. There is abundant and reinforcing climate data that extends far beyond recorded history. Air bubbles trapped in 600,000-year old ice; fossilized coral growth rings and tree growth rings; fossils that reveal varying distributions of climate-sensitive species over many millions of years; ancient plant stomata; populations of benthic forams, etc.. 




 In the US, gas taxes pay for less than half of road construction and maintenance. General fund taxes pay about the same share and taxpayer-funded bonds pay nearly all the rest.

The trucking industry is the real freeloader here. Trucks do more than 90% of road damage yet pay only 30% of fuel taxes and a much smaller share of other taxes. 














 Just another attack on cyclists by conservatives.

First, most road taxes are paid by general funds and bonds, not gas taxes, so drivers have *no* special right to the road.

Second, trucks account for more than 90% of road wear yet pay only 30% of fuel taxes, so *they* are the freeloaders here to the tune of $50-60 billion per year nationwide.

Third, cars and trucks contribute to the climate crisis while cyclists help solve it. 

Etcetera. But logic has nothing to do with this finger to cyclists.   




 The difference: we need farmers. 




 Goodbye television? Uh, no.

 Among other things, staying within 1.5C is possible only if rich countries will pay poor countries to do it. And why shouldn't we? We, our parents and grandparents caused most of this problem, and we each still pollute at many times the rate of the world's poor. Yet we cannot even meet our promises to fund the measly $100 billion Green Climate Fund, which is the only substantial step taken to date. 









 http://citizensclimatelobby.org

http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/ 




 Not really. The difference between fossil fuel pollution costs and externalities from other industries is that the former have been extensively studied and quantified. This IMF paper simply draws upon those many refereed foundations.  














 Unfortunately, I doubt that polite appeals will move rich countries to keep their promises.

 He says that 97% of publishing climate scientists don't know what they're talking about, and then he accuses *them* of intellectual arrogance?

 Wrist-slap fines, and no one has gone to jail. 




 "Ninety-seven percent of climate scientists agree that human activity has led to climate change. Ninety-seven percent. But Jeb Bush thinks they're wrong. Who's being intellectually arrogant now?" said Holly Shulman, DNC spokeswoman. 



















 "Hypothetical costs"?  




 I admit that including traffic accidents seems a stretch, but that's a very small share of the total cost, and the rest is quite well documented. 




 True enough, but I doubt that changing the source of taxes would influence the sprawl problem one way or the other. However, paying from general funds *would* eliminate one of our most regressive taxes, and it would also kill the bad but pervasive argument that bicycles have no right to the roads because they pay no gas tax. 



















 http://www.energypost.eu/historic-moment-saudi-arabia-sees-end-oil-age-coming-opens-valves-carbon-bubble/ 




 That, and the unpalatable fact that smolders at the heart of the disconnect between rich and poor countries...

...namely, that we richies put nearly all of the excess CO2 into the air, profited from it, and each of us still pollutes at 4-20 times the rate of those in developing countries, so people in those poor countries will continue to pollute until we pay them not to. And try selling *that* to your Tea Party neighbors. 




 Oil prices likely won't recover. Low-cost oil nations are dumping their product while they can, before carbon pollution regs kick in. SA alone has decades of production left in major fields like Ghawar, meaning that they'll keep pumping until the world says they can't. 




 "Warning shots". Good one. On the same night of August 2, the US launched: 1) a commando landing in North Vietnam, which resulted in a firefight; 2) a CIA bombing raid on North Vietnam; and, 3) a US ship incursion far into North Vietnamese territorial waters, firing on North Vietnamese boats when challenged.  




 How about we just pay for roads the way most countries do, through general funds, or triple taxes on the trucking companies that cause more than 90% of road damage while paying only 30% of fuel taxes? 




 Vietnam has not "admitted they initiated the attack on the Maddox" on August 2, and there remains abundant dispute on this point.

US Defense Secretary McNamara himself later admitted that the second "attack", on August 4, never happened.

However, there is no dispute that North Vietnam claimed a 12 mile territorial limit, in line with South Vietnam's claim, the former French claim (20km) and the claims of most nations at the time, including the United States. Yet the Maddox was ordered to within *four miles* of the North Vietnamese coast on August 2, and may have gone closer still. And this was at the same approximate time as a botched US commando landing on North Vietnam's coast *and* CIA bombing of eastern North Vietnam, from bases in Thailand. All that is "legal monitoring"? No, it is not. These are acts of war, they were all conducted in concert and in secret, and the result was a giant lie and millions dead. George Ball also admitted as much. Face it: the only justification for the Vietnam War was the U.S. desire to swing a big dick, which failed miserably. You'd think we'd have learned something from that. 




 "It's estimated that a further increase in sea level of one foot - just one foot - by the end of this century could cost our nation $200 billion," Obama will say.

Unfortunately, the consensus estimate for sea level rise this century is at least double that, with a strong possibility of being much higher still, and the financial damages of higher levels are exponential, not linear. And let's not forget that the last time the Earth had 400 ppm CO2, as it now does thanks to us, sea levels rose to around *65 feet* higher than today. 




 More like provocation, sailing into Vietnamese territorial waters and back out again to draw fire. There is *no* evidence that the Vietnamese attacked first. 

Sure, that was worth [millions dead](http://thevietnamwar.info/how-many-people-died-in-the-vietnam-war/) and an indelible stain on American honor. 




  Um both are distorting markets though.

Yeah, but, as the article says, renewable energy subsidies distort markets in order to *solve* a gigantic global problem while fossil fuel subsidies distort markets while making that problem worse. Bit of a difference there, but one should never let facts disrupt a good false equivalency. 




 They might. But in this hypothetical, Myanmar is a strong military dictatorship, so its neighbors might decide a few dying forests aren't worth a war. And most of the countries impacted by its climate engineering are at a considerable distance.

 Canadians are the [world's third-worst polluters](http://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/blog-uploads/2012/11/list-countries-co2-per-capita.png), after Australians and Americans. 

Electrical generation isn't Canada's primary pollution issue; transportation and farming are. 




 It's only the "fuel" in "fossil fuels" that we're worried about. That means cheaper feedstock for the plastics biz. 




 And so it would. The oil industry is highly automated, using infrastructure built long ago. Clean energy requires far more labor per unit of capital, mostly due to the need to build out systems. 




 [Relevant.](http://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/blog-uploads/2012/11/list-countries-co2-per-capita.png) 









 I agree, but wildly inflating statistics sure doesn't help the argument. 









 Well, that and the facts that governments can control the value of their own currencies, and that those values are always relative to other currencies. 




 That's not limited to the south. Drive just thirty minutes out of most U.S. cities and you start hearing the same. 




 This article exaggerates. The IPCC says that agriculture accounts for 12 percent of global carbon emissions; this article says "18 - 51 percent for livestock alone," citing a single, isolated study for the low end of that range and nothing credible for the high end. 

Crazy talk. 




 The report is limited to easily quantifiable US impacts. Globally, most of the damage will be sustained by countries in warmer latitudes, and the forecasted costs are well into the many trillions. 




 High altitude jets are problematic no matter what, due to the radiative forcing of the contrails they produce, which generally doubles the harm of burning fossil fuels in flight. I see a future of lower, slower aircraft. 




 [Cumulative emissions](http://www.theenergycollective.com/sites/theenergycollective.com/files/imagepicker/141834/acumulado1960-2010.jpg) matter just as much, and we'll never come to effective global agreement on decarbonization without considering them.  




 Sulfide seeding would vastly accelerate the already-catastrophic acidifying of the oceans, and would destroy forests and crops with acid rain. Not a good idea. 




 That's politics talking, not data. Even the least impoverished, least corrupt US cities suffer far more violence than other rich world counterparts. At least one famous study comparing Seattle with Vancouver BC demonstrates exactly that. 

Sure, poverty and inequality make it worse, but the U.S. Is a rich North American nation with a South American gun violence rate. 




 "Before the older laws"? Britain's tighter gun laws began in 1903 and were tightened much further throughout the 1920s and 1930s, then repeatedly again ever since. Handguns have been hard to get for many decades, which correlates with declining homicide rates. An interesting comparison is with Japan, where handguns were still in wide circulation after World War Two, and where homicide rates were nearly as high as in the US, and several times higher than in Britain--until the Japanese banned handguns and homicide rates plunged to near British levels.

 The CDC's mandate includes reducing injuries. 




 From its Wikipedia:

"The CDC's main goal is to protect public health and safety through the control and prevention of disease, injury, and disability. The CDC focuses national attention on developing and applying disease control and prevention. It especially focuses its attention on infectious disease, food borne pathogens, environmental health, occupational safety and health, health promotion, injury prevention and educational activities designed to improve the health of United States citizens." 




  How to you protect yourself when only law enforcement (and criminals) are armed?

I dunno. Ask anyone from any other rich country.
 




 The UK already had extremely tight gun laws *before* the ban, so the effect of tightening the laws just a little further was small. Even in loosely regulated countries, tightened gun laws generally take decades to reduce violence due to the simple durability of guns themselves.  




 Wait, 34,000 Americans die by gunshot each year, versus a handful in all other rich countries, yet our national health research center can't even *look* into reasons why? Good God. 




 Given that wealthy countries are responsible for most of the historical carbon emissions that have warmed the climate so far, yet most of the health impacts of those emissions are being felt in poor countries, how do you see the rich and poor worlds deciding who pays for these impacts? 




 This is where the climate issue will resolve: in the courts. We can look forward to massive punitive damages for the fossil fuels companies that have knowingly endangered the world, but we'll also get ham-handed, court-mandated "solutions" that will cost far more than they should and hurt more people than they need to.

If ever there were a good argument for heavy carbon taxation right now, this is it.

 FDR didn't have to unite whites, blacks and Hispanics to create his New Deal coalition. Bernie does. And, so far, Bernie's rallies are noticeably whiter than Hillary's.

 However, the Confederate battle flag was largely forgotten in the South until its [resurgence as a symbol of white supremacy](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/06/150626-confederate-flag-civil-rights-movement-war-history/) as the civil rights movement gained traction after World War Two. That's an entirely different kind of "Southern pride". 




 The savings in passive design come in HVAC, usually beginning with a sub foundation geothermal loop and heat exchanger. You'll also need a PHIUS certified builder and possibly a similarly certified architect. 




 If passive design is your analogy, nuclear is bargain! Passive building construction is now as cheap as code-built. 




 You can also include [southwestern Oregon](http://www.weather.com/weather/tenday/l/Medford+OR+97501:4:US) on that list. 




 Sarcasm. I hope. 




 The key to making it work in newer cities is to start fees at a low level and raise them steadily over time, after first announcing that this will be a long-term policy. The idea is to notify everyone that building more transit, and living closer to work and stores, needs to become a priority.

Politically, that's a struggle in some places, especially conservative ones, but the twin needs to cut carbon pollution and rein in runaway freeway spending demand change. 














 Bingo. Older hot-climate cities were generally built to suit the need for walking, often with an emphasis on evening and morning activity.  Newer cities are built for driving from one air-conditioned pod to another.  




 Judging by the downvotes here, pro-slavery redditors are on task today. 




 Creditors are making an example of Greece to deter Spain and Portugal from following suit. 




 Shark bites man; man punches shark. Sounds logical. 



























































 Non-monetary compensation means health insurance, which accounts for two thirds of US employee benefits and is growing steadily more costly still, yet which provides no more value. It's simply a race to keep up with spiraling costs in a horrible system.

That's why Americans no longer have employer pensions as more workers in most other rich countries still do. Health insurance is the monster that ate American employee benefits. 




 "Scientists are scary. Pay me $425,000 to make them go away." 




 Except that deniers are unmoved by data. 




 A good deal of both, along with a depressingly durable dictatorship. But, after years of drought in Syria and rising grain prices thanks to the Russian heat wave, by most accounts climate played a major role, and not just in Syria. The whole series of Arab Spring revolts began with food riots.

 China is now making huge strides, leading the world in solar power, new dam building, new nuclear plants; they are implementing carbon taxes and pledging more than $6 trillion to decarbonize in the next twenty years. To put that last figure in context, China will spend almost as much on decarbonization as the US spends on its military. For a country that was desperately poor only a generation ago, which has built its economy entirely on massive coal power, that's stunning progress. 

Now it's India that we have to worry most about. 




 Because CO2 remains in the atmosphere for 200 years, Americans are by far the [largest polluters to date](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Cumulative_energy-related_carbon_dioxide_emissions_between_1850-2005_for_different_countries.png).

In terms of emissions per person, Americans are still five times worse than Chinese (although not as bad as Aussies, Qataris and a few others).
 




 Shades of the Netherlands! And more evidence that the climate wars will ultimately be won in the world's courts.

 The Lloyd's report's scenario:

"A strong warm-phase of the El Nio Southern Oscillation (ENSO) develops in the central equatorial Pacific Ocean. Flooding develops in the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, reducing production of maize in the
US by 27%, soybean by 19% and wheat by 7%. Severe drought reminiscent of 2002 hits India, while parts of Nepal, Bangladesh, northeastern India and Pakistan are hit by torrential rainfall, flooding and landslides. Severe drought affects eastern and southeastern Australia and Southeast Asia. In India, wheat production is reduced by 11% and rice by 18%. In Bangladesh and Indonesia, rice is reduced by 6%, and rice production falls in Vietnam
by 20%, and by 10% in Thailand and the Philippines.
In Pakistan, wheat production is reduced by 10% due to flooding. Australian wheat is reduced by 50% by drought. Asian soybean rust expands throughout Argentina and Brazil, causing an epidemic. In Argentina, soybean production is reduced by 15%, with a 5% drop in Brazil. The Ug99 wheat stem rust pathogen is windblown throughout the Caucasus and further north; Turkey, Kazakhstan and Ukraine suffer 15% production losses in wheat, while Pakistan and India lose an additional 5% on top of existing flood and drought damage. Russian wheat production declines by 10%.

"Wheat, maize and soybean prices increase to quadruple the levels seen around 2000. Rice prices increase 500% as India starts to try to buy from smaller exporters following restrictions imposed by Thailand. Public agricultural commodity stocks increase 100% in share value, agricultural chemical stocks rise 500% and agriculture engineering supply chain stocks rise 150%. Food riots break out in urban areas across the Middle East, North Africa and Latin America. The euro weakens and the main European stock markets lose 10% of their value; US stock markets follow and lose 5% of their value. 














 Nuclear is a big part of it. So is hydro.

 Sounds to me as if we have every reason to be alarmed. Did you read the linked Lloyd's report on which this is based? This is from one of the world's largest insurers, mind you.

The last food shocks spawned the Arab Spring revolts and the rise of ISIS. These coming shocks could do much worse, possibly leading to violent fascist states across much of the poor world, and likely dragging richer countries into the mess. If, that is, we fail to slash global carbon emissions soon--or maybe even if we do, given that much warming is already baked in. 

The question is, can we get over our love of pickup trucks and our aversion to foreign aid in time? I'm not entirely sure that we can. Fasten your seat belt. 




 The most telling difference is the way Americans treat immigrants, and policies towards them, which are generally less nasty (in the case of Latinos) and sometimes adoring (towards Brits). No wars were fought here over the rights of immigrants, but a big one was fought over the ownership of blacks, and that was followed by more than a century of continued legal discrimination against them. The end of that era under two Democrat presidents helped blacks, but it was a huge slap in the faces of southern whites who had long measured their self worth by their supposed racial superiority, driving them into the Republican Party. 

Race, more than anything else, has always defined nearly every aspect of American politics. Immigrant issues come and go, but not this gaping wound. 




 "This will make it very unlikely that the world will be able to limit average the rise in temperature to within 2 degrees Celsius, a threshold seen by scientists as necessary to avoid the worst effects of climate change." 




 Despite occasional upticks in price, don't expect a real end to this slide until burning oil is outlawed by international agreement, as it will be within 85 years according to the G7 leaders--or as it should be in 27 years according to the world's national scientific academies. 




 By "acting now" I don't assume that all fossil fuel burning would end tomorrow. We have 27 years to accomplish thais at present rising emissions trends. We might push that out to 40-50 years if we start cutting emissions now. That is time enough to do this gracefully. Most credible economic forecasts show that this might shave around 0.2% off the global growth rate (3.3% annual growth rather than 3.5%, for example), so it wouldn't be free, but it really wouldn't cost much, either. More important, it would *prevent* much, much higher costs due to future warming. 




 Yes, this means acting *now*.

Actually, I think the markets would do just fine. They tend to move in inverse relationship to the fortunes of oil companies anyway. The key is that even as we dismantle the fossil fuel industry we would also build its replacement, and there are abundant business opportunities there.  




  That toughness leads to foci of deprivation that stand in contrast to the wealth of the rest of the society...Both the foci of deprivation and prison are racially disparate, for whatever reasons.

For whatever reasons? That is a rhetorical qualifier that few Americans would make. We know too well what reasons are at issue. Persistent racism, segregation, social dysfunction and mistrust all dramatically raise the costs of government services. We spend tons more on prisons and police than other nations do. We feel a greater need to arm ourselves against our fellow citizens than people in other countries do, which, in turn, leads to high costs for violence. We lack an efficient universal healthcare system because too many of us see it as a subsidy for poor blacks. 

On the systemic side, by moving to (and remaining in) rural areas and states, which are accorded greater political power by law, racists also achieve disproportionate political influence, which incurs all kinds of direct and indirect costs (more support for road spending, which puts distance between "us" and "them"; more support for prisons, which are both racial weapons as well as rural jobs machines, etc.). 

All of these problems reach a zenith in the former slave states, which is why many of them remain among the poorest states requiring the most Federal help.

Wars are expensive, and many (not all) American conservatives are dedicated to regarding blacks as a kind of internal military threat that must be contained, while some blacks respond in kind. It's a very costly, very old mess that completely skews comparisons with all other rich nations. 
 




 Never a bad idea if you have the land, but the study here suggests that shortages are unlikely in rich countries. We just risk being dragged down by increasing chaos and warfare in poor countries. Think ISIS, which was spawned by the 2005-2010 Syrian drought and the 2010 Russian heat wave and wheat crop failure. 




 You mean we richies will still have our bacon burgers while food riots spawn millions of ISIS-like fascists across Africa and Asia? Well then, there's nothing to be concerned about, is there? 




  I'm pretty sure they mean 3rd-world society

Yes, that is what the study concerns; emerging food shortages in emerging countries. 99.9% of redditors will remain fat and happy, arguing endlessly over why all the poor are so rudely killing one another. 




 Except that right now Americans hate one another's guts so much that we've had decades of domestic terrorist attacks like last week's horror in Charleston, the Tea Party's Las Vegas killings, the Oklahoma City bombing, etc.--most of which are expressly designed to spark Civil War Two.

 




 What's happening is that white Americans care so much about black Americans receiving welfare, that their distaste for this overpowers whatever empathy they do feel for poor white Americans.

Pretty much. Along with the deep seated American myth that we all get what we deserve, which makes it easy to dismiss poor whites as lazy losers. 




 Except that coal-fired generators emit too much carbon to sequester at anything close to economic scale, suitable CCS geology is rare and far from most power demand, and all major R D attempts at developing feasible large-scale CCS, such as FutureGen, have repeatedly failed.

It's no coincidence that most of the money wasted on CCS research has been in the U.S., where most coal-dependent states happen to be political swing states fought over by both parties (KY, WV, TN, OH, PA, NC, CO, NM, MT...). Gotta tell those folks what they want to hear. 














 Not so fast. We already see this happening occasionally, such as after the 2010 Russian heat wave and wheat collapse, which sent wheat prices up 40 percent in the Arab world, which caused food riots, which sparked the Arab Spring revolutions, which continue today.

The study's point is that this may well become horrifically common. If one of these disasters produces an organization like ISIS, what would ten produce? 




 Done and done! And my Congressional rep as well! 





























 A 2001 paper? 

Unfortunately, the findings are all too timeless: Within the United States, race is the single most important predictor of support for welfare. Americas troubled race relations are clearly a major reason for the absence of an American welfare state.
 




 The difference is that power for your electric car can come from low-carbon energy sources like wind, solar, biomass and nuclear. 



















 It's not all about salary. The 1980s were also a time of employer pensions, cheaper health insurance, affordable universities, lower priced homes and so on. Toss twice the income on top of all that and I'd take it in a heartbeat. 




 However, these are ranked companies, and Canada's reserves are split between many. 




 Good responses here. Also consider that the last time the Earth had 400 ppm CO2, sea levels were 25 meters higher than today.

 The fact that this happened to his amygdala is [not insignificant.](http://lakesideconnect.com/anger-and-violence/how-does-anger-happen-in-the-brain/)  




 To be fair, this is nothing close to the subsidies that fossil fuels receive: $550 billion annually, and that's for a very mature industry that is killing us versus a nascent industry that we desperately need. 




 That's the catch. This flag isn't just a celebration of treason; it is a threat to all black citizens, to remind them of who really owns the place. 




 They're everywhere in Idaho, sometimes flown over the U.S. Flag. 




 I've seen people draw guns in arguments, and one my neighbors--a great kid--was killed in just such a situation. Handguns just make it too easy.

Drawing a knife and attacking someone in a dispute is much more likely to get you killed. 




 Hey, Germany is doing it. Why can't we? 




 Wherever people commonly carry fighting knives there is much more knife violence. Your point is? 




 Roughly speaking, that is 1 gun murder per million Swiss; 1 per 11 million Japanese; 1 per 34,000 Americans. 




 Switzerland has a population of 8 million; Japan's is 127 million.  




 Not even close. Why? 




 I wish. However, I have family and friends who own real arsenals, and they do indeed add to them every time gun control comes up in major public debate. I know one couple who have guns stashed in every room, with battle plans drawn up to repel home invaders. Mind you, these folks live in the safest, most boring rural idyll you can imagine, but man are they *ready*. 




 The 97% consensus measurement wasn't really off. It merely showed that only 97% of publishing climate scientists publicly endorse the consensus, while, of the remainder, only a microscopic fraction actually oppose it. What the new study shows is that when we look at scientists' *research findings*, we see that nearly all the "undecideds" in the missing 3% actually echo the consensus, even though they are reluctant to say so. 














 After recent events in South Carolina, you may want to reconsider that statement. 




 Yeah, but this is the *state government* we're talking about. A state government that was the very first to commit treason against the United States in 1861, and which, under that flag, killed thousands of Americans while enslaving thousands more. 

Don't just lower the flag; sell tickets for the right to shit on it, and hand the proceeds to the descendants of slaves. 




 Fuckface Flag. More alliterative. 




 "Kind of genius when you think about it, to not violate the flag code they decided to just make it a permanent t fixture rather than on a pulley system like every other flag.

A flame thrower should do the trick.  




 It would also lead to riots by those of us unwilling to be screwed for the sake of yet more tax cuts for the rich. And that would lead to dead people, which would lead to still more. If the long list of right-wing terrorist attacks in this country are any indication, Civil War Two is *exactly* what conservatives secretly crave.  




 Okay, here's a thought experiment: rather than outlawing murder and rape, shouldn't we just make them expensive? 

No, because that would simply give license to the wealthy to commit whatever horrors they like, and murder and rape are absolutely intolerable. Same here. Carbon pollution must end altogether; in fifty or sixty years there will be no tolerance for it. We won't allow *anyone* to burn fossil fuels. 

No doubt, carbon taxation is the best first step towards decarbonization, but it cannot be the last step. 
 




 This may strike some Americans as radical, but it is almost precisely what German President Angela Merkel just proposed at the recent G7 summit, and her country is on track to make good on this. 




 But the agreed scientific consensus is that we have just 27 years to quit fossil fuels under the present business-as-usual scenario. How does a $40/ton carbon tax even begin to accomplish that? It cannot.

At some point in the coming decades, we need an outright ban, with truly serious penalties for lawbreakers.  
























 I'm a fan. However, some conditions:

 An emissions tax must be high enough to change behavior *and* to account for the price of damages caused by carbon pollution. That would be at least $40/ton (the official US Gov figure for the social cost of carbon, and too low at that). No one is currently proposing a tax level this high.

 A carbon tax must return its revenues to taxpayers in order to prevent a shift of tax burdens from rich to poor, and to prevent the economic drag that comes from tax hikes.

 A carbon tax must eventually pair with a carbon cap. The great flaw in carbon taxation is that it doesn't actually outlaw burning carbon, which is what the world must do. However, it can delay that ban and reduce its pain. 




 It's about time. 




  "To say that people who would willingly kill multiple people, especially ones they don't even know, isn't mentally ill is... well.. wrong, unless you can think of a logical reason for murdering lots of people. 

Sounds like a question for Tim McVeigh, Adolph Hitler, the Hutu militia or any number of other mass murderers.

The usual reason for killing lots of strangers is because you hate their kind. You might classify that as mental illness--and you might be right--but it's still the largest, most common problem that humanity faces and has always faced. 




  "If we are really concerned about gun violence, the overwhelming majority (by ridiculous magnitudes) comes from illegal gun ownership.

You do realize that this is because getting an illegal handgun is just so freaking easy in the U.S., where guns flood the streets and run down the gutters with each spring rain, right? Just try finding a handgun to buy on short notice in the U.K. or Japan, for example. Getting a connection will likely take days if not weeks, and then you'll pay a fortune, *and* you'll face serious charges if anyone finds out about your illegal pistol. Consequently, handguns don't get carried around all the time as in the U.S., so they don't just pop out and end arguments badly as they do here. 




 To be fair, *some* Catholics are indeed among the crazies in the Republican Party. Look up Opus Dei and its adherents like Santorum and Scalia. A third of Congress is Catholic, including some of its wackier members. We can guess that they aren't altogether happy with this pope. 




 Our responsibility for warming the planet was rather well settled fifty years ago, and very settled thirty years ago when high-powered computing made accurate forecasts possible. However, the basic concept of global warming from burning fossil fuels, and the first rough calculation of its future effects, came [120 years ago](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Arrhenius/arrhenius_3.php).  




 No, carbon taxes would not ignore methane. The only significant human-caused gas it would ignore is NOx, which is very easily regulated by other means. Water vapor is another, but it is a biproduct of warming by CO2 and CH4. So, yes, a carbon tax could be quite effective--if it is steep enough. 

I like the Citizen's Climate Lobby plan: a carbon fee-and-dividend that would return all revenues equally to each citizen, giving people some resources to adjust their living, boosting consumer spending at the same time to overcome the economic drain of an additional tax. 




 You do understand that a tax cut for the wealthy means that you'll have to pay more, right? It's a shift of burdens from them to you. 

Paul thinks you'll prefer kissing the National Parks and National Forests goodbye, you won't miss Social Security or Medicare, you'll do fine without Federal law enforcement, you'll gladly say goodbye to clean air and water, you'll never need disaster aid from FEMA, and you won't mind tripping over the emaciated poor who can't get food assistance...yet you'll gladly spend still more billions to fund the world's largest military machine. It'll all be unicorns and rainbows. 




 The chart shows that the *effective* income tax rate now paid at various income levels is very progressive, with those making less than around $40K paying nothing, after deductions, while those in the middle pay around 9% and those making $1 million pay 21%.
 




 Sounds like a preliminary draft.

From the article: "Powell, a member of the National Science Board under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, decided to share an exclusive draft of his research on Tuesday  just days before Pope Francis is set to deliver a major address on climate change  because he doesnt want his holiness to reference outdated numbers." 




 Paul's plan would cut revenues to the Federal government, dumping more burdens on the states to fund through their own tax systems, which tend to rely on regressive measures like sales taxes, permit fees, etc.. Bush did the same thing. 




 [This article](http://judithcurry.com/2014/07/07/understanding-adjustments-to-temperature-data/) may help explain.  




 Did you happen to notice the graph? After deductions, nearly all who make less than around $40K pay no income tax right now. 

And how about the accompanying stats? 

"The average effective tax rate for all Americans is about 10.4 percent. However, taxpayers earning over $1 million pay a 23 percent effective rate and taxpayers earning over $250,000 pay a 21 percent effective rate more than twice the national average.

 https://www.nc-climate.ncsu.edu/climate/patterns/PDO.html 




 Look what happened [the last time](http://www.ctj.org/html/statefx.htm) we did this shit. The Bush tax cuts were a windfall to the wealthy but a disaster for the states. Furthermore, by their nature, state taxes and fees tend to be much more regressive than Federal, so this very effectively further shifts tax burdens from rich to poor.  














 No mention of climate change? The Arab Spring uprisings began with the 2010-2011 Russian heat wave and wheat collapse. The Syrian civil war began with the 2006-2010 extreme Syrian drought.

We've been warned to expect this, and this is just a taste of what's coming, people.

 




 Low income families pay [almost no income tax](http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/business/trythis3.png) now, so this wouldn't change much on the low end. However, on the high end, this would be huge: 49% of all income taxes are paid by those making more than $250K ([source](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/03/24/high-income-americans-pay-most-income-taxes-but-enough-to-be-fair/)). Those of us in the middle would have to pay for massive tax cuts to the rich. 

Meanwhile, even the poor get screwed as state and local governments raise regressive taxes on them to make up for the shortfall in Federal money for roads, transit, emergency services, healthcare, parks, law enforcement, care of public lands, etc.. For example, fishing at the local roadside now requires a much more costly license, plus an even pricier parking permit, so that even catching fish for dinner is out of the reach of many.

Aren't you getting a little tired of all this? I certainly am. 




 Clearly, not a Catholic. 




 When has economics *ever* been divorced from politics?  




 So he gives away crumbs to the poor, who pay very little income tax now, in return for handing a gigantic windfall to the rich? And the rest of us get screwed? No thanks. 









 Seems a perfectly accurate assessment to me. Limbaugh, Beck, O'Reilly and company may not directly encourage right-wing violence, but they certainly fan the indignation that leads to it.  




 Schoolmate says, I never heard him say anything, but just he had that kind of Southern pride, I guess some would say. Strong conservative beliefs.

So...yet another mass murder by a crazed white conservative trying to "take his country back".  









 The one shockwave on four justices' minds right now: shredding wildly popular Obamacare would guarantee a very leftish Supreme Court within four years. 




 So I guess we can just forget about that larger moral issue: the rising conflict between the oil industry and the need to preserve a livable, productive climate? 














 As in many bankruptcy cases, while it may be irrational for Greece to leave the EU and default, it is extremely rational for them to *threaten* to do so. With richer EU countries fearing a cascade of subsequent defaults and departures by Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Italy, the Greeks have real bargaining power. Why not use it? 







































 Not exactly the first time someone pulled a crazy [scam in Spokane](http://www.forbes.com/sites/williampbarrett/2011/09/22/the-merry-scamsters-of-spokane-strike-again/). 














 However, there's also this little aviation emissions detail called [radiative forcing](http://www.treehugger.com/aviation/what-the-heck-is-radiative-forcing-why-should-my-aviation-carbon-offset-include-it.html), that more than doubles the warming caused by burning *any* fuel at high altitude. 




 What, no mention of demographics? Am I the only one noticing that the "lack of wriggle room" in these various national economies correlates somewhat with the the aging of their populations? Japan and Italy suffer the most economic pressure; no surprise that they also have the most demographic overhang. Meanwhile, demographically younger countries like Australia are in better shape.

Energy resource deficits appear to be another factor in play. Norway, Australia and Canada are doing better; Japan and Italy, once again, are doing worse.

  Did the Pew study rank AGW among other concerns?

Yes, didn't you read it? [Here is a nice interactive summary graph.](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2015/jul/17/interactive-whats-the-world-scared-of)

Did you say "substantial cuts" or did you say, "all 97 national scientific academies have formally endorsed IPCC Assessment Report 5, which plainly says that we have 27 years to quit fossil fuels at present trend, and that means all fossil fuels."?

I quoted the text, which says that *in order to have a 66% probability of meeting the 2C threshold* the CO2eq limit is a trillion tons. And, yes, I realize that various groups are in hot debate over whether we have 485gt or 390t or 355gt left to burn, but the IPCC is on the conservative end of that spectrum. 

I'm saying government bans of oil are very unlikely, and you are supporting that by saying they don't lead, they slowly respond.

I'm saying that political will is building, but don't look for it in the halls of Congress; it's in the electorate. Just remember that the electorate is not very well represented, because the Constitution apportions far more voting power to less populous states. The most climate-concerned are concentrated in larger cities and larger states, which are also where the fossil fuels are; each voter in coal-rich Wyoming has nearly twenty times the voice in the Senate as a voter in climate-concerned California. We are also unique among rich nations in the way we allow moneyed interests to dominate television political programming and political advertising, so advantage fossil fuels biz.

Yes, we are agreed that it will be replaced. I just think the road to replacement is long enough that we won't see governments banning them in a couple of decades.

I never said I expected this to happen in a couple of decades! A better estimate would be 30-60 years.  




 Both towns are effectively doing the same thing. 




  The study I cited was from the UN and was scientific. Please don't embarrass yourself by pretending you read the methodology.

I'm afraid it's my turn to be pedantic, because there is *nothing* scientific or weighted about this voluntary online survey. Read its disclaimer: "Use the MY World data as trends rather than as evidence, as they may not be statistically significant or representative." For example, did you notice that 80% of respondents are under age 30? Or did you see the gender skew, or the geographic ones? I'll go with the recent Pew study instead, thanks.

AR5 made no such statement. They use the RCP (relative concentration pathways) framework, and they make no statement about what combination of mitigation and/or adaptation should be used.

From the WGIII Summary: "Scenarios reaching atmospheric concentration levels of about 450 ppm CO2eq by 2100 (consistent with a likely chance to keep temperature change below 2 C relative to pre-industrial levels) include substantial cuts in anthropogenic GHG emissions by mid-century through large-scale changes in energy systems and potentially land use (high confidence). Scenarios reaching these concentrations by 2100 are characterized by lower global GHG emissions in 2050 than in 2010, 40 % to 70 % lower globally16, and emissions levels near zero GtCO2eq or below in 2100."

Being a conservative IPCC product blessed by the world's leading oil nations before publication, the report also omits known potential large feedback forcings such as methane hydrates. Crazy but true.

your desire to see those things become a reality doesn't mean governments are ready to do those things.

Governments almost never lead. They respond, and slowly. China excepted. 

If we invest in all the alternatives you suggest, to the point that they become cheaper than fossil fuels, there is still use for them as feedstocks for fertilizer, petrochemicals, etc.

Of course. Let me whisper one important word in your ear: "plastics!" Honestly, it will be a great business to be in when it becomes the primary market for oil and gas sellers.

The public is tired of all the cries of "the sky is falling!" They are willing to do their part, but they just don't respond any more. This was already true six years ago when researchers started to report on Apocalypse Fatigue

There is some truth to this, but much also has to do with the public's mistaken sense that we lack solutions--an attitude that is carefully cultivated by the largest industry that has ever existed, whose products will lose value as alternatives become clear.

I've been following energy research for years now and have found nothing that does everything oil does.

No single thing does everything oil does, nor will. Instead, a combination of many energy sources and methods will replace oil. You seem informed enough to know what they will be. 




 




 We all know that Miami, New Orleans, Mumbai and Rotterdam are future scuba attractions, but this study suggests that nearly *every* port city may join them beneath the waves within a few decades unless we decarbonize in a hurry. 




 Keegan's *A History of Warfare* and *The Mask of Command* both qualify. Loved them both. 




 True, to the best of my knowledge, no national academies have actually called the threat existential (although plenty of their fellows have). They dont need to. When a normally restrained, stiffly phlegmatic national academy uses words like very serious or grave, they may as well say its time for us all to update our wills.

One thing is certain: all 97 national scientific academies have formally endorsed IPCC Assessment Report 5, which plainly says that we have 27 years to quit fossil fuels at present trend, and that means all fossil fuels. The alternative is to run unacceptable risks with millions of lives, with the global economy, and potentially with civilization itself. Although I doubt that we'll make the 27 year deadline, we certainly won't stretch it out to the 85 years that the G-7 leaders just agreed to. 

Oil alternatives exist now and theyll be far cheaper in years to come. The total cost of decarbonization is credibly estimated at 0.1% of the global economic growth rate, maybe shaving the forecasted 3% growth rate to 2.9%, so there is literally no excuse for delay. We should be massively building out renewable and nuclear power, putting a high and rising price on carbon, investing in energy efficiency at every level, and crafting government policies to encourage urban living. Soon after, all fossil fuels will almost certainly be outlawed by global agreement, and they will be outlawed first in the nations most responsible for the past 150 years of carbon pollution. That would be us. If I had to guess, I would say these bans begin around 2050, assuming that the world makes some major cuts long before then.

The kicker is the strong likelihood that even more alarming evidence of risks will emerge in coming years. For example, something like [this just-released blue ribbon study](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/07/20/the-worlds-most-famous-climate-scientist-just-outlined-an-alarming-scenario-for-our-planets-future/), which suggests that our grandchildren may be in for vastly higher costs than we knew. We should be prepared for more revelations like this, and even worse.

Is the public ready for this? Globally, yes (and please dont cite another non-scientific online poll to claim otherwise). Americans, Canadians, Aussies and Saudis are among the only true foot-draggers left, but even in these countries the political will to address the climate mess is rapidly growing--as it must.
 




 Is this offer for all of Romania or just Transylvania? 
























 "Hey, you, the troublemaker with the protest sign...you look a little too likely to become radicalized for our taste, so get in the truck".

Crikey.  














 This. Is. Huge. 

Low-wage workers are routinely jerked around by disorganized, uncaring employers who demand that employees be available at virtually any time, leaving them no way to schedule other work, school or family needs. It's not uncommon for employees to be suddenly called in for work on short notice, and then, after dropping everything to suit up and get to the job, to be told they aren't needed after all. 

This has to stop. Lousy, unreliable jobs like these comprise a larger and larger share of employment opportunities.  














 ...for one day. 




 The oil ban is decades away, but I have no doubt that it is inevitable. According to *every* national scientific academy, and the IPCC, and any climatologist one can find, our only choice is the existential one. The risk of igniting a runaway warming excursion is simply too great, and the potential costs of that too devastating. We are risking many millions of lives, and even, potentially, putting civilization itself on the ropes. Against that, quitting oil is a tiny price to pay. Other options do exist and will improve over this period.

On public opinion, your vision needs to extend beyond the United States (forgive my presumption, but you sound American). World opinion on climate is much different than American, as [this new study](http://www.efe.com/efe/english/technology/pew-research-center-says-climate-change-biggest-global-concern/50000267-2665247) shows.

For a preview of coming attractions in the oil biz, look at the stock performance of the largest U.S. coal company over the past five years: BTU share price plunged 98%--including a 12% drop just *today*. If you're in oil, not to put too fine a point on it, GTFO. 




 Good article, and thanks for posting, but on GMOs I'll have to go with the vast majority of scientists who say there is no evidence of their widespread harm as foods. 




 Baby steps. Breaking up the largest banks would do far more good, faster, than any indirect effort to "encourage smaller banks" through reserve rules. 




 Plague and aging tend to be inversely related. 




 How old are you, and do you need the money soon? If you're young, putting away life savings, an aggressive fund or two may be the way to go. You have time to ride the rises and falls.

By their blended nature, lifecycle funds are all pretty conservative. 



















 Well, no; if you drive SUVs and live in a sprawling, inefficient detached home miles from work and stores, you cannot claim to be "green" under any circumstances. Even EVs won't solve the larger problem, which is the overall inefficiency of far-flung living. To beat this, we have to live closer together, especially in places like the US, Canada and Australia.

If we had a hundred years to make the switch to clean energy, this wouldn't be hard to pull off, but we don't have anything near that long. This requires major changes that only government can handle, and it means destroying the largest, most powerful industry that has ever existed. All starting yesterday. 




 Carbon regulations are "subjective"? I don't think so; they are simple math. All national scientific academies agree that we must cap cumulative emissions at one trillion tons to stay within the 2C warming threshold that provides a good chance of livability, which means phasing out fossil fuels entirely within 25-60 years, depending on when we begin and how fast we transition. Period. 

However, I take your wider point, that Americans are more likely to support expanding freedoms than restricting them, even if the restrictions are tiny. Still, as we awaken to the stakes here, I'm sure we'll do the right thing, and the author is right to say that change will come in a wave.

I love Washington's attempt to pass a carbon price, offsetting it with sales tax cuts. That's smart and balanced, and, along with efforts in California, could easily spread nationwide, although probably offsetting the tax by returning revenues to citizens through dividends. 




 Why would an A.I. care about self preservation?  




 McKibben's science and current economic assessment are on the money. So is the idea that warming will cause broad and diffuse obstacles to the global economy, which may be headed for a major fall. He might also have put more attention to the effects of rising warfare in a world like that. 

Still, it's probably unlikely that this crisis would lead to McKibben's hippie dream of a peaceful, decentralized global economy of home gardeners and bloggers. Capitalism at scale will probably survive and revive...or the world may indeed decentralize--into poverty, death and constant war. For more on the economic consequences, from actual economists, read William Nordhaus for optimistic scenarios or Nicholas Stern for pessimistic ones (and read Martin Weitzman no matter what). 




 I think Fareed's point is that concern over job prospects has driven the flight to STEM, but at the expense of national competitiveness. To a certain degree he's right, although the privileged kids who are likely to start blockbuster tech companies are probably getting plenty of high-quality humanities education no matter what. Think of Zuckerberg at Harvard or Jobs studying calligraphy at Reed. 
 




 Yeah, it wasn't hard to see how unpopular this idea would be with redditors.  




 No doubt you're right about the easy availability of the world's cheapest oil, but I believe the Saudis and Emirates are also preparing for the banning of oil as fuel, which will occur over coming decades. That is why they are selling it even more cheaply, and why they are building out alternatives like solar. As the world awakens to the depth of the climate crisis and gets serious about switching energy, oil will crash just as coal already has, and for similar reasons. No one knows this better than the Persian Gulf states. 




 Damn. Was hoping not to see this conclusion...

Can meat be sustainable? The answer, based on the evidence I was able to assemble, seems to be: Yes, but only in moderation. And because we are currently eating so much meat, those who give it up altogether are probably making the most environmentally friendly choice of all. 




 Dutch elm?  




 The global oil biz takes care of its own. 




 I think of it more like discovering that smoking has weakened your heart, and you'll die unless you quit. A weak heart doesn't mean the end of life, however; it just means that you'll have to 1) live with medication, 2) deal with bouts of weakness, 3) never smoke again. 




 Desal is incredibly energy intensive, and the Saudis are trying to liquidate their oil reserves before climate regulations reduce their value. 




 The last thing any company wants to do is to invest in products that cannibalize the core line of business, especially if that means stepping into gigantic fields that are already full of big competitors. Simply put, the oilcos have chosen not to compete with General Electric, Siemens, Emerson, Sunpower and the like. Rather than compete in the electrical space, they've decided to stick to their knitting with chemical energy, mostly by betting that natgas will solve their problems for the next fifty years. Companies like Shell are also doing some work in biofuels.  

I think this is both stupid and immoral, given that the scientific consensus says we must quit carbon fuels in 27 years at present trend, and that biofuels have very limited potential, but no one ever accused oil execs of being the sharpest knives in the drawer. 




 Hello once more, global warming. We'll meet again, don't know where, don't know when...

 The Keeling curve's blips are annual. Because most of the Earth's land and vegetation is in the Northern Hemisphere, global CO2 falls when it's summer here. The plants gobble it up. 




 We can stop making it worse, can't we? There's a huge difference between a 2C warmer world in which civilization survives, and a 4-6C warmer world where all bets are off.

 Doesn't it actually work in both senses: extreme nationalism and prejudice against groups of any kind other than one's own? 




 1) The US caused the problem [far more](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Cumulative_energy-related_carbon_dioxide_emissions_between_1850-2005_for_different_countries.png) than any other nation did. 

2) On a per capita basis, Americans each emit more than [three times as much carbon pollution as Chinese](http://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/blog-uploads/2012/11/list-countries-co2-per-capita.png), and more than twice as much as Europeans. Together with Aussies, Canadians and Persian Gulf nationals, Americans are still the world's worst polluters.

3) China is now making huge strides to control its horrible pollution problem, leading the world in installation of carbon-free energy, taxing carbon, beginning to take a positive role in global climate negotiations. They have far to go, but they've made quite a start in the past five years.

4) US "progress" is due to the rise of gas, which is [leaking so much unaccounted methane](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/leaky-methane-makes-natural-gas-bad-for-global-warming/) into the atmosphere that the claim to vast emissions cuts is a huge lie.
 




 Europeans each emit less than half as much carbon pollution as Americans do.

 Same thing with the long, successful fight to ban ozone-destroying CFCs. There, too, industry predicted economic disaster if we enacted regulations, yet somehow we survived without a scratch--and recent studies say the consequences of damage to atmospheric ozone would have been even worse than we knew. 




 Half of Norway works for the oil industry, and the other half sells them drinks.  




 Poor food options and bad habits. The poor eat more starch and sugar, drink more soda pop, get less cardio exercise. Good groceries are harder to find in poor neighborhoods, outdoor exercise in the evening may be less safe there, the poor more often lack personal discipline, etc..

 The GOP is caught in one helluva bind. Nothing motivates their base as much as bigotry and chauvinism do, yet the party is doomed until it can attract more Hispanics, blacks and women. 

It's not as if they didn't see this dead-end coming. 




 Military standards now often prevent many from enlisting because a larger share of the poorer half don't meet educational requirements, or have weight problems or drug issues, or a criminal record. The result is that present military demographics are more upscale than they once were. 

My observations may be anecdotal, but I sure know poorish, small-town kids who'd *like* to join the Air Force or Navy, but who can't for some combination of the reasons above. 




 [This may help as well.](http://www.eesi.org/files/climate.pdf) 

The article at issue breaks "electricity" and "commercial   residential" into two categories, when really they are one because 70% of electricity is used in buildings, especially for air conditioning, water heating and appliances. 














 Amazing how fast this rumor caught fire among US far-righties, whom I heard guffawing over it the very day the research came out. Thanks once more for the firehose of bullshit, Fox News. 




 Based on the sea of gray hair I see at most climate rallies, I'd say we already have this segment aboard. 




 Well, around 75 percent of the fossil fuels industry is nationalized, so we'd have to begin by buying out Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iran, China, Brazil, Indonesia and Nigeria. And, in truth, that may be what some of those countries are hoping for. 




 In the US, all agriculture accounts for only [9% of greenhouse gas emissions](http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/sources/agriculture.html), while globally the figure is around 12%. Some isolated studies claim much higher figures, up to about 33%, but those appear to be biased. Both in the US and worldwide, the largest emissions source is the heating and cooling of buildings; second-largest is transportation. 




 Unless the revenues return to citizens, the tax won't survive and escalate for long. Give the revenues to the poor and the rich will kill it; give the revenues to the rich and the poor will kill it; but give the revenue back to all, and most will continue to support it. 




 The one we have is Nike HQ. Seems pretty healthy, but appearances deceive. 




 Unsaid: obesity is especially high among low-income and rural folk who are most likely to enlist, so it's a double whammy. Then add the *other* disqualifiers mentioned...

lack of adequate education, a criminal history or drug use. All those put together mean that 71 percent of Kansans are ineligible for military service

In other words, it sounds as if *most* of those in the demographic segments where the military draws most of its enlisted personnel are now ineligible to enlist.  
























 With better, cheaper batteries they can, and those are on the way--along with solar panels multiples cheaper than today's. 




  Solar isn't the only option though, wind and hydro energy could be very promising for the US.

The US is maxed out for politically acceptable hydro, as are Europe and Japan, but the developing world is still full of opportunities. 




 Nuclear, wind, solar, hydro, biomass...

The energy system we need is as simple as ABC: Anything But Carbon. 

Gas doesn't qualify. Not even close. 




 Better Kardashian than their previous cover featuring Tsarnaev, the Boston bomber. 




 Not just the GOP. Studies show that in *every* country, it's hatred and mistrust of foreigners that most unites conservatives. We 'Merkins just take it a step further, invading and occupying any country that makes us nervous. 




 I'd just love to see one of these conventions hosted by their actual funding organizations--Koch Industries, Exxon, Suncor, the American Petroleum Institute--rather than by their front groups like Heartland and Friends of Science. 




 So much for that petrostate thing.

 If Trump can't manage a small campaign communications team well enough to prevent botches like this, I'll pass on letting him run the country. 




 Venting and leakage are two separate problems, and leakage is the larger one. There's debate about where all the gas is leaking, but much seems to be from poorly cased wells where gas flows up the *outside* of the borehole, while in other cases the local rocks just easily leak gas when disturbed. Almost none of this is deliberate, and even less is monitored.

http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/09/15/study-bad-fracking-techniques-let-methane-flow-into-drinking-water/ 




 Do I have this right: the leak rate is 1.5 times the previous EPA estimate of 2.4%, so it's really 3.6%? And the cutoff point for benefits from switching to gas is a maximum leak rate of 3.2%, so the gas business is actually *increasing* our carbon footprint?  




 We are in an "interglacial period". A long summer between ice ages. 

Polar ice has been around for about 30 million years, as the climate has gradually cooled due to the rise of the Himalayas leading to increased weathering of rock, which sequesters carbon. By contrast, ice ages come and go every 100,000 years due to the Earth's orbital cycle. 




 Don't drive so much or you'll spend most of your time and money doing so. I'd drive the West Coast seeing cities and national parks, then fly to New York for a week, then maybe drive down to DC. Maybe finish with another flight to New Orleans and a drive over to Austin to see music in both cities. 

Yosemite, Crater Lake and Mt. Rainier are not to be missed, especially if you enjoy hiking. Hit the rugged coasts: drive California's Big Sur and the northern half of the Oregon Coast, staying in small beachside motels or campgrounds. 


 









 http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/03/world/nuclear-energy-climate-change-scientists-letter/ 




 Most global surveys show that attitude is pretty limited to the US, Canada and Australia.  




 Not a *very* protracted timetable, however. Carbon pollution has already brought us crop failures, record hurricanes, the Arab Spring revolts and the Syrian mess. Severe droughts are beginning to plague the expanding subtropics with increasing frequency. It's on.  




 Unless we stop the madness, which I'm reasonably sure we will do. Decarbonization is relatively cheap and easy. All we lack is political will, and that is about to change. 




 Well, the climate *has* swung through changes in the past, and we know why--which is how we know that we are responsible for this particular warming swing. Watching a rerun of the PETM in fast motion is indeed terrifying.   




 Not that simple, unfortunately. *Cumulative* emissions matter as much as *present* emissions because the carbon pollution now warming the biosphere was put there over the past 150 years, not just now. By that measure, Americans and Europeans are responsible for most of the problem *and* Americans still each pollute at nearly triple the rate of Chinese. 




 Call it all "carbon-free energy", then. Many leading scientists working on climate agree that nuclear must be part of our solution, and very few disagree. 




 Thanks for posting this. Yeah, I think we're coming to terms with the fact that carbon pricing will delay the outlawing of fossil fuels, but it won't eliminate the need. 




 You mean the photos of women riding on detached urban cycle paths? I think you'd have trouble finding *any* cyclists wearing helmets in downtown Copenhagen. You simply don't need them in a place where bikes move at a stately 10 mph, separated from traffic and pedestrians. 




 It amazes me to see how fast and far this crazy conspiracy rumor has traveled. I've heard deeply conservative folk agonizing over this 1,500 miles from Texas, speculating that this will be a Federal takeover of Texas followed by a UN takeover of the US government. The nut bone is connected to the whacko bone...

 We agree. I simply mean that individuals all have the capacity to improve the world, and rich individuals can obviously do more, but no individuals can do as much as governments can. Collaboration counts. 














 Yes, they controlled for income. However, we probably don't need a study to tell us that. Take any two neighborhoods of similar socioeconomic status, one with trees and one without, and, more often than not, you'll probably find residents generally happier and healthier in the treed area. 

And no neighborhoods are more depressing than ghettos without a tree in sight. 




 Plenty of cities do have tree planting subsidies worth looking for. I've gotten scores of beautiful, big trees at no cost for neighborhood tree plantings. 




 They controlled for wealth. 




 Yes, sea level rise will take time, but this study's point is that even the damage we've done to date will cost plenty, and if we don't start decarbonizing soon we'll lock-in much, much worse.

Unsaid: drought, floods, storms, wildfires, crop disruptions and associated warfare will grow intolerably horrible long before the oceans rise by several meters. 




 To be clear, this is mostly about Shell positioning itself as a gas company. Renewables are a very small part of their plans. 
























 Disagree. The hyperwealthy are most definitely capable of improving the world. So are the modestly wealthy, and so are you and I. The issue is that in a $75 trillion global economy, even the $40 billion Gates Foundation can merely nibble at a few narrow challenges. None of us can do much alone.  




 "Women cyclists are the 'indicator species' for how bike-friendly a city is. If there arent at least as many women as men, then usually its because cycling is not safe enough. Its an indicator that you do not have good enough cycling infrastructure.  




 To be clear, the diet problem is nearly all about *beef, pork and lamb*. Poultry and seafood have [vastly lower carbon footprints](http://www.greeneatz.com/foods-carbon-footprint.html). By cutting out beef alone, a typical American can reduce their carbon footprint nearly as much as going vegetarian would.

 "I'm no scientist, but..." 




 If Exxon was merely pumping oil, I'd agree. But leading a costly, twenty-year global campaign of deceit, all to keep selling a product they knew to be massively destructive? That puts this in an entirely different legal category.

Personally, I doubt the game will change until bastards like these are held to account with multi-billion-dollar judgements against them, as the tobacco companies were. The stakes are vastly higher here than they ever were with tobacco companies. 




 So...we and the next ten generations all pay taxes to move every coastal city, to accommodate a billion people flooded out of deltas? No one gets out of this without paying. 














 ["Globally, subsidies to fossil fuels may be on the order of US$600 billion per year, of which the GSI estimates about US$100 billion is provided to producers."](https://www.iisd.org/gsi/fossil-fuel-subsidies/fossil-fuels-what-cost)

We're talking direct handouts here, not vague calculations of externalities. 




 Go with the Planet X for the carbon frame.  




 Except that the vast majority of subsidies in those developing countries are *consumption* subsidies, not production subsidies. 




 One of my go-to quotes, but this isn't just willful ignorance. Exxon spent at least $30 million on a concerted campaign of lies to attack climate science that they knew was true, and we can safely assume they also knew of the millions of deaths and the global calamities this would likely bring. Welcome to the Crimes Against Humanity Zone. Punitive damages, anyone? 




 Did you read the linked GAO report? Excerpt: "From Fiscal Years 2003 through 2012, State Funding for Public Colleges Decreased, while Tuition and Out-of- Pocket Costs for Students Increased. State Funding for Higher Education Decreased by 12 Percent Overall and by 24 Percent per Student."

This began with states shifting costs to students. Federal student loans then grew to help ease the pain of that shift, but they did not cause it. 




 By guaranteeing everyone's loans and throwing in grants, they have created the same "blank check problem" that medicine faces.

Not really. Most post-secondary funding comes from the states, not the Feds, but state governments have recently shifted most of these burdens onto the students themselves. That higher tuition, in turn, has forced the Federal government to step in with more loans to meet the higher costs, but students still end up with a bill that was once picked up mostly by state taxpayers.

http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/get-there/wp/2015/01/05/students-cover-more-of-their-public-university-tuition-now-than-state-governments/ 




 Interesting articles as well, and thanks for 'em. There's no question that Syria and the Arab Spring were due to pent up frustrations, along with heaping helpings of greed and fear. Climate disasters and resulting food shortages were merely triggers.

Those triggers go much farther than the Syrian drought alone, however. The Arab world lives on other countries' export crops, and *those* crops suffered [repeated climate calamities in 2008-2011](http://www.americansecurityproject.org/climate-change-the-arab-spring-and-food-prices/) that drove MidEast food prices sky high in 2010-2011. The "squares" protests across Arab countries began mostly as food riots.

 




 Very few Arctic methane plumes are dense enough to ignite.  




 http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-change-hastened-the-syrian-war/ 




 And it still is...warming. 




 Funny you should mention it. Exxon later paid some of those same PR firms and the same tobacco scientists, such as Fred Singer and Fred Seitz, to pose as climate science experts and cast doubt on the scientific consensus on climate change. In 1989, Exxon led the formation of the [Global Climate Coalition](http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Global_Climate_Coalition) to grow this into a multi-industry push that included carmakers, utilities, construction companies, chemical companies, aluminum companies and many others. 




 Look at it this way: the last time the globe warmed enough to melt the ice caps 55 million years ago (probably due to giant basalt eruptions and outgassing causing greenhouse warming) much of Earth's life died, continental interiors turned to deserts, sea levels rose hundreds of feet, superstorms were common, and summer heat in most places would kill you. 




 Professor? Of what, petroleum engineering? 




 Why wait for Bangladesh to submerge? Syria and the rest of the Arab Spring revolutions show the results of climate calamities and resulting food shortages here and now. We'll see lots more of *this* kind of climate chaos long before we see Bangladesh, The Netherlands and South Florida vanish beneath the waves. 




 Used to be "climate science denial", but phrases are hard. 




 Loved Merchants of Doubt, but I'm way past being shocked by psychopathic greed. 




 Sounds as if you had a bad teacher in 1981. The scientific consensus on warming goes back to the 1960s, based on solid published research that began in the 1890s.  




 These crimes go beyond reckless endangerment. With thousands now dying from climate disasters caused by carbon pollution, and with abundant evidence that oilcos have known this for decades yet actively misled the public with massive campaigns of lies, we're talking manslaughter at the least, and possibly mass murder.
If corporations are people now, Exxon should be on trial for its life.   




 Exxon has done precious little in alternative energy, and the other oil majors have backed out of most of their renewables initiatives. Many of these programs still exist, but, in most cases, they are now barely funded.

http://www.eenews.net/stories/1060006834 




 God help us if Arctic methane concentrations ever get dense enough to ignite wildfires!

No, except in a few odd cases, such as when methane builds up beneath lake ice, these tundra methane emissions are very diffuse. A big problem for the world, but not for plants and animals nearby. 




 Organize! None of us can do this alone. Add your voice to others. There are scores of great organizations looking for volunteer help, participants at rallies, writers of op-eds and so on.

Meanwhile, vote, recycle, and live in a walkable city. 




 The oil majors (minus Exxon) did briefly flirt with developing alternative energy technologies, but most have cut back those initiatives. Why cannibalize your core business when you can simply deny the climate problem, confuse the public and keep the cash register ringing until you retire on a carbon-spewing yacht? Leave it to the grandkids to handle the worst calamity in human history.  




 Don't count on the starving poor to become that organized. Do count on them to create violent, costly chaos in all directions. 




 Business analyst here. Some manufacturers and real estate trusts look about fifteen years out, but they look only at a slim number of variables, like the future prices of aluminum or suburban land. Most companies just muddle through, trying to repeat what worked in the past. No wonder that decarbonization scares the living shit out of them. 




 Before you jump, please persuade as many Republican science deniers as possible to join you.
