 But...Italy can't top...it's not right... 




 Downloaded it a couple hours ago and I love it!!  




 Are you only first discovering the awesome that is magic ocarina???? It's a smule app like magic piano but more mystical. 




 Dat tree 




 Accio. Most definitely. You can always use it to get yourself a tool to kill someone with anyways. 




 Hope you're okay with some Japanese songs;
Air Force Ones-nelly
Dancer in the Dark- Megurine Luka
After dark- Asian Kung fu generation
Alones- aqua timez
Awake and alive- skillet
Boom boom boom boom- vengaboys
Burn it down- linkin park
Byouteki kikkyu Nikki- uverworld
Caramelldansen-caramell
Cherry saki yuuki- an cafe 
Those are all I can get right now. Hope I helped!
 




 I invade people's personal space. Often.
 




 Autobots...they won't try to annihilate me. 




 I think all cable networks have a porn section. Only problem is you paid for this one.  




 All of the comments before me are so...technical (and probably correct). I was going to say photoshop and be done with it...now I have to learn... 




 Lost it at the monster mash.  









 Thanks! I've decided to just go ahead and jailbreak. There isn't that much to worry about I guess! 




 This isn't what I think of when I think of the Axis Powers...but it's more accurate than Hetalia...probably... 




 That was terrible XDD 




 Where was credit given to 9gag? The watermark? Then 9gag has written us a bibliography.  




 Reddit, have we really come to taking posts from 9gag? We're still bitching at them for doing the same thing to us.  














 The control of bamboo. Must be a lovely thing.  




 I can never get my arms to bend right so I always end up either in a strange position or using a pencil or something...

Well...I guess eyeballs could count. But it's probably not as satisfying as a ball scratch.  




 That they would. I'd find it surprising for any guy to agree with me.  




 Yep. 









 I actually read the whole thing...and about the pics. I think the preview is either legit or accurate. I wouldn't really want pics for the shit lasagna tub though. 




 The fact that my name is used in the same story as Comic Sans worries me.  




 It ran away from my computer. And it will never come back.  




 Kuroshitsuji. Just explain anime as sexy men that fight and it's also full of sexual innuendos.  




 On le front page! Congrats on both achievements! 




 Me and my friend actually had quite the debate about this. She kept saying green while I insisted black; the glass over the reflective part is green. The actual reflective part is black. What do you think reddit? 




 Harry Potter plot canyon:
Think back to Sorcerer's Stone. Remember how Hagrid got Harry from the house? 
Now think up to Deathly Hallows. Snape got Harry. 
I always found Harry Potter plot holes the most fun ^_^ ((I was actually hoping I would get to show off this 'discovery' on reddit. I'm not saying I'm the only one who noticed this though.)) 




 Go to the store and buy some of those cone facemasks (I've found a pack of four for $2). Put those on and tie something around your head. Go to every store in the vicinity. Occasionally just stand on the sidewalk. The looks from other people make this the most fun.  




 The kindergartners at an elementary school in my town (Well, two schools) all have iPads in the classrooms. When I was in kindergarten (not too long ago actually, about about nine years ago), we had blocks. Not legos. Blocks that would connect to each other up and down but you had to tape them together to make cars and such. Not iPads. Yet at my school we have two 6 year old Macs for all of us to share then a bunch of PCs. Kids need to start being kids again.  




 Want. Miko. Want.

 These are all of the Vocaloid songs on my iTunes. Some are covers, and I tried to remove any repeats. Sorry about the lack of links...it would take quite a while to link to all of these. I know there is a lot of Gakupo here...I love Gakupo and there wasn't enough of him! I'll gladly give you links to these if you would like though!

 And that ladies, is why tampons are the route to go.  




 I look back at memories from when I was a kid and since it was a while back, I can only remember a few things. Things I remember about my room are blue, my sisters room is red, and the kitchen is green. Outside is orange or white.  




 Cool! I never knew there was actually a name for it.  









 I must say, using reddit as advertisement was a wise choice.  




 Yes. All the time. I'm usually thinking about Hetalia or such though.  




 I got my mom a cake...well...I made it. 




 I would still recreationally sleep and eat.  




 ...Rammstein memes overload....XD 




 You...are...a...saint. 

Well, really I don't want to take notes to write a script tomorrow...and cleaning is too mainstream. 

But tis a valid point. I should indeed get off the internet.  




 Where was it??? GIVE ALL THE RAMMSTEIN RAGE ENCOUNTER UPVOTES!!!! 




 Yes...it was a guy that dresses like a woman. I *do* know the difference. 




 The leg sticking out is really bothering me... 




 There was a transvestite named Riley addicted to being an adult baby on my strange addiction...striking resemblance too... 




 Sometimes I do, but then I think of people's intelligence level and one of the most widely known products is a blanket with sleeves. Then I start to think that around 2010 we started going backwards... 




 Thanks! 




 "Wait...no...nevermind...we actually...and then...*insert contradiction here*...bro you just had to be there." my favorite.  




 The only students I tend to see on reddit are engineering students.  




 I think everyone needs to give this kid a cookie.  




 My teachers get all on my case along with the rest of the planet. When ever someone asks me "Why are you so quiet?" (I'm not really a quiet person...at all) I respond with "I really shouldn't plot murder out loud.  




 ...dafuq? _

That definitely belongs here...

Did my best! 




 Zelda on SNES....memories ^_^ 




 The blank spots in the packaging. They're irritating.  




 Can't...by the time I decide to get out of the shower, the water is freezing and I have to do gymnastics to rinse my hair... 




 Indeed. 




 You look a tad like Emma Watson. But these are awesome!! 




 Seen this comment on this video at least 5 times now XD 









 Well, those of us who can spell properly aren't exposed to search results that are spelled lyk d1s.  




 I would be in dire need of new trousers.  




 Just to correct....this is transformers animated. 


And my childhood is ruined. 




 I am not alone. When I was younger I always tried to put myself into a state of just consciousness.  




 Take a snuggie, phone/laptop, and snacks with for the poopy process. Much more relaxing.  




 Someone better take a cactus over there.... 









 Yes!!! Im always much better with a pen (or liquid pencil), good with a mechanical pencil, and pretty bad with just a pencil.  




 Le Jesus of bubbly beverages.  




 Well....smells is an easy one. You know that fresh 'snow just melted and no one has allergies yet' smell? Every time I smell that smell I think of elementary school and have a dire need to go on some monkey bars.  




 i find it silly i just gave it its 666th upvote ^_^ 




 Good to help the unknowing...with STDs.  




 one does not simply...create a rage comic. 


must study le art of rages. took me 3 months of viewing masterpieces to make my first rage.  




 psh...once youve seen blue waffles, youve seen it all 









 The Help. i figured it would be one of the worst movies ive ever seen considering my sister picked it ((shes the opposite of me...i prefer action/horror/blow up movies)) and the setting is quite a few years back. it was /actually/ pretty good.  














 XD Well...better not to lie! 




 actually, google is on the confirmed list of sites going down http://sopastrike.com/ 




 Indeed...especially when crash is involved *epic trollface* 


































 I only add people I know outside of reddit as mods. And if they have more than one account, they can use the account that is already moderating.  




 Boxers or briefs? 




 How exactly do you make a beacon?
 




 The seed is 'gnocci' and the mountains get good at x -285 y 106 z 407. 














 The first thing I noticed in the album was the Deathly Hallows graffiti.  









 Mules are sterile. 




 I decided I would update the software on my iPhone. No problem, right? Wrong. I look and it shows the 'connect to iTunes' logo. That's not right. Next, I saw a notification that my iPhone was in recovery mode and needed to be restored. I figured there was no other way to fix this since it was stuck on that screen, so I restored of course. I'm just hoping I'm not alone on this.  




 This made me cry! I'm getting the last issue...I don't care what it takes!! 




 I accidentally built a house at cloud-level...but only the 2nd floor is at cloud level. It's pretty irritating to go upstairs and then there is a giant cloud taking it's time going through my house.  




 FAKE. Nobody has that signal with At T. 




 Piranha.  




 87...A ton of these names decided to run away from my mind. Time for a marathon... 




 I would put my best skill at procrastinating, but if that's not accepted, then I guess I'll just make them all feel a bit too awkward.  




 This is fantastic! I'm glad nothing like this happens to me; I'm also glad you're alright (physically, anyways)! Message me when next part comes around!
 









 I've used this a couple times. You can change the angle and difficulty (how fast it 'scrolls'). It's pretty fun and the faster it moves, the better the workout.  




 I'm wondering if I should even bother updating or not...It seems there are more complaints about 6 than praise.  




 I know that (I actually prefer that subreddit), but my friend really wanted one Luka-centric. So I gave her her subreddit...and tried to explain it wouldn't grow that large.  




 Absolutely.  




 I didn't put it there, actually. My building skills are quite horrendous. And I was on creative and like to use glowstone instead of torches around my house.  









 At least he didn't click an NSFW links...from what we can see. 
 




 The fridge seems like a good deal until you realize that $100.00 buys about 3-4 bags of decent groceries.  



















 If they do take out all of the well known characters for 4, the movie will do as fantastic as the final seasons of G1. Once the characters people know and love are gone, they stop watching.  









 Back in 6th grade I had the pleasure of watching one of my classmates do an oral report after having vodka for lunch. It was hilarious. He never got in trouble. Just suspended for doing other stupid shit.  




 GET SOME HOT SAUCE ON THAT SHIT. 









 I was playing Minecraft and noticed the sun looked a bit odd. It was a solar eclipse! Has anyone else witnessed this? If so, how often does it happen? 




 I honestly found the Bount arc terrible. And I thought it was canon back then-so it was supposed to be awesome! 




 That's a dub I haven't heard in a long, long time. 
 




 The only person I am super picky about, is Kisuke MUST be played by Owen Wilson. 




 You have a problem with pictures of a dead fetus posted online yet you're on r/WTF?  




 Fake. 




 Honestly, you should try to stay around people as much as possible. With this, the last thing you should do is isolate yourself. That's when the bad stuff always happens; when people get the logic of "I'll stay alone to save others." If he is truly this crazy, you being out of the way wouldn't necessarily stop him.  



















 This belongs on facepalm (facebook post) and it shouldn't be here (it's a screenshot, check the rules). Also, I really don't get it... 




 Hetalia has mentions of WW2 and focuses on the Axis and Allies.  




 Well...I am quite the Hetalia fan. So, whilst I was in social studies, we were already getting rather off topic and in my corner of the room, we were talking about WW2. I decided to blurt out "I love the axis! Germany is lovely!" My teacher didn't appreciate that and I had to go through and explain Hetalia to a room of non-anime viewers. 




 What's the age range? 














 Austria. 




 I think this is pretty awesome for LP and Transformers fans like me...but I'll never get one.  




 It's a my little pony extension for google chrome (ponyhoof).  














 Bidding ended at about $250.00. Little less..But that tab makes scary sounds.  














 J-just take all of my upvotes!!! 




 how...did...you...FIND THIS??? I could hug attack right now!!! 



















 More like Italian.  




 My friend wants to be buried in a tomb of anime plushies...mostly Sasuke.  




 We all remember in the first movie when Hagrid went and got Harry from his house after the attack, right? Well, what about when in the last movie it was Snape to get Harry out of the house? This is definitely the biggest plothole I have seen in the series. Feel free to correct me, Potter fans, if I'm incorrect on something.  




 Break Stuff -Limp Bizkit. My I'm pissed off song.  




 Skillet is a Christian band.  




 Don't mean to brag or anything...but...crotch scratches are nice.  




 One does not simply...get sick of pasta.  




 I really didn't realize how many pics I went through until I was done! That was quite the adventure though! I didn't think it would look so nice towards the end after seeing everything torn apart. Well done! 




 Will you be a redditor when you're older? 









 My sister works in a salon and gets hair splinters in her feet all the time. 




 Considering how anti-9gag reddit is, at least crop out the logo to avoid ridicule.  









 We were talking about alliances and stuff...I got sent in the hall after laughing about Germany invading France...three times.  




 Boxers or briefs? 




 My brother in law has worked countless hours in factories for the past six years to support my sister, my niece, and now my newborn nephew, and my sister doesn't even give him a birthday card or say thank you. He's sacrificed everything down to his laptop (she kept hers though) to keep them out of the streets and she is asking for a new otter box. She also hasn't had a full time job in the whole time they've been together...spent the past six years on an assistant teacher degree that she dropped out on a month before she would have finally graduated.  




 World is mine hatsune miku 














 GerIta, USUK, Spamano 




 Psh...once you've seen blue waffles, you've seen it all. 









 It was probably the only time Italy ever followed orders from Germany!  




 A walkthrough had to be a mood killer XD.  




 He has to be a little impatient...Italy probably has no idea what he's doing! 




 That might just break the internet...in the most awesome way possible.  
























 I can't upvote this enough.  




 I don't have to listen to you and your anarchy. 




 I wouldn't mind...it might actually be interesting seeing how this happens. The biggest of my concerns is the flags. They might just change the meaning of 50 stars is they're lazy enough.  




 _ So happy! No more grown men arguing like little girls! 




 Maximum health. And a bad ass cape. 




 [All I can think of.](http://http://imgur.com/CBuA4)

((NSFW)) 




 Well, Obama's got reddit's vote. He did an AMA *and* is encouraging us [to exit our internet hidey holes] to vote! 




 We find out in another story...he was crushed by a giant shipment of oranges and ladies in white dresses. 
Edit: I accidentally a word. 




 It's not filler nor canon. It's an extra. That's all. Fillers are put in just the anime, yet manga extras can still be in there, just not part of the plot. Fillers can end up being more relevant than extras.  




 I learned that trick from reddit-thank you for saving me from trying to use it and leaving someone with a hot, soapy, shit soup in their toilet.  




 I just literally say 'etc' if I have to because I can never remember how to say it.  




 Sent an email...got one back quickly. I let the conversation escalate before I commented though.

*Not sure where I should go with this conversation now. *
 




 This is quite an awesome build. I downloaded the world to get a better look. It's fantastic! 




 I've woken up right before my alarm and in my sleep induced drunk, I started panicking, wondering if I downloaded the right texture pack the previous night so I could get dressed, and then proceeded to look for my laptop in the bathtub. I wish I had a good excuse for that.  




 YES! Glad he won! 




 Thanks! 




 This takes patience and skill that I simply do not have. I applaud you.  




 I'm not Hispanic, but I'm rather advanced in Spanish. When I read things out loud I use proper pronounciation and accent, but there's always that idiot that says "stop acting Mexican!". So I have to dumb it down to heavy r's and d's.  




 The hill I go snowboarding at has a conveyor lift listed on the bunny hill. It must be new this year, since last year there were only ropes. Is this an actual conveyor belt for snowboarding/skiing? 




 WE NEED UPDATES!!! Unless you're dead...then that would be crazy...or this just annihilated the ending. Or Rose hacked him. Fuck...now I'm overthinking nosleep. 




 My radio likes to turn on on its own. All it does is make loud, irritating, static. Usually I don't mind...sometimes I'm even too lazy to get up and turn it off. When it does this in the middle of Rose's dialogue, I can't help but throw things at it in fear.  




 I am a native speaker and I thought that was a saying.  




 Repost of something posted 12 days ago.  




 Marilyn Manson. Horrible live.  




 Well that's a lot of nope!  




 How much are they?  




 Thank you for living a dream for those of us who stay in internet caves.  




 The curl and Gilbird says it all.  




 If I didn't know any better I would say she was a Hetalia fan. 




 Fuck cleanliness too.  




 Ugh..that's going to take a while...I guess that's payback for derping up. Thanks! 




 I accidentally changed my spawnpoint...twice. The first time I tried the command, I thought it would take me to my spawnpoint. Since I didn't go anywhere, I tried it again thinking I entered it wrong. Turns out, I changed my spawn point twice. Is there any way I can reverse this? (I'm in a superflat and have been searching the Nether for my portal. Haven't had any luck with that..) 









 One of the features of the update says that Herobrine was removed. Is Mojang trolling us or was Herobrine actually there? 




 ^_^ 




 Then a membership is definitely something I'm willing to invest in. Thanks! 




 If you have an Underground membership, can you download all of the previous CDs/order them? (LP8 is the best!) 




 "Oh shit...didn't they do that thing with Jay-z?"
Or
"Faggots. Why do you listen to that screamy emo shit?"
OR 
"FUCK YEEEEEEEEEEAH!" 




 I like guys who are just a bit too socially awkward than expected...not necessarily the type to sit at a computer all day, but more of the kind that's almost too shy to say hi to random people. (And OP's quirk: awesome.) 




 The other one is Project Diva~ 




 Would love to...but, there's a bit of an ocean in the way. But a meetup would be awesome! 




 Same here over in Wisconsin...the snow cam is so uneventful. 














 I know Hatafutte Parade, Mein Gott, Absolutely Invincible British Gentleman, and Excuse me, I'm Sorry were performed, but I'm wondering if there were any others as well.  




 I always tell people my dreams if they're interesting; and I hate being a hypocrite. But when people tell me about how 'demonic' or 'dark' their dream was, I usually get irritated. The only thing more irritating is when my friend tells me she doesn't dream and when she does it's a sign that something bad will happen and she should stay home and watch TV that day. 




 Do you get your period on both? And if so, at the same time? 




 We broke another website...overloaded. 




 Not all of them are wrapped in the plastic. I've seen them at bookstores open; they expect everyone to be mature and buy it or pirate the ebook before reading it in public. 




 I was wondering that too....it just disappeared. Nothing with 20000+ points just disappears. 




 We have a bunch of those in our science classroom. They're not plugged in though... 




 Found it again! 









 Yet the textbooks at my school are falling apart... 




 You lucky lucky female you,  




 It was! I could fly across it at a point. I took out my compass trying to find my way back to my spawn point. It told me my spawn point was right next to the huge thing! So I was dumb enough to fall out of the world...no such luck. Maybe I'll be lucky enough to come across something like that again. There were even diamonds in the caves! 




 There's trees on top too-a whole biome! 














 If someone took my bike like that, I wouldn't even be mad. They obviously deserve it more than me.  









 Licorice. It seems the whole planet loves it, and thinks Twizzlers are the best candy in the world, but I just can't seem to see how it tastes so fantastic.  




 Thanks!
 




 Okay, this seems like a really dumb question, but I was wondering if Minecraft had to be updated for anvils to be available, since I can't craft them.  




 I have that printer...it sucks shit. Can't even print out a simple document without screwing up.  




 My friend can't remember anything. It annoys the living hell out of me when she can't remember plans or something but can remember anything science and math related. If I hadn't met her brother, I would think she was full of shit. Even though sometimes I do anyways... 




 "Rowling would not rule out another book set in Voldemort-ville. But as far as "Harry's story is concerned," Rowling said, "I'm done." This is the part of the article that makes me excited.  




 What is your favorite bath and body works scent? How often do you use calculators? 




 http://i.imgur.com/XosMF.png
Well this is a fine discovery.  




 Buy Lucky Charms (cereal).  




 Sometimes I'll be looking through a photo album and she just drifts across the page. It definitely livens things up!
 




 Pinkie's~ 




 Most certainly! 




 What's your favorite kind of chicken? (My friend's been wondering.) 









 That's Soundwave before he was copyrighted as such. 




 No problem!

 In science, some kid started to explain how retarded it was that we had to study paramecium. Someone decided to reply with "Don't say retarded you fucking fag!" 




 Most certainly! 




 I am honestly impressed with this website; It has tracks from extremely well known artists to artists from overseas. Even character songs! This is definitely going into my favorites~! 




 So...I guess we broke another website.  




 The bubble wrap bag things came with Vault. I was so excited when I saw the package! 




 Whelp, I'm done eating for life.  




 But they're still sending deaf students to a concert... 


































 We have to use the damn red ones with ovals. But I make circles anyways. 




 Good luck getting a scantron on an Algebra 2 test. No where to show your work. 




 So there is no HB #3 pencil?  




 Ultimate. I don't *really* know what I'm doing so I just stand in our goal and wait til my team throws it at me. Then I catch it. 
Thanks~ I really surprised myself with it! 




 I was thinking (instead of catching frisbees) about support. From others. I started to relate it to a bed of nails. Have you ever laid on one? It's painless (unless your hair gets caught!). Why? Because there are so many nails to rely on. Think of your supports, whether drawing, or a friend, or a sibling, destroying bubblewrap, painting, whatever those supports are that stop you from self harming at that moment, as the nails in the nail bed. It REALLY hurts to lay on just one nail alone, and if the bed of nails is just in the sky, you will fall without support. The more you have, the better and easier it is. I'm getting somewhere with this. And where I'm going is, find something. Some type of support for yourself. You can talk to someone, draw, sing, listen to music, or do something silly like wear as many shoes as possible then make noises, it doesn't matter! If it stops you from hurting yourself or others, do it! I'd like to find someone who went to the ER for drawing their cat as the Mona Lisa. 

* **TL;DR:** The more nails (supports) you have, the less it hurts.  




 1: I think they wear clothes underneath them, like a skirt or pants and a dress shirt. 
2: I've always thought they open in front, but then again it's right and left with robes and cloaks with me. 
3: I think the plain robes are a requirement for first years, as your crest and colors get added once you're sorted. 
4: Maybe the hoods attach? I think it might be the cloaks that have a hood.  




 I actually agree with this a ton. Harry was quite the asshole in the last book. Ron and Hermione were *constantly* trying to help and instead of contributing to the suggestions they gave him, he decided to do what he wanted and argued with them about why they were wrong. We get it Harry, you have no family. No need to start all of the angst so soon. Leave it in the fanfiction please. 




 I spent the past 15 or so trying to click on it.  




 Today I realized I missed the signups for ALL of the secret santas! 




 Other than that I've spent the past fifteen minutes trying to catch the snitch, I actually ended up seeing Dumbledore in a new light going for round two of the books. I was completely with Snape when he said Dumbledore had practically raised Harry like a pig for slaughter. I don't know if I didn't see it the first time because of all of that Dumbledore sparkle or what, but it took a second reading of the whole series and some movie watching to see how that worked. 









 This is an exquisite list. Shall definitely use some of these! 




 If the people that email your kids get an email notification that you receive a copy of the messages, she could have been fully aware of this, and secretly seeking adult help. Going incognito like this is one of the easier and quieter ways of screaming for help.  




 He's a bit of an ass about it, but for some people, the guilt trip works. If a celebrity went and made a video like this, the world would be all over it. Some people have a tough form of caring, and I think this guy has that. But it doesn't work to 'just stop'. Just stop smoking. Hell, just stop breathing. Forever. Not that easy, is it? 




 Thanks; I try not to listen to him. He's never been one to 'understand' what's going on with his kids until it directly affects him, and even then it's  more understanding that things aren't happy for him.  




 Craft stores. Dat smell.  




 Snape was an asshat to Harry because he was an asshat to everybody. It would be odd if suddenly Snape bowed down to the Gryffindor King. Snape's character is just pretty damn bitter towards life I guess, and I can see why. 




 I got it for free more as a "if I like this shit I'll buy the game" type of thing. I don't want to spend $25 on a game I don't like or  is only mildly interesting. I'm too lazy to print it too. 




 That's my plan. 




 I've been told that by my dad when I tried to tell my parents I was depressed. All I got out of it was that I was a 'self centered attention seeking fuck'. It definitely doesn't help the situation.  




 A blood bomb is when you period decides to do a surprise attack and BAM. Red hurricane. 




 Personally, I don't like how everything that was easily accessible in the sidebar previously is now moved to an almost hidden location. 




 I'll give them a try! I've been trying to read more than just posts on the internet anyways~
 




 It is well written, I just can't get into it; it's not my genre. I prefer science-fiction and action. 




 18-20. This won't be a fun night. 




 Study for a math test, a TON of worksheets, 3 chapters of To Kill A Mockingbird, a worksheet on Stalin, and a lab report. Yay. On the bright side, I've still got twelve hours or so.  




 I've started studying and ended up drawing all over a page of my textbook-luckily it was in pencil.  




 This was wonderful. I may not be able to relate to the bloody chair, but blood bombs, most definitely. And the worst is when they happen on the ONE day you don't wear a liner.  




 Only protection I have is Atheism. But all these religious people in my house are going to screw me over some how.  




 My bathroom has one on every wall. So in order to turn on the light you see at least 3. Fuck.
 




 Now...how in the hell do I tell more people than there are in r/nosleep?
GONEWILD. 




 Davey. Wavey. He is an expert in all things gay-yes. Eyes is the best way. OOR you could stalk them. I find that a fun method~ 




 I had a [horrible] friend that was homeschooled. She entered public school in 7th grade. Bad move. Her social skills were HORRIBLE. As in, she had her own cell phone, but left it at home (which was across the street from school) so she would use one of our cell phones. I'm fine letting my friends use my phone if their's is dead, they don't have one, or they forgot it that day. But she does it intentionally. She also had a bad habit of being...stuck up? Nosy? Acted like she was better and knew more because she skipped a grade. Not to mention, all of the times I have invited her over, she never slept over. Once she had a mattress to herself, a lamp on, all the pillows and blankets necessary, and then insisted on turning a fan on (in October!). Two of us were already sharing a mattress and one was on a pile of blankets, so we were ticked. Then she left at about 11 to which we were all happy. Sorry if this seemed more like a rant, and I could go on, but from my experiences, many of the homeschool (even private school) students I've met have not been pleasant. I have met a total of one homeschool student that was nice, but she also has been in sports, therefore, interacting. 




 4. Feelin awesome. This test knows what it's doing. 




 I actually have a black one of these. It's fun to walk around town with my phone stuffed in my pocket and talking on this.  









 Emma changed the most. 




 Slamming it shut is another great solution. 




 I believe it! I'm not grossed out easily, but sometimes the smell of what we're working with is just horrid.  




 My sister announces her shit status to her boyfriend rather openly. They have been together for well over a year so I think things are going well.  




 I don't know if it's the brush or what, but the last one looks awesome. Glad you found a good outlet! 




 The hour before lunch is always the longest. And I have Biology before lunch, so if we do a particularly gross lab that day, appetite gone until *right* after lunch. 




 GRELL! Would not have minded for a second had Grell sat on me~ 




 [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS1uDnIPTvo) Is always fucking hilarious. 




 I don't recite the Pledge. I can't remember the last time I did. I don't like pledging my 'allegiance' to a country that I'll probably end up moving out of when I'm older. When we analyzed the Pledge in US History, I realized that it's a bit odd to be having kindergartners learning that.  




 Thank you~ 




 Thanks~! I do love Transformers~ 




 I like the new logo...wish I'd hovered over it earlier! 




 What I love about it is thinking of what you could do in a Cyberpunk society. It's so much more fun.  




 No problem~! I can't keep these awesome pictures to myself when I find them! 




 The download button on DA gives the highest resolution available.  




 What is the point of going to one of these events? 









 I'm in high school taking Principles of Engineering (Project Lead The Way) and the big semester project that we're doing is an interview of an engineer in the field. I don't know any engineers personally, so if anyone is willing to help, that would be awesome! There aren't too many questions, just about engineering. All of them are on the sheet (pictures). Anyone who volunteers, no personal information will be shared (except my teacher of course)!

 My school has a GSA, and I know a few LGBTeens, but they're friends so it's a bit lonely for me too. Just gonna have to wait things out! (Too bad we can't start our own LGBT colony!) 




 Okay, thanks! 




 How does this 'everything free' work? I don't see anything about it on the site. Am I lost? 




 What if the straps were to snap? 




 Grazie! 




 Know what else is weird? Bible fanfiction. I'm not so much shocked that it exists as that there's so much of it... 




 You're not alone. I might be a bit more skilled if it actually snowed soon... 




 I think I'll just stick to bitching at people with words...to stay on the safe side. 




 Thanks! And I'm good with any gender~ 




 Thanks~! 









 And people say Reddit is a waste of time.. 




 I'm American and didn't realize how much I loved Twinkies until I had a meltdown at in the store at the empty shelf with the announcement taped on.  




 Sup. 









 I've been sick with that cold/flu mutant too, and I know those feels. But I've been at home...thank you for brightening my day though~ 




 If this has turned into a game, then yes. I am in as well. 




 I remember watching the first movie with fascination with my mom. My friend and I went to the theater to watch the last one and it took every atom in my body not to let the feels out.  




 Oh...SuFin is so sweet! It's good to know I'm not the only Hetalian here! And this comic is awesome even to people who don't know anything about Hetalia...has an awesome message.  




 That's okay. I accidentally smacked my friend's kitten in the face. I tend to talk with my hands a bit. It cuddled in forgiveness though~
 




 You copied and pasted every single one? Thank you for saving me (and the rest of us) the time and frustration. Too bad they went so fast though.  




 I love this theory...but sadly, it cannot be.  




 You sir, deserve a trophy. 




 XD Hitler vagina! I can sadly relate to a TON of these. As do most females. Now we get to see how many admit it. This is what happens when women get their own thread... 




 I keep  HUGE supply of tampons and liners in my backpack and sometimes a random girl (or one I hate) will ask me for one in the locker room. I've got plenty to share and I know that feel.  




 I thought of that position too.. 














 Ching Chime-Serj Tankian 




 You may want to block your name out of the corner.  




 A local Sendiks. They were going on about Leroy Butler burgers and such for the year anniversary.  




 Yes, they are quite good burgers. But I was still shocked that she stood in line for an hour when she could have made them probably better in less time. I then realized just how American my parents were when my dad proceeded to explain how they're related to football. 




 The only thing I can think of when I hear Special K is Disco Bloodbath.  
























 Cheez-its and Mountain Dew is a favorite. Oreos are also fantastic. 




 Flexing is not a turn on. I'm sorry. 
What is nice, is a randomly clean counter or something. You can flex your muscles all you want whilst wiping down that beer you just spilled instead of throwing a towel on it. 




 Puberty roulette master. 




 Dem eyes. 









 It's not the *worst*, but I know life's just not as easy for ugly people. I'd hate to have to see my kids deal with a ton of bullying and rejection because of a few bad genetics. 




 Wait...is NotaMethAddict Kyle or Thorian1990 Kyle? 




 I'm terrified to have children because of that. I'm not the worst looking person on the planet, and I probably won't end up with someone less than decent looking, but knowing my luck there will be that one gene from that one ancestor that fucks it all up.  




 It's an edited picture for a show where the countries are personified. In the show, they have glasses. America's are named Texas. 




 HETALIA. Gay nations everywhere. I hope I beat someone to pointing out this CanAme. 




 Futurama and MLP? *highfive!* Working on one now~ 




 Oh! I must be on the right track-I've worked with the Greybeards. 




 There's a big quest besides all of the Dragonborn stuff? I just got the game and went straight onto Dragonborn quests. It was escape being executed, Riverwood, Whiterun, YOU'RE A DRAGONBORN. I'm level 10 thinking the Dragonborn quests are the main ones.  




 I didn't like boys at all for a while (thank you Spy Kids). But then I saw Shark Boy and Lava Girl. Bi forever. So elementary school for me...and my first crush was a girl. But then some boys. I didn't know there was a 'right' and 'wrong' way to do it. Just liking people. 




 He got reddit gold. I'd consider that a very good thing. 




 Congrats! Your stories are absolutely amazing, I actually want to read them more than once-they never lose the effect! 




 Fuck. 




 I often feel the same way. One second I'm "OMG MEN" but then I just find it difficult to see myself in a relationship with a guy. I guess I just confuse myself a TON. 




 So cons I guess. It would take work to drag her out of the friend zone. 




 RP 




 Thanks! 




 This movie always puts me in a fantastic mood. And in the mood to get things done. 




 Both girls...so friend zone is okay. 




 [I'm not that bad.](http://i.imgur.com/jSfjA.png) 




 Yup! I love Pinkie Pie because she is just that awesome and always hunky dory.  




 Thanks! 




 We would wrap it around the playground a few times! 




 My mom picked some up for me and I'm just wondering if anyone has used it and if so, how do I use it? The packaging for Swix is never too descriptive. 




 My friends and I have sat all day and used tons of yarn to make these things yards long.  




 I want gold for Christmas...
And it did continue to you! But skipped him. 




 My mom was so proud she found it. I had a mental breakdown over the loss of Twinkies. 




 Yup! I got my xbox today so I hardly know what I'm doing. 




 Thanks~! 




 It says my email is already in use...but that's because I already have an account. How do I fix this? 




 I got the same Xbox package. I almost broke it rolling around in happiness. 




 Sorry, was trying to sneak the picture whilst standing in line to hand it in.
 









 Your HTML skills make me fear your photoshop skills. 




 Omnipotence. 




 Yup! Southeast Wisconsin. Can't wait to get to the hills tomorrow! 









 Being in Wisconsin, half of my teachers planned around the hopeful snow day. Others just planned for a movie or test (genius). 




 The middle ring-that's fine. The BOTTOM RING. NEIN. And of course it's the bottom right on *all* of my binders. 




 ...Do you at least get lack of snow days? 




 Relevant, because it was just announced that my school has a snow day tomorrow! 




 For those of you that get snow days, what is your plan for the day? Snowboarding? That homework you didn't do? All I know is that I have a huge can of Code Red and Minecraft in my taskbar waiting patiently for me! 




 You fuck. This was awesome. 




 The Algorithm. MATHCORE FTW. 




 Being a freshman, this is a dangerous attempt buuuut, here goes. 
 1. Walk on the right side of the hallway. I don't wish for you to walk over me.
 2. Don't you dare point out we were supposed to turn in homework 10 minutes before class ends. 
 3. Upperclassmen own the school. Get over it.
 4. If you are a freshman, walk against the wall. It saves the rest of the planet from walking into your backpack.
 5. Do not announce it is your birthday if you did not bring a snack. 85% of people at school don't care.
 6. We know you're tired. Anyone who has to wake up at 4:30 in the morning for school is tired. Stop complaining and go to sleep. 




 Alright, I have done my fair share of interesting presentations. You could do a paper and presentation on Japanese culture. Or Vocaloids. I was asked by a teacher to put together a powerpoint and the class was absolutely hooked by singing holograms. It really is fun to research. You could write a persuasive paper on a famous (or even controversial) person. I have a friend who wrote a persuasive essay on why Ivan the Terrible wasn't actually that terrible. Freedom and the Internet is also a go-to topic for me.   




 What type of topic are you aiming for? 




 Thank you! My brain must have shut down~ 




 Could someone explain the Imperialist? 




 I now enjoy you greatly. The only thing that could have made the Japanese better was if it was possible to put it in someone's voice. 









 Absolutely. I have a couple fandoms where I'm always thinking of more ideas, most of which I end up being too lazy to throw on paper. Others it is a rather painful experience and I hope that I never get a request for them. 




 From what I know, a group of griefers. They griefed the farm of my friends and I, who, from what I know, have done nothing to provoke any griefing. 




 Don't want to join due to fear of being a target, but you have gained an ally! I'm always willing to help others in the server!
Edit: Unless you're in my base/taking my stuff. Then I will either do my best to crush you or run away in fear. Probably the latter. 




 [Here's me before snowboarding a couple weeks ago.](http://i.imgur.com/V1iNo.jpg) It was also my first or second week on the server.  




 I can't stand the pointless griefing either. I get when two teams/players have a grudge between them or war is declared or something, but my friends and I built a huge farm open for use by anyone (as long as seeds are replanted) and we keep getting griefed. This isn't playing. This is immaturity. DFS and RoT have hit us so far.  




 This is awesome. But I didn't get asshole on my envelope. I got my name. 




 How did you find out? Did you do extensive research and come to the conclusion? Did you see a therapist? 




 I see. I'll make sure to watch for you guys then :) 




 What does the rest of it stand for? 




 Yes...I loved that base. It was a shared base. I have a much nicer one now. I needed to renovate anyways~ 




 I know it's a Hindu peace sign, but I doubt whoever made it intended it as such.  














 Not as much r/nosleep as much as it is r/wtf. 




 So...this app is only available in the UK... 




 When reddit shuts down and after half an hour of refreshing, only vaguely admitting defeat. 




 I see. That makes sense then. 
 




 But who knows how long each power would last? 




 College is free in the UK? Lucky! 




 Today the power (well, the lights) shut off in half the school and the network was down so we all got sent home.  




 I have these. They work really well.  




 I've come across settlements (and seen pictures) with HUGE amounts of obsidian. I'm just wondering where it all came from.  




 This tactic really doesn't work. It usually ends with "If you want to fuck up, go right ahead."  




 Nope, the 4. I don't have money (or the desire) for a 5 so I'm glad it's safe. 




 Unique? After looking at the comments here, I really have to find a different one. Let's see...I got it! That swoopy 2010 Bieber hair cut. No. I don't want to feel like I'm dating someone who is either 12 and/or just took a helmet off after a week. 




 Absolutely. Accents are awesome. My friend and I go nuts over them~ 
 









 Don't know; I'm more in the Sunburst/Little Switz area. They should have some snow made though, it's been cold enough.  




 I'm American and write similar to that. Not necessarily cursive, but not full on printing.  




 Momo and Rukia. I just couldn't stand Rukia from the beginning, and Momo is pretty damn useless. At least Komamura can use bankai. Or a decent shikai for that matter... 









 Yes, I dumped chocolate milk on my iPhone. It was charging pleasantly on the table. My cup of milk was sitting pleasantly near it. That is fuck up number one. Number two was when I decided to grab my cup for a drink of that lovely beverage. Miss. I hit the cup and the milk went flying on my phone. I have never ran so fast than when I did to get some rice to throw my phone in. I also managed to wipe excess milk off with my shirt. It has survived (for now-last time it got wet, it took days to take effect) and is currently in a bag of rice. Fuck.  




 I see. I've had teachers that go absolutely nuts over scantron. 4 question vocabulary quiz? SCANTRON. 




 You have to pay for them? 
























 I feel less alone now.  




 Anywhere there's not updated youth, I guess. 




 So I've been living in a cave....is this slang now?
 




 That's what I was thinking. Origin and the state of Origin was quite the give away. And the griefing being allowed.  




 I don't quite know what flavor, but it tasted great! 




 He wouldn't eat it, so I put it on his head. He was fabulous~~ 









 You sir, are my favorite asshole.  




 I would actually find your gayness a turn on. I always feel I'll end up alone because I tend to have more of a thing for gay men. There's just something about them.  




 I'm that way as well. I always want to know more about what frightens me. No problem. Answers are always fun to give when I have them.  




 I like to believe Bloody Mary can only be summoned. I'm a child when it comes to summoning less than pleasant things, so I prefer to believe they only go where they are wanted.  




 I don't think so. Charlotte seems like she would only visit those who want her presence.  




 My bathroom has a mirror on every wall. Showers are always terrifying. We have those glass/mirror sliding doors. Perfect scene for some demon to pop out and kill you in the middle of your repeat of shampoo.  




 I thought the same thing! I was highly infuriated. 




 I enjoy using Unrelenting Force in the library at the College. Watching the books fly at that orc...it feels good.  




 The Crimson Nirn quest. I discovered it on my third character. I haven't started it yet, but it's found by going into a ruin, and then a building in that ruin, then picking up some red nirn. So pretty easy to over look.  




 If you're having trouble finding where the glass chaos starts, /tp 0 64 0 




 Spock is definitely my ladyboner. He's just so...Vulcan. It's lovely. 
 




 I have never held much love for Rodimus/Hot Rod. He was okay in the movie at first. But then I started to be unable to stand him. He just really seemed to be a forced character. He couldn't be Optimus-he was far too inexperienced and didn't deserve leadership. He also acted far too much on direct emotion, in turn, getting Optimus killed.  




 Radioactive -Imagine Dragons 




 Thanks-I didn't know what it was called or what it was other than some plant. Good to know its not poisonous.  



















 The one thing that I'm really not linking about this map is the huge ice oceans and the mountains. That's about it-everything else is pretty grand.  




 Omai. This is worse than Voldemort and Crookshanks (Hermione's cat). 




 I actually came across a few cows wandering around the base. I was able to repopulate. If you need a cow, we could work on a price in PM.  




 I am only in need of one cow. I have a little bit of every ore along with stacks of melon and meat. I have carrots and potatoes too. State your price in a PM, and we can negotiate. I shall only trade with trustworthy players, who will not turn this transaction into a scam. I am mostly a farmer, and a non-PVPer unless in defense. 

EDIT: I have found cows. A gift from Notch. 




 And the cows are gone as well. I have some stuff in a hidden room to get the farm going again, along with tools. I'm usually pretty paranoid about griefing and prepare for the worst.  




 And a lovely one, too. 
 




 ...did you make it?  




 This...why is this link purple.... 




 The problem is, this comment is actually relevant.  




 I only allow myself to go down to 100 when I'm on reddit. If I have tabs open, I have to attend to those. Then get something done. Then keep redditing. 
 




 I really wish I hadn't emptied my base of all of my valuables. The minimap even had all of my old markers. 




 SEALAND! In the top five of my favorite countries. I actually screamed when I saw this post. 

So an actual question, do you plan on maybe expanding the country? 




 It should be known that freerice only works if adblock is off as the ads pay for the rice.  




 I have stayed up until inhuman hours searching for a way to get shaders going (accidentally updated before I had all the files for mods) and you just saved me from insanity. If only every comment on a forum was this helpful.  




 Only self posts don't get karma. 




 Did I miss part of this April Fools joke? Nothing is happening to me.  




 I've seen nobles on horses armed by an Imperial guard or two a few times. But never more than that. 6-8 would definitely be interesting. 




 The iron helmet was my favorite for the longest time, but after a while ebony ones started popping up and I decided it was time to up my armor a bit.  




 I wish I'd gotten this advice. I'm far too attached to my first character, and regretting dumb things I did in the beginning of the game, and realizing I screwed up too late. Like selling things I shouldn't have sold for a little bit of coin. At least I didn't obliviously toss away Dragon Priest masks! 




 You are required to wear the wooden mask to access the shrine, although there may be a bug/glitch to get past that.  




 CUDDLY FRIENDS??? *hug* My friends are rather anti-touching (unfortunately) so my frequent hugging and petting and such doesn't bode well. The last time I got a new friend was at a convention, so I guess minimal social advice from me. But you're not alone on this~ 




 Back in my day, food was *solid*.  




 Seinfeld. Get with it.  




 If it's rave-like music that has people just moving around, bounce slightly up and down while waving an arm or three in the air. Works every time. Slower songs, if you have a partner and you're both clueless, just rock sideways in a circle (as most teens won't waltz). 




 I would travel for free. And all the expensive food I want.  




 I'm not sure if you mean you found some covers or you're still a bit lost. I'll go with the latter. If I were to go out and buy Miku's voice (since she is simply software), and make her sing a Lonely Island song, it would be considered a 'real' Miku song as she did sing it.  




 I just read an article about this on Cracked. I LEARNED SOMETHING BEFORE IT WAS ON REDDIT. Just like Chef Ramsey actually saves very few restaurants.  




 I've used "I like my women like I like my glasses-sitting on my face!" It's quite effective. (Though before I may or may not be downvoted into oblivion, I take no credit for thinking of it) 




 I started shouting at him until I realized he wasn't trying to annihilate me.  




 This may just be the best thread I have seen in months. But I should probably contribute something. 

"'Erecto!' she added, pointing her wand at the misshapen, which in one fluid motion rose into the air"  




 "Fucking shit not now I'm at school." Sixth grade. Right before social studies I had to buy one of those cardboard applicator tampons. I take pride that my first tampon was successful. 




 I'd be pretty content-less griefing! 




 Thank you! When I logged back on today, the server was back in order, so you must have done some magic. Yesterday was absolute chaos. Now hopefully we can go back to being peaceful with each other~ 




 I'm not sure that means there is a lot of PVP, but I was attacked from behind by a slime. My health was low after the trip to Unity.  




 Hi! I died in Unity recently, and hadn't made a bed yet, so I'm back to square one and I'm afraid my stuff will have despawned by the time I make it halfway to Unity. If you come across a large pile (full inventory) of stings including an enchanting table, a couple brewing stands, some diamond, and a bunch of watermelon, it is probably mine (if there is a stack of beef in it, it is definitely mine). If you are willing to return some of the stuff to me, that's great! As a reward, well, I'm willing to negotiate. Probably most of the diamonds as I don't find too much use for them. And a brewing stand or two if you want.  




 What numbers are for saplings? That would be great for changing the saplings or just removing them. 




 [First and only.](http://i.imgur.com/kyiKUSB.png) 




 Wow. This accurately depicts my ex-friend [left] versus me [right] when it comes to gaming. Her xbox voice makes my ears bleed. "Yeaaahhh I'm a girl and my KD is higher than you! I know~~~~ No you can't see my boobies!!" 




 [Lilium.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGUN7-PkyY) 




 My coming out to my two friends went like this: 

Friend 1: So guys, sexualities?

Me: Bi.

Friend 3: Bi. 

Friend 2: Bi.

All: O_O Well that was uneventful. *moved on to another subject* 




 Thanks~!

(Thanks for the tie help too-I really should learn it before anime con!) 




 [Here goes.](http://i.imgur.com/9avYKWS.jpg) 




 Thanks!

 




 I'm not out, so if I tell him I just don't want it to get around school then to my parents. I really don't care about school-it's the pretty anti-gay family I'm worried about. 




 This guy has randomly started talking to me on facebook. I already knew him at school, but we weren't close. I'm pretty sure he likes me. Even planned a date (we're to watch Big Bang Theory and Star Trek). He's really nice and funny, and we have similar interests, but it wouldn't work out. I like someone else. Not only that, but I don't think I can tell him that I don't necessarily like guys. So I guess I just need some help telling him no without hurting him-I don't want to be known as 'that bitch that friendzones everybody'. 




 That will be quite the challenge for me....meats and cheeses are my favorite foods!

 I tried the non-whitelisted server, and it was great! My friend and I started bases. I was in awe as I saw all of the available resources and mobs on a server. I'd be glad to be added to the whitelisted. IGN: MikoVargas, and I'm 15.

 First migraines: second grade. I would wake up in the middle of the night screaming, spend hours in the irritatingly bright nurse's office at school, it was not fun. I'm a freshman now (unfortunately) and I still get them. Painkillers and sleep? Coming up!  




 School spirit for a week with a big dance and football game at the end. It's mostly celebrating the athletes. 




 I always walked around doing a raptor impression (got friends to laugh...don't care how stupid I looked) then I got here and saw raptors. My brain made a tiny boom noise...I was pleased yet clueless. 




 As a freshman, it is my policy to walk against the walls and around other people. 




 Alas, Myspace has seen its time. I think it should retire and look back on its golden years. 




 We have semester finals Friday. Then Monday and Tuesday. Goodbye, borderline good grades! And I'm one of the nerds... 














 *Slow clap*. You did not shit yourself. You shit *yourself*.

 I like single lane roundabouts. Once you add more lanes, the idiocy of the population kicks in. Most people just ignore the lanes in those.

 /r/wtf has actually been making me say wtf. Thank you, reddit, for finally putting out weird shit again.  




 Suspensions have interested me since I first saw them, and I'm interested in doing one (or more if I like it), but I'm wondering if there's an age requirement (or an age you'd suggest) for it.  




 [These are probably what you're looking for.](http://www.sickplugs.co.uk/product/blue-snowglobe-plug) 




 I think 15-16 is the minimum. At that age, you have an okay scope of a job, college, and the rest of your life. At 10, you're hardly out of elementary school (if that). I also think that piercings should be fully the decision of the one being pierced. Pierced babies always frustrate me. I understand that the school and parents are okay with it, but I hope she was given a talk about how future employers might not be okay with it. I've wanted stretched ears when I was younger, but I didn't even know how people wanted to do it; I thought you needed some type of surgery, which my parents would never allow. Once I got a bit older and a bit more educated on it, along with showing responsibility, my mom allowed it. I definitely think 10 is too young to start stretching, but I don't think there should be any laws or regulations on it.  




 With my first piercings, the 18-14 jump wasn't happening at all. My second piercings, however, went from 18-14 seamlessly. It ultimately depends on your ears/piercings. If it feels like you have to force it through, it's too big of a jump for your ears.  




 I keep my stuff in a transparent blue lock box (from Walmart, so it's not far from pickable; just enough to keep it from popping open) and I have each pair in a labelled 'drug dealer' baggie. I would do the tackle box system (which I really like) but I don't quite have enough plugs to have a system for that, and I find the labels a bit easier.  




 I think I'll be doing that. I'm diligent about keeping only steel in fresh stretches, and I'm planning on getting mostly glass, steel, wood, or other non-acrylic plugs and tunnels in my goal size. I have one acrylic pair, but I'd only be wearing them for a day at most. The spirals I would wear over night and such, so sleeping on them probably didn't help.  




 Morgan Joyce/ilymorgannn is pretty reputable when it comes to piercings and the advice that comes with them. I would give that link as advice myself.  




 BAF has fossilized mammoth tusks for over $1000. 




 From my experience, Wal-Mart does better piercings than Claire's. My first holes were done by Claires, and I needed a taper to go to 16g, but my second holes could go up to 14 right away. My first holes have also been extremely sensitive. This is also problematic for me because I want to stretch to 2g, but I don't want my ears funny looking with the outside being the larger hole.  




 bodyartforms.com all the way. I've had completely good experience with them, and you get free o rings and a sticker along with a gauge card with every order, and who doesn't like free things? They also have a huge selection (with decent prices) and excellent service. Their shipping rates are also decent, and it's only $1 to add insurance to the order.  




 I read on BAF that Kaos is discontinuing their o rings. Is there anywhere else that sells clear silicone? With my recent BAF orders, I've been choosing the clear o rings as the freebies since they're not like the standard black ones that come with everything, but since they're being discontinued, I might need a new source.  




 So I started wearing some 14g acrylic spirals in a healed stretch, and I noticed that a really small area around/in the piercing was a reddish pink. I didn't know if this was just dye coming off of the spirals, or a reaction to them. My ears don't feel irritated while wearing them. I clean the spirals with rubbing alcohol and a q tip and they usually turn the q tip pink which is why I thought it was maybe the dye.  




 In what way does the stretching speed effect the shrinking? Does faster stretching mean faster shrinking? I'm kinda in the same boat as OP with stretching, and I'm only at a 12 so not too worried yet.  




 I pictured the entire scene when I saw that. Bomb jacket and everything.

 I have some programs for my TI 84 Silver that I want to convert to my TI 84 SilverC. I want to know if this is possible. If I can't convert it, can I just write the program straight into the 84C?

 Mine was a battle axe with a pretty good enchantment too. I have a feeling it was frost or shock. I always want to destroy every other holds' special weapon out of spite. I wouldn't be able to just let Lydia go. I always make sure she's at home with my kids so she's out of danger. I refuse to have them live at homes away from Breezehome, because the walls of Whiterun are rather safe. Losing Lydia would crush me.  




 When I found out I sold the axe of Whiterun. I'm attached to Whiterun, so when I found out I sold that axe because level 8 me was scraping for money, I was pretty sad.  




 There's no getting out of these downvotes.

 [Dawnguard Spoiler](#dg "If you haven't been to (or found) Ancestor Glade yet, I definitely recommend it. It is by far, one of the most beautiful and mysterious places in the game. It's just south east of Peak's Shade Tower in a mountain near Falkreath. There's a few spriggans, but after getting past those, is a large cavern similar to the Gildergreen Sanctuary. There's odd trees with unharvestable bark (unless you have the proper tool) so bring the nettlebane if you have it in case that will work. This is one of those locations that I probably wouldn't have found if I didn't climb mountains a lot, so it's easy to miss but worth the travel. If anyone knows any more about it, sharing is great!") 




 Alright. Thanks!

 I don't hate Justin Bieber. I'm not a fan, but there's no reason to hate him. He probably makes more in ten minutes than I will in a lifetime, and it's just immature to hate him for songs he released years ago.  




 The only time I will cosplay or get even the slightest bit weird with my interest in anime, is at an anime con. It's a designated place and time for people that like anime to be a bit more open about it and it's a bit more accepted to let loose. I still refuse the weird noises.

 What kind of snacks would be appropriate for the plane? How much can I take on? They haven't told us if we would have any stops or if it would be one long flight.  




 Does this require a certain type of board? It looks like a higher flexibility would be ideal.  




 We're going to be in various cities for 12 days. The list says were visiting Madrid, Salamanca, Avila, Segovia, Toledo, Sevilla, Granada, and Barcelona. I think there's a couple other cities along with some free time trips where we can choose where to go.  




 In April I'll be going to Spain (and Europe in general) for my first time. This will also be my first time traveling out of the country. I'm going with school, so I'm a bit restricted on things I can bring and do. What would you recommend for things I bring for the plane and for the trip overall? We're staying with host families and hotels, and it's recommended we bring a gift for our hosts. What would you recommend as a gift? I've heard peanut butter is a good option, but I feel like a lot of students will be doing that. Any help is appreciated, as I know nothing about traveling. 

Also, do they have kinder surprise in Spain? I love them but the US has a problem with them. 

Edit: I'm going with my Spanish class, so language books are taken care of, but I will be looking into guide books!  




 Subway (sandwiches, not trains). 

-This rule goes in general for most cashiers, most likely. If I've already rung in your order and am getting your change, please don't dig in your pockets and say "oh, I have 48!" The register just told me what to give you and it's in my hand, I'm not calculating your new change when there's a line. Keep your 48. 

-Please don't shove your notebook or phone with a list of orders at me. I can't hold your grubby phone while making subs, and I know you can read. I don't mind if you come in with a list (I recommend this over a phone call!), but I can't touch it and i don't want to drop your stuff in the lettuce. 

-We don't have $5 footlongs anymore. No, I can't change the prices on your order because you didn't know. Please stop yelling at me; I didn't make the price change. 

-If you have a coupon, ask about it ahead of time. Like before you order. Nobody reads the coupons. Regular subs only. That doesn't mean a sub on regular bread. We're more than happy to help you with the menu-the new design is weird. 

TL;DR: don't change your payment when I'm giving you your change, and read the menu and your coupons ahead of time 

 




 I'll definitely be starting with a conventional grip, then. The girls on my team that have a finger tip drill are on varsity, so I can always get the ball re drilled when I get to that point, right?  




 I'm serious; I know it's kinda ridiculous. I have dumb fears for every new sport I take up. 

Are the rubber inserts necessary? All custom balls I've seen have them, but they look like an add on.  




 So I'm looking to get my first ball and have an idea of what to get. The problem is the holes. I've only bowled with house balls, but I've tried a couple of my teammates' balls and the finger holes just seem so small. And the rubber doesn't help. I don't want my fingers to get stuck while using it, and I don't want to dislocate my thumb after lofting it halfway down the lane. Anybody in the same boat at some point?  




 Blow outs are my biggest reason for going slow. And my ears are pretty thin and inelastic. Of course all of my friends who don't want to stretch have gorgeous lobes.  




 2g! Long journey, but I'll get there! 




 I was riding it the "wrong" way. I was using the tail as the nose. I'm glad I didn't mess anything up with my base. I'm also glad my bindings are an easy fix. Youtube will definitely be cheaper than a trip to the shop!  




 So my board has some problems. I told the guys at my shop that I was goofy, but I learned I'm regular. This happened because I was riding a plastic board from good will, so I sucked goofy and regular and picked one when I got a good board. I've been riding my board backwards. Is this a problem? I've seen it a couple times in videos, but I did it for pretty much a full season. 

Then there's the problem of my board sat in a closet all last season. Was this bad? It didn't go into it with an end of season wax or anything; Id only gotten it waxed once on the first season. 

My bindings are backwards. So, I'm assuming my stomp pad is now in the wrong spot and my safety strap thing is on the wrong foot. How do I fix all of this? 

Third, and probably my biggest problem is my base. It doesn't look too happy. It has a couple scratches, which are probably okay. But I think it has base burn. http://imgur.com/a/3faxR 
I scratched at it a bit in a small spot and it came off, so does it just need a good cleaning and waxing? I didn't know too much when I first got this board, so I wasn't too nice to it. I know a couple chips and scrapes are going to happen, but I don't want my base messed up this soon. 

It's a 5150 Velour, but the bindings are 5150 Empress. I've never done my own wax job before, so I don't have an iron or anything. My shop charges $50 for the tune up and $20 to fiddle with bindings, so I'm hoping to be able to do this myself. 

TL;DR: Please help me fix my board. It's backwards and burnt, and I don't know what I'm doing.  




 It looks around 8g, but I would recommend measuring it. 8g is about 3mm, so it shouldn't be more than .5mm off.  




 Although decades are increments of 10 so it doesn't work as much.  




 I had to start taping to make the 8-6 jump. It only took four weeks. I would do an inch of tape on the plugs every two weeks (changing the tape to keep it from getting gross every couple days). I would recommend going with PTFE and some glass wear Pyrex plugs. They're like $8 a pair on body art forms and their wearable is big enough so you don't have to trim the tape. At small sizes like 8, tape is finicky enough, so not having to trim makes it easier.  




 Also make sure to check local shops! They have great selection. The shop I go to is having a 40% off all jewelry sale.  




 That's what I was worried about. I don't quite know how placement would go or anything - Id leave that to the professional. Usually I test piercings with an old CBR to see how they look, but I don't have a spare industrial bar so I can't figure out if it would work. The only think I don't know about is if it would be able to go through the back of the forward helix comfortably.  




 Ah, sorry!  




 I've always liked the look of elf ears, but I'm not able to make the commitment to getting my ears sewn into a different shape due to not quite having a career path yet - and it's a big mod. I figured I could get sort of an illusion of elf ears with an inverted industrial. Kind of connecting an outer helix to a forward helix. Has anyone had this done? Is it even possible?  




 It looks a good half centimeter from where it was marked. Did he remark the placement and pierce there or just change the placement mid-piercing?  




 I'll have to try a pair. I thought it was a pretty heavy stone, so the reviews on BAF that called it light threw me off a bit. And it's price isn't too bad either.  




 Twisting a piercing is like twisting stitches. You want to heal that wound, not agitate it. Try to find an APP piercer, or one that had least taken some APP classes. I know not everyone has one locally, but it's worth a bit of a drive. This is a hole in your body. You don't want just anyone putting it there. I have some local piercers, but they're terrible so I waited until I could take an hour drive to an APP one. The mods here, and even many of the members would probably be able to point you in the right direction for a knowledgable piercer.  




 Which material have you found heaviest to wear? Not just stone vs wood, but stone vs stone and all that. I only have Quartz plugs, and they feel pretty heavy, but I don't have much to compare them to. When I get to my goal size, I want to wear heavier plugs to dead stretch a bit since some of my favorite plugs are double flare and I'll need the give. I'm not worried about price since I have time to save up, as long as it's not anatometal eyelets expensive.  




 I find that adjusting the water before getting in saves a lot of pain and hypothermia.  




 In the US, art classes tend to be only mandatory until 6th grade (age 12 or so). Leadership roles are everywhere, but students aren't pushed to innovate or create. There's a lot of pushing to take AP classes and Honors classes in favor of art. Also, arts funding is the first thing to get cut in schools. Some schools hardly have music programs.  




 He may have pierced her bigger than standard earrings, but not so big that she has to wear plugs. Most shops pierce at 14g for lobes, which is 2-3 sizes bigger than standard earrings. The jewelry might slide around a bit in her ears, but it should be fine. If the jewelry she has in now looks like it's about 2mm in diameter or less, she can just wear some smaller sized jewelry and downsize.  




 I've always had pretty thin lobes, and with stretching I've been worried about them getting thinner. I'm only going up to a 2g (at a pretty slow pace), but I'm stretching my second holes so there's less lobe to begin with. I know downsizing and going back up is a method to thicken up lobes. How effective is this? Right now my wearable is a little under 1/4 inch (going off of my earskins), so I need some help.  




 BAF also has great shipping rates. I think it's roughly $5 for USPS priority shipping and only $1 insurance on any order. I've never passed up the insurance yet and all of my orders come in under a week. I think they have a free shipping deal, but I don't know the rate on it.  




 Your lobes look great! I'm jealous!  




 Wasn't trying to be an ass, I was just trying to avoid the shot glass method.  




 I have a fresh conch piercing, so I want to avoid bumping my ear on a cup.  




 How exactly do you do a sea salt soak? I've seen salt:water ratios all over this subreddit but not how to do it. I've been using H2Ocean so I've been just spraying it on. I've heard of putting your lobes in a shot glass of the water, but my lobes aren't quite big enough for that. Bowl? Cotton ball? I want to make my lobes happy without spraying salt water everywhere.  




 I had to start taping to get up to a 6g. After 4 weeks, I was at a 6. I added an inch or so of tape every two weeks and was there in no time. My ears aren't very stretchy, so yours might tape up quicker. But make sure to take taping slow as well since you're still stretching your skin.  And keep them well oiled!  




 Yup. I got mine in a kit, but you could probably find some separately.  




 [meh.com](http://meh.com)  




 I always thought it was a goat with a pipe.. 




 Where exactly do you plan on taking the laptop that you don't want the school to know about? They know your address. They know where libraries are. If you stop at McDonalds on the way home, they won't care. Chances are, the location tracking is to prevent theft and to track the Chromebook if it's lost or stolen. The tech department has more important things to worry about than looking at the whereabouts of teenagers and their school laptops. If you're worried about the thing having access to the webcam without your permission, cover it with a post it. Use it responsibly and you shouldn't have anything to worry about. It's a big investment for the school so naturally they have a lot of security measures in place. Use your own device to play around and do things you don't want your teachers to know about. If they take screenshots of you writing a paper or taking notes, then they'll just know that you're working.  




 Go naked over night and see how far that takes your lobes. If your lobes downsize to an 8 or so, just stick in some 10's and let your ears do their thing.  




 I'm getting kind of sick of wearing the same tunnels or captives in my 14g lobes. I've seen some amazing anatometal studs but I don't know how to get them. Are they just labrets or are they a custom piece?  




 If you don't have a gauge card, such as the freebies from BAF, you could use a caliper or a ruler to measure your tapers and match them to a gauge size chart. Some sizes will have a bit of deviation, but most are on target. In regards to neosporin, I wouldn't recommend it. Head over to walmart and pick up a bottle of vitamin e oil. Much better for stretching and much cheaper.  




 Ultimately, they are your parents, so their decision is what you want to go by to keep tension lo was long as they're the boss. My dad doesn't want me "gauging" at all, yet my mom doesn't care much either way. My goal size is 2g so it's easy to hide, especially at my correct 8g. I'd recommend talking to your parents and make sure to show your dad that you know the proper and safe way to stretch and be stretched and the consequences that come with stretching along with how you plan on dealing with employment (parents love to use that one). If your dad is still against it after you try to show that stretching isn't the end of the world, show cooperation and agree to downsize until you're an adult. If anything, he will see it as a sign of maturity and change his mind, especially as parents tend to see stretched ears as rebellion. Cooperation completely breaks that. 

TL;DR: talk to them and cooperate with your parents. The worst that can happen is your dad doesn't budge and you have to downsize until you're an adult.  




 Don't just save coins. Keep low value coins (pennies for Americans, penny equivalent for those outside the US) completely separate from all the other coins. They take up a lot of space for not giving much value. Dimes are smaller than pennies and sure do cash in for more! Sorting the change is a bit tedious, but you get a lot more back at the change machine.  




 Too many customers answer "yes" to questions where it just doesn't work. Even worse are the ones who are staring at their phones and answer "yes" to "what kind of bread for that?" 




 Just waiting until the next size slides in is probably the best way to stretch! I only clean my ears with H2ocean when they're super irritated or the week after a new stretch. For taping, a common size to start is the jump from 8 to 6. I think it's the first full millimeter, so it's a bit harder for ears to adjust. However, when you start taping is completely up to your ears.  




 I've thought about if this could exist for convenience, but there's not much of a way this could be made with a safe material. Niobium is flexible, but their description made it should like they were trying to eliminate high cost. The closest effective thing to these would be Snap Plugs. The idea of an expanding plug is cool, but I can't think of how it would be safe.  




 Losing plugs sucks! I'll probably do the earskins or naked since earskins are water safe.  




 I'm going out to a lake in a few days and was wondering what type of plugs I should wear while swimming. I want to wear my earskins since they will float if they do pop out, but I don't know if they're okay for water.  




 They're nice and lightweight. I always give them a good rubdown with vitamin e before wearing them and make sure my ears are nice and oiled up. They're super comfortable to wear. I occasionally have to oil throughout the day because they do get a little dry and a little paranoia goes a long way with ears. I usually use holey buttr for that since carrying around a bottle of oil looks a bit odd. I'm definitely looking forward to more horn jewelry.  




 I've only bought one pair of horn hangers from Oracle, but they're amazing. They were great quality and a decent price. I have plans to save up for some pieces from One Tribe, but until then, I'll have to get a couple more from Oracle.  




 I find that Oracle is a quite good brand. They have some pretty reasonable prices as well, although are still on the pricey side overall. One Tribe has some great looking pieces and is pretty widely approved of as well.   




 Our store has a tip jar that we use to bring up the register when it's short. At the end of your shift, you count the drawer. If it's short on your shift, you fix it. I don't know if that's just us, or universal. A few cents is passable, but a dollar or more needs to be fixed. We know subway isn't a restaurant entitled to tips, so throwing that $1.06 in from the tip jar usually doesn't bother anyone. Our owner definitely doesn't mind when we keep the drawer even or above.  




 Veggies expire  (by subway standards) after two days, so they should never be sitting in the cooler 2 days before serving. Most veggies are prepped that day, though. Maybe a difference of a couple hours, but don't make an employee check labels because you want some fresh veggies. If you're the only one there and the employees seem like they're in a decent mood, they might slice a tomato or green pepper just for you. But don't pull that an hour before close. Chances are the back is cleaned up or close to it.  




 "I'll have the white cheese." Thank you. That has now narrowed it down to 4 out of 5 of our cheeses. Some continue to insist on the white one after I ask which one.  




 The employees control an alarm clock radio in back, broken radio in front. Usually a pop station, but sometimes I get the luck of rock or silence.  




 Has anyone set up a way for them to meet up yet? They would probably have some pretty interesting conversations. 




 I'll have to grab some next week. I knew my lobes were a bit on the thin side, but they didn't seem that thin. At least since they're clearing out they'll be nice and cheap! 




 I just got my first few pairs of earskins. They're amazing all around except that the wearable seems off. I got 5/16 since that seemed to be the common size and didn't seem too big. When I put them in, it seemed like they had a massive bit sticking out. In pictures I've seen of earskins, they're really close to the ear. Should I have gotten a smaller wearable or is this a common thing and I just have to keep them pushed back?  




 What is even happening in this thread anymore 




 Apparently when I was younger, I would never actively wake my parents. I would just tiptoe into their room and stare at them until their parent meter went off. Usually service was pretty slow.  




 Can someone tell me why we hate this? 




 Thanks! I couldn't tell if it was an orbital or a nicely placed conch. I was thinking of getting it for my birthday, but wanted to avoid having to pay for two piercings.  




 I'm thinking about finally adding to my piercings. I was thinking about getting [this](https://gs1.wac.edgecastcdn.net/8019B6/data.tumblr.com/6d8e5f3655b194ee6ce6fd889a48e600/tumblr_n5dznyV5PW1s7gqgho1_500.jpg) but I don't know if it's an orbital or a conch. I also don't know what size of captives to wear in it. It seems like it would be bigger than those you would wear in a septum diameter wise, but I'm not sure. Opinions/help from anyone with any knowledge on this piercing would be appreciated! 




 What is your current size? What type of tape are you using? Bondage tape and PTFE have different thicknesses, and your current size definitely matters. 




 I know it's too steep to ride. But it would be fun if it was rideable. It's just a massive rail that at first glance seems fun to ride.  




 Some subways have drive thrus, so this might be the case (not likely though). OP either visited an extremely low standard subway that barely passes inspection or OP works at subway and did it for the karma. Hell, there isn't even herbs on that herb and cheese.  




 I can agree with this. No subway employee is this sloppy. And there's no reason for the bread to have been mutilated as it was wrapped. Granted, the sandwiches aren't usually like the picture, but they're not horrible either.  




 I'll have to post there too, thanks! I couldn't find a subreddit for spots so I figured here was broad enough.  









 TIL I'm a guy.  




 So it's a real placenta? I was hoping it was just some really good latex work... 




 No problem :) 




 If you really want to see if it will look good on you for yourself, pick up a cheap captive bead ring and stick it on your nose. I did that to test septum and lip piercings. And since CBRs are common in septums, it was pretty helpful.  




 After hearing this, I'll definitely be getting some wood plugs for my goal size. My problem ear absolutely hates anything that's not a good long soak in vitamin e.  




 I'd say you should pick up a cheap bottle of vitamin e oil or stop wearing the tape while you don't have access to your usual oils. That way everything stays oily and lobes are the one place that's okay.  




 PTFE becomes transparent with oil. A trick used to make it go in better is to oil until it's relatively transparent. It's not thinning or dissolving or anything. That's just the tape absorbing oils and getting clear. Like toilet paper or something. PTFE is also a very drying tape because of it so try to oil it more than thoroughly.  




 Cheap steel is bad steel. 




 I'm not able to downsize because all of my tunnels started rusting; that's why I switched back to my CBRs. 




 I've only been wearing steel from BAF; these piercings have yet to see acrylic 




 I have both my ears stretched to 8g, and my left ear is fine. My right ear, on the other hand, became really irritated a couple days ago. I've been at 8g for about two months now so it's not due to a recent stretch, and I'm wearing the same CBR's I've worn in the past. It's red and slightly painful, almost dry, although I use vitamin e oil on both ears. I haven't changed any care that I've been doing. Maybe I slept on it funny? It doesn't feel like a tear. Has anyone else had this and possibly know how to fix it? 




 Ah, thank you 




 I looked at the site (been looking for some labradorite) and one of the options is wear size. Is this any different than the other size option? 




 I've been using the immersion reading feature on my kindle with a book for the past couple weeks, and this morning I turned on my kindle to return to my book and the feature was just gone. I can access the ebook and audiobook separately, but the option to use the audiobook with the ebook is no longer available. My kindle is relatively new so it's still under warranty, but I'm hoping there's an easier fix than sending it to get fixed.  




 Comfortable stretches is always great! I've been hearing surgical steel everywhere but glass seemed like it would be safe as well.  




 I'm in Wisconsin, so I've been looking for a material that's a bit less chilly.  




 I've been using steel tapers and single flare tunnels, but I'm wondering if glass is also an option since it seems a bit more comfortable and nicer looking than the steel.  




 I have zero experience with McDonald's excellent customer service.  




 I had that fun moment at 12g. One of the best moments ever. It's like becoming an astronaut after wanting to be one since age 6. 
























 Precalc is a much harder course than AP Stats. At my school, people take it as an alternative to precalc. If you're comfortable taking two math classes at once, go for it. The two classes aren't too related-pretty much opposite types of math. Precalc has a lot of algebra and trig where stats has a lot of...stats. I've heard there is much more writing that a typical math class as well. 

Does your school offer AP Macro/Micro economics? If so, take those. Relatively easy courses if you stay on top of the readings as notes, and they're fairly interesting. Taking precalc would be wise since it would better prepare you for any math classes you choose in college. 

In short, if you're willing to do two math classes at once, go for AP Stats and international relations along with precalc.  




 Honestly, the cake chapstick is my favorite from the brand. It feels much less waxy than the other flavors, which is a shame because I love the other flavors. I do like that the cake flavoring/scent isn't too intense.  




 Maybe that's why I thought blue would look nice! I've been living on mobile, so everything's white. 

I do have a Walmart, but there's nail polish everywhere and it's poorly lit. I'm relying on Walgreens to pick up the slack. I have two of those, so drugstore products should be much easier for me to grab.  




 Maybe a blue color scheme? Not much reasoning for this - blue is just a nice color. It's the opposite of pink but still goes nicely with pink, so there's that. 

I think air for posts would be fantastic! Product review, product request, swatches, dupe, dupe request, FOTD, and list of favorites is all I can think of for flairs, but that's what's usually posted in the makeup subs. 

Honestly, I love how fast this sub grew. My nearest makeup stores besides Kohls are 45 minutes away, and my wallet is always afraid of going with!  




 I prefer to let it thunk onto the couch. Not the best way to practice a release, but much better for the floor. Does the bean bag add good cushioning?  




 Hot or cold sub? I get six inches, so just double anything number specific if you're going for a footlong. 

If you're looking for a hot sub, steak and cheese on Italian herbs and cheese. I get it toasted with provolone and pepper jack alternating. For veggies, I do lettuce, just enough spinach to cover the lettuce, green peppers, and onions. Mayo, oil, pepper, and oregano. Most delicious sub on the planet. 

For a good cold sub, I go with a BMT on herb and cheese. I always change the cheese on this depending how I feel that day. Today I'd throw american on, but I've used everything down to mozzarella. Lettuce, just two spinach leaves (since I make my own subs and can be difficult with veggies; gauge the artist on this one), tomatoes, two cucumbers (I'm not a big fan, but they add something), green peppers, yellow peppers, and olives. Then add mayo, chipotle, oil, pepper, oregano, and parmasean. 

Definitely bend the subs a bit to fit your own tastes or if your store doesn't offer something I suggested.  




 You're eating an entire foot of food. First, think of the loaf of bread. That's a lot of bread. Next, think of the meats, cheese, and sauces. These three things are quite fatty (usually) which will help keep you satiated. Next, you have veggies. These are going to be more nutrient dense than french fries so they'll keep you fuller longer. 

A footlong sub is a lot of food, and it will feel like it. Just be careful eating these too often. I feel bad when I get the same customer every time I work. The sodium amounts alone on these things are ridiculous.  




 I'll have to try this if oil removers don't work. I have some pretty greasy lids, so I want to avoid adding to that, but if the oils work, then I'll accept that they work.  




 Join something! I waited until my junior year to join a sport and it stung. Sports at my school are a bit pricey so my parents didn't want to, but they realized the value of a sport after a college tour. 

If you don't want to join a sport, that's fine. I'm not the best athlete and I joined bowling for my sport so I won't push a sport. There is a ton of other things to do while in high school. 

Get a job. If you do this, hold the job and keep your grades up. If you don't have much extra going on through school, a job will help you save up for college and your boss might just connect you with someone who can land you that internship your freshmen year of college. Having a good relationship with your manager or supervisor is also good as they can serve as a reference on your resume. 

Volunteer! Some schools have clubs for this, others don't. If yours doesn't, start researching local volunteer opportunities. Humane societies and elderly homes are just a couple things that come to mind. Colleges love to see 100+ volunteer hours, and you could build that up over summer. That's barely over 4 days. Just make sure you document these hours. Talk to your counselor and see if volunteer hours go on your transcript. 

Don't have any clubs at your school that you're interested in? You can start with a special interest group, or a big club such as Model United Nations or Bots IQ. You're likely going to need a teacher to help you start a club. If it's one of the bigger clubs such as Model UN or Bots, there may be some fees associated with these, but colleges find participating in more major clubs a very big plus. 

There are lots of things to do in high school, you just have to find them. Flyer for an event on the wall? Flyer asking for students to help set something up or run an event? Grab a couple friends, or even go on your own, and try it out. Worst case scenario is that you don't like it and you move on.  




 Colleges like to see rigor, but they also like to see success. I'll have 7 AP classes under my belt by the time I'm out of high school. A few of those were more challenging alternatives to a required course, so they just ended up being the better option. I have all B's in my AP courses, but at my junior conference I was told that would be more impressive to admissions than A's in common core classes. 

The best way to benefit from AP is make sure you take courses that you can hold a 78% or higher in and courses that you are confident you will get the credit for. If money is a challenge for your family, don't load up on AP since the test is $80 per class, although your school might offer assistance options. Check with your guidance councilor on those. 

Overall, you need to assess your own abilities. If you haven't chosen courses for next year already, look at your current classes. Are there any in a subject that you found easy and want an extra challenge in? Does your school offer any AP classes that are interesting? Are you at Spanish/German/etc level 4 this year or through your junior year? Your school might offer an AP level 5 that is challenging, but you will have 4 years of experience in. (Your school's foreign language system may be a bit different than this).  




 So I've been working on tight lining and doing a wing with liquid liner and I must ask: how the hell do you get it all off? I have eyeliner all over my upper waterline and in my lashes and it's just impossible to get off. I've tried using baby soap since my eyes don't take well to anything but sitting and scrubbing between lashes with a q-tip is a royal pain.  




 I found that my 8g were much easier to put in than the 6g im at now. Just lubed it up and popped it in. I guess earskins are something everyone has a different experience with.  




 It really makes me feel bad. People come in and order and ask where the $5 footlongs are and I just tell them they're gone. Some people just leave. At our store, sales dropped a bit after the new menus and prices came out.  




 I think the lack of drugstore testers is what attributes to a lot of Ultas used product problems. I was hoping to get my foundation there as a drugstore one, but I couldn't swatch any of it! 

MAC online is definitely a more comfortable experience. While I was at the Macy's counter, I swatched a few shadows to see what I should add to my list since I was already way over my limit for the day. Definitely felt better over there than in the store. I feel like the store is there for people who know exactly what they're looking for and aren't too concerned with how much it costs. Maybe that'll be me in a few years, but for now I'm just fine with swatching at Macy's and picking up some products online.  




 So do we. Our manager had it tucked off to the side on top of the hotwell for the first week we had it, put people started claiming they didn't see it so we moved it to on top of bread selection. I really wish it was easier to differentiate the type of subs. The premiums add up pretty quickly.  




 This was pretty much how my experience went! I guess I got lucky compared to others here; the staff at my Ulta were all very willing to help and seemed to know what they were doing. The store was also very clean and well stocked. Only problem I had was the used products problem. I bought two NYX concealer sticks and right before I got to the register, I realized one was used! They weren't even sealed! Still signed up for the rewards card since my good experience definitely calls for a revisit. 

I also went to Sephora, MAC, and I browsed the MAC selection at Macy's since the actual store was a bit intimidating. Sephora was what I expected, I probably should have accepted the employees' help after circling the store three times for a beauty blender! I think with MAC, I'll be sticking to the Macy's counter. It seemed to be all the same things but with prices posted and less people glaring at me.  




 Some coupons are location specific. Was it a printed coupon or from one of those official coupon clipper things or the newspaper? Granted, even if it is a bigger coupon, they may still not accept. They should change their sign to say as such. 

On the other hand, that employee may have a rude and/or lazy one. In my store, we accept any coupon we can, but a sign for showing coupons ahead of time would be great. Often, people will bring in BOGO coupons, get three steak subs, then at the register I have to explain to them why the coupon is invalid. 

The new menus make using coupons really tough on customers since they don't list subs as regular or premium anymore, so a lot of people come in thinking anything without extra cheese or bacon works with a coupon.  




 Nice coverstock, good brand, decent price, not too strong of a ball, and it looked and smelled great.  




 I find that sticking to my diet is a lot easier when I accept invitations to go out to eat. Granted, I make sure it's not an every day event. But I allow some time for a treat and just try to order something healthier when I'm out to eat. I know that when I get home and when I eat tomorrow, I'll be right back on the diet train. If anything, I'll do a little extra cardio. 

With the comments, I try to block them out with people that I don't know too well. If it's a closer friend that I know I can say a dick comment to, I'll give them a snarky reply and it usually shuts them down. One of my friends is pretty against eating healthy and thinks it below them, so I go out of my way to point out how energized I feel and how I'm just not lethargic at all whenever she complains about being tired or groggy.  




 Definitely will! I'm a bit of a receipt hoarder - never know when you'll need them! Do you have any experience with returns with them?  




 Lorac is one of the big reasons I want to go. The Kohls by me just got the Pro and Unzipped (gold?) palettes, but I wanted to check out Ulta before grabbing them at Kohls. I'm glad they have more drugstore brands since I'm on a bit of a budget. I'm just worried that with my luck I'll end up purchasing products people have decided to test!  




 Just checked the search! I guess they have a pretty huge used products problem? The one I'm headed to is new, so I hope it's not too prevalent there just yet, but I guess if it is pretty terrible, there's a Sephora 5 minutes away from the Ulta and a JCPenny Sephora on my way home.  




 Finally got an Ulta kinda near me, about 45 minutes away, so I'll hopefully be taking my first trip down there tomorrow with a friend. 

Anyone here have good or bad experiences to share about the store? Are the prices decent? Is it like Sephora? Better? 

I'm hoping to splurge on some nice foundation or a palette, but don't want to over spend.  




 I just love hearing myself talk. I do a lot of speaking before I think, so sometimes hearing whatever flies out of my mouth is fun. I also hate conversation lulls. They're just not fun. So I need to push the conversation with something.  




 I feel like it's really a trend among all subways. They simply don't put value on the employees that keep the store running and customers coming back. I have a feeling they prefer having more disposable employees that don't ever expect a raise.  




 Maybe a trapper keeper style binder? My cousin has one of the loose textbooks and he keeps the chapter he's using in a separate binder from the big one the rest of the book is in. Doing that might help lower the risk of damaging/losing all of the pages while only using a fraction of them.  




 My approach. I bounce in my approach and my coach hates it. My feet never really leave the ground, but on my first step I'll drop low, then pop up, and repeat until I'm at the line. He showed me a video of me bowling one day at practice and I looked pretty silly.  




 Thank you so much! I'll probably get their new quad, but I'm definitely going to pair it up with that Maybelline palette!  




 Generally, keep oils out of a fresh stretch for a week or so until it's healed. I find it best to do massages with the jewelry out so it gets into the piercing and the piercing has time to relax. 

For cleaning, when the stretch is fresh, it's okay to do a soak with the jewelry in, just like its a fresh piercing. If the stretch is all healed up then you can take the jewelry out for sea salt soaks.  




 I'll have to check out Amazon then! I wouldn't mind branching out from the one palette though. The white, a couple different browns, and maybe a gray or something would make an ideal palette for me right now. My makeup experience is some Walmart mascara and a one eye wing so I'm not too picky just yet. I'd be willing to spend ~$10 on a palette right now, give or take a bit until I get a bit more confident in my skills. I picked up a $15 Balm quad and ended up hating it after a good 2 uses and gave it to a coworker who loves Balm products and makeup.  




 Would one off amazon be safe? I don't know when these were discontinued, so I don't quite know if the product would be good. If there's a chance that one off amazon wouldn't be the greatest, something similar would be great. I really loved the colors and the formula so anything similar would work.  




 Sorry! Here's an Amazon link - should be desktop. Totally forgot it was a mobile site! 

http://www.amazon.com/Physicians-Formula-Mineral-Eyeshadow-Minerals/dp/B0017138OG 




 http://m.rakuten.com/product/270255096?listingid=356071630 adid=29963

That was my favorite eyeshadow a couple years ago when I was rocking the middle school look. White shadow and black waterline. 

But it was a great quality eyeshadow and I tossed it before writing down the name. Regretted that until I tracked it down. I think this is the product, although the far left color was white on my quad. 

Does anybody know of where I can get this product or a good dupe of it? It was a Physicians Formula Mineral Wear quad but I don't know exactly which colors. I feel like it was discontinued ages ago since I can't find it anywhere on the PF website.   




 I'll have to pick up some. Don't want an injury hurting my game more than it has to!  




 I got a pretty rad blister at practice last Thursday, and I have a meet tonight.

Do you guys have any blister solutions? It's pretty painful and dry. I'll probably throw tape over tonight to bowl, but is there anything I can do to make it heal a bit faster or at least hurt less? 

My thumb hole isn't the problem, my thumb size just fluctuates a ton and I didn't put tape on when my thumb told me I needed tape. Ended up blistering then ripping. Life lessons from bowling.  




 I always said read it as erissd. If the movies are good for one thing, it's pronunciation!

First two are in natural light and second two were in the bathroom. I don't have much experience with makeup beyond mascara, so anything is helpful!  




 You could ask the employees, but they'll definitely look at you funny. I don't even know if we're allowed to do that. You could always add it afterwards. 

With the prices, they've been going up for a while. Over here in the Midwest, our new menus are really enraging customers. Cheapest sub is $4 and its a six inch. Cheapest footlong is $5.75. I have a feeling subway is slowly moving away from the $5 footlong since it's not too profitable. 

Overall, prices and cheeses are very reasonable. You could decide on your favorite store in your area and talk to them about adding provolone to their options. Chances are, it's very available to them, they just don't know if there's a demand for it. If you'll buy it, they might just add it since it's not a discontinued item.  




 Definitely! Kaos is so comfy and easy to wear-best sleeping jewelry. Just gotta keep them oily. Silicone is pretty dry, especially this time of year.  




 What brand are they? Kaos earskins are super clear, even lubed up, and have a tiny flare. 

 




 It feels great! I gained ~4-6 pounds over Christmas and this morning when I weighed in, it was all gone. Getting back to healthy was hard after all the eggnog and leftovers, but it's rewarding.  




 Pick up some glass single flare from a piercing shop or body art forms. Much easier to stretch with and much safer. Also, head over to Menards or Home Depot (or any hardware store) and pick up a roll of PTFE tape. It's a good $1 or so and IIRC, it's a bit thinner than bondage tape so it's easier to stretch with. Also, the emu oil or vitamin e oil should help more than jojoba for stretching since they're a bit slicker than jojoba. Just remember to completely saturate the PTFE before you wear it or it'll dry out your ears. 

My ears aren't very stretchy either. Just gotta go slow and spoil them.  




 It's okay for it to be a bit pink on the inside, especially after a fresh stretch. You're on the right track though! Stick with quality jewelry, and you're doing the right thing with massages. Also, you might be able to size up in a month, but if your ears start saying no halfway down the taper, it's okay to wait. Some people have no problem getting through small sizes and others take a while to size up from the start. 

Also, be prepared for a bit of frustration, and don't be like me and try to calculate when you'll be at your goal size. You'll be disappointed due to time between stretches increasing with size. It took me 4 months to go from 8g to 6g and I eventually got frustrated and taped up. It's the first full mm stretch, so it's a bit of a fight. Whenever you feel ready to just shove the taper through or add one more layer of tape than usual, look at some of the posts by people who've blown out and you'll want to wait. There's people here with 2" ears. Your goal size is possible. They didn't get there over night, or even in a couple months. 

It's a bit early so I rambled a bit, but stick with generally accepted methods, good jewelry, and don't rush at all. You're asking early, so you're getting a head start on healthy lobes!  




 No problem! I work at subway so I eat quite a bit of subs. Gotta get it into mfp somehow! Took a bit of googling, but I think this site is gonna stay a favorite as long as it has my favorite subs.  




 So tonight was my first meet at a high oil lane and a longer lane than I'm used to. It was also extremely cold on the bus ride to the alley and in the alley.

My home and proshop alley is nice and room temperature and it's also been a warm winter, so when I got drilled, my thumb was a bit bigger, if not swollen. During practice before we started, my ball fell off my hand. Just dropped. Anyone else ever have the problem of a suddenly too big thumb hole? Usually my thumb swells and needs tape and everything, but today I couldn't feel the hole snug on all sides. This led to me gripping the ball and doing terribly. Should I put in some white tape? The cold weather is sticking around now, but I don't want to be where I usually am with my thumb pretty much stuck and tape in my thumb slug. 

Now my next big problem. I have a Tropical Breeze, so it's a low to medium oil ball. These lanes were drenched. My usual strike shot is standing at 17/18 and target at the second arrow. I ended up having to stand at 23 and target the third arrow to get anywhere near the pocket. No hook at all, or revs. I was really regretting not getting the Crux I was eyeing up since this is my first ball. I've read it's high oil? 

TL;DR: How do you bowl high oil with a low oil ball? Any solutions when it's so cold that my ball fits like a house drill? Bad meet due to conditions, and I want to know how to improve, especially on those conditions since I'm at that alley again next week.  




 I found a website that lets you add everything you got on your sub and it shows a full nutrition label with calories and macros. Super helpful, although the sodium content in my favorite subs makes me feel a bit guilty about eating so much subway. 

https://nutritionix.com/subway/nutrition-calculator 




 These are gorgeous! Rainbow fluorite is one of my favorite stones next to labradorite. I finally checked out this site and my size is just smaller than what they carry. The prices are great though! I'll have to find a friend to wear all these plugs for me.  




 I drink strawberry slim fast powder for breakfast. Granted, it gets mixed with milk instead of water. It keeps me full for about two and a half hours, although it says 4. It's about $10/can where I am, and you get 14 shakes out of it.  




 I think a smiley would look good. It's subtle, but it still looks nice when it shows. And lots of jewelry options with CBRs and horseshoes.  




 Personally, I don't care for the whole one ear stretched look. But I also don't have a taste for one lobe pierced, or any unbalanced piercings. Ultimately it comes down to taste. If anything, your biggest problem with it will be finding plugs you love, and you're stuck paying for a pair since they're not available in singles.  




 Tumblr is the place that would hate you. I've seen so many anti-capitalism posts there.  




 Parents travelled and I had work so I couldn't tag along. Friend I had plans with cancelled, other friends just wanted to go to bed. New Years is pretty lame without other people. 

2015 resolution: find cooler friends.  




 Same with my town. Although, it's down the road from AutoZone and Advance Auto Parts. I don't see the strategy there at all. But at least my local RadioShack is still going strong.  




 I have a problem similar to this. The pad on my ring finger catches on my grip during release, and gets a bit sore after a game or two. I don't have much of a solution for it yet, beyond keeping my hand cool so it doesn't swell. I assume it's just anatomy making bowling difficult, but it's my first ball, so it might be something your pro shop guy can do something about.  




 DB ancient shrouded armor all the way! I always add the Volsung mask because breathing underwater is nice and the carry weight improvement is helpful. It's also a glitched mask that you can wear with the ancient shrouded hat/mask/cowl/thing.  




 I aim for strikes too, but a cool looking strike is so much better than a textbook strike.  




 What about using a plastic cup/bowl? Too lazy/not enough time to use the stove for 1/2 cup of water for oatmeal.  




 I got a pair of 14g tunnels in a kit. It was pretty exciting. You can see through them, but it takes a bit of wiggling your lobe and a well lit area.  




 I'd actually like to learn two handed, but my coach wants us bowling one handed. It's what he does, so it's easier for him to teach, and midseason isn't really the time to switch I guess. I like the amount of power it puts on the ball. It's cool. Power shots are my goal every time I bowl.  




 Even when against a rival school at a meet, all of the teams in my section can't help but congratulate them. When something like that happens, just seeing it is exciting.  




 I prefer when they leave it in the tin so the lava doesn't get all over, but the only time they've done that they didn't skip the sugar so it still looked okay.  




 South wisconsin is a terrible place to be this year. It was raining yesterday and is forecasted for the rest of the week! The lack of snow is really killing any Christmas spirit I had a couple months ago.  




 Fast traveling EVERYWHERE. I would occasionally spend a couple hours just dedicated to discovering (but not exploring) places just so I could fast travel when needed. If I couldn't fast travel to a place I needed to get to, I would wander through a mountainous shortcut that didn't have anything interesting, although I accidentally explored labrynthian and didn't realize until a good 6 months later when I realized what labrynthian was.  




 A labret post the right length definitely wouldn't be out of the ordinary. It's what good shops use for cartilage and lobe piercings. Your shop should be able to fit you with the right jewelry.  




 Plugs and tunnels will be a rare find at that size. An internally threaded labret or a captive bead ring would work. I was lucky to get a kit with a 16g taper, but it didn't come with jewelry in 16g, so I had to pick up some captives.  




 I'll buy six boats with this.  




 Wouldn't the school be evacuated and searched in the case of a bomb?  




 Hiders are definitely a good option, although I'd opt for one of the brighter options  




 If anything, silicone. Earskins or the plugs are squishy enough to have enough give if someone manages to punch you in the ear, although earskins would be preferable since it would be less likely to shove the jewelry through. 

Although now I'm thinking of someone's finger getting caught in the earskins. 

Just take your ears off for the night.  




 Bae, bruh, swaggy, hella, your mom jokes. It's terrible.  




 Get them soaking and happy before you start changing jewelry around too much. You should really look into getting some jewelry that isn't acrylic. Even some cheap stainless steel would be better and your ears would have a better time healing. I don't change jewelry types around until my ears are comfortable and healed so they don't get irritated while they're healing.  




 It's Vargas. Just accept it and embrace it.  




 So I got my ball back from being drilled, and it has some excess superglue smudged on it an inch or so away from the thumb hole. Is there a safe way to get it off?  




 Thanks! I add a little butter to the pan or milk if they're scrambled, but that's it. Calorie counts on mfp can be a bit sketchy.  




 This question feels like a pretty bad question, but myfitnesspal has really thrown me off with it. Does the way you prepare an egg change the calories? 

I've seen it range from 90 to nearly 400 just from different types of eggs. I love my eggs scrambled or fried, but these are showing up as over 200 calories! One egg isn't that filling on its own, so I don't want it to take up that much of my count.  




 The U.S. is pretty damn big compared to Europe. Often times driving is necessary to get to places outside of large cities. We need gas, so the high demand drags down the prices.  




 I'll have to try this. Apparently my biggest problem is hooking my hand around the ball and not clinging to it during the release, so this should definitely help with those.  




 Exactly. Raising your children with WIC would do little harm, as you can only purchase healthy foods with it and you go in for health checks. I'm just wondering if a male is able to access the program or if the mother of the kid was involved? Women Infants and Children seems to be narrowed on the mother-child relationship.  




 Olive oil, lemon juice, oregano, and dillweed added to taste. You can cook it in the slow cooker if you prefer it more tender, or fry it up in a pan of you prefer a bit more firm of chicken. I use breast for this since it's easy to dice.  




 Meet on Monday went terrible. Our team only has 3 so we get 6 frames a game, and we lost a game with only 4 frames in a game. 

Practice went great, though, although nothing I did followed my coach. He wanted me to get more revs on the house ball because I was skidding to the point of rolling with a slight backwards spin. Okay, more revs it is. There's the gutter. Skid the ball down the lane? Strike it is. House balls are bad. 

And for the reason I was on a house ball. I took my ball in last week Wednesday to get drilled, and the pro shop guy said Friday or so. I couldn't pick it up over the weekend, so it didn't matter that it was Friday. I'd get it my next practice on Tuesday. Pro shop guy isn't in. No problem. I go in on Wednesday to pick it up and the pro shop guy said the papers got moved around so he couldn't drill it over the weekend. Now, I'm not exactly mad about this. I'm getting the drilling at a huge discount and I'll finally have my ball so in pretty excited, I'm just worried about only having one practice on it before the meet next Monday. I'll have to come in over the weekend to practice with it since it's my first fingertip. I'm hoping it bumps my average over 100 and my fill above 55%.

If you guys have any at-home tips I can use to get used to my ball, it would be super appreciated.  




 Boy or girl? These things are vital to naming!  




 A girl at my school went 14-2 over the weekend with acrylic. Nice girl, but makes some really cringey choices with mods. It's sad to see people with nice lobes just destroy them.  




 If you're only at 4g (5mm), then you could probably get away with going naked for the interview. Just leave your plugs out for the day before to make sure they shrink up a little bit (you can always stretch back if you go down a size). As long as you don't have any catbutt going, it shouldn't be too noticeable.  




 I'm writing a program that makes an applet and creates arrays for a class. I have most of the program built, I just can't figure out the if statement. Basically, I have 3 separate arrays with each array named after a different job position. The user inputs a name in the applet and it displays the position the name is associated with. I can't figure out how to write an if statement along the lines of "if this name is from this array, display this". I can't post the code now since I'm on mobile, but I can post it later.  




 Not the realization that I gained 20 lbs over the summer, but the fact that it was my fault. I'm on depo and weight gain is a side effect, so it was a nice scapegoat. Until I downloaded myfitnesspal and realized I was eating nearly 4000 calories a day (sometimes more) and not working out at all. I'm not too big, but I want to do something about it before I get there. Obesity is in my family and I don't want to be a part of it.  




 Leaf. Was at a mall and a little kid comes up to me and tries to play. Up comes mom calling, "Leaf! Come over here! We have to get going, Leaf!" And then he goes over to some other people sitting on a nearby couch. "Hi! I'm Leaf!" I just looked at the lady. She kept calling the kid by name and I couldn't believe these people even existed. Maybe it was Leif, but I doubt this was the type of lady to name her kid after a Viking.  




 I always wonder if Willam ever takes his own advice. His lips are always so intense. It worries me in some of his videos. He always brings the butthole rule up when he's wearing a very bright and shiny lip.  




 I'm getting a ball off of this line! How long does the scent last and what scent did you get?  




 It's through school, so any consumption with alcohol isn't allowed and if caught, we get sent home. Host families are adjusting dinner times for us since they know we're on a different schedule. I would go for the food, but I think we have a curfew.  
























 I could handle ebooks. I prefer a solid book over them, but I didn't get a kindle for nothing. Sometimes it slips me as a medium!  




 The only reason this is such a huge deal is that my parents are out of state for two weeks. My hands are tied. I wish they could look at the records from the last time I got a card (along with my moms signature on my old card!) and give me a new one, but I guess not.  




 I have a huge TBR list and a very thin wallet, so the library is my buddy. I haven't gone in a while since I've been in a bit of a slump, but I went to the library and the whole system was different. 

I needed a pin to use the computers. I asked what that was about. The librarian scanned my card and looked me up and apparently I wasn't in the system. Okay, maybe it's not scanning correctly? She sends me down to the first floor for a new card. This librarian tells me they don't use those cards anymore and I need a new one. I got that card 10 years ago and my aunt has taken me to another city's library and used her 20 year old card! 

Has this happened to anyone else? This is a minor inconvenience to most, but apparently you have to be 18 to get a library card. I'm 17. I can drive a car and hunt animals but I can't be trusted to get a library card to replace my existing one. 

I know this is a bit more of a rant than book discussion, but I want to share my feelings with some book lovers that would understand the pain of not having a library card. 
 




 I definitely finished the book with very negative feelings. I also feel that I read the book at the wrong time in my life, which took away from me fully enjoying the book and being able to look at Holden from an objective viewpoint. 

I also read it for school. Although I disliked it while I read it during the summer, when September came around, along with the teachers analysis, that book got butchered and I ended up liking it less. Maybe I'll give it a second go in a few years.  




 It's good you got out of that. A minimum wage job is not worth that sort of treatment. Even if the job put you at a temporary loss from the uniform cost, the next job you get will hopefully be a much better environment that pays better as well.  




 **The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien** 
I'm hoping to finally finish this book after starting it over a year ago. I just can't get into it as much as I hoped. I keep setting it down but I'm on the last 30 pages so I'm trying to persevere and move on. I've read other books in between though!  




 RemindMe! 2 days Donation for /r/millionairemakers 




 My store has 3 people on during rushes because we tend to hit 65-70 subs an hour during these rushes. Between rushes we have 2 people working to get the prepping done for the next rush. 

There's 3 subways in my town, and the other two have a different owner. Our store has sales, so we're the more popular store.  




 What did your uniform consist of? $40 is quite a big cost for the uniform. Typically the first apron and hat is free and the first shirt is $10. You could always just work enough hours to get the money for the uniform back.  




 Honestly, when people say "surprise me!" I go through and confirm every ingredient anyways. You don't know if these people have any food allergies or if they're looking to call and complain about the sub later for free food. 

I'd rather play 20 questions than get in trouble for killing a customer.  




 People are standing in aisles now. It's ridiculous, but it's great! Wisconsin for Bernie!

 "Hi, my name is ______ and I put in an application ______ ago, and I'm calling to make sure it was received by the manager or store owner." 
That's the easiest way to make that call go. You know the store technically 'received' your app, but you don't know if anyone looked at it. This ensures that a manager will know there's an app waiting and if they're hiring, they'll look. If they're not hiring, they'll let you know.  




 Definitely not. I don't think I would even see a McDonald's employee with a backwards hat. A couple people at my store have tried it, and I correct them because it's horribly unprofessional.  




 The other night a lady asked for habaneros. So I go for the jalapeos, thinking she mixed them up. No. She wanted banana peppers. Alright. You have fun with those tangy habaneros.  




 I would do Barcelona and Toledo. I toured ~12 cities in Spain, and Madrid was my least favorite. For shopping it's nice, but it's such a bustling metropolitan area it doesn't make a great vacation. 

Barcelona and Toledo are both gorgeous cities. 

Toledo has history and sites and little shops on side streets that are fun to go into and restaurants that you're less likely to find in an urban area. While in Toledo, I also got a gorgeous handmade sword. I don't recommend a sword because customs was an absolute pain, but there's also jewelry and smaller blades that are easier to transport. The views in and of Toledo are breathtaking and great photo spots. 

Barcelona gives the best of both worlds  with metro shopping areas in the same city as amazing sites to see such as the Sagrada Familia (pictures don't do the inside of it justice! Definitely go on a sunny day) and the Parque Gell. The architecture throughout the city is also just amazing. 

I don't entirely hate Madrid. The museums there are amazing, but I would only make Madrid a day trip. The museums don't take too long to tour and there's only so much time you can spend in Parque Retiro. 

Honestly, if you're going to be in Spain for a while, don't limit yourself to a couple cities. Get around for some day trips! The aqueducts in Segovia, the university in Salamanca, and the bull fighting museum in Seville were some of my absolute favorite spots outside of Barcelona and Toledo. 

Sorry for the lengthy post and any spelling errors, but Spain is such and old and amazing country.  




 Leave the sandwich on the counter next to the register. Whoever is on register will bag it, or you can do it when you get there. It's possible to bag with gloves, but it's a waste of time if you have other subs to worry about.  




 When you get the call depends on the store. But if you do get the call for the interview, take it seriously. I've seen many people sit down with my manager in jeans and a tshirt that looked like it hadn't been washed in a week and I never saw them come back. Grey slacks and a white button down was my interview outfit. Professional, but not flashy. Come off friendly, not militant. Subway is all about employees being happy around customers, so show in your interview that you can handle your job without losing your cool. You can google plenty of other interview prep tips that aren't subway specific but you'll still need. 

If you land the job, do the online training ASAP! Your coworkers don't want to deal with someone who is asking how to season bread after 3 months of working there. Ask questions here. This subreddit it saturated with experienced employees.  




 I would consider them okay. Many companies make brass weights. I don't know if brass is safe for long term use, but as long as you got the jewelry from somewhere you can trust, you should be okay.  




 Company wide change. Scoring was only aesthetic but under trained employees scored improperly and made the bread non functional. There was a thread on this a couple weeks ago.  




 8 to 6 was definitely my most exciting too! I was stuck at 8 FOREVER! I moved up to 6 on my birthday with no problems. Overall it was a pretty okay day. That stretch was a great start to my day.  




 I'm hoping to get a watercolor tattoo for my first tattoo, and I want it done right. I'm willing to travel, but not too far. 

Anyone know any good artists in the Midwest for watercolor pieces?  




 I put my visor below my bangs and then pull it up to regular height so it lifts my bangs. I only do this on hotter days since it looks a bit stupid. Ultimately, it gets the job done.  




 You could make a quiz on quizlet.com with all the formulas, but honestly I found it easier to just jump on meats when we didn't have a rush and ask coworkers questions. They're there to train you. It's their job, let them help you. It'll get easier the more you do it.  




 Honestly, the enchilada sub is what the customer makes it. It's our messiest sub so I always give out extra napkins and in some cases offer a fork. The sauce always drips, especially if you get flatbread. Adding lettuce into that mix will make it hell. Like many others have said, subs are made right in front of you. If your subs are always a mess, maybe you need to reevaluate the obscene amount of veggies/sauce you get.  




 Yeah. If the store sells soup, ask for it in a soup cup. People have asked. I know they're not putting all of that sauce on their sub (some do though when they eat in) so i assume they're stashing sauces they can't buy.  




 Well, the first one is easier to answer. Subway salads are mad with 6 inch portions of meat and footlong portions of veggies. They're actually pretty huge since I usually put enough lettuce to fill the bowl in the cases that people thing olives and lettuce is a salad. 

Other than subway, there's gotta be a variant of southwest at just a regular grocery store. Never scoped it out. But we can't sell packages of it to customers. A week ago a guy came in and asked if he could buy 30 pounds of enchilada. Nope :/  




 Lots of people definitely walk out. Some are okay and want to try something new. Some get mad and start yelling. 

My town also has 4 subways within 5-10 minutes of each other so I just refer them elsewhere, even though they're all under a different owner.  




 Probably a hellish rush combined with the previous shift not doing their job. I've been in the situation where all we have is flatbread. 

People like you who understand that sometimes things just go wrong are the best :)  




 Honestly, I've had people like this. You have to remember that your boss will ultimately value them and their returning wallet more than you and your feelings. These customers will be your problem for 5 minutes maximum. Put on your customer service face for those few minutes and remember that the sooner you just deal with them, the sooner they're gone. 

And petty revenge is always a blast. Oh, you wanted mayo? Here's 40 lines right in the hinge. Cut the sub unevenly. Only 6 olives on a footlong. Give them only 1 napkin. Then when they're gone, go in the cooler or freezer and just rant like there's no tomorrow. They're not completely sound proof, but it's better than yelling at customers!  




 Kaos used to sell 1/4" earskins, but they discontinued them. BAF has some left. I grabbed up a bunch of pairs when I found out.  




 Maybe have flair be how long the user has been with subway? It would be a bit of an honor system (I've been at subway 200 years!), but it would give posters and lurkers an easier time differentiating the more credible comments an advice.  




 Yup! But we can only do it with bread that was in the retarder too long. This means it's really hard to work with and looks terrible when it comes out. Very inflated.  




 With acrylic being a lower quality material, the sizes may not be as regulated as with other materials. I'd recommend digging out a caliper (or gauge card if you're a bodyartforms customer) and measuring them to know which is correct. 8g should be 3mm in diameter.  




 We don't necessarily do all of the prepping. Most of the prepping is supposed to be done by openers and mid shift. But sometimes those people don't quite do their jobs so closers are stuck prepping, or we have a big rush and run out of lettuce, or ham, or something else. Lately the openers have been slacking and leaving about 4 things prepped for the rush :/ 




 I'd recommend going onto bodyartforms and ordering a few silicone orings and trying those. Some people are allergic to the black nitrile ones. My ears always get a bit irritated from them, so I try to stick to the silicone ones.  




 The employees won't make too big of a deal about it. Probably ask a manager what to do and you will either get charged the actual price, or get a nice deal.  




 They even ask when there are people eating in the lobby! Those customers aren't for decoration!  




 Glass if definitely the best option! Silicon is porous. It'll absorb all of the gunk from hiking and be a pain to clean. 

Glass is very easy to clean and hypoallergenic. All it needs is a little water and a soft cloth to clean it off. Hell, I use my tshirt in times of need. Glass is the best material to wear for long term use.  




 Same thing happened to me just now. I have a feeling the text was edited out or something. I'm on mobile so maybe I'm missing a formatting thing? 




 Some openers set the dishes up on the baine differently than others. Putting the knives in different spots, they don't like the meatball spoon with holes, etc. Nitpicking you would only expect from a fast food employee.  




 Luckily I was only in my first week when a lady came in and ordered 100 gift cards! Our general manager was there so she let me know not to try to ring them all in.  




 I've tried putting the baine back together entirely (no food of course) for the opener in the morning. I've tried leaving it all in back to dry. Gotten told off for it both times. It just depends on your opener. I just leave it in back now since I do those dishes last so they need to dry.  




 It's definitely hard to get people motivated! They always want to leave early, but sit on their phones their whole shift and leave all their jobs until the last minute! The faster you finish, the faster you're out!  




 Get as many of your duties done ASAP! As a closer, this is super important. 

I think my favorite hack is something that you would need to ask an opener to do. I hate cleaning the metal cambros that catch all the food from the baine. We figured out that the t shirt bags fit nicely in these. When they're nice and clean in the morning, put some of the bags in them. Leave them in all day or change them if needed. Nice and clean. 

Prepping is usually the first thing I get out of the way. When that's done, I know I'll be ready for customers and not have to run in back to prep during the rush. 

After that I take care of helping my precloser. 

The second bread is panned for the next day and frozens are pulled, I start my closing count. It's okay to count everything in back early since nothing is baked after 6 or so. 

Another thing I do is condense and clean the baine an hour before close. I get all of the veggies and important meats onto one side of the baine. I clean the baine and forget about it. It's my least favorite job so I would rather get it out of the way ahead of time. 

Another one of my favorite little hacks is getting other people to do their job completely. It's the Preclosers job to take out garbage. I make sure they take out all the garbage. It's a bit riskier for a closer to leave the store to take out the garbage late at night. At my store we also have a rule about dishes. You need to clear the sinks before your shift ends. I make sure others do that or I get stuck with a huge pile of dishes.

There's probably much more, I love finding ways to make my job easier, but that's all I can think of for now.  




 Thank you! It's good to find out that I didn't destroy it! It really worried me because it never did this any other time I washed it.  




 I tried it on all my brushes and nothing but makeup ran out! This was a bit of relief. It would have been terrible if all of my brushes were ruined.  




 I picked up the Ulta brush and sponge cleanser and tonight I tried it out. The first think I cleaned was my beauty blender. I've been washing it before with just some foaming Dial soap. So I get it soaked and spritz some of the cleanser on. I start lathering it in and pink starts splashing on the sink! I panic and rinse my beauty blender and the water started running pink! 

My beauty blender seems okay now, just a couple pale spots. I don't know how this effects the integrity of the sponge. The cleanser says it works by dissolving makeup so I worried my sponge was dissolving. 

Has anybody else had this problem? It doesn't seem like something that's supposed to happen!  




 If it's a dollar or two that they actively tip me, I definitely say thank you. If it's their 13 change, I ignore it. They threw it in the tip jar because they didn't want it, not because they thought I should have it.  




 I love when they end up just putting everything back and asking for water. Makes me wonder if they can read or need glasses.  




 Always. Especially after the new menu boards came out. People come in and order 4 footlongs and ask me why their total is $35! Sorry, I gave you your receipt and the prices are right in front of you. I figure if anyone really wants to fight me on the prices, I can direct them to the 800 number that's likely somewhere on the receipt.  




 This works for any store that doesn't carry pizzas. We carry pizzas and therefore pizza boxes, so we're still stuck with flatizzas.  




 Thanks! 




 I ordered online from Ulta to get the free gift bag. Everything was in great condition!...except the brush cleaner. As I was opening the bag, I noticed that the brush cleaner had leaked! I don't want to go through the hassle of returning the package and waiting for it to be shipped out again if it's not necessary. 

Can I take the product into an Ulta store with the receipt and have it exchanged? It's pretty cold here in wisconsin, so the bottle or cap probably cracked during shipping.  




 I was in that spot last night. No customers either! There's a point in the night where you could leave and it wouldn't matter.  




 Me too! It's my favorite scent but I can't find it anywhere, so I've been carefully rationing it for special events.  




 I found a pair on plugclub.com that I was planning on going with, since I don't know how well the goo would go with the acrylic. 

I didn't even think of a tree stash! Mine will only be in 2g, so it wouldn't hold near enough to have any fun. I'm sure the larger lobed members here would have a good shot at it though :) 




 It's definitely one of the most important things I've learned at subway. 

And when all else fails, go scream in the cooler. Shits almost soundproof.  




 Yup!! 




 I've been looking into getting a pair of steel stash plugs. I was wondering if I could keep some spare holey buttr in them. Anybody done this? It would be nice to have some on me without carrying the tin.  




 You probably won't lose it or have to take it out, but you may find that you don't like the look of it once you're at your goal size. I watch a YouTuber who is at 2 inches and took out other love piercings simply because she found her ears a bit cluttered.  




 I have never thought about this and honestly, it's a bit terrifying. Maybe because I just thought of wearing my bunny as a slipper! This is truly a horrifying aspect of transfiguration that I would like to see a comforting fact/headcanon for. I'm not vegan or anything, but this makes me want to ban transfiguration with animals!  




 First, NONSLIP SHOES! I don't know if your store will require them or not, but they will save your life so much. Subway is a slippery store. 

Try to actually learn something in the online training. Some people just run through it then don't know what they're doing. 

Make sure you're great at biting your tongue. That customer doesn't want that tomato? Fine. Just give them another slice. Some of the people that come in to subway are super picky, especially since the food is made right in front of them. These people will only be in your life for a couple minutes. 

If you work in a busy store, be ready to be moving all the time! Don't rest until everything is done. I'm a closer and I bust ass to make sure I have everything prepped, cleaned, and done at least an hour before close so I have time for any emergencies and to sit on my phone. 

Don't be afraid to ask other employees for help. We've all been there. Hell, for my first three weeks I was making flatbread subs inside out! If someone corrects you on something and you know they know what they're doing, correct it. I have a couple people at my store who regardless of correction will continue doing everything wrong. 

That's all I can think of right now. I love helping and training new employees. They're fun.  




 I just bought this online! I hope the blush and shadows work well. Those are the main reason spent $20 on stuff I kinda needed but could have gotten from another brand.  




 This is somewhat encouraging! I have some pretty non-stretchy ears, so my goal size is only 2g. However, my ideal goal size is 5/8". Unfortunately, my ears aren't stretchy, they're pretty thin, and I was pierced crooked with a gun. 

Since I'm currently stretching my seconds (problems with firsts), I might eventually consider getting my firsts re pierced with the intent to stretch and I might just get up to my true goal!  




 They're a store option, so you either have a store that has taken them off the menu or a store with employees that can't be bothered. I'm know I'm guilty of simply telling a customer were out of crusts if it's almost close and I have better things to do than make a flatizza, but the crust is literally baked flatbread. Any store can make it as long as they also carry meatballs (this means marinara sauce) and flatbread. Not all stores will have the register button though.  




 UW Madison is definitely a great school. Its competitive to get in, although not as competitive as Harvard. 

As for the campus, it's big and it's beautiful. I don't attend and haven't gone on an official tour, but I've been to the campus and it's great. 

The user above me has some great links you should definitely check out. Also check out the school's website! It will have everything you'll want to know about program quality and campus life.  




 Definitely MSU. I'm not a fan of the partying down in Arizona (cousin is a student there and it's all he does), and I'm a Midwest kid so Id miss my snow.  




 My coach starts you with your target on the second arrow. Where you stand is a pretty individual thing and something you can play around with. Some stand at 15, some stand at 20. 

Second arrow is the most common target I've seen, but you might find that it doesn't work for you. I found that I just couldn't use a target that far down the lane without wanting to loft the ball, so I use the third dot.   




 On the PSAT, you're penalized 1/4 of a point for a wrong answer and 1 point for a blank answer. I assume the SAT has similar scoring.  




 Pick up ACT for dummies! I'm taking a prep course at my high school in a couple weeks, and the book was one of the materials given for the class. We were also given a practice math packet. I think the book is around $20, but IIRC, it has some practice sections and it's thorough on explanations. 

For math, there are probably lots of practice questions laying around the Internet with explanations on how to solve. My precalc teacher gives out practice ACT questions every week, with difficulties ranging from scoring at 12 to scoring at 34.  




 Easiest way to tell if your thumb is swollen is how it fits your thumb. Your thumb should fit the hole well and be snug, but it shouldn't take any effort to put your thumb in and out of the ball. Make sure you do this test with a straight thumb. Try pushing your thumb nail against the ball when you're in the ball if you're not sure if it's straight. 

If you're struggling a bit to get out of the ball, your thumb might be swollen. There are a couple solutions I've found to work best. 

First solution is low effort and sketchy effectiveness. My thumb and fingers swell a lot after a couple games, so I keep my hand above my heart to lower the blood flow. I'm short so I can do this by resting my elbow on the score screen at the table and keeping my hand up. Tape is also your best friend. Vise hada patches in blue are my favorite. 

The second solution is a bit more pricey, but will be a bit easier in the long run. You could get interchangeable thumb slugs. Get one measured for when your thumb is fitting in your ball just fine and when it's swollen. I haven't seen these around too much where I bowl, but it's a pretty conventional place there.  




 You get what you pay for with balls. I've seen pyramid balls go as low as $30. IIRC, some have a plastic coverstock, which is the same as a house ball. Unless you want to research like hell and buy online (which won't save you much money because you'll be charged for drilling anyways unless you're on a league), talk to your proshop guy. They should set you up with something that's beginner level reactive and a good fit to your bowling style. Once you have a solid main ball, you can pick up a cheap plastic one as a spare ball. If anything, your proshop might have some used Storm laying around that you could get at a super low price since. 

I bought the cheapest shoes that had purple flames on them, so I'll let someone else advise you on show choices. The brand is Etonic. They're sold in my proshop, but they're not the best. Very entry level. 

Proshop guy is god around here when it comes to ball selection, and there's a reason for that. 
 




 Local B M has some jolly rancher flavored juice, but it's a more strawberry/watermelon flavor. 

Anybody know of a good recipe for cherry jolly rancher? Or at least some flavors that might work to make it?  




 Those are the only real chicken nuggets. Eating the whole bag in a day is the way to go.  




 Thanks. I expected it right from the first game and forward. We were also missing a varsity player and kept swapping out JV players to cover.

We've gone to state before, so next year will hopefully be another trip!  




 My team completely flopped out of going to state. 

Sectionals were at 8 am on an unfamiliar lane pattern. I blame that entirely. It was a long pattern with virtually no backend, so my ball was hooking as well as a house ball.  




 How exactly did you do the subway university classes before you were hired? You need your owner to register you as an employee and give you your login to complete it. 

As for the W2 thing, there has to be some type of legal thing against them withholding it. That's absolutely ridiculous.  




 No options for those of us that don't vape! 

My parents and friends vape and the devices are actually really interesting, so I stick around, but I don't even own my own setup.  




 In all honesty, everyone here freaks out way too much about acrylic. 

I agree COMPLETELY with acrylic being a huge nono is a fresh piercing/stretch. Wearing it for prolonged periods is also bad. 

If you wear acrylic plugs in a completely healthy and healed stretch for a few hours, your ears will not fall off. If you find that you have a reaction, then it's best to avoid it. 

No, acrylic is not the best jewelry and isn't safe to wear for a long time, but if your ears are completely healed and you pop some in for a few hours, you will likely be fine. 

Stretching is one of those hobbies you should only take up if you're willing to go for quality. Keep glass/stone/titanium/etc as your main jewelry. Glass is just as cheap as acrylic if you get it online, so price is hardly a factor when it comes to quality products. 

Paying an extra dollar or two for glass is surely easier than dealing with a reaction from extended acrylic wear.  




 I have a certain mechanical pencil that I only use on assessments. It's been with me for 4 years and is beaten to shit, but it's never let me down on functionality and i never worry about filling in the wrong bubble on accident. I can't even fathom filling a scantron sheet with a different pencil. 

It's probably more of a consistency thing than a good luck charm. My most effective good luck charm is doing homework to the fullest and occasionally glancing at the textbook. But all that's boring. So the pencil works.  




 Carmen lip conditioner. It's super light (almost like lip lotion) and absorbs right away! Great moisturizing ability without making your lips feel gooey/waxy. It also has a light mint/sugar taste.  




 Nope. Our owner doesn't want more than one closer.  




 I make $7.50 as a closer in Wisconsin. I'm 17, but I've been working at subway about a year now.  




 The stores in my area don't train on putting the code in or anything. We are just told to give the cookie and put the receipt in the receipt envelope. And in all honesty, I won't fight with a customer over a cookie.  




 Before doing something extreme, like a sarge Easter, there are little things you can do during your release that might help. I had some ring finger problems too, since I was relying on my ring finger to pull the hook. I ended up having a pretty constantly sore finger and tore open a blister on that finger. I worked on adjusting my release to using my middle finger as the main force in my hook and letting my ring finger just pop out. I already have a callous on my middle finger from writing, so it doesn't hurt at all. The joint pain also stopped since my middle finger is a bit stronger. 

Another solution would be to talk to your pro shop guy and have the pitch, span, and grips checked for a good fit. Your ring joint is likely a little shorter(?) than your middle joint, so one will be drilled closer to the thumb hole than the other. If your ring finger was drilled the same distance from your thumb as your middle finger, you might be straining your joint through the whole release. 

I hope I helped somewhat, albeit I did ramble a bit. I do feel your pain with ring finger problems. I was tempted to pick up a cheap ball off craigslist and have it sarge Easter drilled to see if that would fix all of my problems!  




 Some stores (mine included) have yet to actually start using points, or even training employees on them. They're not necessarily adding new rules, they just didn't know the full list to begin with. 

Also, the lowest point prize is 10 points gets you a cookie and you earn 1 point on every dollar spent. That's a $10 cookie. Doing the survey on your receipt (or even faking the code) costs a lot less.  




 You've been accepted into the itty bitty lobe committee! We have the most irritatingly small wearables and it makes jewelry purchasing a pain in the ass. 

If BAF is out, you're likely out of luck. You might be able to find something on eBay. I think silicone can be autoclaved, but I'm not a professional. You could also go on a piercing shop hunt and try to track someone down who still has kaos stock in that size. 

As for the tunnels, anatometal custom orders are pretty easy, albeit a bit pricey and lengthy depending on what you order. BAF has a great filter which includes wearable area IIRC so definitely put that to work! 

When I found out that kaos stopped the 1/4" wearable and BAF bought the stock, I blew $80 so that I would have earskins that fit. They actually pop out in my sleep if they're too long! They're not fashionable either.  




 I second this. A color code system with post it flags and an old fashioned piece of paper for elaboration. If you're going to do this, I find the actual plastic post it flags much easier to use than the paper post its. The paper ones stick to the pages a lot more and sometimes curl them.  




 Head to YouTube and look up ACDC Econ. Amazing videos on macro, micro, and regular Econ concepts. Definitely got me through my final!  




 At this point, it's what you want to take, then. Stats will still be there in college. It's okay to put it off to take a class you want to take. If you want to take international relations and think you'll enjoy it more than AP stats, go for it. If you would rather take stats now, look at the course catalogs for the college you're thinking of. Do they offer an international relations course?  




 Definitely screws on. The flares are just a bit too big to be double flare, and usually that style of plug screws on. 

The size? Looks like about 2g, give or take a size.
