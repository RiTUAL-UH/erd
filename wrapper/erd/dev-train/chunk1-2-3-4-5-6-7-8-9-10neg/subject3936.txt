 The girl with the penis in her butt is Jennifer White. 




 That's cool...until he has to go literally anywhere else where all the rocks don't coincidentally look exactly like his camouflage. 









 I disagree because when I hold back I end up jizzing a lot more at the end and as we all know a gallon of jizz on a girls face is way more likely to get her pregnant than just a few pathetic ropes. 









 A) I don't watch porn in the shower I watch it at work, while I drive, when I'm on the toilet, when I'm in bed and when I'm watching TV and when I'm sitting on my porch.

B) I don't watch dicks but its hard to watch straight porn without noticing the main supporting actor just smashing away at the female lead.

C) I do watch dicks, dicks are awesome.

 This was "Simply the Best" tifu today, little bro. 




 Its a great opportunity to give high school students a taste of the real world, where popularity is everything, a lucky few succeed, and everyone else watches from the piss-soaked streets below as the top 1% revel in their own wealth and glory. 



















 The human race is bored. 




 A bot *that's* going to be doing cool stuff. Not who. Nice try, human.

 I'd let her pull my nuts out of a block of ice. 




 Salt is the opposite of pepper and squirrels are the opposite of chipmunks. 




 And then your high horse breaks down on the way home and you freeze to death in the unforgiving cold in the land that the sun forgot. 




 Fun fact: all Pekingese have a similar yawn button located on either side of their face just inside the hinge of their jaw. 




 Pugs are the dog version of oversized sweatpants. 




 If I was a surfer I'd be insulted by this title. If I was a paddle boarder I'd be stoked, then I'd kill myself because paddle boarding is so lame and embarrassing.  




 I don't know what's more entertaining; the dialogue or the musical transitions between camera angle switches. 














 I disagree I think its way more unrealistic that super babe/Bond villainXenia Zaragevna Onatopp would marry a half-rate piece of shit Jedi who's only claim to fame aside from getting s3riously pwned by Darth Maul was being Galactic dickead Count Dooku's fuckin' apprentice.

 I don't get it; I could still easily stick a cucumber up my ass with that thing on.

Edit: OK I'm catching a lot of heat about the lefties thing; the bottom line is that when a lefty writes with a quill, they tend to smear the undried ink with their hand as they write, and that is a huge bonerkill for me. Deal breaker. 




 I've always heard that dogs were colorblind, but this confirms it. 







































 I can. I'm 28 years old I can say whatever I want. 




 I like to imagine all the marbles as being really excited they're at a theme park and running around going on rides.

 You were definitely fetus. 




 You can't see the NSA's dick pics, but they can see yours. 




 Chicks swallow millions of sperms all the time and they don't complain. You get one little fetus chunk in your mouth and you make a huge fuckin stink about it. Weak. 




 Heavyweights because fat people would bitch about it because they suck because they're fat. 
























 NSFW 




 Sorry for the vagueness and ambiguity but its 530am and I don't know why my brain just started to think about this but about ten or fifteen years ago I remember seeing this movie where this guy who is an increasingly shitty husband comes home to find a really fucked up video of his wife confessing to a bunch of fucked up shit like cheating on him and the video gets worse and worse until the end it actually shows her cheating on him on the video with his neighbor and then he finds out that its not a recorded video but a live feed from the neighbors place and he tries to kill her and or the neighbor or something. It may not have been in theaters maybe just made for/by HBO or Cinemax or something. Sorry/thanks.

 ANUSTART 




 Also why is he laying on his back with no pants on in what appears to be a dirty bathroom in an old insane asylum.  




 I feel like 80% of rap songs from the 90s are full of those sounds too. 




 I would either choose "oops" or "what's that?". 




 Its cool because English is such a garbage language that when you read it out loud all the a's make different noises.

 If the husband of some bitch can be president, then some bitch who's husband was president can also be president. 




 Holy shit 









 Panda Venom new band name I called it. 














 Look it up, its actually a physics phenomenon in the sport of table tennis. 




 I dunno man I saw one on the Science Channel that can essentially print 3d buildings from locally acquired mineral resources, which NASA is considering using for building a moon base, and moon bases probably won't have to be breastfed, have diapers changed, wake up crying every night, and throw up constantly for the first year of their lives... 




 And that every straight guy age 12-35 walks around with a banana in their pocket. 




 Well, in the kitchen, women complain about doing the dishes, and in the bedroom they complain about having to make the bed and fold clothes, and in the TV room they complain about the TV being too loud or food being left on coffee tables; ergo, they need something to complain about in a bathroom that is otherwise dominated by their mess, so they use the toilet lid as their vehicle. 




 Baby pandas are in fact much more dangerous than adult pandas because their venom is just as potent, but as adolescents they haven't learned how to control the amount that they inject into their prey when they bite. 









 The 14 year old me was pretty certain you were supposed to pee inside a girl's bagina when you had sex, too. 




 I feel like Lynch is a pretty racist surname too. It's like having the last name Gaschamber. 




 I'm tempted to create numerous extra accounts just so I can give this more upvotes. 
























 "This is not a test." 




 Was hoping for nsfw... 




 I ask because it seems like every woman takes serious offense to the c**t word even if its not directed at them, and I honestly can't think of any male counterparts. 




 Don't the 90s include the year 2000? 



















 I have zero business sense and even less ambition, I'm just a guy laying in a beanbag chair. Ideally someone else would put in all the leg work, carry this idea through to fruition, then get super rich off of it so I can send them a screenshot of this post in a few years and try to get a couple million dollars in sympathy money from them, all without leaving my beanbag. 









 The safety is always useful, regardless of whether the gun is loaded or not because it provides an unambiguous indication of the weapon's condition to anyone, and secondly we are not talking about weapons with organic safeties we are talking about a MK17. 




 Yeah true. I guess that's why they don't put safeties on guns, they just assume the gun owner just constantly checks the chamber instead of flicking a pesky switch, amiright. 




 That's exactly my point. If you rack it and put it on safe, then you know 100% its safe. Then when you're done taking pictures of it to show people on the internet, then you can again visually clear the chamber, put it on fire, and release the firing pin to relieve spring tension for storage until the next time you want to take it out and take pictures of it. 




 Irrelevant 




 Put it on safe, dumbass 














 Tomato with acne 
























 Solved. By someone in /r/movies.

 I'm Channing Tatum and I'm disguised as an ugly guy researching a role for a movie I'm doing about bunny rabbits and all the profits go to poor kids on paleo diets with cancer and AIDS.

 Competitive eating 




 Republicans in California 




 I feel like I'm the only one of my friends who gets pissed off when both my cancer and my HIV flare up. 




 The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins is a really enlightening book about the nuances of the theory of natural selection and simplifies the world into replicators (genes) and vehicles (organisms). It's one of the most  interesting and provocative books I've ever read. So I guess I'd recommend reading that while you jerk off. 


































 My 13 year old autistic cousin was talking to my aunt and he said "With all the stars and planets and galaxies in the universe, there practically HAS to be aliens out there!" My aunt responds "There aren't." My cousin asks "Why not?" My aunt responds, "Because the Bible." 




 They don't have a favorite football team. 




 If Tyler Perry presents it. 




 Euthanize 




 The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins made me reexamine the "meaning" of "life" as we "know" it. 




 Obama 




 When the supposedly "unsinkable" ocean liner you're on hits an iceberg and sinks. 









 With technological advancements and social media, people think that just because they have a "microphone" or a "platform" for essentially instantaneous global public discourse, they also necessarily have a "voice" or "valued opinion", when the truth is that everyone should go back to the good old days of shutting the fuck up and vaccinating their god damn kids. But then again, I'm just some asshole who thinks everyone should listen to my opinion, voiced above. So fuck me too. 




 After reading all the comments to this point I think it's safe to say we all agree the north is fucked worse than a black guy in a horror film. 




 No teeth 









 Dude I totally agree it pisses me off how they're always walking around looking like their hands are in their pockets like smug assholes.

 Dam is there anything Johnny Sins can't do?! 




 Make onionade. 




 Ignorance 




 Abortion. Babies aren't self aware until they're like 3 years old so claiming that a fetus is a person and that abortion is murder is absurd and akin to saying that stepping on ants is genocide. 




 This is meta af and my brain just got tingly. 




 I had been saying "making end's meat" until I was about 24 




 Jonah Hill 




 Double down on 86 million more lottery tickets. 














 Well nowadays we use the internet to find clothes, food, jobs, houses, cars, porn, vacations, banks, and a billion other things, I think it's only natural and inevitable that relationships find their way into that list too. The future is now. 









 Soooo... What is she looking for a competitive eating training partner?
