 Awesome! Definitely one of the best book blogs out there- I trust you guys more than many of the legacy newspaper reviews out there.  




 Why don't you create it and we'll see what comes of it. I would love to contribute.  




 I still remember reading #5 where you find out Marco's history. Genius books, awful television show.  









 Thanks! 




 Much appreciated 




 Thanks! 




 What is it in the human brain that tells us to compete with others with no material gain?  














 Whelp, consider me informed. I'm ridiculously impressed that you knew that.  









 I don't even care if Enders Game is awful- I've been waiting most of my life for that movie so ill be there on opening day. 




 You may want to begin with history books. Anything by Michael Beschless is amazing. Nowadays the best politics books are about individual issues. Authors go hand in hand, like Joseph Stiglitz and the economy. What are you interested in learning about? 




 Even receipts are plastered with exclamation points.

 that doesn't charge hundreds of dollars for new ink cartridges. I have a Konica Minolta Magicolor 4750DN and to replace everything (toner, ink, imaging units) costs more than a thousand dollars every 6 months. This is for less than 5,000 pages printed. Any thoughts? 




 But his ideologies ARE kind of reflected... Ender was never supposed to exist. The Wiggins had him so that they could procreate as their religion said they were supposed to.

 I'm reading we are anonymous by parmy Olson. Really well researched. 




 Dan Simmon's Hyperion. I dare you to read it and not enjoy. 




 Check out Dan Simmon's Hyperion or Orson Scott Card's Enders Game. Both have subsequent books and will hook you from the starts. 












































 Yes, I'm sorry. 




 I once wrote a 15,000 page story 3 separate times, in first, second, and third person respectively. Finally I realized that I liked it best in third person, but that I needed to rewrite it AGAIN. I think in the end, I kept about 100 words of the roughly 50,000 I initially wrote. 

The silver lining is that the story thrived from the endless editing, and is now a published piece of fiction.  









 Not to mention some of these folks aren't even alive.  









 I've been waiting to read this book for months. So it's worth it? 




 Ahhhhh 




 John Keats is a poet from 200 years back. He's an interesting guy, and Hyperion gets its namesake from one of his poems. This book takes a VERY interesting twist on him. 

Also, the book is chronological.  




 Ayn Rand is a wizard with a plot, but her writing is grueling. 

Ender's Shadow is brilliant, as well as the entire Hegemon series. I have a sneaking suspicion you'll be hearing a lot more about this book after November hits.  




 The first book is about a pilgrimage to an abandoned planet, and each of 7 chapters is told by a different pilgrim. Each subsequent book takes a different narrative approach, but all of the characters remain the same. On a side note, if you're at all a John Keats fan, this is a can't miss.  




 Bright Lights, Big City.  




 Hyperion by Dan Simmons.  




 Check out Hyperion by Dan Simmons. It's a 4 book series that runs through about 7 narrators, but each of them have a compelling story and they all come together flawlessly. One of the best (and most underrated) series around.  









 Isn't this why fan fiction exists?

 I've always attended the interactive sessions, so I can't speak to the music. That being said there seems to be a give and take with the popularity of these festivals. They are becoming larger and more intricate, which takes away from the grass roots feel of the whole thing, but also moves them towards bigger acts and more legitimacy. 

Plus even at interactive the music is still killer. 














 Clay, I'll be attending your talk with Emily Parker this evening at the New America Foundation. How do you know Mrs. Parker and what are your thoughts on the possible balkanization of the Internet? 









 I have a Lenova laptop, plugged into a Lenova docking station, which is hooked up to a Dell monitor (VGA to VGA). I recently picked up a Lenova monitor. I would like to use the docking station to have dual monitors, but the only other port is a DVI-D and the monitor has a VGA port. 

I ordered an adapter (VGA to DVI-D) and it didn't work. I did some trouble-shooting, and both monitors, chords, and ports work. This leads me to believe that it's the adapter's fault, but before I order a new one I'm curious if there's something I'm missing. My IT team tells me that the video card, comp, and docking station support dual-monitors.  




 Depends on experience and writing. Do you have any writing samples? 




 I'm in the process of rolling out a new tech-oriented website with a focus on futurism. I would like to hold an open discussion about how technology is effecting out culture; think "the future of optometry in a world of Google Glass" or "Snapchat is mocking your privacy; here's why you don't care." I'm open to most topics, but I"m looking specifically for beat writers to cover drones, wearables, and 3d printing. 

Message me if this is of interest to you and I can share more details.  









 I can't help but feel that open systems are dominating the market right now, and that any desirable closed system is being cannibalized by open source software anyway. More curious than anything else.  









 Congratulations. As someone who works in publishing, this is no small feat. However I have to warn you, the hard part is just beginning.  
























 I'll probably be picking that up soon 









 It is an epic western about the Texas frontier. It's a very dark cowboy and Indian story that spans about 100 years, similar to Marquez.  




 I work in the book biz, so I saw dozens of reviews for this book when it came out. If I can help it I won't read a review before I read the book, so I basically ignored The Son until a few weeks ago, when I met Philipp Meyer and had a beer with him. I started reading the book the next day and, though I'm only a dozen chapters in, I know this will be one of my all time favorites. The writing is as close to perfect as I've seen in recent memory. Have you all read the book and what do you think? I'm afraid I'm just a fan of the man instead of the writing.  









 As a publicist, this is an awesome list that will add hours to my workload next week. Thanks.

 I thought the book was inspiring. The whole time I was reading it I was thinking that I should really get out there and do something big. The specifics didn't matter so much to me as that feeling I got while reading it.  









 What's the fun in that? 









 We had a middle school gym teacher fired and jailed for being intimate with a student. I believe this occurred on several occasions, and they were discovered by the gym teacher's wife, also a gym teacher at the school.

 I would start with Drown, his first collection of short stories. His second book is a novel called The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao. This won a Pulitzer for fiction, but is usually the least liked of his books. I loved it, but I would read Drown first. Finally, This is How You Lose Her is his second collection of short stories and was released last year. He's apparently working on a Dominican Apocalypse story now, which will be amazing. If you Google him you can probably find a number of his stories online. He publishes in The New Yorker every couple of years.  




 Junot Diaz will cure that for you.

 The fella with the beard is at work and asked me to respond. As a bit of back story, we all initially began our training with beards- it was kind of a gimmick for charity. He was admirably the only one who kept his throughout, and we actually shaved it off together about an hour after this picture was taken. But here's his response:  

"it definitely kept me warm on a relatively cold day. Disclaimer- Not advisable for use with summer training regimen in NYC and is generally incompatible with most models of girlfriend."

Anyway, thanks for the kudos!

 




 Ha! Who is this? 




 Thanks. I think I'm still smiling now.  




 The entire thing was memorable. Even the people who were miserable were smiling because of the crowds. The three of us ran the entire race together so we had a lot of support throughout, and we did about as well as we thought we would. If I had to pick one moment, it was coming off the Queensboro Bridge into Manhattan. The crowds, which were already massive in Brooklyn and Queens, were ENORMOUS in Manhattan. It was such a cool experience. Thanks for asking!

 Two time reader here. The first reading wasn't so much difficult as it was disgusting. I've read some dark stuff, but this one got to me. It wasn't until the second read that I realized how amazingly intricate and beautiful the prose was. I actually sympathized with HH and thought of the book as some great story of love and loss. Every time I mention this I get weird looks, but it has become a favorite of mine. Keep at it.

 I had a professor back in college who swore by this book. I couldn't hear the end of how amazing it was and how McEwan demonstrated his masterful writing skills here. I started reading it yesterday, and am currently about halfway. Holy hell was he right. Every chapter is amazing concise and demonstrates everything that makes writing transformative. voice, POV, narrative distance, blah blah blah. Anyway, read it.  




 It's so awesome that I wish I never read any of them so I could read them again for the first time.  




 Hyperion by Dan Simmons and it's not even close.  




 She came by way of Archer, Bridgeport, Nanuet, worked off 95 in jeans and a denim jacket, carrying a plastic bag and shower shoes, a phone number, waiting beneath an underpass, the potato chips long gone, lightheaded.  




 So many. 

David Mitchell
JK Rowling
Junot Diaz
Phillip Meyer
Ben Fountain
Lev Grossman
JOshua Ferriss
Jennifer Eagan
Michael Chabon

So many more. The issue is that this trait can reasonably be argued in most any book considered decent. Even short stories show character development. I don't really agree with the the fact that Cormac McCarthy doesn't develop his characters, he just does it differently.  




 Requiem for a Dream. Nightmare fuel.  




 How long did the technical aspects of the book take you to write? I know your background is in the sciences, but there seemed to be a lot of complicated formulas involved in this book. 

Also, did you intentionally write this book to read like a movie script?

Lastly, did you laugh when you realized that Matt Damon was going to play ANOTHER character trapped on a foreign planet? 




 I love to insult people through compliments.  




 How was it listening to the audio book? I read it and loved it, but it was so clearly written for a movie that I bet the audio book was even better.

 What a picture! 


































 This was published ten years ago. Is there any updated info? 




 I don't want to give any spoilers away, but I thought the writing here was pretty remarkable. There were a dozen points where I stopped to comprehend the sentence or passage that I had just read. I thought the plot was above average, but maybe not 2 million dollars above average. The end, especially, left a lot to be desired. 

Anyway, I guess I'm asking what everyone else thought.  




 Unless I'm mistaken, /r/writingprompts is mainly fiction. I'll have a look though.  




 Hey All - I was a college writing major and now I work in publishing. I help authors come up with ideas for op-eds all the time, but when it comes to my own writing I'm kind of at a loss. In the last few years I've written about gaming dynamics, the changing language of the technology age, fan fiction, and, ironically, Reddit. All of these pieces were for major publications and some were even paid. I also have some random fiction in the works. 

My question is what would you all like to read about? Specifically at the intersection of writing, publishing and technology. It's been the better part of a year since I've written anything worth reading and I could really use some of that famous Reddit juice.

 I dare you to tell me it didn't inspire you to put the book down and run around outside. Very odd result, and an author I can't help but think would be proud to hear you'd rather be running around then reading his book.

 Yeah he's awesome. That post came out the day I finished the book, so as much as I hate to admit it I couldn't read much more about Musk, especially since the post is loosely based on the book.  




 I don't typically read biographies, and this one won't be published until May 16th, but I got my hands on a copy and holy hell was it awesome. There were some pieces that left you wanting (very little on Solar City) and a few more typos than I would have liked in a finished book, but man it was great. If you're a fan of Elon Musk you need this book. Beyond that, I found that it was incredibly inspiring, on the level I haven't seen very often. I guess this is a bit of a rambling explanation, but I'm wondering if anyone else has been wanting to read this or if I'm the odd man out? Sales seems to be pretty steady on Amazon.  




 I loved all four of them, but nothing will ever compare to the first.

 Has anyone read Loving Learning? 









 Listen- this is great that you finally read a book and I hope you keep reading and take down a million more. That being said, I'm shocked to see so many people who go so long without reading. Books are the easiest way for us to share our ideas and thoughts and it's a shame that so many people don't take advantage of them.
