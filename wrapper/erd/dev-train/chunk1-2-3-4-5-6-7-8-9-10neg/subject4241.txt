 Okay, I've never really used Reddit before, but I saw this subreddit where people upload unusually creepy stories for help/advice. And that's just what I need right now. I guess I should start off with some background information, so my situation can be remedied most effectively. My name is Summer, and for the purpose of slight anonymity Ill leave it at that. I just turned eighteen, and I moved to a small city in Utah a couple of weeks ago to start attending summer classes at a local college. Before I go any further, you should know that up until now, I lived in Florida. I lived there my entire life, so moving out to such a new place entirely was difficult. I dont know very many people here. Sorry about the tangent, I just wanted to give enough information to make the rest of my story make more sense.

Okay, so like I said, I moved here a couple of weeks ago. My Mom and I drove all the way from Florida to get here, and we were on the road for a little over a week. She helped me set up all the stuff in my dorm and stayed a couple of days before heading back out. It was definitely emotional, being an only child my Mom and I have always been incredibly close. After she left I had a couple of days to get acquainted with the campus. I met four other girls staying in my dorm who are all super nice. The way our dorm is set up is similar to an apartment- Theres one big room that we all share that has a kitchen and living room, and then this long hallway that branches off to three other rooms- Two double and one single. I was lucky enough to land a single dorm room, and being a bit of an introvert this has proven to be very beneficial. I can go to bed and wake up whenever I like, and not worry about sharing a small space with someone else. After that, classes started right up. Being summer semester, there werent as many people in the classes, which was nice. Most of my courses only had five to ten other students, so I really got to know my professors. I made a couple of friends, if you could call them that, and things were going fine. Up until a few days ago.

 So the way summer classes work at my college is kind of weird. Most of the general ed courses, like the ones Im taking, started during mid-June. Others that deal with majors, however, started in July. So at the beginning of last week, I started seeing some new people file in. No one especially notable. Anyway. A few days ago, I head to my Biology class as usual, and see a few new people that had recently joined for major programs. As soon as I walk in, a new boy comes running over and gives me this massive bear hug. And as hes hugging me, he says, Oh my God, Sunny! How have you been? Now, this was odd for a number of reasons. First of all, I had never seen this guy before in my life. Hes this tall, sandy-blonde haired fellow with trim muscles and a killer smile. A good-looking guy, someone I wouldnt easily forget. Second of all, as stated earlier, my name is Summer, not Sunny. Now, Im sure a lot of you are thinking what I originally thought- Maybe he saw me and thought I was someone else. But what was eerily disturbing about the scenario is that my father used to call me Sunny. He called me Summer Sunshine, and told me that my Sunny smile always brightened his day. It was sweet, a nickname I had always cherished. But my father passed away in an unresolved accident when I was nine, and now just hearing the name Sunny sends shivers up my spine. So, Im sure you can imagine my surprise when this stranger runs up to hug me calling me a name I hadnt heard in nearly a decade. As soon as he breaks loose, I say something along the lines of, Hey, um, my name is actually Summer. I dont know a Sunny. You may have me confused with someone else. He stares at me intently, scanning my features, and then says, Haha, very funny, Sunny. Hey, weve all missed you since the trip! You should totally come to the next one, if youre free. It was a total blast last time! He turns to walk to a desk, and I stand there, completely dumbfounded. 

After the class ends, I rush out to avoid any confrontation with that weird guy. And then, things get weirder. As I walk down the halls towards my dorm room, all these people I have never seen before start waving at me and saying things as they walk by. A redheaded girl Ive never seen says Hey, Sunny! Great to see you! as she opens a classroom door. A couple of jock guys said something along the lines of,  Sunny, remember- Dont touch the poison oak! and burst out in laughter as they turn a corner. Each time it happened, I got more and more unsettled. By the time I finally got back to my dorm, I was on the verge of a major freakout. I rushed into my friends room- Lets call her Abigail- And told her everything that happened. I asked if she was certain that she hadnt seen anyone that looked even remotely similar to me. She assured me she hadnt, but recommended we search for girls named Sunny on campus. So we pulled up the school directory. Nothing comes up for Sunny. We search Sunshine, Allison, Allie, or anything that could be related to Sunny. Still, nothing. Abigail suggested that we look through the school ID page on the online database to find photos of girls who may look like me. Nothing. No one even closely resembled me. By the time we had looked at every photo in the database, she was beginning to feel my frustration. We figured our search irrelevant and called it a day. 

Then, this morning. I wake up, and to my surprise, theres a new iMessage on my phone from an unsaved number. Here is the exact message, copied and pasted from my messenger. Good morning, Sunny. Its Ez. Wow. I cant even begin to explain how AMAZING last night was. Youre just Wow. Im honestly speechless. I cant wait to see you again. Um, text me when you get up? Cant wait to hear from you. I hope you can understand how much this freaked me out. So many things were running through my head, and all I could think is I need to tell someone. So I leave my dorm to find Abigail, and shes sitting at the kitchen table on her laptop, and she says Hey Summer, I didnt know you went on the Anthropology majors camping trip! I kind of stood there, confused for a minute. She flips her screen around, and sure enough, a girl who looks EXACTLY like me is sitting on a log surrounded by other students in a forest, grinning ear to ear. Shes wearing this weird tank top with a batik print and holding a journal. I tried my best to stay calm and explain to her that I had never seen that photo before and had never even been camping. She looked confused and pointed to the caption at the bottom, where the students names are all posted. Sure enough, in between ELIZA HENSON and MCALL PARK is SUMMER, followed by my last name. I couldnt believe it. I walked back into my dorm, and as I went to lay back down in bed, I noticed a picture frame on my bedside table that wasnt there before. And I swear to God, its the same photo Abigail had just shown me. Thirteen college students sitting on logs in the forest, smiling, wearing outdoorsy outfits. The only difference in this photo is that the girl smiling ear to ear and holding the journal has no face. Its scribbled out harshly in thick Sharpie. 
Guys, Im freaking out. I have no clue who this girl is. According to the college, she doesnt exist. And yet, there are photos of her, and people know her, but she doesnt exist. I think she may be stalking me, and Im terrified. I dont know how she got that photograph into my dorm room, and it freaks me out to think why she would have scribbled out my face. And how "Ez" got my phone number? I have no idea what to do. I have all these thoughts running through my head and I need to get a hold of things. This is all so unfamiliar and I just want to go back home. PLEASE HELP

Thank you to those who commented some suggestions last night when I posted my dilemma. I wasnt familiar with memory gaps, but I can assure you I have no mental health discrepancies and something like this has never happened before. I just figured I should keep whoevers reading this updated. Things have gotten worse.

I barely got any sleep last night. It took me a while to type out what was happening, and the entire time I couldnt shake the feeling that I was being watched. I closed my drapes and closet doors so that there were no peepholes into my bedroom, but I couldnt lose that eerie feeling that seemed to hang over me, weighing me down. Early this morning, I decided the best thing to do would be to talk to campus security. Like a couple of you had suggested, I figured that occurrences like this had to be somewhat common, or at least not completely foreign. 

I walked down to the station with the photograph in hand. I tried my best to explain to the police officer what had happened, but he regarded my situation with little interest. He speculated that I may have gotten too drunk to remember this Ez guy, and that one of my roommates had put the photo in my room. As Im sure you could imagine, his answers were far from settling. I insisted that he look at the hallway camera videos from the past couple of days to see if anyone had snuck in to plant the photograph. Begrudgingly, he did. We watched a time-lapse video of everything that went on in my hallway and outside my dorm room from the last 48 hours, and to my demise, nothing seemed especially odd. I saw my roommates come in and out, sometimes bringing food or friends with them. The only thing that miffed me was my own patterns. According to the video, on the evening of July 9th (two days ago), I didnt come back to my dorm until 4:30 AM. I know I went to a party that night, but I dont remember staying out that late. I guess I hadnt really kept track of the time. It tends to fly when youre having a good time.

After finishing the video, Campus Patrol guy was even less interested in my claims. He shooed me away and told me to come back if anything else happened, but not to worry about it right now. Quite obviously, this didnt solve anything. I kept asking what else I could do, or who else I could talk to, and he finally suggested that I talk to Mr. Stoltz, the head of the Anthropology department, about the camping trip I had heard so much about.
Luckily, Stoltz was still on campus for the weekend to help students with coursework. I rushed to his office to see what information he could provide. As soon as he saw me, he said Oh, Sunny! What a pleasure to see you! After the trip, I was starting to worry you would never come and visit me. How have you been? Hearing Sunny freaked me out no less than it had when others had said it. I calmly tried to explain what was happening, and I showed him the photograph with the scribbled-out face. He kept giving me these puzzled expressions, and opened up his laptop to show me more photos from the trip. Sure enough, there she was. Gripping a hulking backpack. Setting up a tent with other students. Throwing a fishing line into a lake. I assured him it wasnt me, it couldnt be me, there was no way I was a part of that trip. As I talked, I could hear myself starting to sound more and more crazed. After my ranting, he stood up and put a hand on my shoulder. He said something like, Summer, Im not really sure whats going on, but I think it may be good if you went back to your dorm and got some rest. Maybe then youll start to see things more clearly. I left feeling even worse.

I went back to my dorm room. I really didnt want to get my mom involved, worried I would scare her too much. But I figured she was one of my last options. Ive called her over and over, but it seems shes been busy. Im praying shell call me back soon. I want to go home. I want to go home so badly.

Ive been in my dorm all day, worried to go outside. Call me paranoid, but all of this is too much for me to take in. I know Im safe in here, and I know that no one else can get in without a key card. But guys, while I was typing this I got this email and Im freaking out. I think Im losing it. This is the message I just got.

sunny, i bet you thought i wouludnt find out. i bet you thought that dumbass wouldnt spill. but im not stupid and neithher are u. i kno what u did to heather nd ur nothng but a sckanky whore sunny so dont think ull get away u messed with a bad bitch sunny and dont think ull get out of this easy. dont bother watching for me im coming when you dont expect it. your gonna wished you never screwed me over sunnyy

It came from this jumbled-up email, and when I searched it on Google it said it no longer exists. Im so scared, and this Ez guy, hes been calling me all day, and Im too terrified to answer. He keeps sending these texts urging me to call him but I just cant. Im blocking his number. Im freaking out. I dont know what to do. Im terrified. Whoever this girl is, shes done something really wrong, and I dont know how to convince people that she isnt me. Im terrified. Please help me, please help me please help me please

 Thank you... And it's Summer. Please don't call me that.  
























 Great work. I like how you captured the reader's attention and held it through the end. Killer ending as well.  
























 Dead? I can assure you, I'm perfectly alive. How could I have posted any of this? This is no joke. 
 
























 My older brother passed away a couple of nights ago. We found these notes on an open text document on his laptop. For the record, no one in my family knew about Sylvia. As of right now, were conducting a search to find out more about her. Here are the notes. 

Sylvi-

I dont think I could adequately express my feelings for you if I tried. Ever since I saw those crystal blue eyes beneath wavy golden locks, I knew you were destined to be mine. I guess I should apologize in advance for not being the person you and I both wish I was. I want to give you the world, and treat you like a queen, and I suppose all I can say is that Ill sincerely try. Syl, youve given me a chance. And that chance is the most wonderful thing thats ever been given to me. I look at you, and I look at me, and I question why youd ever be with someone like me. Im a mess, Im a ruin, and youre Youre everything. Youre beautiful, and kind, and smart, and ambitious, and youre going places. I dont know if Ill ever show you this letter, but I want you to know that at this moment, I am the happiest Ive ever been. Sylvi, youve made me the luckiest guy on the planet. Youve given me more than I ever could have asked for, Vi. And I promise you, sincerely, I will do all I can to never let you down. Forever and more. 

Sylvi-

I am so in love with you, Sylvi. A couple weeks, and Syl, youre my everything. Youve made me feel a way Ive never felt before in my life, and I dont anticipate ever feeling this wonderful again. Youre like a high that never goes away. Just thinking about you makes me euphoric, Vi, because youre mine. Youre what Ive always wanted but never dared to dream of. Sometimes Im afraid to sleep because Im worried Ill wake up and realize that everything that happened between us wasnt real. I am so grateful for you, and Im so grateful for us. I love you, Sylviana Jane. Forever and more. 

Sylvi-

Im sorry, Vi. Im so, so sorry. I worried that I would screw things up between us, and I did. I didnt mean to make you cry, Sylvi. I didnt mean to make you feel any less than wonderful. Im sorry I yelled at you. Im sorry about the busted lip. I just, I went off, Vi, and It wasnt your fault. I know you wont answer my calls, and you wont answer my texts, but Sylvi, Im begging you, please forgive me. I know I dont deserve it, and I know I dont deserve you, but Im asking you with everything I have to take me back. I promise you Ill never hurt you again. I still love you, Sylvia Jane. Forever and more. 

Sylvi-

Why wont you answer my calls? My texts? Its been 24 hours, Syl, and Im starting to get worried. I dont know where you are, Syl, and it terrifies me. I drove around last night looking for you for I dont know how long. Where the hell did you go? Syl, Im begging you, please, please come back. Ill never ever hurt you, or yell, or any of that ever again. If I dont see you soon, Syl, Im leaving and Ill find you. Ill find you, Syl, you better believe it. Theres no hiding from me, I love you, and I will find you. Forever and more. 

Sylvi-

I cant sleep. Its been 28  hours. I cant do this anymore. Im leaving. Ill find you, Syl, and Ill take you right back where you need to be, with me. I will not stop searching until youre back with me. Forever and more. 

Sylvi-

Even with your eyes shut, Syl, youre so beautiful. Even with the puffy purple lower lip. Even with the swollen eye socket and blood-matted hair. Even lying on a bloodied, dingy carpet amidst glass shards and powdered cyanide. I found you, Syl, and it was too late. You were gone. Youve been gone for hours, Syl. Your pretty eyes are shut for good, never to be reopened. I said Id find you, Syl, and I did. I found you, and I took you home. And youre here, with me. Were together now, just like I had always imagined. On the way back from where I found you, I stopped at a drugstore, and I bought two things. One, the biggest bottle of Tylenol I could find, and two, the most expensive music speaker. $119.47, Sylvi. Nearly maxed out my bank account. 100 pills in the bottle. Ive taken all 100. The first 20 went down easy, but the last were harder. They started tasting bitter after a while, but now I can feel them settling in my stomach. Ive had to fight my gag reflex, but its working. I can feel my perception starting to slip.  And now were both here. Nobody's home. Its quiet and dark. In a couple of minutes, Im going to play that song that always made me think of you as loud as I can, and Im going to lay down next to you, and Im going to join you. Wherever you went, Sylvi, Im coming. Im never losing you again. Ill find you in that vast nothingness. Ill follow you, just like in the beginning. Im coming. And then, we can really be together. Forever, Sylvi. Forever and m

Im sorry its taken me a little while to continue my entries. I spent the last couple of days at the police station. Ill explain why in a moment. 


After getting that cryptic email, I found it difficult to leave my dorm. I spent the rest of Saturday night (and early Sunday morning) terrified, trying to distract myself with weird YouTube videos and upbeat music. I started feeling detached sometime around 3 AM It was one of those things I cant really explain. It was like I was losing my sense of self, bleeding into some foreign form. I tried to calm my anxiety by thumbing through some old scrapbooks and looking at photos of my happy family before the tragedy struck. I loved my Dad so much. Just seeing the pictures gave me a sense of longing and yearning for his voice 


For a couple of days afterwards, everything actually seemed okay. I went to class and avoided contact with anyone and everyone that I could. As soon as my last class would get out, Id rush back to my dorm and lock the doors. I repeated this cycle for days. It was much easier than facing the reality that my roommates and teachers thought I was crazy. I got weird looks everywhere I went. Some people still called me Sunny, but I chose to ignore it. After the messages from Ez, I blocked his number. I havent heard from him since. 


Around Thursday of last week, some strange rumours began circling around campus. I heard my roommates talking about it when I was eating breakfast in our kitchen one morning. Apparently, a girl on campus named Heather had been missing for a number of days and no one knew where she was. One of the girls in my room, lets call her Sophie, apparently knew Heather really well. She was devastated and had no idea where Heather couldve gone. As soon as I heard this, my mind jumped back to that cryptic email. I was so worried that whomever was stalking me had had something to do with Heathers disappearance. 


By Friday, the news had circulated to the entirety of the campus and the police got involved. Heather was nowhere to be found. Apparently, her roommates said that they hadnt seen her since this huge frat party on July 9th. I was at the party, although I didnt remember anything strange happening. 


By Saturday, the police began questioning the students, looking for anyone who had any information about her. They took it dorm by dorm. My group was questioned around seven o clock that night. The questioning took place in a room Im fairly certain used to serve as a broom closet. It stunk heavily of chemicals and sweat. You have to know that by the time I got in the room, alone, with the officer, I began to feel uncomfortable. Even though I knew that I had nothing to do with Heathers disappearance, the email had frightened me. Whoever had sent it had clearly meant to intimidate me, and it worked. The questions were all fairly straightforward- Did I know Heather, did I know anyone who would want to hurt her, did I know where she had been at the party that night. I told them that I had been at the party, but had never met Heather. The officer pulled out a glossy headshot of a pretty blonde with large blue eyes. 


As soon as I saw the image, something clicked in my mind. I had known Heather as a child. We went to the same elementary school in Florida. I hadnt seen her since 5th grade, though, and had no idea that we went to the same college. I told the officer all of this. Our fathers had been very close and operated a small marketing business together, my dad the President and hers the Vice.  Before he passed away, I remember seeing Heather often at barbeques and company dinners. Her father even spoke at my dads funeral.  I couldnt believe I knew her. 


After I told him this, the officer got more and more suspicious. He asked me deeper questions, getting into details about our childhood and the relationship between our families. By the time I was dismissed, it was a huge relief. Later that night, the officers showed up at my dorm. They asked that I leave with them to stay at the station. I was confused and incredibly scared. I had no clue what they wanted with me. 


Once we got to the station, they took me into a room with an older and heavier officer. He was very kind and gave me coffee. Apparently, some other students who preferred to be kept anonymous had told them that I may have been connected to Heathers disappearance. Additionally, a couple of teachers had told them that I had been acting strange and was potentially mentally unstable. He told me that my mother had been notified and was instructed to call back later to discuss further plans. I was so scared. Angry that I had been accused, but more than anything, scared. He told me he believed that I didnt have anything to do with it, especially based on my spotless mental health and school records, but they would need proof. Someone that had been with me that night to testify that I wasnt involved. To my demise, I found it difficult to remember what exactly had happened. I remembered going to the party and dancing, but after that, everything was sort of a blur. All I could see in my minds eye was entering the party, bright lights, and waking up the next morning back in my dorm room. Of course, I didnt tell him this. I knew how crazy it sounded, even to me, and figured that if I told him any of it, it would only turn out to be more incriminating. Part of me wanted to tell him about the whole Sunny situation, but as my mental health was already in question, I figured it best not to. I fell asleep on a metal cot later that night. 


My mom called the station early the next morning. Of course, she wanted to know everything. I heard the officer talking to her for a while, profusely explaining the situation and apologizing for all the trouble it was causing me and her. Afterwards, he handed the phone over to me. I heard my mom crying on the other end. Sweetie, are you okay? Please, God, tell me youre okay! As soon as I heard her voice, I started bawling. I told her everything, the stalking, the email, the accusations, all of it. By the time I was done, she started to get anxious as well. Summer, I think its time you come home. Somethings going on down there, and I know you have nothing to do with it, but I dont think its safe for you to be there anymore. Ill try and find a way to fly out there as soon as I possibly can, and after I talk to the police, you can come right back home with me. Does that sound alright? Of course it did! I was so ridiculously relieved, and it felt as if a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. 


After speaking with my mom and the school superintendent, I was released to go back to my dorm room. Unsurprisingly enough, my roommates acted really uncomfortable around me. I figure they were probably the ones that had told the cops I was unstable. I locked myself in my room and started packing everything back up. The more I put into boxes, the better I felt. It was wonderful. All of that was gone the minute I picked up my scrapbooks. 


My beautiful, kitschy scrapbooks, the ones I had pored over nights ago, were ruined. Torn to shreds. The minute I pulled the box out of my closet and saw the torn covers, a feeling of deep anxiety filled my stomach. With shaking hands, I opened one up. That specific scrapbook was meant to commemorate the year I was 8, right before my dad passed away. On the first page, there was a large photo of Heather and I in third grade. Someone had written EVIL BITCH in bright red sharpie right next to her face. Barely able to move, I turned the page gingerly. More photos of Heather and I, along with some other friends. In every photo Heather was a part of, some sort of sharpie caption followed.  DADDYS LITTLE PSYCHO, MURDEROUS TWIT, and CRAZY BACKSTABBER dotted nearly every page. I was scared to death. I closed the scrapbooks and put them back in the closet. I havent even opened my closet since then. I laid in bed all day yesterday. Scared to move. Scared to speak. I dont even think I slept. 


This morning, I got a text from my mom. The earliest flight she could get in is for Wednesday afternoon. I should be gone by Wednesday night. It was some relief, but after the scrapbooks, Im so scared. Someone has been sneaking in. Someone. I dont know who, or how, or why, but someone wants the police to think that I hurt Heather. Im so terrified. A few hours ago, I drove down to the lake and threw all of the scrapbooks in. Even the ones without writing. Just the thought of someone tampering with them makes me not want them anymore. On the way back to my car, I a glint of silver on the ground near the dock. On closer inspection, it was a bracelet, and a familiar one at that. It was mine. My charm bracelet. It had been a gift from my Dad before he passed. It was mucky and disgusting, and looked like it had been there a while. I have no idea how it was out there. I didnt even remember losing it. I didnt wear it when I took the scrapbooks, and I havent worn it for a few days, at least. I started thinking that maybe whos been sneaking into my room took my bracelet and wore it out there. I ripped off every individual charm and tossed it in the water. I threw the chain itself as far out into the lake as I could. 


Im back in my dorm now. I plan to stay here until Wednesday. I have everything I need here, and no one can hurt me. No one can sneak in and mess with my mind. No one can make me feel delusional or crazy, and no one can accuse me of anything. I will wait for my mother to come, and then I will leave just as quickly and painlessly as I came. Ill be gone so soon. So soon. I just have to stay sane until then.
