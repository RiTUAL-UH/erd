 well, yeah. I lurk on reddit but never really had the urge to post anything till I had this. Apologies if this is against "Reddiquette." It wasn't my intention. 




 Thanks. We know Clones is shit and just wanted to see if there was any way to make it better! I think "kinda cool" means it's a success! 









 That would be pretty awesome.
If you are interested, We will be releasing a 90ish minut rewritten/rescored edit of the prequels with some Jango Fett sequences that may quench your thirst.

 




 Thanks alot! And yeah, I'd say that's a reasonable assumption.  




 Thanks!
The song is Nightcall by Kavinsky 




 or that... 




 I want to see Coruscant having been left in a state of decay after decades of totalitarianism. 
and vibroblades. yeah. just some badass dude with a vibroblade.

 Why have you only gotten nude in Deadwood?

 Fan Created Content of the Month or something more concisely worded . 




 Obi Wan has taught me well. 









 Thanks for watching, we were gunning for something like a Bladerunner vibe. 
 









 Sorry about that, I think it is an issue with the Kavinsky track that's used. YouTube apparently doesn't want certain people to see it.
If anyone has any tricks to get around that type of thing, I'd be interested. 




 Definitely!
If you want, I'll try to shoot you a PM when we upload it.
It should be soon. 




 2006 2-disc special edition dvds include these as a special feature. They don't look too pretty though.
 




 Thanks!
This is actually a clip from a larger prequel edit.
(all 3 Movies are down to one 90ish minute film with a different score and plot.)
I tried to choose the best beats to cut to but some (like that one) may have gotten away.

 The most popular answer will of course be Shia LeBeouf. 




 "Stan Wans" 




 Here are some Posters I made for my fan edit. 

Here is the link to the edit if anyone is interested:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJJqYoMxG7o  









 I bought the Blu Rays and used two programs: "Make MKV" and "Handbrake" 




 well, according to several posters on the Originaltrilogy.com fanedit forums, this one is up there. 
However, The Phantom Edit seems to be one of the more well regarded. 
I think it will depend on how closely you want the edit to stick to the unedited films.  









 Will do. 
I just want to know how some of the other full length edits on YouTube get so many views. 




 It may also depend on the rights holders to the music you are using.
Some may be less merciful than others
 




 I believe that you may need to make a separate plain old youtuber account. I think that YouTube will take them down if they have the possibility of being monetized by the uploader, which you can't do with a base account. 
That was my thought process,at least. You should still be able to upload the long videos. 
YouTube is pretty mysterious to me though.  




 What kind of account are you using?
 
























 Tin Tin 2 




 I didn't make this, 
just found it in the youtubes 














 This is why so many trailers show you the whole movie. 




 I think you can safely say Zombieland is a zombie movie.
 




 Something like "hey guys! Iiiiiiittttsssss Chimichanga Time!!"
and then Deadpool bursts onto screen with Benny Hill music being chased around in circles by hot chicks in their underwear wearing Bea Arthur masks?
 




 Groovy 




 Is Die Hardest off the table now? 




 I just thought I was being funny. 
Don't mind me. 
I'm interested in seeing this at some point though. 
 




 So there have been other Persian-language Israeli films that haven't starred Hollywood Actor Navid Negahban?

 At what point do you stop liking movies? Can you tell the difference between a film from 1989 and 1990?
Do you really even like movies if you are willing to disregard 70% of the history of film? 




 one word. 

Nazis. 




 Yeah ... back in the 40's ... pretty common knowledge. 




 Would you have been bothered by The Long Halloween or Year One's departure from typical Batman fare when it was released? Or would you welcome the new take? 
Why do you think that the MCU's films are more in line with writers like Stan Lee than someone like Brian Michael Bendis? 




 How do you judge which version of a comic book character is the most true, since the characters evolve and change wildly from author to author?
Do you think Birdman would have topped the box office in the early 90's? 




 Do you feel that the recent superhero films are typically not bringing a fresh take to their source material? Are they too faithful?  




 Both Schindler's list and Jurassic Park are based on books, one of which is based on a book about something that actually happened. 
 




 Moonraker has a ton of Pepsi product placement I believe  




 The Samurai Trilogy by Hiroshi Inagaki

 If looking at the sea motifs are your thing: Check out Takeshi Kitano's filmography

Also, they're great movies.  




 Sir Ian, 
Ive tried your acting advise from Extras, but it doesn't seem to work for me. Any further advice?

How different did the mood on the Hobbit sets feel compared to LOTR?

Do you and other Knights occasionally gather to fight crime together?
 




 He looks like he has a very tiny head compared to his body.
 
























 That'll be a tough one to beat, I think. 




 Color has been around for most of the history of film.

Recently, the film Locke takes places over only a couple of hours.  




 That's some shaky ground. 




 Ghostbusters gets confusing. 




 Not that much different when you type it out. Heh. 




 While not unwatchable, John Wick's score is aggressively lame. 




 What are some of your specific complaints? What were your expectations before watching it? 




 Yes, there are many lost films.

 But he is saying that people feel she is wrong based on an incorrect understanding of the character.

Not everything is completely subjective. 




 You could just look up the nominations for any given year?
Save you time and hassle. 




 
Mickey Rourke had to look at a picture of his dead cat in order to tear up for a scene in Iron Man 2.
That's pretty method, right? 
























 The mirror scene in 25th hour and the "Dead N-Word storage" scene in Pulp Fiction.

In both scenes, our awareness of the directors' personalities breaks immersion. 




 Just watch the Directors cut. It adds some excellent scenes that are missed in the theatrical. it also adds some silly bits, but overall its the better version of the movie. 
The ultimate cut is neat, but don't watch it for your first time. 
 




 Duly noted.
 




 Thank you, 
It does bug me that he cites "too dark" as his reason for distancing himself from Temple. When I think it is more likely the other, like you said.
the movie is just a case of Spielberg sticking a bit too close for comfort to the adventure serials he loves so much without finding a way to subvert or update their more questionable tropes for modern sensibilities.
 




 It doesn't drastically change or improve the film. But it's nice to watch if you want to see more mutants doing mutant things.  




 I find it strange that people seem to have more of an issue with the silly bits in Crystal Skull than the troublesome xenophobia and sexism in Temple of Doom.

I think they're all varying degrees of good, though.  




 He falls out of a plane in an inflatable raft and doesn't get hurt.
You go try that. 




 Wes Anderson

Organized Crime film. 




 Simple Plan 




 If I'm remembering right.
Yojimbo was sort of a response by Kurosawa to critics saying he was too "western" in his filmmaking.
Kurosawa was "I'll show you western!" With yojimbo.
 




 It seems like it is going to be similar to Jumanji or Zathura 




 Your use of "boring" confuses me. 
























 Which implies that the TDK was not a departure in tone from Begins.
In what way is the Tone of Rises more removed from the tone of TDK than TDK is from Begins?

unless you are saying that each film has been a departure, but for some reason dislike Rises for it. 




 What about the film makes you say this?

Why do you think that TDK and Begins have a more consistent tone than TDK and Rises? 




 I think he's probably asking for some of your judgements.
Not why you didn't judge it the first time. 




 It's disingenuous to suggest I was definitely suggesting it was you who was being disingenuous. 

About that particular sentence, at least.

*squints eyes* 




 I wouldnt call Scarlet Witch a lead either. 
It's hard to say about upcomming movies. 

I love the marvel movies, nor do I find them to be particularly sexist, but it is disingenuous to imply that they are giving their female characters the same attention as the males. 




 I wouldn't call most of those leads.
 




 The Long Good Friday 




 Like a...a short....film!  




 There are plenty of characterizations of the Joker that work just fine in their respective films/books. 

But the one thing that the Joker NEEDS is the Batman. 




 it seems to be a rip off of the futurama episode: Anthology of Interest 2 




 Michael Keaton plays the same character in both Jackie Brown and Out of Sight. 




 She looked a little stormy 
























 So....when they are stereotypes. 




 There is a difference between government and societal censorship. You are constantly a part of the latter.

Are you saying that there is no cause for comedic minstrel shows to be shunned by audiences? Comedy should tackle these topics and not be afraid of them, but society should discourage works which continue damaging stereotypes. 




 It's time to talk about a worse problem facing Hollywood today: unnecessary puns.

*edit* Sexism does exist in the movie industry though. And feminism is good. 

 




 Yeah, Keanu's 47 ronin existing on a top 10 samurai list is pretty upsetting. 

I haven't seen it myself but Kon Ichigawa's 47 Ronin is a fairly well regarded telling of the same story. 

I do have a soft spot for Last Samurai, but its not top 10 material. Ninja scroll and 13 Assassins are pretty cool. As is the original 13 Assassins by Eiichi Kudo, and two companion films "The Great Killing" and "11 Samurai"

I've watched too many samurai movies. 




 Kurosawa is a master, but you are doing a disservice to yourself as a fan of the genre by limiting yourself to just him.

Check out the Samurai Trilogy by Hiroshi Inagaki which is on this list, Twilight Samurai as well. 
Sword of Doom by Kihachi Okamoto,
 
The original Harakiri by Masaki Kobayashi, and every other movie by Kobayashi you can find. 
  




 I just, think you should check out what roles get nominated for lead actor or actress and which get nominated for supporting at the Oscars. Otherwise, someone may conclude that your definition is purposefully vague in order to support whatever your argument is.

*squints eyes* 




 Then what is a supporting character? 




 Which rules of physics do Thor's hammer break? 




 The editing and fight choreography have always been pretty sloppy in the trilogy. 

TDK is definitely the most "real" of the three, but it still has things like the silly bullet forensics. Begins is not particularly grounded in comparison. 
I'm glad you still like it though.  




 What is your definition of "lead"? 




 But then, how do you know if you'll like the ending before buying the ticket?
Seems risky. Dangerous even. 




 Can you give me an example of how Rises is so devoid of brooding? 
If I recall our main protagonist gets beaten and spends quite a lot of time in a subterranean prison, left helpless while his city is under siege .
 
























 Great movie. However, when I watched it, I couldn't help feel that it could have been a lot *blacker*. 
Peter Dinklage was great though. No issues there. 









 Nobody does it better by Carly Simon 




 And you have to lie in order to tell the truth.

Oooohhhh yeeaaahhh!?!?! 




 

" I do agree with you that the public has every right to disagree with it if they so choose. Just like it is the comedian's right to continue with his comedy, and If public opinion is strong enough and oppose him he/she will stop."

This is exactly the process that this article is a part of. Public opinion grows through discussion. Which is what this article is.  

Free speech and Free markets censor things all of the time. 
 




 I took your last comment to a logical extreme, since you stated that you would not label minstrel shows as racist.


I think you are confused about my basic argument. Which is not in favor of authoritarian censorship. 
 
My entire argument is that, someone should be free to put on any show that they wish, however they are not free from the public's opinion. 
And the public should have the opinion that overt racism, sexism, etc is wrong and should thus choose to not support those things.

The original claim was that Amy shumers movie perpetuated certain negative stereotypes instead of using comedy to subvert or satirize them. 

I think you underestimate the degree to which media influences our worldviews.

Edit: disregard the minstrel show stuff. I got my arguments confused.
The Hitler statement was still a logical extreme of your previous statement. 




 So, if Hitler had a comedy routine you wouldn't say his ideas should be discouraged?  




 Have you ever not watched a comedian because you did not find them funny or disagreed with them in some way? 




 Do you like that pun? 




 I am not talking about "shutting down" comedy in any way other than what the free market dictates. 

Society at large would not accept a 1920's minstrel show today, and as such it would not find investors and would not be written and performed. In effect, society shifted attitudes of race have "censored" the once popular minstrel show.



 




 That's clearly different than a minstrel show.
And is an example of the exact thing I am talking about.

Do you think minstrel shows, operating in the same manner they used to, should still exist? 




 Do you think they're should still be Minstrel shows? 




 Do you think there should still be Minstrel shows? 




 That is an example of societal censorship. It is using satire to show that the stereotypes do not hold weight and that their existence should be shunned.
