 100% agree 




 Has there ever been a player close to, equal to, or better than Lebron at making players around him better? JR's resurgence and emergence as a weapon on this team, I believe, is completely the Lebron effect. Like, him and Bron can go off together and just dominate a game as a duo. He does the same thing with Kyrie and did the same thing with Wade or Bosh. Even back to Mo Williams when he was an all star, that was all the Lebron duo effect. Takes a 33 win team to number one in vegas odds to win the chip the day he signs... single-handedly changes franchises. Just curious to see what you guys think! 




 well shit, id be itchin to come to cleveland now too that theyre relevant again

 But most important, are you 12... or 13? 




 Very, *veeeeerry* important crack 




 And that sir, is why you are wrong.  




 Yeah, talking to him. That doesnt mean anything. He could have been recruiting for when he is a free agent. He does that with plenty of players 




 You're right... but, what if? maybe 7..... 




 This isnt a movie and i dont care. 
McConaughey in True Detective. Not a single soul could have done that the way he did it. perfectly done 




 yeah, science bitch 




 dude, dont bring that up. i have to live the rest of my life as a steelers fan saying "what if Tebow didnt torch us for an 80 yard TD bomb to win the game in OT?" 




 yeah that series was an anomaly. i was at game 4 and you could tell he wasnt in the right place. he honestly looked like he was playing a game he had never played before. but other than that series, all he has been in clutch. never understood this 




 KD was gettin up there for me this year just bc of his twitter crap and his "you can play me for it" shit about his all star bid. like, you didnt earn that, at least be grateful. but, i cant blame a guy whos had frustrating injuries like that after an MVP season. 

Westbrook will have to do 




 dude, come on. none of this is remotely accurate 




 OH MY GOD I KNOW. LIKE, THIS IS PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL. ACT LIKE AN ADULT GOOD GOD 




 Who said he does...? 




 So Kyrie and Dion and old Varejao were his golden ticket? Come on man...  




 MJ had/has the same cult following. But, I agree about him getting away with offensive fouls sometimes. However, the dude gets hit in the face on drives all the time and never gets a call bc he isnt effected by it bc he's so big. I think him getting away with pushoffs and hooks is refs making up for missing him get hip checked in the air 




 Yeah, because that totally isn't classless at all and the exact same thing they did to Dirk..... 




 For real. Just get it all out, no need to hold back. We're all friends here 




 Screw Boozer. He's one of the most annoying players ever 




 Sounds on purpose 




 my heart likes it a whole lot 




 Im a white dude who lives in a city and i just pre ordered it. Is that good or bad? 




 How many are there for real? The commercials make it seem like there's a lot.  




 Reese wasnt in gone girl bruh 




 Welp. He's resting this game so I guess the back situation is more real than I thought 




 Hopefully he rests. Good time for him to grab some extra rest. Also, would love for Love to have just a giant game to get him back in the swing of things. We will need him come May 




 Even if Lebron isnt the MVP, he will get the MVP. after everything, it's the fairytale ending the league and the team and he wants 




 I like this one. Scariest teams are gonna be 5-8 




 youre telling me a Paul George, who hasnt played all season, is going to come back in the lineup and not kill their chemistry AND play like a star against the best player in the world? Cavs in 4, moving on.  




 Rockets dont get past first round. Warriors dont make it past the second round. Blazers and Spurs the dark horses to make it to the Finals. Cavs win finals in 5 games against whoever they play.  




 I don't even think it's that. it's how dangerous it is to have something that distracting on the road, right? i mean, it is a powerful message and all but dang, poorly placed.  




 10/10 would dump 




 Lilly even says smokes sandwiches. Like, come on 




 We would also destroy them one on one right now 




 Yes, all of this, but also what the hell was goin on with Mozgovs hands tonight? mighta been just me but it looked like he couldnt catch anything 




 He WILL be an MVP in the future. No question about it with that ball handling and finishing ability. Not to mention that 3 point stroke!! Damn 




 I think 3-9 against teams over .500 is the only argument you need 




 When in reality, he brought in over 150 mil to the Heat in 12-13 alone.  









 Dumbledore Mt. Everest  




 Vince, T-Mac, Marc 




 It would make for some playoff series with more fire and intensity. Nobody is gonna like gettin called out by the one seed. i like it 




 It's the "idea" of an escape tho that draws people to it 




 That's why. Earth sucks sometimes, so lets see how it is out there. It's an escape 




 Yeah OKC is like a +36 with him off the floor and -24 with him on past few games. Not MVP-like to me 




 hahaha bruh. hop outta here with that Teague stuff.  




 never works for me. stimulates my mind 




 Worst win percentage in the league without him in uniform. I think that speaks volumes 




 He's carrying them offensively, but they're better defensively with him off the floor. I also just dont see the league giving an MVP award to a (maybe) 8 seed.

 BRUH me too. this was that 8th grade basketball pre game hype track 




 yeah, i think he's the guy who can slay anybody on a song but just isnt as popular to the average fan.  




 exactly. drake changed the genre to an extent so saying he cant make a classic is near sighted. if his career ended today he would still be known as a complete game-changer with tons of bangers that everyone knows 




 Interstellar. Made me think deeply about things I had never thought about, question things i always thought were solid fact, and shed tears at how emotional it was. Something about him being the same age as his daughter and missing her entire life while only being gone, in his time, for a very short period. Awesome movie 




 Literally none of these work.

 I love that bang 




 past few games it feels like thats been our entire offense. pisses me off. run a play 




 yeah im just confused about the whole nonchalant nudity thing happenin here 




 Lebron deserves it over everyone. He's the best player on the planet. But, I'm 85% sure he won't get it regardless of how out of his mind he plays until the middle of june because people just want someone else to get it. Like DRose a few years ago. Yeah right 




 Neil Patrick Harris as The Riddler
Johnny Depp as a character like John Cusack played in Frozen Ground
Will Smith as a Bond villain somehow
Bryan Cranston as literally any character in anything because he's the best. But I wish he could have been Lex Luthor in this Batman v. Superman comin out. 
I would watch Matthew Mcconaughey be his True Detective character forever so if he played a guy like that but motivated by evil, I'd be down.  




 haha lebron is the most clutch player in the league. just look at the clutch-time stats. bleacher report did a story about the clutchest players in the league and it's not even close

 Woah. This just put the whole season into perspective. Bravo 




 coulda sworn she was gonna kill herself. like 4 different times I thought "this is it. here it is" but no. slightly disappointed but also intrigued to see where they go next. that one lady claire talked to with the baby said that she (claire) should be president and Claire had a distinct "I'm intrigued" look on her face.

Can someone remember the name? I cant for the life of me 


































 Under Pressure goes hard. Logic is gonna be big 




 Miles Teller is a great actor. I'm lookin forward to this movie 




 Yeah but he can make those regardless. Best player on the planet has to make difficult jumpers in the playoffs 




 What's wrong with Lebron's jumper? Dude just can't find it. Hope that shapes up as we head through the playoffs 




 it's a bad angle.  




 It makes me so sad. Like, you're huge. Get on the block, the actual block not this 18 feet away from the rim post ups, and jump hook the shit out of em.  




 Kyrie is the most unguardable player in the league off of pick and rolls. You go under, he splashes a 3. You go over, he's goin to the rack where he's the best finisher in the league. You hedge hard, he's splitting you for a 4 on 3 advantage where he is probably gonna get a bucket. Crazy 




 SO FINE UUUGGHHHHHH 




 its been bad 




 Except for his inability to jump through people and dunk the ball. He's got some weight lifting to do this off season 




 Our defense is just plain awful right now. I'm sad.  




 my point is no one is that consistent. regardless of the level of competition, no one has been that consistent for that long  




 To say it isn't impressive to never have a bad first round series in an entire career is insane.  




 All the "bc hes in the east, come to the west and see if that stays" crap is stupid. 5 years from now, the East is gonna have the 60+ win teams and 8 seeds that have 50+ wins and the west will have sub .500 teams in the playoffs. It flips back and forth, always has always will 




 Not impressive to never get bounced in the first round? You serious? 




 I think Kyrie Irving is going to be the most outstanding player in the league until the Finals start. There's just something about the way he plays that makes him seem like a guy who can really succeed in the all-eyes-on-you playoff stage and with that kind of intensity. Big game player.

 scratch my hatch 




 As is the case with CB, when you get twice the shots, you'll score points. That's not a very difficult concept to grasp 




 Don't tell me 14 pts a game from Wade on a bum knee is contributing. And I never questioned Bosh's pick and roll defense. I agree, he is excellent at that. Guarding big men, however, is another story. He got cooked by Roy Hibbert(!!!) 2 years in a row before *Udonis *Haslem was put on him and shut him down. And he couldn't guard Duncan, or Splitter for that matter, two years in a row. 

All of those things aside, when I say Lebron carried them, I'm not wrong. He led the team is scoring, rebounds, assists, and steals for nearly 4 full years. He was the best defender in the league, regardless of who got the award, for 2-3 of those years. so he had to guard the likes of DRose, KD, Tony Parker, Paul Pierce, Paul George, etc. all while leading the offense in every statistical category there is. Yes, DWade contributed at times and yes, CB helped spread the floor and in p r situations defensively, but outside of that, it was '09/'10 Cavaliers all over again. 

But, I greatly appreciate you actually contributing information and making a logical argument. Most people just throw aimless comments out there and hope they stick.  




 i disagree. i also think it's ridiculous to still be upset with him about that. that's the only questionable thing he has done since he was 17 years old. he is a stand-up guy who has always gone above and beyond for his community. and even when he was in Miami, you knew he always wanted to be back home. to not forgive him for essentially going off to college before realizing he was meant to stay home is just immature.   




 I would love to hear your reasoning instead of just a blind statement.  




 Uhh... he did. Just because he was getting, what, 22 and 10 before he had the lung issues doesn't mean he isn't past his prime. He was getting twice as many shots and was the unquestionable focus of the offense every time down the floor this season. You're bound to have better numbers when you get twice the shots. But prime Bosh? That was in 2011 when he would routinely get 30 and 15. When Lebron and Wade were out, he would drop 40+ and single-handedly win games. You won't see that from him again 




 He did. He doesn't score those easy points unless Lebron is on that team.  




 Prime Wade and Bosh left after 2011. Wade was hurt from '12 to now and Bosh became a jump shooter who couldnt defend 5's, which is what he had to play bc that team had no size. Lebron carried those teams and it's not even an argument.  




 wait so lebron isnt even in your top 5? _ 




 I just want a realistic spider-man. Like, why is he so witty and funny? Didn't Robin Williams say the funniest people are the ones hurting the most or something like that? Make Uncle Ben's death dark. The whole thing dark. Like The Dark Knight dark. I want him to resort to humor because he's depressed and fight crime to try to *AVENGE his uncle's death. I dont want the same old high school stuff we've seen. Reinvent it. Make it new. I want him to do bad things to criminals because he's so angry. I want dark humor at first until he realizes what he actually needs to do to with his ability. I want Captain America to be integrated somehow and sort of take him under his wing and show him how to be responsible with his abilities. I want Captain to tell him "With great power comes great responsibility," echoing what Uncle Ben told him previously, only this time it actually clicks. Finally, I want him to become an *Avenger. But only because he has earned it and struggled through the pain to become one.

 That's not what I mean. Just the whole homecoming, fairy-tale kind of season it would be if they make it all the way and win. He'd be a hero and even if he didn't have the best series individually, he would get the award.  









 No matter who has the best series, Lebron will get the MVP. It's one of those storybook ending kinda things 




 I would! Currently on my phone though so the flash doesnt work. Definitely using that in the future though! 




 Not watching the game bc league pass is too damn expensive, but is lebron just not shooting well or is he missing easy shots or what? seeing him shoot 5 of 14 always makes me angry 




 I just feel like we all need some evidence as to how incredible dat ass is before we judge this man for his innocent compliment.... lol 




 and people be gettin mad at me sneezin 5 times in a row in class.

 I was frozen solid in my seat watching that. Didn't move an inch. So incredibly mesmerized by all that scene took and how expertly executed it was.  




 A Time to Kill. come on, now 




 haha he was so awesome to me as that character. so believable. just crazy enough 




 yes. i understand what it is technically. all im saying is, in terms of quality, this is only a mixtape. hence the excitement for, what he calls, his album.  




 What im saying is, he didnt put the work/effort into this "mixtape" as he calls it as he will for his actual album. and i got screwed then bc mine said 14.99.  




 It was actually more than that, so your argument is invalid. And he literally said it was a mixtape. Only on sale to get out of his CM deal. Come on, keep up son

 but, can you throw it over your shoulder? 




 hahah ring back tones. those were the shit 




 I can see him resting em for the last game. Other than that, I think he'll play em. This year is just different with the playoff road ahead. Won't be as grueling in the East but also the pressure to win I think will effect Blatt's resting method. He'll want to maintain the rhythm and flow of the rotation going into that first round, imo 




 He's in my top 5 most hated players in the league. Dude has hated Lebron forever because he always gets stomped by him.  




 My favorite is "You sir, have a small penis" and then a detailed cartoon drawing of a man with a monocle looking down from above the urinal.  




 hahaha get tf outta here 




 i think they probably have a pretty good relationship. as much these kinds of stories suck, lebron knows better than anybody that stories like this are gonna happen regardless. i mean, he's known the dude since high school 




 the whole "spaghettified" thing is being debunked right now. Physicists arent sure if that is what would actually happen or not.  




 Id still give it to Aldridge just because he'll never get it again bc Davis is gonna run the league from here on out

 It's actually incredibly useful for recovery and energy. Have a place like that in my town, used it before and after every game last year. It's insane how much spring you get in your step 




 Ive said it before, I'll say it again: Mike Miller is going to be huge these first two games. He'll spread the floor offensively and he can guard Mirotic or Dunleavy. I know his shot has been off when he's played this season, but he is a playoff performer. Look out for MikeMillMadeIt come Monday 




 Am a white kid from Texas who didn't have the daddy money to buy a car with. Can confirm. Nobody actually cared about anything if it didnt have to do with them. The reason I listen to the kind of rap that actually says something about life is bc i have no clue what that life is like. I actually wrote a paper about it this semester, and I just basically like seeing life from different perspectives and trying to understand from a distance what people are going through bc i have no idea what that life is like. 
Anyway, I'd like to apologize for the jackasses who didnt give a shit. All us white kids aren't like that, I promise.

 *hole 




 I dont want this theory to hinge on Bruce pulling something Batman-ish out of his ass. I think Nolan showed Selina Kyle in that scene just to mess with the audience and make us question everything we just saw, exactly like the end of Inception. I just find it extremely hard to believe that Bruce either got the bomb out far enough from the city and somehow escaped the blast radius himself in that small amount of time, or used the auto pilot to take the bomb out which would mean that everything we see of him in the aircraft is fake. Just doesnt make sense. Makes a lot more sense for him to sacrifice himself to protect the city he has dedicated his life to protect and for Nolan to throw Bruce and Selina in that last scene just to fuck with us. For me, that was Alfred seeing what he always wished he would see every time he went there. Completely in his head.  




 No, the ship was not put in autopilot. It simply said the auto pilot had been fixed.  




 That Bruce Wayne is alive and Alfred actually saw him at the restaurant in Paris. Bruce Wayne died. He sacrificed himself for the city, as it was always intended. What Alfred saw is what he always hoped to see when he went there. That's what that scene meant. He was, once again, seeing what he wanted. But Bruce died. Period.  




 I just hope he has to deal with that disgustingly thin "goatee" for the rest of his life. talk about shame 




 Always imagine this track playing behind a video of like slow-mo phantom cam nba highlights. The beat just reminds of somethin like that. cant explain why 




 No. Just saying that he has the ability to defend guys like mirotic, as i said, and spread the floor offensively for Kyrie and Lebron. It's really not that hard of a concept to grasp 




 Ocean's 11, 12, and 13. But mostly 11 




 Guarantee Miles Teller will win one. He's going to develop into a phenomenal actor 




 YES. AGREED. THANK YOU 




 Iman Shumpert is expected to play well. Mike Miller isn't. Therefore, him playing well is the unexpected X factor.  




 I promise I'm not! Just watch. He'll come up big in this next series 




 Mike Miller is the X factor in our playoff run from here on out. I saw it in Miami, I see it now. If he can hit 3's like he has in playoffs of old and if he can defend like he has in the past, he's a game changer. He is a guy who has been through it all before with Lebron and knows where he needs to be at critical points in a game. He's 6 foot 8 so he can guard some 4's who tend to stay outside (mirotic, for example) and he can rebound the ball too. If Blatt actually plays him, he can genuinely affect games.  




 Why can I only see the To Pimp A Butterfly album cover when I look at pictures of these protests? 




 More optimistic about our chances in the East? Absolutely! At winning a title? Not so much. If Kevin indeed tore his labrum and has tendon damage, he might not be back at all. Especially since he would be banging that shoulder in the post all game. and ESPECIALLY since he can be a free agent. I just don't know if we can beat, say the warriors, without him. If he can play (and chooses to) i 100% think we can win it all. but he has to play 




 We can beat either team without Kevin. Neither team is playing well and both have weak points. Guys, I'm excited 




 Heat beat the post-heavy Pacers without Bosh. Cavs can win without Love. Gonna be tough and it'll take everything Lebron and Kyrie have, but it can be done 




 Didn't he sign like a 6 movie deal? Cap 3 would be number 5... 




 Mike Mill is gettin pt this series. Lebron knows who he is in the playoffs (game 5 in '12, 7 3's, shoeless 3 against the spurs) and he's is gonna make sure he plays. The only issue i see is our starting lineup. we have to match pau and noah so tt and moz have to start. cant spread the floor with that. so we have to wait for the bulls to put a smaller guy in before we can have a lineup that suits our strengths. in other words, we cant make the first move. we'll be adjusting to what they do instead of the other way around. still think we got em tho 




 Hopefully Leron doesn't throw up clankers for 3 quarters before he realizes he can just drive past anybody and score. But if anyone can get it done, it's Lebron and Kyrie 




 Yeah Kevins mad. He's playing as soon as possible. and losing JR isn't going to be huge for however many games it ends up being. I think we'll see a lot of Mike Miller next series and a lot more post up Lebron. I'm not worried about this series honestly because we have all the pieces to win. If guys like James Jones, Mike Miller, Kyrie, And Shump all hit shots, we'll be fine. Plus, I don't trust DRose to do anything 




 Hahahah yo that's hilarious. That's how it was for that Heat team against the Hawks too. But yeah, things are different now. Winning this next series with injuries and suspensions will just cement his legacy tho 




 basketball reference.com. literally showed it on screen during the game. in the NBA, when a dislocated shoulder is listed as the cause of injury to a player, the average number of games missed is 27 games. However, I am not saying Kevin will be out for 27 games. I am saying that, on average, that's how many games are missed by players during the regular season. and yes, if there's no ligament or tendon damage then of course it wont be that long.  




 Average games missed by NBA players with same injury: 27 games.  




 This is the dumbest comment in this whole thread.  




 this is fucking atrocious 




 agreed 




 bend him over a table 




 james jones is fucking terrible today. get him out of the damn game 




 you clearly didnt watch him the past 5 years. Especially last year in memphis. dude locked people down for long stretches of games. and again, you clearly dont know mike miller. he could shoot 0 for 500 in the regular season and come into a playoff game and go 7 for 7. he is a big game, big shot maker 




 MIKE MILLER AND SHAWN MARION NEED TO BE PLAYING IN THIS GAME. MIKE IS A 3 AND D GUY AND MATRIX IS A SLASHER/POST UP GUY EHO DEFENDS AND REBOUNDS. I DONT UNDERSTAND 




 This game is hard to watch at best. So much settling and stupid shots and isolations and bad defense and fouls and im sad now

With a little research, you too can find the pictures of him on set actively filming a scene in his costume and make up without a big ass tattoo on his forehead! Woohoo! The internet is awesome! In the words of Walter White, "Fuck you, and your eyebrows!" ass.  




 Yes! I feel the same way! I loved the original ones at the time but upon comparison I thought Garfield was just more spiderman like 




 Let me clarify, the acting wasn't bad. But Spiderman wasn't convincing. Like somebody said farther down the comments, Tobey was a better Peter Parker but the Garfield guy was a better spiderman. I just didnt like the spiderman depicted 




 Exactly 




 Yes, she wasn't hot. Just cause she's soaked and her tits are showing doesn't make her hot. MJ is supposed to be an unattainable level of hotness. She, clearly, is not.  




 Jerry Maguire:
Miles Teller as Jerry
Emma Stone as Dorothy
Anthony Mackie as Rod
Margot Robbie as Avery
Channing Tatum as Cushman
Tom Hiddleston as Bob Sugar
 




 Holy shit. Why is this not a movie yet 




 He doesnt have the tats in the movie. that was just for the promo pic 




 "How many.. of your friends... have I killed?"
"Would you like to know.. which of them were cowards?" 




 Fight Club. Like, it was okay. I guess when it was released it was probably a big twist-at-the-end thing people hadnt really seen before (speculation cause i have no clue. im 19) but I just didn't get the hype.  




 I thought Garfields version was much more Spiderman-like than Tobey's.  




 Acting was bad. MJ wasn't hot. Only thing good about it was the villain. 

Let the roasting commence.  




 Yeah thats cool, but how is that end result achieved? 




 HAHAHAHAH AMERICAN PSYCHO!!! PATRICK BATEMAN IN THE FLESH!! HE HACKS HIS FACE IN WITH AN AXE TO "IN THE AIR TONIGHT" SHORTLY AFTER 




 A Few Good Men and Jerry Maguire are his two favorite. Pretty much slips a line from each one into conversation every day. I also love those movies, probably because of him 




 Azizi Gibson, anybody have any good stuff? I know Claustrophobia and Backward Books, but that's it. Really feelin the beats to those two 




 I encourage all daughters to kiss they mothers, with those lips that all that lipstick covers, you're never too grown up to miss and hug her 




 Yo, this is Drakes song. Not a verse from Ross's song. He put his out way earlier and Ross asked for it 




 Exactly what I was thinking. Dude always looks so pissed off at those people.  




 Well, correct me if I'm misinformed, but I believe a clock operator is the guy who operates the damn clock so fuck you and your sarcasm, dumb idiot.

 thanks fam 




 Hey can somebody post the post game interviews for those of us in a college dorm with no NBA TV...... 




 He said "I packed it" one time too haha 




 HAHAHAH HYPE TRAIN 




 Read that in Dave Francos voice from neighbors when he's doin that impression with jigsy cat 




 Holy fuck. That was incredible. That's gonna be an Oscar worthy Johnny Depp performance 




 LoL 




 Anybody know when some new Drake is coming out? Seems like pretty soon would be a good time since he is trying to recover from the bad reviews he got about his Coachella sets.  




 Kate Beckinsale, here here 









 That would be the sickest thing ever. Loved Treasure Planet when i was a youngin 




 http://i.imgur.com/qh56qoH.jpg 




 get outta here. he didnt give him a chance to land. look at the feet 




 Sallgood, man 




 Lebrons gotta step up next half. Been playin like hes been to 4 straight finals and is tired or something..... 




 I think that half showed how important JR making shots is for our offense. If he isn't hitting, our spacing is bad and we go iso and settle for stupid shots way too much.   




 Lead at the half.  upvotes for everybody 




 well fuck me. im too filled with rage to realize we said the same thing. apologies fam 




 he looks lost 




 No, he's either settling or too passive. He's driving to pass, not to score. which is infuriating.  




 oh god. she's younger than me. oh god oh god oh god. does this mean i have a chance?!??? 




 Some of that Inception, city turning over on itself stuff was dope too 




 I feel like this is an understood thing about the movie.  




 This song will forever be in any top 5 drake list. gold 
























 couldnt care less that he banked it. im just pissed they didnt call the fuckin travel on Butler two possessions earlier. nigga took 4 steps 




 no it wasnt. falling away off target. lucky he got glass 




 make up no call for the no travel call 




 NICE TRAVEL GOOD GOD 




 lebron to TT lob? 




 he just cant hold the ball for all 24 seconds of a possession. spot him up in the corner. run some other action 




 Yo, those two Lebron buckets were so insanely clutch. Props, King.  




 Doesn't matter of he's hurt. If he's out there, he has to have an impact.  




 Why isnt shump in the game. I want him in for Kyrie now 




 ball dont lie.  




 I want Delly playing the 1, Kyrie and Shump spreadin the floor, and Lebron and Tristan beastin in the paint.  




 haha 35 game seconds. it's something, i guess 




 Ball dont lie 




 A Kevin Love commercial... :'( why? why do this to us? 




 God I love everyone on this team right now.  




 No rest 




 i want delly 




 Lebron just executed a one-man trap. Wow.  




 Lebron, you gotta make a layup bruh. No excuses.  




 Tristans effort just brings a tear to my eye. He needs a gift basket or something 




 Wake up tomorrow like how the fuck did i get here? last i remember, Bitch ass Noah was talkin some noise and i got pissed off and rose up and.... 




 Let's be real, if Mozgov catches the ball a couple more times, we're up by more and have less TO's. So, he gotta step up.  




 Catch it high, keep it high, have bouncy feet, lay it up. dont have to power jam every time. get the points.  




 a virgin who's had sex for the first time.... so he's taking every shot because he's the fuckin man in his head? nah 




 yo i know Kyrie is hurting, but he needs to tape it up at the half and get goin. we need him 




 DELLY 




 he cant go to the rim. refs arent calling shit. cant hit a jumper. fucj 




 DAMMIT. GET A HANDLE AND DUNK ON PAUS UGLY ASS FACE 




 yo when he hits a 3, he typically starts to find a groove with his jumper. not always, but most times. hopefully he can find it tonight 




 not this again lebron 




 mozgovs in the way 




 good god mazgov cant catch 




 Hence, the joke 




 So Lebron can advance and so CP3 can't. Rose plays worse with one day of rest and CP3 would benefit too much from extra time off. It's all a conspiracy, man 




 http://imgur.com/33e5gfR 




 When that first track started, I coulda sworn Make It Rain was about to start blarin 




 hahahah cardale joinin the FUCK NOAH HYPE TRAIN YEEAAAAHHHHH 




 TRISTAN "I WANT THE MAX TOO BOSS" THOMPSON 




 Their best shot with our worst=7 point loss
Us just playing aggressive and them not shooting well= complete blowout from start to finish 




 wish mike woulda faked the swing pass and splashed that one tho 




 One of the best teammates in the league according to the guys he has played with. Always love having guys like that 




 Remember that "one day of rest for Rose" stat? Yeah, I'm really excited about that one.  




 You right!  




 agreed. missing more than you make isn't efficient, but it's definitely not bad 




 always 




 13 for 28? damn. not very efficient but ill take it 




 play according to what the coach assumes theyre gonna do. watch their plays, how they react. it is what it sounds like. you feel out the game and decide what you need to do 




 He didnt establish back in bounds. bad no call 




 He didn't take a game off. It was a "feel-out" game. If you've ever watched him in the playoffs, you know he always feels out what theyre going to do before deciding how he needs to play.  




 nah bro 




 CAN MOZGOV CATCH TO SAVE HIS DAMN LIFE GOOD GOD 




 UUUGGHHHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!! AAAAANNNNDDDDD OOONNNEEEEEEE 




 I would like to take this opportunity to publicly admit how incredibly wrong i was about Mike Miller. Forgot that, ya know, he's old and slow. Apologies fam. I am dumb.  




 For real. Have JR come off with that second group instead of Delly.

 haha i'm 19. and i dont give a shit. that movie was the bomb 




 Bruh, when he tossed Zoey in front of that train hahahaha I was like OH SHIT HE'S MURDEROUS PSYCOPATH HAHAHA 




 The obvious choice 




 Still my favorite movie all time.  




 Yeah, that's how I felt about 3 before I saw it. I'm not gonna go into it with any preconceived notions. It'll probably be the shit.  




 giggity 




 The hell is a mother lawyer? the mother of all lawyers? you need a better edumacation 




 watch the tape boss 




 lol. didnt know he was gonna be guarding pau fuckin gasol. that's coaching, not him. he has to be in with that TT, Mozgod, Lebron, Kyrie group to spread the floor 




 Nope, Shump on Butler. He is a better wing defender right now 




 Contesting shots isn't about your vertical. And you don't contest a shooter like him. You run him off the 3. Hence, the tiredness I spoke about. Not that hard to comprehend 




 You gotta watch off ball more. They literally have him running off baseline screens and down screens for the entire first quarter.  




 I would watch the shit outta that movie 




 of course he can handle him. but he's gonna be worn out from handling him, which is going to reduce his drives. resulting in more chunk up, late clock, flat jump shots.  




 hahahah take it. you don't question Iron man's past 




 You put TT in the starting slot and you have Lebron chasing Dunleavy off of screens for the first 8 minutes of the game, which is when he needs to set the tone offensively by getting to the rim with fresh legs. So unless he and Shump are gonna switch, I don't know if TT starting is the answer 




 We had one good quarter and three shitty ones and only lost by 7 after taking their best shot. We're fine.  




 ^^^ THIS 




 Lebron is notorious for playing game 1 as a feel out game. Meaning, he takes their best shot, analyzes it, and makes adjustments to counter it. DONT FREAK OUT EVERYBODY. WE CAN DO THIS. Past few times he's played the Bulls in a series he lost game one and handed em a gentleman's sweep by beating them in 5. So dont worry, we can do this. We're fine.  




 JUST A REMINDER
http://imgur.com/BLNqeFL
 




 6 TO's. Missed 13 shots. That's a bad game for Lebron standards. He has to step up. He has to average 25 10 and 10 for this team to win 




 Ehhem... http://imgur.com/BLNqeFL 




 WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK LEBRON 




 This is the lineup we gotta keep. Playin well on this stretch 




 Good things happen when Lebron drives to the rim. Always 




 LEBRON IS BEING A BITCH. GO TO THE RIM HOLY SHIT 




 indeed 




 He has to make that one though 




 I like bully-on-the-block Lebron 




 MIKE MILLER BABY HELL YEAH 




 THAT WAS SO NASTY MY GAWD 




 http://imgur.com/VK7vyHQ 




 UNCLE DREW IS THE MAN MY LAWD 




 Offseason to do list:
-Get knock-down 3 point shooters
-get a solid backup 4/5 who can play similar to Kev
 




 THESE REFS. GOOD GOD. PLANNING THEIR MURDER AS WE SPEAK 




 That was the worst opening quarter possible. Can only go up from here 




 lol, this guy tryna tell you to ease into it. smoke it all, you deserve it 




 Yo, bruh... fuck Noah 




 Thanks fam 




 I'm telling you Cavs fam, Mike is a playoff performer. Get ready 




 *Faptually correct 




 it's pretty freakin cold, but not unpleasant. did it like 20 times in high school for basketball. helped me (torn acl) recover and heal faster so i could actually play. getting out of it is awesome bc your whole body feels a rush of warmth 




 farenheit. and it's only for about 2-3 minutes. no damage is done. helps recovery and boosts energy. have one of these places where im from and used it all the time before/after games in high school 
























 David Lee. Hate everything about him.  




 100%. watched this movie at least once a week when I was younger. would definitely pay for the theater experience 




 DAMN JR. SO DISRESPECTFUL 




 yeah that's the only reason he's in haha. he wanted that one 




 bets on lebron missing second on purpose to get the board?!?!
Nevermind lol 




 Lebron in just for the triple double lol 




 Lebron boutta go from being guarded by Jimmy Butler to being guarded by Demare Carrol. hahaha he gonna be just fine fg% wise 




 Even games where it looks like hes playing terrible, finds a way to get that close to a trip dub. crazy 




 MY PENIS CAN ONLY GET SO ERECT. IM SAVING MY DAUGHTER FOR YOU DELLY 




 holy shit. like, why? 2 seconds left. go at the rim 




 they've been sayin it since 2010 and it was never a reality. blinded by names. now theyre all old and bad and they gotta break up the band 




 dont go too crazy 




 Hot damn, we have a winner 




 DELLY OH MY GOD MARRY MY FUTURE DAUGHTER 




 Who's the Holy Spirit of our team? MozGOD, Outback Jesus... but who is the third of the Trinity? 




 eeehhhhhh debatable 




 "horrible agent but a beautiful man" doesnt at least make you chuckle? haha 




 Confirmed.  




 hahahah it's funnier because of your name 




 as long as she doesnt talk 




 lol 




 you're right. i'm sorry. bad idea. but if it happens tho? be pretty awesome. definitely prefer 12 feet and in 




 I just want Lebron to come out and stroke a few 3's back to back to back and step on their throats. kill any confidence they might still have and gain a rhythm in his jumper. perfect scenario 




 Lebrons gotta fund his jumper at some point between now and the next series. I dont know how many more games we can squeeze out with him shooting this bad 




 dont play Kyrie again, Blatt!!!!!! he needs rest for next series!!!! 




 Lebron needs to learn the art of the 10 foot pull up. Attack that baseline drive but instead of getting clogged up under the rim, pull up real quick outside the paint for that touch shot 




 IMAN SHUMPERT MUTHA FUCKAS. YOU DONT CLOSELINE THE BEST FLAT TOP IN THE GAME AND EXPECT NOT TO GET GOT. BLAP BLAP 




 Is Kyrie my new favorite player? Because this is how you become my new favorite player.  




 WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON 




 Yeah. we played bad. Lebron took bad shots and got in semi foul trouble along with mozgod. TT, JJ, and Kyrie locked it down tho. POSITIVE VIBES EVERYBODY, MAINTAIN POSITIVE VIBES 




 PUMP FAKE AND DRIVE. LITERALLY THE MOST EFFECTIVE MOVE IN BASKETBALL.  




 Okay, so this is my least favorite version of Lebron. He'll turn it around and win this game, but I just hate when he opts for transitions 3's and deep 2's so early in the game.  




 I think the immature thing to do is to care what people on the internet think and do in response to what you think and do.  




 exactly 




 she's adorably attractive.  




 Gorgeous, chrome plated horse whip 




 I think Delly is the most liked player on this team by his teammates. Lebron was talkin him up about how he's the toughest player on the team and a lotta "my boy" and stuff from other guys. These guys are really coming together and forming that championship bond you want to see. Really cool 




 Now that, is a helluva car 




 Exactly. Bron took Eric Snow, Larry Hughes, Donyell Marshall, and freakin Joe Smith to the NBA Finals when he was, what, 21? 22 maybe? That's incredible.  




 Put him on the block and let him go to work. been killin all game when we do that 




 DELLY AND TT's CHEMISTRY IS UNBELIEVABLE. LOVE THOSE GUYS 




 LEBRON GOES HARD IN THE MUTHA FUCKIN PAINT BITCG 




 okay. time to go to the rim 




 But Lebron drives in past Butler and Noah hacks the shit out of him and no call. Dont understand 




 When Bron is "banged up" he always finds a way to have one of those games. Love it 




 Lebron :D 




 Yes agreed. That scene was too much 




 Such a Lebron thing to do 




 "You, you take picture with Mozgod. Will be good for you, come." I love the great and powerful Moz 




 Yeah exactly. Hope he comes back strong next season 




 U-kendrick lamar 




 The thing is, he knows it isn't a rule that you can't use the review time as a timeout of sorts. Everybody uses it, so you have to assume it can be beneficial for both sides. Also, he was the one begging for a review because he thought more time should have been taken off, not put on. So, it is  his fault that we had time for Lebron to command the ball. No reason to be salty at anyone but himself 




 Is Chris Bosh one of the most likable players in the league? Seems like everyone genuinely wishes the best for him and wants him to succeed. It's actually really awesome to see 




 My entire life, the Cowboys have sucked 




 tasty smores? 




 bet I can guess your age 




 So mad it's not on Netflix anymore. Never got around to watching it but so wanted to 




 the fact that no character is likable is kinda why i like it so much. in a very twisted way 




 Also my favorite Nolan film. I thought it was awesome and thought provoking 




 Excellent movie. Casting was perfect 




 Love Zombieland. Really surprised me 




 Those movies are fantastic and hilarious. The Rodrick character was perfectly cast 




 Interstellar when Coop is watching the recording from Murph. My emotions were so confused. How do I react to my daughter being the same age as I am? Such an unusual concept but I was crying way more than I should. After realizing he missed 23 years of her life in such a short span of time, makes you understand how fleeting life is. McConaughey did that scene extremely well too 




 Fuck Disney for making me deal with a love story followed by a depressing death in the span of 4 minutes. Just plain rude 




 Crap. Forgot about that scene. Feels 




 The father-son scenes with Costner are the best parts of the movie. He did excellent 




 Oh god I balled like an infant. Done so damn well 




 Yes, this, 100%.  




 So, just to clarify, you're saying if it was a completely different story and absolutely nothing about the film was the same that any character could feasibly be the main focus? Can you confirm? 




 I think you're forgetting just how tiny he is. And a big man with bad feet don't last long anyway. (ie. Yao Ming) 




 I think Brent Barry is far and away the best analyst/color commentator doing playoff games right now. Least biased, most insightful, knows when to shut up, and just generally a good listen during a game. Also, Ian Eagle is a great play-by-play guy. Watching this Wiz/Hawks game and I love the commentating  




 Well, that's a shame.  




 But they go in for their college accomplishments. Not the culmination of their collegiate and professional careers. If a player is going to be inducted based on their professional career, they have to actually earn it.  




 all im saying is, he's 27 years old and the past two seasons have been his come up. he hasnt done anything except break some 3 pt shooting records. that doesnt equate to HOF status 




 Yeah that's true. I guess I just dont see him getting enough space to get 3's off. Hand check rules were very different and him being virtually 7 feet tall, keepin that handle would be difficult 




 Pippen and Rodman come to mind. But if he drives into the paint against the Pistons and gets beat up like MJ and Scottie did, he's done 




 very different circumstances 




 I think you cut his minutes in half in game 5. Delly has been playing like a champ 




 Oh so Derrick Rose is a hall of famer? god that term is thrown out so much, it means nothing. you have to actually earn a spot in the hall of fame over the course of your career. one season doesnt make you a hall of famer 




 But injury prone. He could impose his will physically and hang with those guys for sure, but he just wouldnt have a very long career 




 You think glass tiger KD is gonna take some hits from the bad boys? lol nah 




 Yo that's an instrumental track from the Interstellar soundtrack. That's cool. Much inspire 




 And it makes no sense that they dont like him. He is the polar opposite of a Gregg Popavich who is a douche bag to everyone who asks him a question. Blatt is thoughtful and answers every question with charisma. I dont get it 




 Wasn't he trying to open a tab? not order one? 




 About to have my second ACL surgery. Believe me, Derrick Rose's determination and dedication is of the upmost inspiration and I wish him all the best. And I'm a die hard Lebron fan.  




 no dude, im askin the guy who posted the comment what he's saying. read what he said. grammatically it makes no sense 




 Wh... what? 




 Bruh. game 6, 2012, Boston. Most pressure he's ever had on a game in his life. 45 pts, 15 boards, 5 assists. I like that Lebron 




 HAHAHAHHAHAH HELL YEAH CAVS FANS 




 yeah, the iso hesitation jab step pull ups are rhythm killers individually and as an offense. take a rhythm jumper or make a quick decision. dont hesitate whatever you do  




 CATCH. THE FUCKING. BALL. OH MY GOD 




 Is Tristan my new favorite player? I think he's my new favorite player. Anyone confirm? 




 totally agree. just like to see more effort close out wise 




 tristans floater game on fleek tho 




 Too many open 3's from the Bulls... Good run to tie it up but we cant allow a 3 point shooter to shoot with no one within 10 feet of him 




 haha youre shitting me right? just turn the game on before that post turnover? get outta here 




 can somebody fuckin be strong with the damn ball. this is bullshit 




 God I love Bob's 




 Like as extra scenes or a bonus feature or something? I was curious why he was such a small part of the film 




 Bruh, Lebron shot 8 for 25. 7 TO's. that's not a season average. Kyrie cant jump or sprint with one foot. that's not something that happened in the regular season. dont try to act like theyre playing normal. if Lebron and Kyrie play like the duo theyve been all year, this isnt a game. 
And I'm perfectly content being down 1-2 because we have the best player on that planet on our squad. Also, cleveland doesnt have a home court advantage. their home crowd was basically terrible so those first two were neutral site games as far as im
concerned. 
In the end, being down 1 to 2 without a 17 and 10 guy, without a play making shooter for the first two, and with a plethora of injuries isn't the worst it can be. I have faith in King James.   




 are you? sounds like a pretty biased take on officiating from your end too, boss. they called a foul to make up for the missed goaltend, by the way. watch it back, literally nobody touched him. but, all that aside, yall won the game. congrats. yall got 50 from your top two, we got 38. we got out rebounded badly. had basically zero fast break points. got out scored by 15 on 2nd chance points. and we still only lost on a hail mary. im content with that. the question is, are you? just hope it doesnt scare you that Lebron and Kyrie have played like complete shit for 3 games and it's still a close series. we'll see what happens when they get it going 




 we were in the game all bc of lebron too.  
























 if he was trying to be efficient, they wouldnt be here 




 lol no. they have no advantages anywhere.  




 bruh is there a reason for the insanely long series of numbers as your username? 




 Nah nigga gtf outta there! Thor boutta whoop up on Loki or some shit! 




 NOOOOOO. DONT RISK IT. GONNA NEED HIM AS HEALTHY AS POSSIBLE.  DELLY IS DEFENDING HIS ASS OFF AND I LOVE IT. DONT PLAY KY 




 you just proved my point. so, thanks man 




 Yeah! Crazy! 




 that's incorrect. the doctor he visited that morning specifically said it was food poisoning. do some homework 




 as long as theres no weird singing alien creatures 




 Original Star Wars trilogy. Because why not 




 Also in True Detective, the scene where it's like 8 minutes straight of one continuous shot as Rust is leaving that drug house while avoiding all the cops. Heart was beating so fast. Chills for sure 




 Surprised no one said the time between Episode III and IV, following Obi Wan on Tattoine.  




 Jack Nicholson's "either way, i dont give a damn what you think youre entitled to" whole quote from A Few Good Men.  




 The Dark Knight Rises. Yeah, I went there.  




 Every damn scene in I Am Sam with Sean Penn. Balled that entire movie. Fuck that movie, but ill be damned if it isn't fantastic.  




 Batman died at the end of TDKR and you will never convince me otherwise.  




 Hulk from 2003! I thought it was awesome! Came out when I was 8, so the nostalgia factor is probably there, but the comic book filming style was awesome!  




 The very first Interstellar trailer was perfect. Didn't disclose anything about the film but I knew right then and there that I would be seeing it opening night. Need more like that 




 I, Robot. 
We're all fucking dead.  




 They all collectively recognized that giving it to him was saying goodbye to him. They all loved him and didn't want to give up on him, so they hesitated.  




 Way late but Matthew McConaughey. Interstellar and True Detective were incredible. Loved Mud too 




 Grit makes them feel real, like they could actually exist in our world. That's what I want in superhero movies. I want them to transcend their unrealistic nature and feel truly real. Grit and darkness and mistakes (Superman killing Zod, Batman getting tricked by Joker and saving Dent instead of Rachel) and learning from them are what make superhero movies of this generation so awesome.  




 small known fact? nah 




 Experiencing that Interstellar scene in IMAX was insane.   




 Saw White Noise when I was like 9. So, yeah. Fucked me up pretty good 




 Also, Indiana Jones Trilogy. A Few Good Men as well 




 I don't know if most could tell it was CGI, but Cast Away came out when I was young so everything looked real to me. However, when he is up on the mountain looking out over the ocean, he was actually on a set piece on the top of a building looking over a parking lot. Pretty impressive and I had no idea until years later 




 When Nature Calls, not Adventure Calls  




 and I loved it. thought it was freakin hilarious  




 It sucks because I thought it was very entertaining up until that bullshit. Like, the fuck? A thumb drive? Just pop out as a floppy disk and send everybody for a real loop 




 BATMAN IS ALWAYS PREPARED. DONT DOUBT HIM OP 




 A Few Good Men. Not a remake, but a military/political law room drama with top actors.  




 original and remake and are two different things, bud 




 Why was that track a shorter version than what he put out already? Like the beat change in the original

Edit: After listening to Excuse Me, I know understand. Comment retracted.  




 I see exactly what you're saying, but I don't think the term "Greatest" is what we should use to describe the guy who transcended the game culturally. I think the Greatest Player should only account for on court play. I think MJ undeniably has had the biggest impact on the game because of all the things you said, but the greatest player should only deal with what happens on the court. Completely agree Jordans impact was bigger though 




 The rings argument is so flawed in a team game. It takes an entire organization to win a championship, not one player. That is what I think Lebrons greatest ability is, to completely flip a franchise around. No other player in history, simply by their individual presence, could turn a team into a Finals threat. If you put Lebron on the Knicks or Magic, they're a threat immediately. No one else can do that 




 Also, I'm tired of uninformed sports fans continuing to say MJ had the Flu. He did not. He had food poisoning. Which is just as awful to deal with during a basketball game, but nonetheless, let's be historically accurate and call it what it actually is  




 "cant close" clutch 3 in the corner
"cant close" drives by your whole team for the finish
"pussy" puts you on a poster for the rest of your life. 
 




 But for real it was probably just a cold towel 




 I got you bruh
http://i.imgur.com/qh56qoH.jpg 




 After reading all these comments, I've come to the conclusion that no one will ever fully respect Lebron for the incredible things he's done in this league. The man can never do anything right. Get over your irrational hate for the guy. Dude needed a breather, hit the deck and got it. If you've never done that after a hard fought game then you've never busted your ass to complete exhaustion before. Get outta here 




 I LOVE MYSELF
*Kendrick voice* 




 Gotta start Moz here since TT has 5 fouls. Put TT back in with 2-2:30 left. Cant risk losing him for crunch time defense 




 these refs man..... my lawd 




 why switch TT onto teague right there?! put delly on him and dont switcv 




 im perplexed by the score of this game. no way it should be this close 




 Line em up in a row. Fire through the temple. Extra bullet just in case 




 Yeah, Horford literally had his arm locked and pulled him down into himself.  




 Whole first half was a giant klusterfuck. Just hoping for a cleaner second half 




 Anybody know why we hardly ever wear the home whites? Always Yellow or Navy, home or away. I like the whites 




 I just wanted to hear so ScHoolboy Q "UUGGHHH" ad libs throughout that haha. They need to link up for a track 




 Pre-game prep song all year last year. Got me so hyped 




 Kitties staring at titties? say no more
 




 DONT YOU DARE PLACE A CURSE ON THIS TEAM. LEAVE THE PREMISES, YOU BASTARD  




 Guys, I dont wanna jump the gun too much or anything, but Kyrie has until June 2nd to rest and heal.....:D :D :D 




 bc tt went full retard 




 Lebrons vision is absolutely insane 




 I retract my previous comment. 
She 100% would kill you 




 except she's annoying and could kill you 




 this one will always win 




 This is from 2011. So, catch up bud 




 Cross-generational comparisons are worthless. But Lebron has Jordan in a specific stat line. So he was better at doing that one thing that Jordan was. That's all I'm saying.  




 I say you give the bottom 5 records the same percentage chance to win that too pick. Say, 11%. Then give the other 9 less, split into 3's. For example, 6 through 8 would have an 8% chance, 9 to 11 has 5%, and 12-14 have 2%. You can change that into whatever increments you want but that's just the first i thought of that equalled 100. Anyway, you have more even chances across the board, it doesn't eliminate tanking all together, but it doesn't incentivize being the worse team in the league either. I also think you draw for every drafting position, not just top 3. I dont know how logical this is, but I think it helps reduce the need to tank for some teams.  




 Cant argue with a guy who refuses to recognize when a great player achieves something great. MJ homers will always be MJ homers. No convincing them otherwise.  




 that's a testament to how great Lebron is. not to be used as s crutch for Jordan or an asterisk on Lebrons advantages statistically.   




 He started out of high school but that doesnt effect years and seasons played..? I'm just not seeing the point you're trying to make here.  




 just standing there, holding her tongue tryna talk this thitthhhss? 




 I KNOW LEBRON IS DOING DUMB THINGS RIGHT NOW, BUT THAT WAS A FOUL. THESE REFS JUST HATE HIM 




 HE CANT. FUCKING. CATCH. GET SOME FUCKIN HANDS. I LOVE HIM, BUT SHIT 




 the bench 




 ceremonial FUCK TEAGUE is in order 




 Kyrie git hammered in the lane on two consecutive drives. no call. TT got mauled getting offensive boards on multiple occasions. no call. my statement is justified.  




 V 




 We're gettin screwed by the refs and it's blatant and it's tied. JR SWISH IS THE MUHFUCKIN MAN HE DONT NEED NO HELP *Drake voice 




 Dont count on that 




 I cant believe these refs.  




 Gotta stop going under the screen on him. too many open looks 




 NO THATS NOT A FOUL. THATS A DAMN SEAL 




 Kyrie needs to settle down. Trying to do a little too much 




 My thoughts exactly. I could totally see a remix later on with him on the track 




 A Roman Empire era Jedi 




 "Back once again, chillin in the back of the lac with a pass or the gin..." gets me so hyped every damn time 




 Honestly just want the Lakers to lose their pick. That's all I care about tonight 




 Same for me with The Prestige! Loved it when I saw it but went in knowing absolutely nothing about it.  




 Sanctum. Great movie 




 That Logic track was on point too 




 everybody put ur hands up high 




 agreed 




 Really wanted a Drake verse tho 




 IBeenStackinUpLikeImFundRaisin 




 What about adding teams in Seattle and Pittsburg? Send the Pitt team East and Seattle West? Obviously makes sense for Seattle but I think it makes a lot of sense for Pittsburg too. Historic sports town, only sport absent being basketball outside of the collegiate level. I don't know. Just a thought 




 Can't look at season number because half the year we didn't even have our team assembled. You have to look at how these teams have played recently.  




 the Kyrie, Shump, Lebron, TT, Moz lineup has the best defensive rating in the playoffs so far. And the cavs as a whole have the best offense in the playoffs so far. i feel like that's all i need to say 




 the bulls would beat the Hawks in this series right now. so two games to them, one to the Hawks, makes sense.  




 There isn't a single defender on the Wizards that is as good as Lebron, JR, and Shump. Hell, even Delly can defend full-court just to put pressure on the ball. So I don't see back door cuts and off ball screens being an issue simply because we have better overall defenders on our squad. Kyrie will have issues though and I fully acknowledge that. I guess I'm just assuming Delly gets more minutes than usual this series? I don't know. That's a big question mark. But as far as TT, Moz, and JJ go on defending Horford and Paul, I just don't see many issues coming up that can't be effectively game-planned for. TT can guard either of them on the post or outside. JJ can take Paul if he is playing more outside with another big in the middle and Moz can definitely hold his own against Horford. Call me optimistic, but I just don't see anything that the Hawks do and think that we don't have a counter for it.  




 Wasn't trivializing. That's just how you talk about basketball. You state what the opposing team does offensively, you tell why you think your team can either, guard against it well and why or, why they cannot. So get outta here with your douchebag approach to responding to my opinion of how the series will go. You can respond with your opinion without being an ass. But bruh, pin downs are easy to guard. Off ball screens are easy to guard when you have smart and quick athletes like JR and Shump on the wings. And, like I said, TT and Moz can handle the post actions because they are both great defenders. And I dont give a shit how much film Carrol watches the next few days, he isn't going to magically get bigger and stronger and quicker and D up Lebron effectively. And if you think the Hawks can beat a Lebron James led basketball team 3 out of 6 times to force a game 7, you're delusional.  




 He can't handle Lebron in the post. Not worried 




 Thank you, Captain Obvious 




 all black is a nice choice boss. best shoes out right now imo 




 hahaha stop. 









just, stop.  




 I disagree with the "offense that won't let up" idea simply because their offense is so unbelievably easy to guard. It's a ton of off-ball screens and pin-downs, back door cuts, and high-low action with the posts. TT and Moz can handle all of the post actions and they've proven that. JR and Shump are more than capable at staying with Korver and Schroeder/Carrol/ whatever other wings they play. Kyrie and Delly can more than handle Teague and Schroeder PG wise and Lebron can guard whoever the hell he wants and lock em down. Defensively, I'm not worried. I just don't want Lebron to keep hoisting jumpers up all series if they aren't falling. However, there isn't a Jimmy Butler caliber defender on that team so I don't know how many jumpers he is going to want to take anyway. Cavs in 5 is my prediction. Remember, the Hawks almost lost to the Nets in a playoff series. hahahhahaha 




 Felt like every game was an anomaly. Lebron was out or the hawks shot lights out or we shot lights out... dont really know what to expect. but i expect a win 
























 Incredible? slow down buddy 




 he also had a wide open dunk if Steph had made a fundamentally sound pass where it needed to be. you know he hasn't been hitting jumpers so as a PG, lead him to an easier shot.  




 They had to switch every screen because Delly was so gassed. Couldn't stick to him like he did the rest of the game 




 6 TO's doesn't equal efficient.  









 Anyone care to speculate what Lebron's "secret motivation" is that he won't tell anyone? I originally thought it was the MVP race and finishing 3rd this year, but he conceded to that last night but said that wasn't the secret motivation.  









 If we hold Steph and Klay under 50 combined points, we win the game. 
Bold prediction: Lebron finds his touch, shoots over 50%. JR and Shump combine for 40, Mike Miller scores 9 points, Lebrons final stat line is 42 points, 16 rebounds, 13 assists. 
 




 only difference is, I'm never gettin mad when somebody checks out my dick cleavage.  




 ahhh, I see we've found the founder of Edible Arrangements 




 yes, I want him to be treated the same way everyone treats Lebron so everyone can realize how insane it is.  




 be held accountable by people outside of the team. aka us, the media, etc. MVP's don't get a pass. ever.  




 yes, I realize. I'm not stupid. But, when you can't hit a shot, maybe stop shooting for a while and get the ball in the hands of the guy who was shooting lights out in the first half? Instead of chunking up 15 3s, find the hot hand instead. that's all I'm saying 




 But not to this extent. No one has ever experienced the criticism and just general hatred from fans and analysts everywhere like Lebron has. It's insane 




 ...he says now that Lebron isn't the one getting ripped to shreds. When it's Lebron, no one bats an eye. Curry? Everyone loses their minds 




 well, you can't. MVP's are held to all-time standards. fall short, accept the consequences.  




 No, actually you don't. As a point guard you can, ya know, pass. Create for others. Run an offense. I don't know. But if you're gonna throw up 15 3s and miss 13, you have to be held accountable. If you're going to air ball a go ahead jumper, you have to be ridiculed. That's how MVPs are supposed to be treated. If Lebron James can score 44 and miss a game winner by inches and get roasted for it, Curry most definitely can when he air balls it on top of a god awful night. This isn't even a conversation.  




 if the refs are gonna magically start calling post man travels then they're gonna need to call Steph for carrying the ball every time he dribbles when he brings the ball up from behind half court. literally puts his hand completely under the ball every time. but no call, bc fuck that call. just like that travel.  




 me too. heard he is actually really good in it 




 "LOTTA ENEMIES, GOT A LOT OF ENEMIES. GOTTA LOTTA PEOPLE TRYNA DRAIN ME OF MY ENERGY. TRYNA TAKE THE WAAAAVE FROM A NIGGA, FUCKIN WITH THE KID AND PRAY FOR YA NIGGA"
-Official Lebron James Playoffs Anthem.  




 Jay-Z like "nigga what the fuck? is you Jesus? shit" 




 I got that fuckin iron man shit keepin me alive right now 




 probably right. mikes barely played all year. but those 4 fouls on JJ weren't worth the risk 




 if Mike woulda splashed that... consider my shit officially lost.  




 you don't have to establish hustle. you have to establish shooters.  




 hahahah no it's not!! not when you're wide open with a layup! he has to convert that.  




 WHY THE HELL IS TT STILL IN?! HE'S DOING NOTHING 




 TT MY GOD.  




 What the fuck 




 TT and Moz gotta learn how to catch somewhere in her too 




 no they're getting in the lane and instead of taking the easy shot, they're trying to make one too many passes and it's always a turnover. so stupid. just shoot the shot 




 TT playing like absolute shit 




 I would love it if we would stop airballing floaters. And put backs by our bigs. that would be friggin fantastic.  




 OH MY GOD SHUMP. MAKE A DAMN LAYUP HOLY SHIT 




 I did it with listerine mouthwash. it was delicious. but probably awful for my body. 


worth it 




 that commercial had me dying 




 my body is ready 




 YEAH WHERE?! HELP PLS 




 Add "U" in there and you're good. Too real of a song not to make the list 




 Yes. just imagine how much better Lebron would be playing just by having KLove's presence on the floor. He wouldn't take 35+ shots and he wouldn't be missing more than half of them just bc there would be great spacing even if it is ISO heavy.  




 Gotta take a page out of the Warriors book and player manage better. From Lebron to Kyrie and Love to Varejao. We're playing for the playoffs, not the regular season. Gotta have them healthy for the playoff runs.   




 Totally agree 




 But just imagine what this team could be with an entire year together and hopefully with health on our side. This team has been remade and remolded every 2 weeks the past 50 games. Think this team could be dominant with health and a year together 




 http://i.imgur.com/qh56qoH.jpg 




 Parks and Rec! 




 I didn't mean he didn't have any plays at all. I just meant that his motion Princeton offense that they threw out in December doesn't work with a ball dominant guy. so the sets he does draw up are to get Lebron a mismatch on the post or a shooter coming up off of down screens. nothing that involves all 5 guys in positions to score like the Warriors have. that's all I meant. Lebron definitely needs to chill on the ISOs tho 




 No, you're clearly not understanding what I am trying to say. I'm saying the Cavs bench played as piss poor as they can and the Warriors got 35 from theirs. What I mean is, if the Cavs would have had a mere 10 points from their bench, they win the game assuming no Warriors score. Just showing how terrible the Cavs bench played and that it was still a winnable game regardless. asshole 




 Yeah for real. TT had 2 points. He doesn't usually do that. He missed some bunnies that he usually makes. JR won't shoot that poorly again, Shump won't either. JJ will knock a couple down. even Delly could hit something. I'm extremely disappointed about the Kyrie situation just for Kyrie's sake bc the dude plays so damn hard, but I still think this is a very winnable series. Lebron just has to go back to that "get everybody else going first" role he's played in the past and we got these guys. Keep the faith everyone 




 Yes, 100%.  




 Blatts offensive system doesn't work with a ball dominant guy. so when you don't have an offense, you run pick and rolls or post ups with your best player. they have literally no sets that involve 5 players at once. I don't understand why you're blaming Lebron for that though. coaches draw up and teach plays, players run them.  




 He took that because he's made it from the same spot with the same move in the same building while being guarded by the same guy before. It was a comfortable shot for him. I don't like it as much as the next guy but I understand why he did it 




 If the Cavs scored 10 bench points instead of 9 in regulation, we win. Don't get so blinded by the Warriors bench. ours played like shit, but if they just play bad we win that game.  




 I didn't like the shot from Lebron either, but I think I understood what he was thinking. He's made 2 game winners from that exact spot in the same building before. I think he was just going for what has worked in the past. and he took it early so TT or Shump, like what happened, could get a tip shot or something. I would prefer him to drive obviously but I wasn't mad at the look because he has made it before with iggy on him too.  




 Yeah but if the Cavs bench scores 10 points instead of 9 in regulation, they win the game. Could have been out scored by 20+ on the bench and still won. If you get 12 from JR and maybe 6-9 from James Jones next game, who knows what happens 




 Seems like the only option at this point.  




 Do your own research Mike! Aren't you calling the game tonight?! You had like 8 days to find this stuff out! 




 perfect song choice 




 Teams don't usually have Lebron James either.  




 LUHBRAHHHN JAAAMES was obviously the best part 




 I think the Cavs will have Shump on him to start. And he can more than handle his own. Then Delly will take some minutes and he can be a pest and stick to him pretty well. So I disagree with the notion that Steph will "roast" the Cavs.  




 That's just incorrect. Go watch that Bulls series again.  




 No answer for their shooters? So Shumpert, a top 10 wing defender in this league, and JR Smith who is an incredibly underrated defender as well dont count? matthew "shut down derrick rose" dellavedova? Lebron fucking James? bruuuhhhhhhh 




 the JR comment is just wrong. he's been consistently hot basically since he put on a cavs uni. and the warriors walked into the finals just like the Cavs did. Just because they played teams with better records, doesnt mean they played better teams. The Pels wouldve sold their souls to just win a game in that series, the Grizz never had a real shot bc they couldnt guard steph and he was just off in the games they lost. also, bigs-focused teams are a good matchup for them. and the rockets had a 37 year old spot up shooting guard playing the point and guarding steph curry. and josh smith, JOSH SMITH, started. 

Also, Cavs defensively are better without Love in the lineup. So him being out favors the Cavs defensively. This will be a much better series than 90% of people think. 
Cavs in 7.  




 bruh. this is nothing. go watch some 80s tape 




 asshole. lets have some maturity 




 Cleveland is that... Cleveland is the... 




 But they weren't though. They were a 60 win team. The Cavs just destroyed them because they're hitting their stride at the right time 




 so were the cavs bruh. Varejao, Love, Irving. Lebron with 2 sprained ankles, Shump with a groin injury....  




 I don't buy it. Now, him to the Knicks to play with his buddy Melo in New York City with a brand new 4th overall pick in a weak eastern conference... I see that as more likely. However, I think him going home to Chicago is the most likely. Bulls let Butler walk on a max contract with LA or whoever pays up for him, get Wade on a discount for a run against the Cavs next season with a new coach... I dont know. just dont see him as a Clipper at all 




 I agree with everything you said. Good job 




 i just meant cuz you said "then your leg cramps up and HE'S like...". just pointing out the pronoun usage haha. nothing meant by it 




 Oh okay. Thanks for clarifying! I just hadn't heard that before so I was curious 




 Lowry is a much better shooter. Dame is twice the scorer Wall is and can pass just as well. TP is a proven playoff performer. Wall is an immature speed player who is an exceptional passer and extremely streaky shooter. so yeah, i'm taking the first 3.   




 Hell yeah to MSG. saw the heat play there last season and that place was incredible.  




 really good bathrooms in general. the mirrors that have tv's playing the games in them. but they arent actually tv's... really hard to explain unless youve been there 




 fuck that stupid ass bull shit. still makes me mad to think about.  




 I only know Dentlef from Parks and Rec. I need to brush up on my basketball knowledge.  




 too far 




 Curry, Kyrie, Paul, Westbrook, Lowry, Tony Parker, Dame, i would take over Wall.  




 damn brodie. spot on 




 you hear that verse on "M's" yet tho? sheeeeesh 




 i fucks with earl heavy. 

so harden cant be him because fuck harden 




 exactly why he is a perfect kobe comparison 




 hahahah youre so dumb. people who dive hands first and get arm locked arent going for the ball the right way! youre supposed to secure the ball and shield it from the opponent. delly dove on it and rolled to shield the ball from the opponent so there wouldnt be a jump ball. he made the perfect play and if korver hadnt gotten hurt, literally no one would be saying anything about it. this viewpoint is idiotic at best 




 hahahah no. so so wrong. if you grab the jersey and nobody sees, good job. if you get caught, it's a foul. not a dirty play. that's the dumbest thing ive ever heard 




 haha stupid. Delly was attempting, in basketball terms, a box out. just like every other play in basketball history. gibson just didnt take the contact well, gave him an extra shove down. got his leg tangled and freaked out. get outta here with your bull shit  




 Was it necessary? No. But dirty? My God that's a stretch. Dirty plays are things done with malicious intent. I think he was just trying to get under his skin. and it worked.  




 All Cavs fans seeing that Playoffs graph http://imgur.com/PNGoOMo 




 Anthony Davis is not currently better than Lebron. That is ridiculous. More athletic and in the prime of his body? No question. But a better player than Lebron James? That's insanity.  




 You're tellin me you wouldn't try to capitalize on 300K? Really? Even if it was chump change for whatever economical bracket of pay you're in, you're not going to turn down and even seek out extra coin.  




 cant tell if female... or homosexual male... 




 hahahahahah oh wow, tears man. literal tears 




 What do you mean by "age as gracefully as Curry and Durant"? Totally agree with the old man game portion tho. Those guys who are smarter, have better footwork, and have an unblockable jumper are the guys who can play for 20 years in the league and still be effective 




 Totally agree. He actually answers the questions given to him and answers them intelligently.  




 People act like no coach has ever done something unorthodox before. Spoelstra did the same thing a couple years ago. Literally took the team bowling and they went on a hot streak. Shane Battier started his "Battioke" Karaoke night and it was always in like March so they got a night off and got a break and came back with a hot streak. This stuff happens all the time. You just dont see it reported about because Lebron isnt on every team and every coach isnt coaching Lebron, putting his every action into the spotlight. These kinds of moves and very strategically done and typically end with a positive result.    




 I honestly don't like Kyrie on the floor at all guarding their starting group. I guess him guarding Barnes is the best option, but Kerr is smart. He'll just post up Barnes and work Kyrie 5 possessions in a row until we do something about it. Hopefully Ky can hold his own for 8-10 minutes before the Delly sub can come in and rotate everybody back in place.  




 Hospital was supposed to blow when the Joker hit the trigger the first time when he was walking away from it in The Dark Knight. It legitimately malfunctioned and he stayed in character and improved the whole scene from then on out. It turned out way better than the original would have in my opinion too. Showed how great Heath did with that role. Also, there was a camera rigged in the bus (not sure if they thought of using that footage or not) but he stayed in character the entire ride. Thought that all was pretty awesome 




 Dumb college kid? You don't get that pass as a nationally recognized student athlete. He was 21 years old. If you have NBA aspirations then you can't act like that and he should have known better. Don't give him a pass just because he's on your team 




 hahahaha oh man this dude is an idiot 




 But wait! THERE'S MORE!
http://imgur.com/rZ2SBSZ 




 Bruh. Draymond too small. Lebron said it himself. And Iggy? Dude can't handle him in the post, which is where he'll be 60% of the time. Barnes will get out smarted on the post and if you guys are dumb enough to double, Kyrie, Iman, Delly, JJ, and JR are gonna give you the pipe and splash back side 3's. Get outta here with this nonsense.  




 I remember watchin this game. I got hyped as hell 
























 I agree they're the team to beat, I just think they'll get beat. And just adding Pat Bev doesn't make them non contenders, but having to face real PG's every round will wear them down. Pat and TP and CP3 were just examples of how tough of a road they just so happen to have avoided this year. Next year they could get hit with Bev, then CP3, then Westbrook in consecutive series. Just saying, it'll be a huge adjustment. And trying to repeat in a stacked conference is no easy task 




 KD is nowhere near 6'8. Lebron is 6'8. KD has at least 4 inches on him. and Yao does have 60 pounds on him, but he played below the rim. KD plays up and flies around. way more room for error when you jump 20+ inches in the air every time you take a jumper 




 Yeah! Always played hard when I saw him 




 Thank long PG for the Lakers whose name escapes me. Saw him a couple times and the dude can play 




 quick question. who would you rather get in free agency, Norris Cole or Mo Gotti? 




 OKC has Dion Waiters, so they automatically are going to have something catastrophic happen to them.  




 that's just a dick thing to say.  




 Warriors won't make it back. Didn't have to face a single legit point guard in their entire playoff run. A healthy Pat Beverly in their way, or Chris Paul, or Tony Parker who Curry has to guard would completely change their dynamic. I think the West is gonna be wide open again. 
Pierce is out of Washington, so they don't have a chance. Chicago just isn't good outside of Jimmy buckets and he can't win a series by himself. Atlanta is gonna be in the mix in the Easy but I just don't see them as a strong team when it comes down to it. I think the Bucks are coming, the Celtics are coming, a healthy Bosh puts the Heat in the playoffs but they aren't much. Cavs are a lock, in my book.  




 Because big men with foot issues have foot issues forever. KD is a legit 7 footer. So he fits in the Yao Ming vein. Similar to Joel Embiid's foot issue that could take him out of next year as well. Big men just don't get over problems quickly 




 Also Kyrie Irving and Mike Miller have underwear deals. Just so you know 




 this is so blown out of proportion by Stein. Every player disagrees with their coach from time to time and Lebron had the weight of the world on him and he knew what it takes to win a Finals series. I think Blatt knew that too and handled Lebrons intensity with class. No harm, no foul 




 Yeah, but he's played more minutes than anyone in history in a 5 years span, not including team USA. he has to rest better throughout the season, and I don't just mean cutting his minutes down to 39 which is still highest in the league. I mean cutting down to at most 35 and having games that he takes off periodically like the Warriors did.  




 Cavs gotta take a page out of the Warriors book and take their resting strategy. Kept their guys healthy and fresh when it mattered 




 Dudes get hurt on his teams every damn year. Bosh in '12, DWade essentially the last 3 years with his knee, Kyrie and KLove.... he always has help up until the big moments. so sad 




 King of the "no pressure end of game" 3s that don't mean anything 




 Lets talk about what needs to happen in the off season to get our minds off of this. I'm sad  




 Lebron in the post, score. fuckin shit man. do that the whole game and were in this 




 Man, Lebron didn't back up his bold statement at all. So disappointing.  




 BACK COURT GOOD GOD 




 LETS GO OH MY GOD WE CAN DO THIS 




 MY GOD DELLY WHY ARE YOU PLAYING 




 Can someone seriously help me understand why Lebron is 30 feet away from the basket every possession instead of posting up? It's worked all series!! why stop going to it?! 6 3 point attempts is too damn much with half the Warriors in foul trouble.  




 Shump can't dribble and can't make a layup. why is he in the game 




 DOES LEBRON NOT WANT THE BALL? 




 is Lebron refusing the post this game or what? 




 I mean, that's essentially what I gathered from every half time speech I've ever heard.  




 If we made free throws and calmed THE FUCK down and cut the turnovers down, we'd be up 8 to 10.  




 incorrect. Warriors shooting jumpers, Cavs driving the ball 




 clock didn't reset after Lebrons shot hit the rim. legal bucket, shot clock guy just didn't react quick enough 




 Lebron on the post. Lebron on the post. that's all you gotta do.  




 If you see that and say there's no contact, you too are blinded by his strength. There's contact on EVERY drive. some of them aren't fouls, but some of them are.  




 I agree, but some of them are.  




 How the fuck are these refs not calling anything on these Lebron drives? He gets punished for being too strong.  




 seriously. if they win it in general I'm gettin Lebrons logo tattooed on my body somewhere.  




 that's one game boss. that's hardly research  




 nothing you said is correct. it's not worth forming an argument against someone when they don't even bother to bring real stats to the table 




 that's not even true. you should get over your laziness and actually find something to backup your claims. you won't find it, but you should try. and "others" are dumb if they want dellavedova and Shumpert taking shots from beyond the 3 point line instead of a Lebron jump hook from 8 feet.  




 everyone who shares this idea knows nothing about basketball.  




 haha okay boss 




 so? still can't stop him even though he can't shoot 




 hahahah I still think it's funny that he's the "Lebron stopper" when Lebron is averaging 36, 13 and 9.  




 hahahhaha bent penis.  




 This shouldn't even be a conversation. Westbrook was doing it in the regular season, Lebrons doing it on the biggest stage in the profession. No comparison whatsoever.  




 every time a player drives they initiate contact. that's not the formula they use to decide of it was a foul or not. Draymond tried to go in and hammer it down on Moz and Lebron and both were called fouls even though he initiated the contact and both guys went straight up. it's lopsided and there's no way around it 




 That's my interpretation of it actually. I always thought we were seeing exactly what he said he wanted to see, so we don't know if it's actually there or not. but I just think it would have made for a better ending if you closed without seeing Bruce.  




 no, you literally don't know how to read obviously. he isn't getting on JVG. he is saying that because he shits on us so much, when he says WE aren't getting calls, you KNOW we must not be getting calls. it has nothing to do with JVG hate. learn how to read and interpret a sentence bud 




 no. watch it back, half of his drives he got hit on and it should have been a foul. clearly 




 you're retarded and clearly don't know how to read.  




 because he shoots 3s and does drive to the rim 30+ times a game idiot. and it should be called a foul because it's a foul.  




 WHERE. THE FUCK. ARE. THE CALLS. MY FUCKING. LORD.  




 OH MY GOD WHAT IS THE LEAGUES AGENDA WITH THESE GOD AWFUL SHITTY REFS?!?! ITS ATROCIOUS 




 Moz earned it, but he can't guard any wings.  




 correct 




 :'( 




 GOD DAMMIT SHUMP 




 I think Moz's minutes are going to mirror Bogut/Ezeli. he just can't guard wings and if he gets doubled in the post like they've been doing, he won't be able to make that pass that Lebron can make 




 Shumpert is fucking retarded 




 LEBRON NEEDS TO FIGURE OUT THAT WHEN HE DOMINATES THE BALL AND SCORES A LOT, WE WIN.  




 haha nah. just the ones that popped in my head 




 Just meant that I like our chances when guys are throwing up 3s instead of open dunks. Didn't mean they weren't scary 




 Hayden Christensen's acting in Star Wars II and III. 

Why did Nolan choose to show Bruce Wayne and Selena Kyle at the end of The Dark Knight Rises? would have made for a much better "Nolan-like" ending if he hadn't and left it up to the audience to decide what happened. 

 




 and that's why you have no championships, sir. Ego 




 I mean, allay had 34 the other night but he wasn't hot by any stretch in the second half. We bottled him up pretty well after his first half burst. In honestly not as worried about those guys because they're shooters. and it's a make or miss league. you live with those. it's the draymond cuts and back doors for dunks or iggy fastbreaks or Shaun Livingston post ups on smaller guards that can kill us, in my opinion.  




 I never said he didn't fit that bill. I never disputed Marion's ability to contribute in the same fashion Mike could either. I don't know where you got that from. All I'm doing is disputing the fact that Mike can't contribute as well as Marion. They can both help the team, but you said Mike was essentially a waste and Marion needs a shot, all in saying is Mike and Marion both deserve time because they can both contribute.  




 the lineup isn't changing. just can't put timo on iggy, gotta have him on Green. put TT on Barnes and Lebron on Iggy or vice versa. try to weather the storm until those mid quarter subs come in when we can go smaller 




 No, you at Mike Miler because he is a winner who does whatever is necessary to win. Hustle plays are necessary. Making shots is necessary too, but when you don't play a minute for months and then get thrown in a Finals game, you can expect some rust. If he gets minutes, he'll hit shots. Marion can't make shots 




 I've been a Lebron James die-hard follower since '06 because that was the first year I watched basketball. Over the past decade of watching him play, and especially the past 5 years or so, I've learned many things about the way he plays and approaches a playoff series. Game 4s, historically, are his rest game. He doesn't take them off per-say, but he doesn't come out guns blazing like other games. This isn't an accident however, because he has a plan. I think it is a psychological trick he uses to get the other team over confident. because wen game 5 rolls around, he turns it on. he looks different, has a new look in his eyes, new energy. he finds a way to get it done. people counted this team out, then when he started to dominate jumped on the bandwagon, then when they lost and tied the series, dove head first off the bandwagon back onto the Warriors side. What I know is this: Lebron the Underdog is one of the scariest Lebrons you'll ever see. and now that he is back to that spot, look out. I AM CONFIDENT BECAUSE WHEN YOU COME AT THE KING YOU BEST NOT MISS. IT'S MEANT TO BE. I CAN FEEL IT  




 I think the only name you change is the Clippers because what the fuck?
I think you gotta rebrand a lot of teams tho. Like the Raptors? Make it more menacing like a Jurassic park raptor. The Nets need a rebrand, the Magic need a rebrand, the Jazz need one... lot of these teams just have outdated looks to them 




 even with that being true, if the Cavs play their best game, they can beat the Warriors at full strength 




 did you just ignore the original comment? we aren't discussing his shooting 




 you see the way he landed on that leg? could have EASILY seriously damaged his knee if he tried to land normally. have to take the momentum somewhere 




 but the same goes for the Cavs...  




 and miller dove for a loose ball... 




 Yeah, if he was going to have an off game or maybe even take a game off to an extent, game 4 is the one. It only tied the series. Brand new series now and two days rest before 5 and 7 are all we need for Lebron to cement his legacy. I BELIEVE 




 this is the silver lining for me. if everyone is going to have a shitty game, I'm glad it all happened at once. it can only go up from here.  




 lol no. I said Lebron should shoot every time he is single covered. you said he should share the ball. look how that turned out dumb ass 




 Lebron doesn't wanna play. He's dead. Ready for this to be over. Hope he snaps outta this bull shit 




 I knew JR wasn't gonna be worth shit when he rode in the gym on a fuckin scooter 




 Jesus Christ JR is shit. get off the floor damn 




 We need him to not take stupid fading contested shots.  




 DEFENSE WINS CHAMPIONSHIPS!!!!!! LETS GO!!!! 




 OH MY GOD FUCK JOEY CRAWFORD IN THE MOST DISRESPECTFUL WAY POSSIBLE. HE'S AN ARROGANT CHODE WITH A GOD COMPLEX THE SIZE OF KANYE WEST AND AN AGENDA TO ELIMINATE THE CLEVELAND CAVALIERS AND TO GET LEBRON INJURED. FUCK THIS GUY  




 Moz and Tristan finna eat 




 Warriors panicking with the lineup change 




 oh, I understand.  




 I don't. he can't shoot midrange like speights, he fouls once every 2 minutes, and the Cavs saw the same film the Warriors did with DLee in. He'll be a virtual non factor  




 but by saying they took their own guys out of the offense by giving Lebron a historic number of touches, you imply that he shouldn't shoot the ball every time he is single covered by guys who can't guard him. if you give other guys shots, you aren't taking advantage of the best mismatch in basketball.  




 first of all, didn't say bounce pass. second of all, you're wrong. go watch the film 




 so you're saying you don't want Lebron shooting when he's single covered? what? the current strategy is to destroy the Warriors strategy. other people don't shoot or get the ball bc the Warriors are too stupid to double him. and when you double him, other guys have open looks and lanes, resulting in better play. come on now, don't be dumb 




 They'll still trap the PnR with Curry, but instead of leaving Lee open on the roll or pop, they'll rotate everybody over a man. So, big man on the opposite side comes over to cover Lee, guy in the corner slides to cover the big man who covered Lee, and you leave the ball side corner man open. if the pass goes there, it's ball side so one of the two trapping Curry can simply close out quickly and recover and you're back in your defensive set. it's not a hard offensive set to counter against, they just didn't have time to do it in Game 3.  




 Yes, but GState hasn't had a lead at the end of any quarter in the entire series with the OT in game 1 being the only exception. They might be able to make it close if the spread gets big, but they haven't proven that they have the mental fortitude to get over the hump. Lebron knows how to close, they don't yet.  




 the cave haven't played their best ball at all! with the exception of Delly, no one on the team has. Lebron has been missing open layups all series, JR can't buy a bucket, Moz can't catch half the time, TT can't make a layup or putback, JJ isn't as hot from 3 as usual... if the Cavs play a sound offensive game for once in the series, they steamroll GState be of how they have proven they can handle them defensively 




 I think the game Lebron has a good shooting night, we'll see something truly historic. Like, he misses 4 or 5 open layups in the first half of game 3. If he just makes those, he's in the 50s while still taking the same number of shots. Can't wait for him to get a hot streak 




 But just like they saw how that worked for them, we did as well. So we had just as much time to gameplan against that lineup and action as they did to implement it. I'm really not worried that much about DLee being in the game. He is a fouling machine anyway 




 strikes me as media savvy. keeps all eyes on him and dumb media fluff instead of basketball and his team. allows the team to stay focused 




 don't. don't say that.  




 A bro you can enjoy some afternoon Friends with, is a bro indeed.  




 not with back spasms he cant 




 nope. Delly wasn't on him in the 4th* when he got hot. Delly was dehydrated and that made the Cavs have to switch screens and put Shump on him instead of Delly. that won't happen next game 




 It didn't result in a lead in any quarter in the entire series except for the OT of game one. and that one wasn't bc of good shooting, team made 1 fg in that period. all free throws 




 Then why did he win MVP? Because he can dribble well sometimes? I'm still confused about how a guy with worse stats overall than the other 5 guys in consideration won the award that says you're the most important and valuable player in this league, simply because he has god handles. which any And 1 player has. So stupid 




 "vast majority" 
























 http://imgur.com/JnoTwpX 




 thank you. good god, fans are never satisfied or even understanding of players sometimes. it's only day 4 of free agency. calm down. he's gonna sign, just after he gets what he wants/feels he deserves. players need to get as much money as they can, while they can. playing career is fleeting 




 WHY DO THESE TEAMS NEED SO MANY POWER FORWARDS 




 you right 




 I know... in trying to hold out hope for him as long as I can. not workin out tho 




 I don't know man. shits tragic. dudes gotta find a way to be proud of their work without thinking everything they do is the greatest thing since sliced bread. stick to your lane  




 we already have a solid player there at all times. where we do not have that is at the guard position. therefore, priority number one. 

also, Spurs aren't trading patty.  




 D': don't do that to me man 




 Kawhi is overrated. Unpopular opinion. I accept the downvotes that come with it 




 I retract my comment. said that after 6 songs. liked em all. don't remember liking the first six songs of a Wayne album. jumped the gun. 

I am dumb 




 Watching Lebron James first playoff appearance and subsequent game winning layup on the Wizards. Die hard Lebron James follower ever since and basketball is my one true love 




 no + no 




 is there a point here? or just a statement about years past, instead of the one coming up 




 is this a real thing? "working on his handles and jumper... just like literally every other basketball player in the world. let's see how it plays out" 




 I'm just gonna put on MOTM2 and pretend like it's 2011 again. I miss you, old cudi 




 yeah, just spark up a blunt and turn that on. if you didn't like it before, guarantee your opinion will change after that 




 nah. he said its on MOTM3 




 we would have like 6 bigs and 3 guards that are actually playable. I think a pg is a much higher priority  




 this is my fav weezy album of all time. already. sheesh 




 /r/hiphopheads please come back :'( 




 oh... whoops  




 Exactly. They said they're working on other deals now. I'm assuming that means they're more pressing issues and TT isn't a flight risk. Same with JR, essentially done deals but don't need to be worried about at the moment. No worries, fellas.  




 Their*. Silly scientists, learn how to spell  




 I just wanna know what Pop said about himself also leaving when Timmy does... isn't that what he's been saying he's gonna do all along? "yeah Lamarcus, you'll take over for Timmy when he leaves.. but you'll also be given a new coach with a potentially new system, an old and broken Tony Parker, and a bunch of old foreign guys who don't have a lot of time left. sound good?" 




 agreed. only place I maybe see him going is home, but him and Brodie Westbrook don't wanna break up yet so idk 




 Nothing will happen until you get the human cancer that is Dion Waiters off the squad.

 I just want Lebron and Pepsi to hook up so he can join uncle drew and Wes on the court.  




 Yeah, I met him at a camp there a couple years ago. Really cool dude. Hope he gets a shot 




 He's from Dallas. My high school coach played with him in high school. Always said he was the smartest guy on the team. Which is high praise coming from that arrogant son of a bitch 




 100%. I respect your animosity. http://imgur.com/2VXTqPd 




 I think I speak for everyone when I say, good.  




 Dude. just stop. it's not going to happen. you're not going to make "steelers" happen in a Cleveland sub. you have a better chance of curing cancer 




 Cavs sub, therefore, respect must be maintained at all times. Our NFL loyalties might be different, but our Cavs fandom binds us. One goal, All In.  




 oh hell yeah! it's been buggin me for a while now 




 I personally don't think he did it. The chick basically said so later. Was for money. but anyway, bruh needs to chill 




 Yo, chill.  




 Steeler by birth, Cav by heart. Please, accept me and all my flaws  









 agreed! I'd love for him and Logic to go back and forth on a track 




 Yeah, fuck having to put a chick on every damn song. just lay down some bars on a beat and be done with it. it doesn't have to appeal to the radio listener all the time.  




 Impossible. Deron Williams, Joe Johnson, and Derrick Rose still play in this league 




 but you don't know how many games he has left. no one does. his career could end tomorrow. you have to make as much money as you can while you can in professional sports because one day you'll be done. and you won't be in your 60s like everyone else when you retire. you have to make money and make it last. 

I will never fault anyone for actively trying to make more money. that's how the world works.  




 he wasn't on the winning team this year..? I don't see your point  




 That's not the nature of the business though. You never know when your career could be over and you won't have the ability to earn money from that job ever again. And especially when other teams/employers are willing to pay you more for your services. It's about maximizing your ability to earn for your family 




 that's not on the line. that was on the line a month ago when actual games were being played. this is the off season, where you negotiate with potential employers about the monetary worth of the skills you provide. after this part is out of the way is when the stuff that makes you remembered starts.  




 that's idiotic 




 I disagree. I think it's always the right decision whether you get more or not. you maintain the leverage by opting out 




 this is just dumb 




 but he isn't running away. just because he feels he can earn more money by opting out doesn't mean he doesn't also want to experience those emotions 




 Is it time for a Tea Party pt. 2? 




 Oh god... that Lebron money O.O 




 more money. I don't understand why everyone is freaking out. if you had an opportunity to negotiate your way into and extra 4 million dollars, you would too. it's not a difficult concept to grasp 




 It'll change when they get rid of Jeanie  




 it's not about cockiness...? it's about maximizing your earning power for as much as possible. it's a good business decision  




 nah I was generalizing 




 Dr. Braun in Lindale Texas.  




 and you too, sir  




 can you even comprehend how much money chemotherapy makes a year for the U.S.? it's absolutely insane. why would our government give up that cash cow? especially with the absurd debt we're currently in. 

this is no conspiracy theory. this is reality.  




 the Hippocratic oath isn't a thing anymore. they did away with that years ago. and while I tend to agree that human beings in their nature are kindhearted, that doesn't take away from the fact that this happens a lot more than people realize. the doctor might not deem it important enough to tell you about at that time so you just leave thinking you're fine. when in reality, he sees the beginning of something forming and "just doesn't want to scare you" even though it is treatable at that time. but they wait until they absolutely have no choice but to try to help. making the most money they can in doing so. 

I just don't trust anyone  




 just like with any company or workplace, not everyone is in it for the money. there are obviously people who actually care. but as a whole, the medical industry is about money.  




 not even a little bit 




 you need to ask more questions 




 Nobody knows. No one asks. Once their told "you're fine" people go on their merry way. 
I know a doctor who used to study under a cancer specialist in California. she said that this guy unlocked the cure for cancer in the pancreas of a pig. had years of studies and proof that it worked, and once the guy tried to publish a work or whatever it's called on it, guy gets taken out and his place gets ransacked. coincidence? curing disease and helping people doesn't make money and the government knows it. all I'm saying is, if it is government mandated that everyone get vaccinated, in today's corrupt governmental system, I want no part of it. and, the medical industry is just as corrupt as the government under which it serves. 

I just don't trust anybody, man 




 it's not about protecting your kids for them. it's only about money. if you went and got an MRI today, more than likely they'd tell you everything's fine. when in reality, you could have a treatable problem forming inside that won't manifest for 6+ months. why don't they tell you? because treating/curing it doesn't make as much money as waiting until it manifests and then trying to control it. 

it's all about money. always has been, always will be.  




 false. you know anyone with a Mercury allergy? that little bit can give them health issues that you couldn't imagine.  




 except it is 




 What may be worse than that is actually trusting doctors who make more money when you get vaccinated. Only reason doctors want it is for the pay day 




 KD day dreams about em at the free throw line so you know they gotta be the shizz 




 WILL I STILL TALK NOISE ALL DAY TO REFS AND NEVER GET A TECH? YEEAAUHP 




 later in the video it brushes its teeth.  




 her snapchat stories are both insanely hot and insanely annoying. too much promotion of products, not enough titties 




 yeah I know! I just never talk to players during the season and then when it's contract time, I use all my "hometown discount" and "win a ring" pitches I have saved up to get em haha 




 By responding, you too are an angry little person who feels the need to have the last word. Also, deflate the size of your ego a little bit and maybe realize that your OPINION isn't fact. 

Stay... whatever it is you are.  




 MyGM! Can't change those contracts in that one haha 




 100%. he's my preseason favorite for ROY 




 I didn't offer him the max in 2k. He didn't pick me. So I'd say yes 




 Spell check got me there. But you used "there" when you should have used "their", forgot the "e" in "use", didn't punctuate that whole sentence properly either, you used "then" when you should have used "than", and you said "as" instead of "has".  So you don't get to call me an idiot either, jackass. 

And as for all the BS proclamations you declared fact, you're wrong. It's actually not true that he juiced in high school. That's a myth. He didn't lose a lot of weight because of steroid use or whatever the fuck you're trying to say (you need help on sentence structure because you make no sense sometimes), he lost weight because of all the things in his DIET he cut out. He was trying to be quicker and lighter on his feet, as he has said many times, and at the beginning of the season didn't feel like himself, as he has said many times, so he switched back to his old meal plan and workout routine to start gaining weight back. Thus, all the back and knee problems coming out of nowhere because he was doing what he usually does in the summer, during the season. Therefore, he took a 2 week break to heal from his injuries and came back fresh. 

Ignorant people who assume the only way an athlete can be good at something is by using steroids or performance enhancers just really suck. It's possible, believe it or not, that you can realize your full potential by eating right, taking care of your body, and working hard. I know, foreign thought right? 




 It's insane how idiots some of you guys are. Having a personal chef who only feeds you the healthiest of meals 6 times a day year round goes a long way, guys. Not necessary to assume steroids are involved.  




 I find it adorable that you think a guy is on PED'a just because he's better than everyone else. Can't just be great on his own? 














 I just want an NBA version of Hard Knocks. That would be the shit

 What if I told you, Annakin Skywalker and Lebron James had the same story arc? Chosen One, leaves for the dark side, returns to do what was always his destiny.  




 we actually do. he said as much a few weeks ago 




 Nah man. Lebron showed his dick to America a week ago. nothing can top that 




 I love Andy as much as the next guy, but my god that contract is brutal. I know it's off topic, but damn if that was lower it would help a lot.  




 how much is it and where can I get it 




 No. He'll never take less than the max ever again.  




 MyGM on 2k. got that bomb ass Cavs dynasty goin and it's helping pretty well

 MJ never lost?! THATS INCREDIBLE!! I didn't know he had 15 championships!! This guys gotta be the best ever then, gee wiz.  




 Yes, because basketball is the only players league. People love rooting for individuals way more than they love rooting for teams. People naturally are drawn towards a human being over a jersey. And the way the NFL is being completely overhauled because of health issues and baseball keeps declining because it's boring as hell, basketball will definitely take over. the worldwide fan base is growing astronomically and that will be a big factor as well. 

these next summer Olympics will prove how big basketball is around the world 




 lol, 245? no way. too low 




 2011 Finals, game 4 in Dallas. Lebron laying the biggest of eggs with 9 points. I was there. 25 rows back. Watching my hero shit his pants on the biggest stage in sports.

 but... he didn't win... according to BET's tweets anyway...

Edit: Okay so I still don't know what's going because the tweets clearly say Steph won, but everywhere else it says Harden won so... I stand corrected I guess? whatever. I'm confused 




 I'm just glad we got a guy who can actually play 12-15 a game and not hurt us while giving Lebron rest throughout the season.  




 He's better than JJ and Mike Miller. I'm happy about this 




 booooooooo get a job 




 If you were given the ability to create the perfect superhero movie, what superheroes would you choose to put in it? What villains? And who would you pick to play those characters? What's the storyline?

some of those aren't records, so I apologize

 False. I can beat Satnam Singh. I guarantee it 




 but just imagine all of the late transition spot up 3s he'll splash. on the defensive end he gets a huge fast break starting block, but the guards get stopped so as he's approaching the top of the key he gets that swing pass and just bangs an in rhythm 3 and the crowd goes ape shit. 

that was very descriptive... I hope everyone is as excited for this exact play as I am  




 stop making shit up, you're not from Texas 




 yeah that makes sense 




 oh that's totally fair if they did play overseas. just asking because, in my mind, that gives the Spurs a pretty good advantage 




 Real question, did Manu and/or Tony play over seas before the NBA? and if they did, which rookie year are we talking? I have no clue if they did or not though 




 I take rookie Lebron over everyone else. rookie kyrie is a top 5 pg in this scenario so that's a plus. Love was solid and boarded like a mad man, Mike Miller was rookie of the year... yeah, Cavs got it 




 For everyone saying OKC, get over it. Ibaka is absurdly overrated, they have essentially no depth and if you think otherwise you're delusional, and this is the year Westbrook finally causes a rift between them where they can't mesh together. he's gone

 So I was looking at the post about Bryan Cranston maybe playing Jim Gordon in a future film and saw that he voiced that animated character for one of the animated films.

For everyone saying "well they didn't take their decision lightly" well duh. If you were thinking about killing a baby that has been growing inside of you, you'd think about it a little too. 

If you wouldn't kill the baby when it's born, as soon as it becomes a human in everyone's eyes and you can see its little face and hands and its crying in your arms, then why is it suddenly okay to do it a month earlier? 2, 3, 5 months earlier? It's not.

 Yo I know KD was the MVP and all, but he'll never be the best player in the game. D Rose dominated, got MVP, chronically injured ever since. KD got MVP, foot injury.... I just don't think he'll ever be the best in the league now. Best scorer? yes absolutely still possible. but best overall? nah. Anthony Davis is coming quick, Steph can still improve, Harden can improve defensively and make a case, Kyrie is no joke... but my vote is AD within the next 5 years.

And he's back now trying to fulfill that promise. So I don't see your point.  




 I'm disputing that. All I'm saying is, as a human being and as a man, your word should be just as strong as a binding contract. And to say one thing and do another is immature and disappointing.  




 His old man game is gonna be ridiculous. He's gonna develop some "fuck you" post moves and just embarrass kids on the block

yes they have his bird rights even if he signs a series of 1 year deals. but these are projections, so he could potentially make more than that or less than that. either way, it'll be a lot.  




 Yes. if he waits until 2017-2018, he can get a 5 year max deal with full bird rights. 200+ million 




 nope. 2 year with opt out after 1 




 Incorrect. Year after next  




 until 2017-2018. Cap jumps to 108 mil, which means he can sign a 5 year extension with bird rights and all, making 32.5 mil and up per year.  




 Your word is your bond. At the end of the day, it's all you have. If you can't honor your word, you're a chump. Therefore, ethically worse.  




 don't believe anything. every tweet is a guy pushing a story line. 95% of stuff like this holds no water and is pushed by agents or teams to try to sway the opposing side. just wait until he signs and we'll be fine  




 how does Superman change if the Nic Cage movie had been made? 




 I'll take two Greeks please 




 I coulda sworn that said CJ Miles... apologies fam! 




 wouldn't have happened. he hated Kyrie when he played here.

 You need to leave... you need to leave now. 




 THATS NOT THE ONLY THING THAT CAME EARLY AMIRITE??? 




 Jerry Gergich. Parks and Rec. He is Mario Chalmers.  




 Remember that scene in Interstellar at the school where the teacher says they changed textbooks to reflect the inaccuracy of the Apollo missions? Said they didn't land on the moon and what not? That's where this is heading. A complete inaccurate retelling of history through the eyes of political correctness.  




 If they get JJ, JR is gonzo 




 I don't see Andy being a part of the trade. Or, I don't see the trade happening if it requires giving up Andy. Him and Lebron are too close 




 Windy said we're looking at a Joe Johnson trade with Haywood's contract... what do you guys think? 




 Well damn. Wade hurt you bro? You don't have to laugh at the notion that he's a good TV personality because he actually is. Better than the rest of the dudes on right now
