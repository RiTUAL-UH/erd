[Here's how to become a Poll Worker](https://vote.franklincountyohio.gov/poll-worker/)

If you want to be a poll worker, make sure you've declared your party affiliation, because some positions require an equal balance of Ds and Rs -- for example, when the actual ballots are delivered to the BOE after the polls close, each car making that delivery must have one of each. 










































































 [FAIRHealth Consumer Cost Lookup](http://fairhealthconsumer.org/index.php) can tell you, based on your zip code and the medical procedure codes, what a medical or dental procedure *should* cost, and how to navigate through the reimbursement process. Here's how this invaluable site came to be:

In 2009, an investigation by then-New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo uncovered conflicts of interest in one system that health insurers used to calculate reimbursement for patients who received care from providers outside their plans network. As a result of this investigation, FAIR Health -- an independent, not-for-profit corporation -- was created to establish and maintain a new database that could be used to help insurers determine their reimbursement rates for out-of-network charges, and provide patients with a clear, unbiased explanation of the reimbursement process. 

As part of the collective settlement the Attorney Generals office reached with the insurers, FAIR Health received millions of de-identified healthcare claims that many had used to help them determine their rates.  This data continues to be analyzed and processed with the goal of increasing its completeness, accuracy, and neutrality, as it will form the basis of our licensed products. The data is also the basis of educational products and tools for consumers made available on this website. 



















































































































































































 She's old (19, spayed), but has been in good health until this afternoon, when she started peeing pink in the bathtub and I immediately made a vet appt. for tomorrow afternoon. After a couple of hours I got her to eat (heartily, Science a/d that we had on hand) and drink, and she went to sleep for a couple of hours. But since she woke up a two hours ago, all she's done is try to pee, with almost no success. She's walking back and forth to the litter box, then crouching there, shaking her tail. She produced a small amount of clear liquid, then nothing. She's miserable.

Other things that might be at work here: she's had an impacted anal sac (6 mos. ago) and does suffer intermittent constipation; the vet says she has small kidneys but hasn't done tests to find out why.

Is this situation dangerous? Is there anything I can do before morning to make her more comfortable?

Thanks in advance for any help of any kind.

 Columbus residents are fortunate to have curbside recycling -- but how well are we doing it? I thought I was being good by saving even scraps of clean cardboard and paper, washing out food containers before putting them in the bin, etc. But then I saw that a friend is saving every plastic bag (although I don't know where she plans to take it), and now I wonder. Do you 

-- empty and wash jars at the back of the refrigerator with contents that have turned into slimy science experiments?
-- tear apart pizza boxes to save the clean cardboard?  
-- refuse styrofoam takeout containers?  
-- use only cloth kitchen towels, rather than paper?  

Bonus question:
Do you urge your friends and relatives to work harder at recycling?

And of course:
Why or why not? 






































































































































































































































































































































































































































































 I've worked the polls in Ohio for several years, but Columbus has turned decisively blue, and local Dems are more active by the day. So by waiting too long -- a few hours! -- to respond to the BOE's call for workers, I lost out on getting one of the slots reserved for Dem poll workers.

May other pollworkers here also find themselves facing such an embarrassment of riches! 






































































































































 At 4 AM, driving on Sawmill was dicey at best, with visibility of less than 20 feet. Route 161, with no street lights and few residential or commercial light sources, was frankly terrifying. It looked like east Tennessee out there.

 oooh, scary! 




 [I see what you mean.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Will_Rock_You_%28musical%29#Critical_reception) Glad I missed it. 




 It probably will. The volume of submissions here is overwhelming. You might want to post it to /r/cats, which is lower-traffic, higher quality (because it asks for original content) or /r/catpictures. I *know* others there will appreciate it. 




 It really is a great pic! You can almost feel his excitement, sniffing the wild air ...

So many of the posts here are lazy, sloppy cellphone snaps of cats asleep on the OP's lap. But this one really stands out, and hopefully may inspire other redditors to try to capture images that more clearly convey their cat's adventures and emotions. 




 Wash your mouth out!

EDIT: OMG, you're speaking about a real possibility. I thought you were making a sick joke. 




 This is one reason why I love reddit, warts and all. 




 Animals and kids know: Everything is food until proven otherwise. 




 I don't think it's even possible to make Freddie Mercury boring. 




 I don't believe this kitten is that old. It looks to be *maybe* six weeks old. 




 Great photo! I'm sure Bruce had a wonderful time -- but shouldn't he wear a collar if he's going out alone? 




 Cute enough for /r/corgibutts ?

 You just said more about yourself than about anything I wrote. 




 You're not even reading your own comments correctly. 




  this poll omits Elizabeth Warren

Who will. not. run.

Why do people persist in this fantasy? 




 She's one BIG kitty! That's about three times the size of my oldest. 




  In the case of pets and children: they're stupid.

Not stupid; they just can't read. Also, it's sweet, and apparently tastes good. Do you happen to know if this treatment works for animals? 




 How much does she weigh? (How much of that fluff is fur?) 




 [And this doesn't help.](http://www.boston.com/news/nation/2015/05/01/news-media-won-cover-bernie-sanders-because-news-media-won-cover-bernie-sanders/Fd4VrpGvVqhACVdPuVjOlM/story.html) 









  ... years of "divisive rhetoric" made the violent phrasing seem normal.

So much for editorial judgment. 









 It might help to leave the radio on, tuned to a good classical music station. That seems to keep our cats happy. 




 The nearest [Rent-a-Wreck](https://www.rentawreck.com/cheap-car-rental-akron-OH.htm) is in Akron, but it's worth a call and might be worth going that far to pick up depending on rates. 




 True. But I posted this because I think the dynamic cited in the headline is a real problem, and not just on the Sanders campaign. I've been in this business along time, and the amount of self-censorship I see today based on what's assumed to be the consensus about what's worth covering is quite alarming. I think it's partially a function of overvaluing what readers want, rather than an editorial vision of what readers need to know.  




  I hate Kroger. 

If all you've seen are their stores along High Street or in student/poor neighborhoods, that's understandable. But go look at one of their best Marketplace stores and try to say that again. The variation in quality is infuriating, but they do have some very good stores.

 I wasn't sure where to ask this in general

You might also ask at /r/Pets and /r/Dogs to get more opinions. 




 "Good Sam" funds -- which are donations from wealthier clients -- are never advertised, and are used at the discretion of  the vet. I've had good luck with just being upfront at the first appointment about the fact that we have almost no money. 

I hope you will be able to get him in sooner than later, because while this could be a big nothing, it could also be an upper respiratory infection. 

Adding, I once found a filthy, scrawny white kitten so close to death that we named him Spike (after Buffy's undead boyfriend). With a little help from an understanding vet, we saved his tiny life -- and he's now a big, robust 9 year old! So please come back and show us photos of your kitten once he's feeling all better. 




 I know how you feel. But he will always be part of you. Maybe [this](http://img1.etsystatic.com/000/0/6011550/il_fullxfull.330687981.jpg) will be of some comfort. 









 So sorry for your loss. What was this handsome fellow's name?

 One of the nicest things about cats is that -- unlike  everybody else you run into day to day -- they *just don't care* about money. 




 *Somebody* doesn't like the outdoors.

 For whoever reported this comment: it isn't doxxing. It's public info about a public figure.

OTOH, it's also unnecessary, and because of that it looks like an invitation to harass. So let's keep such comments to a minimum, please.  














 Inspired, and based on the book, by Ghiglieri, M. P. and Myers, T. M. (2012) Over the Edge: Death in Grand Canyon, this map is presented in Chromadepth and is best viewed with Chromadepth 3D glasses. 









 All true. Every defendant has the right to the assumption of innocence, and to a vigorous defense at trial. But usually this level of comment from defense counsel is saved for the trial, rather than trying the case in the press by blaming the victim.

This particular lawyer, whose bread and butter is DUI cases, has a long-standing obsession with the way consent is defined. Is it ideological? Is it a career move? I don't know, but I do think this interview is over the top. 

 




 Reyes' attorneys are calling the women opportunists.

"What police failed to mention is that the victims were present during the game, called to Mr. Reyes, waited for him after the game," defense attorney Brad Koffel told the judge Tuesday. "They went out and had drinks afterwards. They voluntarily went up to his hotel room."

**None of which matters.** What year is this, anyway?  




 They mean packing material (from appliances), not food containers, but it's a start.

And no, I have no idea what they plan to do with it. But at least it won't be available for my demented feline to keep chewing on, and that's what matters right now. 









 Not sure there's any right way, given [this guy's bias](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplehate/comments/347opv/xpost_rtia_there_is_no_such_thing_as_a_small_fat/). 




 This bitter 111-day strike was more closely-watched than most strikes in the US because it was so violent and so disruptive to business. [This article puts the strike in context](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2006/01/mine-j25.html), detailing the history of both the industry and the union, in a way that other, less "biased" sources can't match.  









 In 1985, the strike by meatpackers at Hormel's Austin MN plant, represented by United Food And Commercial Workers Local P-9, was the cause celebre of the labor-oriented left in the US, gaining wide support nationally from everyone to the left of Ronald Reagan. Only a handful of trade unionists and labor activists disagreed with the strategy of the local, which pitted it against the national union as well as the bosses. P-9 supporters were outraged by the criticism, which history has vindicated. The dispute has long-lasting implications for all labor organizing, and deserves the closer look it did not get at the time.

The linked piece was written while the strike was ongoing, but it remains the most complete explanation of the issues. It's a very long read, but the key graf is this one:

The outcome of the struggle between industrial unionism
and enterprise unionism will determine the nature of the labor movement in decades to come. Concessions can be won back in later bargaining, as many unions have shown. But a fundamental shift to enterprise unionism will destroy whatever class consciousness still exists in the labor movement. 









  I think you're just hating on radicals for no reason, frankly. 

I can't read past this. You clearly have no idea how absurd that assumption is, but you should have caught a hint by now. 




 Yes, and that's one reason why I don't want to be the submitter there. 




 This is a noble effort, but it's unlikely that backpack was left there by its owner, don't you think? It's more likely that you found a pack that had been ripped off and discarded by the thief after everything of value was removed. If there was mail in it, it presumably showed a street address -- is there any possibility that you could take the further step of going back to the bridge, getting the pack and taking it to that address? Even if it's soaking wet by the time you get there, I bet Abigail G. would rather have it than not! 




 You did the right thing. I'm just amazed that they took the hint! 




 No. If you recognized my username, you'd know it's true. I've had to get mods and admins involved on more than one occasion. Having me as OP on such a post would get it downvoted and turned into a flamewar.

Why would you *not* want to do it? 




  Did it occur to you that a lot of those people have the same sort of analysis of all this that I have? Because they do. 

I suspect that I have a better handle on who does this work nationwide than you do -- if we're talking about people who primarily build organizations and coalitions rather than people who turn out for demonstrations. In my experience, the latter group have almost no idea who the activists are *in their own cities*, let alone nationally, who have been working on this issue for decades. They often don't even know whether DOJ has had any previous involvement with police departments in their own state -- which is such basic ignorance it blows my mind. 

There are *plenty* of very radical people involved in the national movement for police accountability, but they are not anarchists. They are people who have learned the cost of letting the perfect become the enemy of the good, and they are not about to let that happen again.

DOJ intervention does make a difference. I live in a city that was forced into a settlement, and although there are still problems, policing here is nothing like it was before. It is literally a life and death difference for people here, so hearing you dismiss it as "an attempt to sap the energy of movements with shallow reformism" is incredibly insulting.

I don't think you and I will get any closer to agreement with further arguments here, but please, get to know the people who were on this case before you woke up. It will expand your political horizons and give you lots more leaders to respect.

  




 I'm not a good person to do it, for several reasons including the fact that I have a small posse of haters who follow me around reddit and downvote everything I post. So, please: lead on! 




 Extremely important question: how did you "send the dogs home"? Did you just tell them to go? I'd be afraid they'd insist on coming along for the whole trip. 




 Wouldn't it be a good idea to cross-post this to /r/OSU and /r/Columbus, if not also /r/Ohio? 




 [citation needed] 




 Tell that to residents of cities where long-term campaigns for accountability have made real differences. From your grand theoretical anarchist heights, you're trashing the work of thousands of community activists over many decades because you think your analysis of hierarchy is more important than their real life struggles for civilian review, better training and better policy.

You didn't say "give up" in so many words, but that was the clear message your vague rant delivered. 




 Ah, so we should just give up, then. I see. Well, thanks for dropping that "knowledge" on us. 

Anyone else? 




 Where'd you find that --Santa Barbara beach? 




 The operator end of a cat toy. 














 Yes, cats hunt. I was just making fun of the idea that domestic cats, not habitat loss, is responsible for large-scale bird loss.

You *can* teach her not to hunt, BTW. She's bringing you gifts, and if you make her understand that you don't want her to do that, she may stop. I've had best success with lecturing the cat: they absolutely hate being lectured. It's much more effective than a spray bottle. 




 Are you saying American soldiers in general today have an easier time in war, or that soldiers who ignored the warnings and went to Iraq anyway are less deserving than those who fought in a just war?  




  All I know is that I'm not anywhere fighting and other people are.

For *any* of the sacrifices made by American soldiers to mean anything, it's incumbent on *every* American to know and care about where and why that fighting is happening. Some wars are just, some are wars of aggression to control resources or trade. 

I really hope your comment was just overgeneralizing, not jingoism. 




 Why is that? The one time I tried to visit friends in Tucson, there were so many cockroaches in their otherwise nice house that we (native New Yorkers) couldn't sleep and fled the next morning, days ahead of schedule. What causes this level of infestation? 




 Wait: you mean it wasn't those evil domestic cats? 




 Er, somebody didn't bother to read the sidebar...

 You've completely misunderstood my meaning. I was saying your situation is the exception to my original comment about never, ever re-homing a pet. You're doing it exactly right, and I'm glad this kitty has a better home now.  




 Thanks for this. ISPCA's malfeasance has done a lot of damage to the reputation of all humane and welfare organizations. You've put the emphasis right where it belongs: on individual donors' responsibility to look this stuff up on Guidestar or Charity Navigator, but to keep on donating.

I found [this partial explanation of the differences](http://www.differencebetween.info/difference-between-aspca-and-spca) at the website most people will trust to tell them which is which. 

I have to wonder why this three year old article is suddenly floating around again now...

 




 What are you talking about?  




 None of which is surprising, since OP's submission history seems to be all about picking stupid fights.

 Moving across national borders is a special case, and arranging for a (possibly permanent) foster home for the duration is the best way to deal with it.  




 How nice for you that you had a good experience in a co-ed HS, just like millions of other girls. Now please stop attributing to me the ideas you want to argue against. Apparently, "YMMV" went right over your head.

I never suggested you "suffered'. The schools I spoke about are not the caricature you posit but (as I said) rigorously academic prep schools. 

You have a chip on your shoulder about this that no amount of discussion will fix. You'll have to find someone else to argue with.


 









 I wish I'd known to teach kittens while young to expect to get their nails trimmed, their teeth brushed and their ears cleaned on a regular basis for the rest of their lives.

But mostly, I wish everyone knew, before adopting a pet, that it's a lifetime commitment or it's nothing. Cats live to be older than many redditors reading this -- one of ours is turning 20 this summer. Pets are not props for a lagging social life, and they're not decor for a particular lifestyle. You don't "give away" pets when living with them becomes inconvenient. People who do this deserve sharp criticism, at best. 




 What will you do for them? Do you need info about how to care for baby kittens? 




 Yeah? You and what coalition? You show up here as a brand new anonymous account, throw out a call and expect anything to come of it? At best, this post is an insult to all the people who actually do the work necessary to *organize* the kind of mass movement that deserves support.

Mostly, though, it's just pathetic. 









 Some vets will give you a Good Samaritan discount if they know you've just rescued a stray -- it's worth asking. Also, look for rescue organizations in your general area, which may be able to help with this. Where are you located?

 Because of the subject, it feels uncharitable, but somebody has to say it: this post isn't extraordinary. Thousands of people have stories from that day, and this is far and away the least interesting one I've ever read. This reddit deserves higher standards for what constitutes a "gem". 














 Um, cute baby *what*? 




 What post is this a reply to? Where in the world is Henry?

EDIT: Never mind. This post is just incompetent spam from a new user whose only other post was also promoting one of her books -- but there, she remembered to include the name of the book and her website address. I'm reporting this as spam. 




 (1) Is your cat neutered? If not, do that ASAP.  

(2) When you go to open the door, only open it enough to put your foot in the opening, and use that and your voice ("Back! Back! Back!") to make sure the cat can't come through. You'll have to retrain *yourselves* to open the door differently, but once you learn it, he'll never get out again. [Source: eight years living with *five* escape artists.] 




 **GO TO THE VET NOW!** Not tomorrow; right this minute. This is a serious emergency -- that stuff is a nerve poison, and an overdoes could easily kill your cat.

 I have attended co-ed schools, so I do know the difference. I was just lucky enough to attend an all-girls school for the critical years when we were all hormonally deranged and socially insecure. If you had no problems in a mixed school, you're lucky. The  problems girls in co-ed schools have are of the sort that are hardest to see, because they consist of omissions: not being as assertive or competitive as they would if not competing for  approval from potential dates; not forming the same kind of intellectually-based friendships with other girls, etc.

EDIT: Adding, this is not just my opinion. There is plenty of research that has consistently found the same result over many decades: [single-sex school produce girls who are academically better prepared, more science oriented and more likely to continue their education.](http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/graduates-of-all-girls-schools-85038)

 




 He loves you! My tiny calico used to bring home multiple snakes every spring, to the point where we had to put a sign on the inside of the front door cautioning everyone to beware of cats bearing snakes: if you didn't check before opening the door, she'd run right past you to deposit her "gift" in the middle of the LR floor. Once I took the same snake away from her multiple times, releasing it back into a ravine nearby, only to have her go find the damn thing and bring it back over and over. 

And the thing is, kitties are so *proud* of the gifts they bring that it's hard to get really mad at them for doing what they're born to do.
 




 Yes:  that's the imgur rip-off of the full story -- this is the original source. I saw that album on imgur, recognized that it *must* have come from some journalistic source, because it was too detailed and professionally shot to be just "some guy on the internet", and so went looking for the original source. As a journalist, I'm allergic to rip-offs that don't credit the journalists who did the work.

Oh, I'm sorry -- were you chastising *me* for failing to notice that this had "already been submitted"?

 One nonreligious group doing this is [**Feed The Streets**, a project of the group Pursuing Our Dreams](https://www.facebook.com/PursuingOurDreams). I like this one because it's grounded in a plan to grow community.

 I'm sorry for your loss. Baxter looked like a lovely friend.

This is a terrible way to learn it, but perhaps your experience can help others get the lesson that cats *always* freak out during a move, and need to be carefully monitored during the run-up and contained during the move itself. Four of my cats flipped out and fled while I was loading the car for the last bit of a move, and I had to stay behind for three days in an empty house before I was able to round them up. I was lucky that time, but I should have known better because it wasn't the first time I'd lost a cat while moving.

May all of us be extra careful with our fur friends hereafter, and may you be comforted by your memories of handsome Baxter.  




 That's not fiction. That's true. 




 ...and just for symmetry, here's a fan page that collects links to all the works of [Theodore Sturgeon](http://www.physics.emory.edu/faculty/weeks//misc/sturgeon.html), whose name and career [inspired the creation of Kilgore Trout](https://books.google.com/books?id=EvCsY3IEJ14C pg=PA173 lpg=PA173 dq=theodore+sturgeon+kilgore+trout source=bl ots=P10yCAL9a9 sig=0_TxLIKZSYrdXkicb8RhgzqyEKc hl=en sa=X ei=xvlcVfPbHYPksATw1YGQDQ ved=0CFoQ6AEwBw#v=onepage q=theodore%20sturgeon%20kilgore%20trout f=false). 




 So... nothing in [the last round of answers](http://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/1s5e19/good_guitar_tech/) worked out for you? 




  Once you get the footage, I'm not really sure what you would do with it...

Anybody who does this should remember that events like concerts and festivals usually prohibit commercial use of photos of those events, and there's a whole industry of researchers looking around online for images violating those bans. Plus, the big ones have major police presence (that includes OHP), which could bring unwanted attention to the drone operator.

 If you think it's not "what Columbus is all about", why not tell us what you think IS appropriate?

I sorta like it, but am open to change (as always).

EDIT: Having just looked at the two you suggested, I amend my view: our current header is much better than either one. 




 Do you have *any* idea how completely you're presenting as a stereotypical sophomore? There's a reason for the cliche that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. 

Anyway, go on about feeling superior. We're done here.

 




 AFAIK it's just a listing, although I suspect they wouldn't list any org with a seriously bad rep. 




 Okay then, as an editor trained as a lexicographer (in which field, what the public thinks *matters absolutely*) I say to you: 

It's a variant. Deal with it.

Anyway, don't you have homework to do? 




 [Columbus Dog Connection](http://www.columbusdogconnection.com/dog_cat_info.htm) can help you find vets, trainers, fence companies, dog-friendly apartments, insurance, food pantries, you name it. This is a rare and precious resource that deserves support. 




 If your car is new and high-end, you probably won't be stopped for this on city streets around central Ohio. Driving while poor is another thing altogether -- that's when "no front plate" becomes another pretext for stop and ticket in places like Worthington and Dublin. 




 It's a variant, as recognized here by at least two dozen redditors who upvoted it over the last two months. 




 I went to a prep school, not a Catholic school, and uniforms had been worn there since the founding. And our uniforms weren't just pieces you buy anywhere, they were made by one specific outfitter, so the price issue was even worse for students whose families were not rich. 

Still, I'm incredibly grateful for having attended a school where uniforms were required and academics were primary. (I'm also glad there were no boys around to confuse us about how smart we all were!) 




   I'm not a reformist so I don't bother myself too much with the impact of reforms.

The reform struggle is the real world that you live in, and it's filled with people who should have socialist politics (and very often do), so you'd do well to start taking notice. It's not selling out to recognize, appreciate and even work in reform struggles -- but not knowing the whole political terrain in front of you is a serious mistake. 




  Starting up with uniforms meant having no hand-me-downs

My school and many others had a "little shop" where students could buy used uniforms for exactly that reason. Socks and shoes were the only thing we didn't buy used. 




 Shift dresses, yes; miniskirts, no. It would have to have been *very* late 60s for those skirts to have such high hemlines. In the mid-60s, the rule in many schools was still that the hem had to touch the floor when the wearer was kneeling. (I have no idea where that standard came from, but it was everywhere.)

Anyway, another commenter has cited the original source as saying it was 1972, which looks exactly right to me. 




 This is one area in which we could take a lesson from Mississippi. Sometimes the old ways are just plain better.

  I read everything else below and think you are getting an unreasonable amount of shit for your post.

Thanks for your reply. I never meant to be rude but I was careless in my phrasing. I'm glad and proud that Columbus finally passed this law -- that's what I was trying to convey, but the way I said it completely undercut the intent.

You should also know that this sub has a reputation for being so brutal that it once was near the top of the list in a discussion of most toxic local reddits, and that in particular that I have a small posse of haters who downvote and disparage almost anything I say. That doesn't account for all the critical comments-- some were right on target about how unwelcoming my original comment was -- but a couple of those people hate me so much they'll come into a thread on /r/aww to snarl at me. So it's not all about this discussion.

Anyway, I hope you find what you're seeking here, and add that the weekly "Bar Thursday" gatherings listed in /r/ColumbusSocial are reportedly very friendly. I won't be there, because I don't feel welcome. 




 You did see that I apologized, right? And I didn't call names. 




 The relative is, for lack of a better word, delusional.

I don't know how close a relative this is, but you might want to consider the likelihood that what's happening with the dog now is a preview of what will happen with the human eventually. The ties you make or break within the family now may be even more important later...

I'm now convinced of your sincere concern for the dog, and wish for you all the best outcome, whatever that is.  




  vote in a new economic system 

Who suggested that? This whole thread is full of strawmen. 




  I wish you'd just give up being an asshole already. 

I'm being authentically me: sometimes wrong, but always willing to retract and self-criticize if that's truly the case. I can't do anything about your opinion of me (and I can't even judge you the way you judged me because your current account is only four days old), but I would politely suggest that the above language is way beyond the limits of how to maintain a healthy subreddit.

Adding, keeping one username for almost 8 years and never deleting mistakes is not easy, but you should try it. 




 Not really. I know a lot about Suprynowicz. The Drega killings happened in New Hampshire. But you did detect something there: the reason I paid extra attention to Dennis Joos and the Drega rampage when others were looking at Diana's death is that I was a journalist, too.

BTW, there's a new book about this coming out this summer from Beacon Press that may finally correct the public record about Drega. I've talked to the author, and it looks like it will be an excellent read. 




 [Here's the article announcing the naming of the wooly lemur, *Avahi cleesei*.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4427160.stm) 









 Once again, a [Dirty Fuckin' Hippie](http://www.cafepress.com/mf/22025047/dirty-fing-hippie-oval_sticker) gets it right. Thank you for that *moral* as well as strategic clarity. I can never understand the willingness of the theoretical purity crowd to throw away the tiny margin of political and survival space for the poorest among us, just for the sake of their own self-image as revolutionaries.  




 That's a grotesque distortion of the position taken by his critics. 




 The Review-Journal is unfortunately Nevada's largest newspaper, but the more reputable choice is the Las Vegas Sun.

What would be excellent is if you could never let anybody forget the Colebrook story, and Suprynowicz's role in its aftermath. The attacks happened before most people understood the danger of lone wolves motivated by Sovereign Citizen crackpottery, so a lot of people wrote it off as a singular event with no political significance. (It was also the week Princess Diana was killed, and that ate the newshole almost everywhere outside the affected local area.) But Supryowicz took this horror, turned it upside down and spent years touring the backwaters of the US using his book to mobilize anti-government RW crazies. 

More people should know about the reflexive heroism of another newspaper editor, Dennis Joos, who threw himself on Drega when he attacked the newspaper office. Joos was killed trying to save his staff and friends. The local library is now named for him.

All of which is by way of saying, too late, that deleting this post might not have been the best choice -- although I understand the logic. 




 hahahahaha 




 By a completely despicable "newspaper". This is the home base of Vin Suprynowicz (editor), who made his name by [championing the vile rightwing spree murderer Carl Drega](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/08/10/1230293/-Carl-Drega-Folk-Hero-to-Free-Staters). So don't get carried away by praise from these hate-mongers. 




 Another one! You should totally also post this cutie over to /r/catsinsinks. 




 Shhh! If the theoretical purity crowd hears you, you'll be drummed out of the ...oh, wait; there IS nothing they could ban you from, because they never build anything.

  Bernie Sanders is the only one who will be able to talk in this "mass arena"

...*IF* ultraleftists like you succeed in demobilizing thousands of young people who otherwise would be going door-to-door, writing letters to the editor, etc.  

Fortunately, I think your likely success rate there will be about the same as most of your posts here. Go back to /r/Maoism, will ya?  




 This case was not decided on the basis of anything about free speech.
 




 What this candidacy presents is a opening to talk in the mass arena at a level that hasn't been possible for at 40 years.

Well, that and an opportunity for some people to feel superior because they have a wee bit of theory, mostly without real world experience. 




 go away, idiot spammer.

reported. 




 by itself all day sitting in it's own piss. I'd qualify laying in your own piss as won't move. 

Okay. You didn't make that clear before.  But when you say it can't be solved within the family, I have to ask if the rest of you -- starting with whoever took the dog to a vet before -- can't do a *collective* intervention. This would have the effect of spreading around the responsibility, and might even make family relations go better in the long run.  




 [Here's what the same intersection -- Fifth Ave. at 27th Street -- looks like now.](http://lostnewengland.com/2014/05/looking-north-on-fifth-avenue-from-27th-street-new-york-city/)

This is a very cool website that does that for many old photos. 




 If that doesn't work, I'd resort to the universal fix: duct tape. 




 Why isn't your assistant busy doing comparative reviews of different brands of catnip?  




 If the pet is still eating, it's not time yet. When the pet stops eating and *won't* move (as opposed to having difficulty), that's the end. Until then it's at the discretion of the owner, for better or worse. It's not animal cruelty to be unable to say goodbye to a beloved friend, and your eagerness to report what should be solved within the family undercuts your asserted compassion. 

You might want to explain to your family member that many pets stay alive for their owners' sakes, and that past a certain point that's not really fair to the animal.

Finally, if the owner once allowed someone else to take the pet to the vet, would s/he allow a third professional assessment now? 




 That was *yesterday*. Read the rules. 




 Note that this was decided not on a free speech basis.  




 I'm so very sorry. That's not an export we're proud of.  




 Note that this case was *not* decided on grounds of free speech, but it's still going to cause problems. 









 ...but Breitbart is an American problem. 




   In a globalized world, there's always a place to escape consequences.

Not forever. The connection between wealth inequality and climate emergency is becoming clearer every day to those who are willing to see it. Those who refuse to see it will find themselves forced, one way or another, to confront that reality. I hope that realization comes at the point of a global popular uprising, not at the point of a global economic and environmental collapse. 




 Oh, come on. If you're being honest, you know that I give lots of help and information to /r/Columbus, which can't really be outweighed by politics that you don't happen to like.

 




 Go back and see the rest of my response. 




 Sorry it came out that way. But it's hard for smokers to understand that many of us could not go to *any* bar in Columbus until this law was passed. I missed almost the entire experience of [Stache's/Little Brothers](http://www.ootb646.com/columns_profiles/venues/littlebrothers.html) because of this, despite being a friend of the owner and a fan of many of the bands that played there.

I do appreciate your effort to be respectful, and rest assured that someone here will give the precise info you need. 




 What's judgmental is your overreaction.

You're about to adopt your first kitten and know so little about cats that you had to ask others what age to adopt and what to feed it. I've had to deal first hand for decades with the effects of people not neutering cats. I suggest that you step back, look beyond your personal scope of vision, and realize that this is a heartbreaking situation that I dealt with fairly politely.

EDIT: By "this is a heartbreaking situation" I meant the crisis of homeless cats, not this particular cat.  




 Welcome to Columbus, where we actually care about [the respiratory health of non-smokers](https://www.ohiobar.org/forpublic/resources/lawyoucanuse/pages/lawyoucanuse-503.aspx):

The new law applies only to enclosed areas. As that term is defined, however, it includes more than just indoor spaces. Decks or patios that are covered overheadby a roof or even umbrellas or awningsand on more than two sides are also enclosed under the law. Smoking is not allowed if members of the public are invited or allowed into these areas, or if anyone works there as an employee, an independent contractor, or even as a volunteer. Business owners still have the option of making their entire facilities non smoking, both indoors and out. 


 




 Yes, she is. Now imagine how much better she'd look lying in a soft bed in the safety of a home where the humans cared enough to have her spayed. 




 OP, do you really rely solely on redditors for your news? There are plenty of serious, competent news orgs offering breaking news 24/7, just a click away.
 




 Can't. They're almost all too relevant, even now. 

I grew up in a house where Adlai Stevenson was right behind Franklin Delano God in our parents' opinion. I was too young to quite understand why, but now I get it.

  Don't think they have the revolutionary drive to support massive change for their workers.

And they won't until there's more engagement and education within the unions -- which are, after all, pretty much all there is in terms of a class-conscious infrastructure in the US. Remember, unions have been the money and mobilizing force behind major struggles for civil rights and against unjust wars.

[Teamsters for a Democratic Union](https://www.tdu.org/) will be an important ally if you do get into this. 




 Believe it or not, I did not know he is a redditor. Thanks for that! 




 This is good: it's how you build a base for *eventually* standing up. And I can tell you from my own experience that denouncing them isn't the way to go. Asking pointed questions (to which you already know the answer) is a better lever for prying open closed minds.

It will help to study what the standards are in unionized plants, you can find out what's up in your area through Unitd Food and Commercial Workers.  




 Right. Not all mice carry the virus. 




 That is absolutely delicious! 




 So what did *you* say in this meeting?

What you're facing is Standard Operating Procedure -- and the reason it continues is precisely because so many retail workers see themselves as just biding their time until they can leave for some imagined better place. Stand in the place where you are, for what you believe in. There's no other way. 




 [Alley Cat Allies](http://www.alleycat.org/Kittens) can help you with every step of the decision, from assessing their age and degree of socialization to building an outdoor shelter or finding a rescue org. They can even help you [find out who in your area is working with feral cats](http://www.alleycat.org/FeralFriends), which may lead you to the individual who is feeding them. (Because this is dubiously legal in some municipalities, they may be working at night.)

You could also try posting in your local and state reddit communities to ask how to contact local feral cat caretakers.

One thing you can do immediately is make sure they have access to clean water. Sometimes feral cats are fed, but not given water -- and that's a big deal.

There are many, many people doing this work, all of whom will be happy to help. Good on you for wanting to help, and good luck! 




 She's looking for subcutaneous, not intravenous. Sub-Q is a standard treatment for feline kidney disease, but I dunno about a UTI.  




 Just go to the vet. The initial visit will cost about $50, the fluids and rig will cost about $25, and you'll go home *knowing*, not guessing, whether the problem is a UTI or (also possible) early CKD or something else altogether.

[Rascal Animal Hospital](http://www.rascalanimalhospital.com/pricing-information.html) is probably the cheapest -- it's a $15 surcharge for walk-in, added to the $30 comprehensive exam. But get there when they open, and expect to wait -- they're currently booking appointments for routine care about two months out. 




 Yeah, that's part of the problem. There are union democracy movements particular to many national unions, but most don't have a high enough profile to reach down to the local rank and file unless there happens to be a member who has wide general knowledge of and interest in unionism in general. Some such groups, like Teamsters for a Democratic Union (TDU) have been so well-established for so long that they have actually wrought major changes. I'd suggest that anyone who is a union member should go looking for their union's rank and file oppositionists, because there usually is help to be found. 




 ... and that's what the [union democracy movement](http://aud2.uniondemocracy.org/) is about. Too bad you didn't reach out to that faction in whatever union you belonged to. 




 What union pursues an *unsupported* grievance, with no basis in contract language? This is a serious question. That is not normal. 




 Or until enough collective action on many levels changes the whole paradigm away from individual rights to social justice. 




 It's more basic that that, even. Americans are taught to think of themselves as individuals and to distrust "collectivism". Until we get past that legacy of anti-communism, no call for change will work as well as it could.  




 [It isn't true, and they do have a choice.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/37yx09/robert_reich_one_big_reason_america_was_far_more/crqz97x) 




  That is their job. they have to defend every single worker.

No it isn't, and no they don't. Not all complaints are legitimate greivances; the job of the union steward is to sort them out and decide whether/when to file a grievance.

The biggest problem workers have with unions is foot-dragging on filing and aggressively pursuing grievances. The most annoying problem for unions is members who don't bother to read the damn contract and thus either don't bother to seek redress or do so for ridiculous complaints.

Source: former local union officer and national union staff organizer. 




 And the worst part is, if everybody would just read the damn contract *before* they personally have a complaint (which may/may not be a legitimate grievance), everything would be so much better. I tell people, "You'd better believe that management studies every word and comma and line break in that *legally binding contract* -- why would you want to disarm yourself by not reading it?" 




 [Progressive Democrats of America](http://www.pdamerica.org/about-us/history) is essentially the faction within the Democratic Party that doesn't want Clinton to be the nominee. They are not the problem. 

Many PACs serve a legitimate purpose and do good work. Super PACs, which don't have to disclose who their donations come from, are the biggest part of the problem. The "Ready for Bernie"/"Bet on Bernie" PAC is another sort of problem: they disclose, but although they claim to be supporting Sanders, there's no way to tell whether the uses they put donations to are helpful to his campaign.

I say "they" when referring to this PAC (which is a hybrid form, but not a Super PAC), but right now [there's no reason to think it's more than one person, with unclear motive.](http://np.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/37xffz/this_website_claims_to_be_a_bernie_sanders_super/crql9z6)
 




 Not all PACs are bad. The problem is Super PACs, which don't have to report donors. 

[Progressive Democrats of America](http://www.pdamerica.org/about-us/history) worked to get Sanders to run as a Dem, and are now working to get him the nomination. They are not the problem. 




 Um, maybe someone should be thinking about what it takes to become a delegate to the Democratic Convention... 




  I think this might be a PAC set up by Hillary or the Republican's backers (billionaires) to slander Bernie 

No, it's just a ["political entrepreneur"](http://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/37xffz/this_website_claims_to_be_a_bernie_sanders_super/crqlleo) who serially uses whatever issue he can raise money around to bolster his resume and, not so incidentally, pay himself as Treasurer.

It will be exactly as much of a problem as Sanders' supporters let it become. The way to avert that is to educate ourselves and teach others how this system works and why they should only contribute to the official campaign. 




 That's what everybody who supports Bernie should do: not only give to the campaign directly yourself, but make sure that others do not give to these unaccountable PACs. It's unlikely that the Sanders campaign will make any statement like this, so it's up to the grassroots. 

And that's a good thing: talking about what's wrong with campaign finance is a key part of his agenda. 




 It wasn't just lamps: the ceramic statues were on every other coffee table. The original was designed by [Royal Hickman for Haeger Pottery](http://www.haegerpotteries.com/haeger.php?section_id=3#1941) and was first produced in 1941 in three different sizes. 
























 I agree. That's why it's so important to teach supporters about how campaign finance works. I do not believe the Sanders campaign will have much if anything to say about this; it's up to grassroots supporters to do this. And it's not a distraction -- objection to conventional, currently legal financing is an key part of his platform. 




 go away, idiot spammer.

reported. 









 This is the correct answer. 




 The press is not going to call this thing a Super PAC, because it isn't one. Fox might do that, but no serious news org will.

BTW, [**here's a good primer on every aspect of campaign finance**](http://www.amazon.com/Unstacking-Deck-Reporters-Campaign-Finance/dp/0976603756) *except* 527s and Super Pacs, which arose right after this was published.

 




 Thre's nothing to report: it's a real, legitimate *but uncontrollable and unhelpful* PAC. See my other comments here for more info. 




 This is the critical point. The linked PAC is just the first to come to this sub's attention. There will be many more. The task is to educate supporters to only give to the campaign. 




 They haven't donated, they've pledged. [He has only recently started taking actual contributions.](http://news.yahoo.com/cary-lee-peterson-love-media-085228219.html) The list you see is autogenerated when potential donors typed in their own info, which is why it looks so ragged.

 There is, but it's not what you think. 

The PAC is real, and apparently registered with the Federal Elections Commission. That doesn't mean its existence has the approval of the Sanders campaign. 

This PAC, which is in no way connected to the Sanders campaign, is the project of a middle aged lobbyist named [Carey L. Peterson](https://sites.google.com/site/caryleepetersonprofilearticle/). 

From a quick survey of this lobbyists' history and other projects, he appears to be a political entrepreneur -- he's in it for the money. I don't see anything that suggests he's a true believer, and sending money to this PAC is not a good idea.

EDIT: [**Here's an article from Bernie's hometown paper that explains this PAC.**](http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/politics/2015/05/30/sanders-unable-superpacs/28184005/)

 




 It's not a trend. It's just the simplest way to keep track of a pencil when you're working mainly with that (rather than a keyboard) and also need your hands free for other tasks. In publishing, especially newspapers, editors used to use special blue pencils for copyediting, and keeping track of those was especially important, which is why the stereotype of an old school newspaper editor shows him (of course) with a pencil behind his ear.  




 I hope he's making better use of his time than that! 




 Maybe you've got to vote for who you've got to vote for to keep the worse of evils from gaining power.

Fortunately, between now and the next presidential election there's  time to do a lot of education on root causes and strategies for bringing justice. Thanks, Bernie! 




 Amen! I haven't been able to get back there for several years, but I love camping there and dream about it often.

Only, next time I'll get out *before* the rain turns the road into caliche and my rental car winds up in the ditch...

 Something got lost in translation here ... 




 There are some extremist "feminists" who act more like female supremacists

Yes, and how that happened deserves a lot more attention.

OP, while you're doing background research, be sure to look into the movement that *preceded* second-wave feminism: Women's Liberation. Based in an internationalist, class-based analysis, this is a perspective that simply could not ever be warped into the grotesque caricature that academics made of feminism. And the women who considered themselves part of a global women's liberation movement were the ones who shook the world in the late 60s/early 70s. 




 Home is a good place to be. Give that li'l fuzzball an extra few pets from his online fans!  




 Please tell us the messy face is from medication for his eyes ...? 




 Yes, because it's not backed up by any hard data. You're asking about a social dynamic; they're whining about their individual experiences. 




 Because most people are too smart to think men *as a group* are routinely victimized simply because they are men. 
  




 Whose media do you mean? Men claim victim status here on reddit  every day. You can rebalance your views by reading about how ridiculous such whining is [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/againstmensrights/).

EDIT: Sorry for the duplicates -- my internet is stuttering b/c rainstorm. 




 Because they have no choice: there are [at least seven different laws in the US](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_of_origin#United_States) requiring that all imports carry a Country of Origin (COO) label.

The "Made in China" labels in clothing are especially galling to those of us old enough to remember when many garments carried [this label](https://laborrightsarecivilrights.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_20130405_155016_375-1.jpg) instead. That was something to wear with pride. 




 It's not illegal for women to be topless everywhere in the US. The right has been litigated in several places (e.g., Columbus OH) and the legal basis for the right is clear. Places where a law against it are still on the books are those where nobody has yet filed a lawsuit.

Adding, the organization that *seems* to lead on this issue, GoTopless, is actually a front for a cult -- the Raelians -- who believe humans are ruled by aliens, among other forms of nuttery. 




 But now you're the expert among the friends you have that don't already backpack. You can be the trip leader! 

And don't totally give up on meeting new people this way. Just make sure you spend more than a few minutes talking to them before heading out. 

Remember, the "bad co-hiker" experiences will someday be hilarious tales to be told around a campfire. Like the time I led a hike in Grand Canyon with a guy who brought along a 36 lb. pack loaded with two hardback novels, a fifth of bourbon (which of course broke and soaked all his clothing) and a crackpot notion that leaving his cigarettes at the rim was the best way to quit smoking. By the end of day one his longtime GF hated him so much she left early and hiked out alone with a torn ACL; the rest of us wanted to throw him to the condors but settled for making fun of him at every turn. 




 You never know what tomorrow will bring to your parking lot. Maybe a traveling circus will use it to stage their parade to the tenting ground. Maybe someone will decide to have extremely inappropriate personal relations with a parking meter. Maybe Oprah will stop by, and get locked out of her car, unable to escape her entourage and fans. You never know ... keep your eyes open, your camera handy, and bring the winners back to /r/WTF!

 I do have a very good idea why I'm talking about, and I never denied the ongoing damage. But your claim the "the Indians forgot" is asinine. Try making that assertion in that in any Native community (even one of the reddit subs) and see how it is received.  




 Remember to ask in the local reddit community where you're moving. 




 it completely turned me off to backpacking with others.

Oh, come on. You went backpacking with *strangers*, not friends. With friends it's a kind of fun your non-backpacking friends can never even dream of. Especially when you plan a big trip that takes months to jointly plan and prepare, which can be the best part of any trip. 




 That's pretty insulting. Nobody forgot. This is about wealth and political power imbalances, as usual. 




 The shelters are separate from the HQ of the organizations that run them. The hotline is widely advertised, but not the physical address of the actual shelter. 




 Amen. Another option is to find a *foster* home by Sunday night, then keep working to find the right permanent home.

OP, why did this *suddenly* become an issue with a five y.o. dog? 




 Nah, for small amounts the people to talk to are at (614) 466-2660.

 




 You're not helping yourself here. 




 Of course I know it was local. But you were responding to a guy from California.

There is one buffet chain I've loved in other cities over many years that I wish would come here: [Souper Salad.](http://www.soupersalad.com/) Among other goodies, they have an outstanding gingerbread always on offer. 




  They think they're privy to secret/privileged information. 

That's a major dynamic in *all* conspiracy theories. Overwhelmingly scary things seem to require overwhelmingly big singular explanations -- compound dynamics and "we don't know yet" don't cut it. So it must be that the Big Truth is out there, it's just being kept from ordinary people like the speaker because they're not part of the powerful elite -- except that now their "knowledge" of the Big Truth gives them special standing above the sheep.  




 Aww, c'mon: Potlucks are a great way to socialize, and most often safer than your average commercial buffet. That one made national news because it was so unusual. Anyway, this one comes with [music](http://www.potluckshows.org/AquacatToTheRescue.mp3).

Good luck getting that chorus out of your head.  




 I'm guessing you're kidding, but the issue here is the union contract. They've been able in the past (don't know if this one is still true) to do things like define "unfounded" in a way that automatically ruled out any complaint against an officer that came in more than 30 days after the incident, regardless of how serious or well-documented.  




 On of the reasons I ask questions about the details behind high quality photos that show up in the sea of cell phone snaps that floods the "new" page is to find out whether the image is original without having to bother with a reverse image search, so thank you for that info. Faking it is especially bad form in this sub, which values OC.

Now I'm taking back my upvote. 




 Weird: I have hardly ever seen photos taken from the bottom of the incline. Most pics are taken [looking downhill.](http://www.ridetheincline.com/images/uploads/general/incline-inside.jpg)

Adding, the incline is a private enterprise outside the National Park, but whatever. 




 Try chaining your bike to a tree in NYC and you'll have it confiscated and face a $1000 fine. Chain it to any other public infrastructure and it can be removed as "abandoned property", although enforcement varies. That's just one city, off the top of my head. You're welcome to test this out, or do your own research. 




 If this were real, you wouldn't be the one posting it. It would have been every post to the front page, linked from serious news orgs, two days ago.

I replicated your Google search and there isn't a single credible source there. Are you new to the internet? 




 The lock ceases to be "yours" when you leave it on a public bridge. It's not theft to repair vandalism.

EDIT: Bikes are different IF they are locked to a rack. 




  here it is called divetelact

In the US it's called [kitten milk replacer](http://www.petsmart.com/cat/milk-replacers/cat-36-catid-200031?OVMTC=Exact site= creative=50564886892 OVKEY=kitten+milk+replacer url_id=148263772 device=c devicemodel= gclid=CN-SzMeq6cUCFZSGaQodYCkAuw). 




  wouldn't an abuser be able to locate the shelter just as easily as an abused person

No. Shelters go to great lengths to keep their locations secret.

 How is it possible to steal what is essentially litter?

  I believe they call it autistic now

autism != retardation. In any case, neither of those terms is appropriate, and both are offensive when used out of medical context. 

What you both mean is *willfully obtuse*. 




 This is an officer known to  many people: Sgt. Steve Livingston has been the community liaison officer for the whole northern part of the city, and is a specialist in community policing. He's also been in the news because he was hit by a car in 2012, breaking 17 bones. The FOP made a huge stink about the outcome of the case against the driver, IIRC.

I'd love to be snarky about this, since I think the FOP is a big part of the problem with policing here, but I just can't manage it. 




 [Here's a guide to caring for small kittens.](http://www.kittenrescue.org/index.php/cat-care/kitten-care-handbook/) There should be a recipe here for making kitten milk replacer at home until you can get to a pet food store to buy some.

Another thing you should do is look around to see if there are more kittens out there. If the momcat is around, she'll take care of them, but it not you'll have to intercede.

This is a great adventure you've embarked upon. Watch out for falling in love with that little squirt!

 This piece is from a libertarian group (published in *Forbes*...), so there's some weirdness near the end about "mandatory donation disclosures stifling participation in the democratic process", but it's a welcome reminder of an incredibly important and hard-fought legal victory. 

Adding, I had the privilege of meeting Corliss near the end of his life, and he was a great man. He never stopped supporting peace, justice and socialism. 









 ...  a reporter is considering doing a brief news story that might negatively portray one of the sponsor companies and the company prefers they minimize coverage...

I don't know how much of a problem media corruption is...

The kind of corruption you cite is infinitely less common than you imagine. The vast majority of reporters and editors in serious news organizations are honest. The problems you see are primarily due to the model of journalism being practiced: a blind belief in "objectivity through balance" combined with a skewed agenda favoring what readers want to consume rather than what they need to know, all dialed up to 11 by the concentration of ownership that happened over the past twenty years. Investigative teams all over the country were disbanded and defunded as marketing experts convinced the new beancounters to chase reader/viewer eyeballs with increasingly salacious clickbait.

This isn't something that's going to be fixed anytime soon -- especially not by non-journalists after the main players have spent two decades trying to figure it out.  So focusing on this instead of on-the-ground organizing would be a serious mistake. 

 




 [Harvey Houses](http://www.legendsofamerica.com/66-harveyhouse.html) are a fabulous legacy in the west. I happened upon La Posada while it was being brought back from the dead -- it's now a showcase, well worth a side trip.

 Yes, although that's a subset of being politically inexperienced in general -- the minor downside of having inspired lots of new activists.



 




 There are new people in the room every day. Don't deny them the chance to discover this because you're already hip to it. 




 Keep trying! A delayed response is not the same as no response. Sometimes it takes sending those "come out and play with me" (even online) messages many times before a person can really hear them, and then the sheer number of times you've tried becomes a factor in itself: your friend can't ignore how many times you've reached out, and some part of his brain will have to recognize that you do care, and that this is because *he's someone worth caring about*. 




 The first thing that goes when you become depressed is your judgment. And the thing that keeps you from turning that around is the notion *which everybody has* that all your thoughts and feelings are real because they're yours. But they're not, and being willing to trust one other person who is telling you that a certain belief is "just  the illness talking" can be a lifesaver. 




 May it be so. 

I wish, however, that it was a better union than the Guild. I'm old enough to remember when GCIU represented Newsday, and negotiated 40K buyouts in advance of a layoff. That couldn't happen today, but damn, they fought hard for the reporters.  




 You're right, but the website is still awful. 














 That looks a lot like a very old dessicated tree stump. What makes you think it's a living plant? 




 Yeah, that website is awful. The video must be available at a better site somewhere.

 Nope. Those are site-wide ads, over which subreddits have no control. 




 As a journalist, I completely agree with your second part. But journalistic integrity has never had much of a toehold in TV news, and CNN seems especially resistant to shaming.

I don't think there's much point moaning about this. The Sanders campaign is *intentionally* focusing on social media and face-to-face organizing, and that's exactly right.  




 (1) Paragraphs! Use them.

 Fexofenadine is the generic for Allegra, a former prescription drug now OTC. It's easily tolerated and highly effective, but you have to take it continuously, not on an as-needed basis. It's pretty cheap, so it's worth a try for a month. I don't know how to characterize our allergies vs. someone else's; I just know neither of us would be able to have cats without intervention. 




 You mean N. Broadway and High, or Graceland? I can't stand the North Broadway one because of the floor layout, but Graceland (which is a Kroger Marketplace) is one of the better stores.  




 My husband and I are both allergic, but both love cats -- so we take fexofenadine every day, and stopped noticing the cat dander years ago.

 I thought this was an interesting intellectual debate -- until I learned more about the "poet" in question. As a *real* poet informed me after I stupidly Tweeted this story without researching further,

Place is a white conceptual artist and lawyer who has published the documents (all of them) from a criminal case and called it poetry. She wrote in Joel Chandler Harris dialect, and her appropriation of this has been the subject of extensive debate. She says, "Authorship doesn't matter. Content doesn't master. Form doesn't master. Meter doesn't matter. All that matters is the trace of poetry."

So the answer is, no, tweeting GWTW doesn't make this poet racist. That ship sailed long ago: she was a consolidated, intentionally provocative racist long before this project.

EDIT: ...and damn the Daily Beast for omitting that critical context.

 




 The Washington Examiner brought the Mother Jones story to their attention. 




 Not everybody who pushes chemtrails is un- or mis-educated.

I don't know what the answer is to people like him.

 




 Nope. They didn't *steal* it, they just did what ProPublica hopes other news orgs will do, which is reprint their work (by prearrangement). 

I just have a fixation about this because PP is the result of the abandonment of investigative journalism teams at major newspapers in favor of outsourcing to free-standing groups dependent on foundations for funding. It's a terrible model, and the transition cost a lot of very good reporters their livelihoods. So I want PP to succeed with its mixed-funding model, and right now it still needs to demonstrate support by showing public support via clickthroughs and shares.

You did more good than harm by posting any version at all of this very important story. I was speaking mostly to other readers, not you, and I thank you for taking this seeming criticism so well.

 Buzzfeed also recently was granted a seat in the White House briefing room, which caused old media heads to explode. They're hiring some good reporters. 




 She has said she won't, and her integrity is what her fans value. Plus, she has a completely other strategy in mind. 




 If that's true, the mods need to reconsider. Buzzfeed is gearing up and becoming a serious news org. It recently got a seat in the WH briefing room, ahead of reporters from better-known news orgs, and that happened because of their new commitment to serious political reporting.

 You might try one of the photography subreddits if nothing pops here. But eventually, somebody almost always shows up here with the right answer. 




 It's everywhere on reddit right now. It would take a lot of swatting, even with the best possible answer, to deal with all of it. I suggest ignoring the venues that will always be hostile to Sanders, and focus on dealing with it in general discussion forums.

And, frankly, this WILL make it to the venue that still determines how a lot of people vote: your local daily newspaper. You may not usually read it, but during the next 18 months, it's a must-read and an important place to speak up, through letters to the editor. 




 Can you read any numbers on it anywhere?

Pay special attention to the last bit about going out late at night. May your kitty be home in your lap soon! 




 Be careful: a social media call to fool around with your employer's  FB rating by embellishing the story could backfire. You've given more than enough info here for someone -- the jerks or your boss or IHOP corporate -- to identify your real name, and you can't assume none of those people reads reddit. You also can't assume that IHOP would condone that behavior, which (since you're one of their managers) could look like IHOP is doing it, possibly in violation of FB's TOS.

Much better to get in front of this by telling the story from your point of view, in writing, to your immediate supervisor or district manager. If you can get a copy of the police incident report,great -- if this takes time, tell them you've asked for it already. That alone will help protect you from blowback you don't deserve.

  more and more jobs are being taken up because of increases in automation

The problem isn't advertising or automation. The problem is concentration of ownership into the hands of a few megacorps that have zero commitment to journalistic values and demand an unrealistically high ROI -- thus, the decimation of editorial staffers, starting with the ones whose work took a long time and cost a lot of money.

ProPublica is great -- but you do understand, I hope, that its existence came about because there were so many old-school journos without jobs. It was almost the only success out of hundreds of efforts to build something new. What happened is basically that the megacorps outsourced serious reporting to foundations, leaving reporters without *ongoing* and (relatively) secure institutional support. The new organizations employ a tiny fraction of the available talent and publish an equally tiny fraction of the serious news that used to get published. 

You can't see the difference because you can't see the work that is no longer even getting started anymore, but I've been in the business for longer than most redditors have been alive and the scale of what's no longer investigated -- especially at the local/state level -- is horrifying.

Anyway, the idiot mods here have decided that this post is off-topic because it isn't "explicitly about current US politics", so if you want to comment further, you'll need to go to one of the other postings. 




 I didn't say "what they think is the right thing". I said, and meant, the [objectively] right thing -- the action that is sustainable within the ecology of human society.

The point is that most people, psychopaths and sociopaths excepted, are both hard-wired and conditioned to want to be fair and compassionate. When some fail to do this, it's a lack of resources -- material or knowledge -- that causes the problem. The idea that it's only natural to compete is so reductionist as to be completely misleading. When public policy is based on that assumption we get massive wealth inequality and wars to protect the system that made some people so much richer than others. 














  Scratching it actually makes it worse

But applying very hot water for as long as you can stand it *does* help, especially if you do it immediately after being bitten.  




 Most people, most of the time, want to do the right thing. 




 I know the VT ACLU has been keeping watch on police misconduct in Burlington, if you're still there.

Remember, different cities have different histories. What we're all really looking for is an overview of best practices, and of best strategies for getting there. My city had a long history of lefty lawyers suing the City for $$$$ over individual incidents, plus a lot of agitation from white radicals who are anti-cop, without much changing. Then 20 years ago it got so bad the Justice Department almost took over the police department, before reaching an agreement with the City that had the effect of forcing a big jump ahead on things like training. We're still struggling, but at a different starting level than other cities, even those in the same state.

But I have another question: why is this discussion in this reddit? I love Bernie, but I'm unaware of his laser-focused economic populism campaign taking on an agenda for building an all-sided progressive movement. He almost certainly agrees on the importance of this issue, but the task at hand is a campaign for office.  




 There are several national organizations that have been working for police accountability for decades, and almost certainly a group in the city where you live. Have you reached out to anybody other than reddit about this? I don't mean to discourage you -- this is an incredibly important issue to commit energy to -- but for the last year it seems like everybody wants to start from scratch, for no good reason. 

 




 What letter? 




 When I clicked through to this, my elderly cat sitting next to me snapped to attention and watched the gif several times through. She's never been interested in anything else on that screen or the TV, but apparently the way a bird moves is hard-wired in her brain.

So the guys who gave that bird water *also* gave a far-distant critter something, too. 




 The people who did this study were a studies-for-hire company. Maybe they just aren't very competent.

Or maybe they were created specifically to come up with results like this, so they can push a specific agenda: [Barna Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Barna_Group#Overview) is an *evangelical* Christian polling company designed to provide "research and marketing expertise as a service to Christian ministry." 



















 "Wire copy" used to mean something: AP, UPI, Reuters. This article is especially useful because it points to a particular fake news "wire service" as the root of the viral explosion. Other news coverage after the fact merely noted that the Mirror had retracted the story. 









 That's where 99% of the problem is, and that's why this bill is just grandstanding. 




 A reporter at the *Providence Journal* concisely summed up the cost of the takeover of most US daily newspapers by corporations during the last two decades in a comment in [this article about the recent sale of the last family-owned major daily to an investment group](http://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/news/2015/06/11/dispatch-sale-heres-how-gatehouse-has-handled.html);

... many reporters let go were veterans with deep institutional and community knowledge. They were replaced by younger, less-expensive writers, something that "gnaws at a lot of us in the newsroom ...

"Gnaws at us" likely means they can't stop thinking about the coverage they can't do any longer for lack of staff and funding: enterprise and investigative and science reporting, for starters. 





























 I can't believe I missed this. Must go adjust brain. 




 Don't ask. Seriously. Just be glad the annual temporary derangement caused by the end of high school classes hasn't spilled over into this reddit. 




 Since when are German Shepherds called cats? 




 OP, please post this to /r/Ohio for extra fun! 




  I've never even seen that meme.

This may be the first time anybody has ever admitted this on reddit. I'm sure it's true for others as well, but yours is a brave statement. 




 what was Hoot ?

Hoot was a [humor magazine](http://www.columbuslibrary.org/cmlcnix/searchresults.cfm?sort= afterdate= beforedate= searchlist=OSLIN%2C%20IRV%20%28%60HOOT%27%20MAGAZINE%29 searchindex=S pub=ALL) founded by local writer [Irv Oslin](https://irvoslin.wordpress.com/), who also wrote a weekly column full of epic snark for Columbus Guardian. After a hilarious but tragically failed run for Mayor of Columbus and the collapse of CG, he moved to Ashland and became a serious reporter.

  




 Good points. A few more are detailed in this post about [**how to find a lost cat**](http://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/199wf8/missing_kitty_in_the_arlington_center_w_henderson/c8m7lkp) from the Reddit Guide to Columbus in the sidebar.

OP, if you do find him, please come back and let us know! 




 I'm (always) speaking in terms of the basic infrastructure of reddit, without RES or gold. Also I subscribe to a hellacious number of reddits, so I see as much of the marginal stuff as I can find time to look at, without even trying. 




 Reading comprehension problems here beyond fixing. 




 A meeting with wine. (This is actually a long-running in-joke among fellow travelers.) 




 I'm not objecting to the amount of punishment, but the *kind*: do you want to live in a society where judges can tell reporters to write articles to the judge's specification? 

Journalists are watching this to see what the news org will do, and what the editor will do. Both *should* refuse this sentence, but the editor in question is a widely-despised hack and will probably cave. 

I have no idea what an appropriate conventional sentence would be. The guy violated a very clear court order, in an egregious manner. And this wasn't for any reason of high principle, just the reflexive race to get a scoop. What do you think?  




 Funny -- I go looking to check the zeitgeist on a regular basis, too, but usually by way of an intentional tour of my "friends" pages (submissions and comments) plus a big dose of serendipity via the random button. Together, it's like reading the best-edited magazine imaginable. 




 Doesn't this guy have any handlers? 









 Some people find it reassuring to know that what was once a slapped-together block party with radical politics has managed to survive for 43 years...

   /r/all is a bigger shitpile then normal,

Why does anybody who understands how the site works even look at that page? I've always found that users who cite that can safely be assumed to be new and/or very young. Not surprisingly, it's Pao-hate central today. 




 This is so true. With very few exceptions, these are literally kids on summer break. [I had them pegged at 15](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/39fhtr/eli5_why_is_reddit_dying/cs2wnr3) rather than 17, but same principle applies: [school's out, and this is something to do](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/39gj8x/eli5_why_are_people_getting_crazy_over_removed/cs35216).

The illusion that it's a bigger, more diverse, more serious crowd can be easily dispelled by a few minutes of reading the user histories of the redditors screaming the loudest. They talk about "reddit's front page" and mean /r/all ... 




 That's one of the best self-criticisms I've ever seen. 

And as someone who used to carry around a tiny version of [this](https://img0.etsystatic.com/060/1/8030109/il_340x270.744115886_i75i.jpg), I have a significant basis of comparison w/r/t self-criticism ... 









 Okay, forget Jason Taylor -- at least for now. He did get hired by Gatehouse (New Media Investment Group), but for the foreseeable future he's mainly the [new publisher and president for the Las Vegas Review Journal.](http://www.thestreet.com/story/13184209/1/jason-taylor-named-president-and-publisher-of-las-vegas-review-journal-president-of-gatehouse-media-western-us-publishing-operations.html) Who knows whether Gatehouse thinks Columbus is part of their western region... 




 Thanks for this post, which is about 100% more informative than anything the Dispatch itself has published, and way more important than most of the posts here lately about any subject. Love or hate the Dispatch, it still has huge influence on the overall public understanding of what constitutes news in Columbus.

The graf below, describing what happened at the ProJo, succinctly describes the central issue with concentration of newspaper ownership into the hands of a few corporations that care more about the bottom line than the public good:

...many reporters let go were veterans with deep institutional and community knowledge. They were replaced by younger, less-expensive writers, something that "gnaws at a lot of us in the newsroom...

"Gnaws at us" likely means they can't stop thinking about the coverage they can't do any longer for lack of staff and funding: enterprise and investigative and science reporting, for starters.

The guy they say will take over, Jason Taylor from Gannett, has most recently been running the Chattanooga Times Free Press and the Jackson (MS) Clarion-Ledger. Neither paper has suffered big staff cuts AFAIK, but I'm reserving judgment until I hear back from friends who work at those papers. 




 Lots of practice makes perfect! 




 My thoughts, exactly. This is *not* uplifting news.

Anybody who thinks you're too negative or over-reacting needs to know that this year, 2015, has been called the "crunch year" by climate scientists -- the last chance to even slow down the destruction of our home planet. In light of that, a "business decision" to slowly taper off production and use up the bad ingredient can be seen for what it is: the immoral acceptance of the amoral dictates of capitalism.  




 You say that like it's a bad thing. It's not! 




 Hey, at least he finally logged off for a while. I was starting to think that if he didn't get some sleep soon, we'd wind up reading about how his neighbors always thought he was a little off, but nobody imagined he would...  




 Loafs gonna loaf. 




 What does this even mean? 

The way corporate owners control coverage is by *not* covering things that should be reported -- and there's no way for most reporters to effectively counter that. So they cover what they can, as ethically as they can, and so manage to at least feed their kids. The news industry has changed so much in the last 20 years that you could staff a hundred good news orgs with the reporters who have been fired for objecting to the new regime.

Be glad that there are still people trying to do it right.
 




 Not exactly: it referred to [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/jlbdf/2_am_ice_chili_shower/c2d2hcz).

 Okay. I wondered if you were trying to play a cruel trick on readers who decided to wake 'n' bake before redditing. Glad to be wrong! 




 This is a serious answer: the people who are upset about this are very young and very wrong about what constitutes freedom of speech. School's out for the summer, and this is something to do.

You'd never know that it's possible to spend the whole day yesterday on reddit, having great conversations and reading interesting posts, without even hearing  about this "rebellion". Only people who think /r/all is the central forum on reddit are reporting on this as though it were anything other than the latest tantrum by middle-schoolers.

 I'm unsure why this post has attracted no attention here -- it's an amazing story. Could it have been removed by mods because of my previous comment about the editor in question, Larry Henry? Well, just in case, here's [one tiny piece of his backstory](http://jimromenesko.com/2014/03/26/letter-arkansas-tv-newsman/) that only hints at why everybody who has ever worked for him thinks he's a hack (at best).

  I am way off the mark

This. Reddit is not "a free speech initiative". It's a business. It's nowhere near dying. A lot of 15 year olds are bent out of shape because ... they're 15 years old. 

It's entirely possible to spend an entire day (or night) on reddit right now without even knowing about this "scandal". I know about it because I subscribe to /r/announcements, but the other 50 or so subreddits I visit haven't even noticed the "uproar".

If you're bothering to read /r/all, stop. It's a piss-poor substitute for the combination of good subscriptions plus use of the "random" button. And SRD is a cesspool to be avoided at all costs.

 Oh, dear. My hotel tip is, if you don't already have a reservation by now, there may be a problem. This is peak season at one of the most heavily-visited vacation destinations in the world. It can take hours just to get past the South Rim front gate. So grab the first reservation you can get (forget about deals) and start out extremely early to drive there from Phoenix or wherever. Also, read the official park website from top to bottom -- you won't be sorry!  




 Are you planning to do any serious hiking (i.e., below the rim) or just visiting? Reading through responses to other posts here will give you a lot of answers, but for specific tips it would help to know what you plan to do there. 




 I meant the sentencing. 









 So whose ethics are more tortured by this judge: law, or journalism? 









 This mind-bending story gets even stranger when you know that the editor in question is one of the most widely despised hacks in the region.

 DO NOT give the kitten regular cow's milk -- it will cause diarrhea, which can be fatal in a kitten.

DO figure out how old the kitten is by checking this [age progression chart](http://www.alleycat.org/kittenprogression). If the kitten is very young, it will need feeding with special food every few hours, and may well need more care than you can handle.( Be honest with yourself about this, because leaving it alone for too long could kill it.) If you can handle it, read everything [on this page and the pages it links to.](http://www.alleycat.org/page.aspx?pid=289)

DO take kitty to a vet as soon as possible to check for diseases.

DO ask more questions as they come up!

But OP, be careful here: you can look into the GoFundMe campaign, but don't start doxxing other redditors or this post will be removed and you will be banned.  




 This is why paying some minimal amount of attention to actual news reporting is a good idea.

I have a couple that couldn't find homes for this reason, and now they're stunning. One kitten I did manage to give away despite being the strangest looking baby suddenly bloomed at about 12 weeks into a cover girl.

Anyway, your kitten is fine just as she is. What is her name? 









 It's owned by a realty company -- [here's the registration info](http://flightaware.com/resources/registration/N35HM). No idea what that thing on top is.

EDIT: no longer owned by a realty company -- they sold it to an anesthesiologist last week (see last line on linked page). So maybe the takeoffs and landings were just a new owner playing with a new toy.

  Hedges and others are smart enough to recognize that if there isn't a peaceful revolution there will be violent chaos.

But not apparently smart enough to take the lesson that a "revolutionary moment" is when the people's resistance has the capacity to manage the earthquake of global economic disaster, not just when old systems and structures are failing. That term has a specific meaning, and this isn't it. 

To only point  to the objective conditions without assessing the subjective factor -- organized strategic resistance -- is to raise false hopes of a shortcut that doesn't require the tedium of base-building. If those false hopes lead self-declared revolutionaries to assume there's a mass movement at their backs when there isn't one, the result will be worse than ugly.    




   If you're really poor you probably get a lot of subsidies 

I'll muster more charity than I feel to say that I hope you never have to find out *first hand* how absurd your assumption here really is. 




 Think about what it will sound like to try to call the kitty by its name if it wanders away. Neither of those names roll easily off the tongue. (My brother insists there's an International Cat Naming Convention which requires all cat names to end in an "ee" sound for this reason. But what does he know? He only has 11 cats.)

How about Inky? 




 Yeah ... no. There's a reason why the leaders of the New Left summed up the main error of 60s and 70s as having believed *that* was "a revolutionary moment". Until there is a unified movement capable of both strategic planning and logistical resilience, the only thing going on here is temptation to take shortcuts.

There is a real danger in this moment from the agitators on the left and the right who wrongly think that it's enough to "bring chaos", after which everything will sort itself out. Such a scenario would default to the right, but probably not the way some of them assume. Preventing that is probably the most urgent task; leading a revolution is rather more than the left can do, especially in the US.


 




 This is an Attention Getting Mechanism, as my mother used to say. You cat wants you to come to her, and play with her, more often. 




 Handwriting -- specifically, signatures -- plus the lag in equipment upgrades due to budget restrictions in government offices probably accounts for a lot of it.  




 Yes, she did, and it was awesome. I am not a Hillary fan, but this is an excellent development. I hope it can be seen, even by Sanders supporters, for the great step it is.

 Thank you! I haven't watched the whole thing yet, but right away you can see the type of seats my friend and I got -- right at field level, behind a low railing -- and even see another girl get the same treatment my friend got. I can't wait to see if we're in this film!

Adding, I can already see it includes ["the fifth Beatle", radio DJ Murray the K](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_the_K#.22The_Fifth_Beatle.22), whose "Swingin' Soiree" show on WINS in New York was the soundtrack we listened to every night on [first-generation transistor radios](http://www.mcrfb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/1963-Teen-Girl-Listening-to-Transistor-Radio.jpg) when our parents thought we were studying or sleeping. Murray the K was referred to by some parents (not mine) as "Moral Decay", and blamed for fanning the flames of Beatlemania. The idea that the Beatles' music was just that good was lost on a lot of older folks then. 

Fortunately, my parents knew enough about music to appreciate both the roots and the innovation that made the band sound so new. My mother even bought herself a four-inch diameter button to wear that said "I love Ringo!", and although they didn't attend, they bought me and my brother tickets and drove us to Shea. It was an unforgettable gift. 

 




 [Angola prison is so infamous](http://www.southernstudies.org/2014/03/institute-index-a-brief-history-of-the-hell-that-i.html) that most American readers -- especially in /r/law -- think of it before they think of the nation. 




 *Nobody* could hear anything, including the Beatles themselves (they didn't have the same kind of sound system as today). I think there are documentaries that show how loud and crazy the scene was. 




 Blame? For what? 




 It seemed like mere minutes. We couldn't believe it when they ran off the field. [Looking it up now](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles%27_1965_US_tour#The_Shea_Stadium_show), I see that the Beatles' set was 30 minutes long. I also see that there were five other acts, which I assume we heard but ignored.

BTW, the classmate I went with climbed over the railing in front of us to try to storm the stage (we had GREAT seats), but was grabbed and pushed back onto her seat by stadium security. I don't think she even paused in her screaming.

 I was there that day at Shea Stadium, and can tell you that (a) I spent the whole time screaming my head off, and (b) I never expected to do that until it happened. I was there *for the music* -- I'd had an excellent musical education and knew just how talented these musicians really were -- but once there I got caught up in the mass hysteria. As soon as it was over I was stunned and annoyed to realize that we hadn't been able to hear a single note.

 









 I'm saving this image to use for reaction comments.

 You forgot the /s . 




 *Columbus Guardian* was a better paper, for the short time it existed. It had serious reporters, serious attitude and Irv Oslin, FFS. 

Even *Alive!* was a better paper than *TOP* until *Alive!* stopped covering local news in 1988. Hell, even *Hoot!* was a better paper than TOP, whose business model boiled down to pissing people off to guarantee newsstand pick-up greater than the skin ads alone brought in.

And the FreePress has been squatting space that should be taken by something better grounded ever since it went cuckoo for chemtrails. The Black Box voting obsession didn't help their credibility -- or that of saner organizations that affiliate with them for lack of any other general purpose progressive outlet.

Anyway, I don't see *The Dispatch* coverage changing much. The news hole is so small already that it *can't* change much, and they don't need to feed readers' inevitable resentment against the interlopers even one minute sooner than absolutely necessary. I'm guessing the new owners will tweak the peripheral businesses before they change the flagship publication, drawing out the advantage of reflexive reader loyalty to the familiar format while they study the market up close.
 




 Ah, I misread your description of reality for a declaration of principle. Sorry!

 




 Um, no. I had the unnerving experience in the mid-90s of interviewing a national figure in the WS/"patriot" movement *at his home*. He had mirrors mounted on the ceiling to see around corners, several attack-trained Dobermans, a bio-war laboratory in his kitchen -- and a single bookshelf with about 10 editions of the Geneva Bible and nothing else. It was the only printed material in sight. That kinda put me off the book.

This isn't the first time this clothing company has gotten headlines for "accidentally" replicating an offensive symbol: last time, it was a swastika. Apparently, this guy thinks such coverage is what they call "earned media". 
 









 Civility is *everything* in an anonymous online forum. This is where we get to make up our own rules, which are based on what we want to get out of the experience. 

Reddit allows for thousands of places where users can be brutal to each other if they want. But this is the subreddit that represents Columbus to the world, and it *can* be the kind of ideal neighborhood almost nobody ever gets to live in IRL: respectful of others' choices, supportive of others' needs, irreverent enough to laugh at ourselves, passionate about the future of our common homeplace.

Civility until unjustly attacked is a pretty good standard.

  




  That's not a personal attack. She's a pretty shitty poster. Everything she posts is either uninteresting, self-promotional or has been posted a dozen times before.

Are you listening to yourself? Of course that's a personal attack. If one user's posts are so annoying that you're willing to go round up 18 citations to her posts -- four of those from other subreddits, and three of *those* from another state -- it's well beyond a discussion of why people in this subreddit, in general, seem to downvote everything, from anybody.

If you want to critique a certain style of using reddit, fine. I'd probably agree with you about this style -- not because there are a lot of similar pleas for help that could/should be found independently through simple searches, but because there aren't any posts contributing important local information or art or opportunities. It's a very selfish way to approach a public forum, let alone a community. I thinks it is a style deserves criticism, because if it becomes the norm it undercuts the usefulness, never mind the enjoyability, of the forum.

*[donewaiting.com, I'm looking at you.]*

Anyway: did you notice that I did not actually name the annoying poster in the comments above? That's giving the offender room to gracefully absorb the criticism and decide to change, without making their entire existence the issue and the target for the everybody who wanders by.

I wrote long here for the same reason you went out and researched those posts: both of us want a better /r/Columbus. We might not agree on what that means, but could we please agree to try to minimize targeting individuals this way?   




 It's not about karma. It's about being minimally civil. 

And that's not coming from a position of cultural prudery: I'm a connoisseur of snark, and it pains me to see the low-effort, sloppily targeted crap that passes for criticism here. Politicians and major public figures, not other redditors, are the ones who deserve well-honed pointed comments. 




 She didn't ask "why are people downvoting me?". She's asking about a much broader dynamic, but you turned it into a personal attack.

Adding, the use of the term "shitpost" is a remarkably reliable indicator of a user who regards reddit as a competition among individuals rather than a forum for discussion, never mind community-building.

/r/Columbus could be so much better than it is if most of its subscribers were not intimidated out of posting. Why not put some energy into figuring out how to make that happen instead of constantly complaining? 




 That's why this question is so important. The endless downvoting of things that aren't necessarily wrong but merely reflect a different taste or opinion is a way to marginalize minority opinions and prevent participation.

Newsflash, downvote trolls:

 Personal attacks are uncalled for. 




 So these are the kind of advertisers supporting "Joe For America" -- an email list I never asked to be on and can't seem to dump. The latest mailing pitches this product, 9 mm push pins and the Geneva Bible, the guidebook for Dominionists and Reconstructionists. I thought the combination was, um, *interesting*.


 









 If you remember that with such vivid (and appropriate) bitterness, you probably also remember the brief, golden moment when Columbus readers benefited from the competition between *three* weekly alternative papers -- Alive! and Columbus Guardian being the others.

And as for bad moments in journalism: the out-of-state owners of Columbus Guardian *pulped the archives* on their way out of town, which is why many here may not remember that award-winning paper. That move was especially galling because it came on the heels of learning that those publishers, who had lured experienced reporters here from much bigger papers on the promise that they'd be on the cutting edge of the move to digital, had never bothered to digitize the archives. All that lofty talk about reclaiming serious journalism, and it turned out they were all about the widgets. 




 More relevant than that is the fact that, until today, The Dispatch was the largest family-owned daily newspaper in the US. The  two-decade trend toward concentration of ownership of print news by conglomerates that prioritize profit over civic education is now complete.

In other words, it's a wrap. The beancounters won.  




 That's [New Media *Investment Group*](http://www.newmediainv.com/section/about) to you, buddy. 

These beancounters wouldn't know journalism if it bit them on the ass. 




 One irony here is that 20 years ago, when concentration of ownership in print media was just starting to decimate the ranks of working reporters, journalists around the country were telling each other that family-owned papers, of which The Dispatch was the prime example, were the last hope for serious news reporting. Then it turned out that such papers had to compete in the same economy as those owned by soulless conglomerates with no commitment to traditional journalistic principles. That should have been predictable, but our hope was fed by desperation.  



















 I love La Chatelaine, but from the description of his kids' ages and preferences, I'm imagining a chorus of "Eew, Dad, there's *spinach* in my eggs!"

OTOH, chocolate croissants.

 I wore orange today, but the only orange shirt I could find says "Fund People, Not War". Hope that's an acceptable degree of mission creep... 




 The point is that *other people* will help put up the money that you don't have, once you've called a meeting or attended one that someone else has called. What's happening in your state's Bernie subreddit? In mine, a guy I never heard of before (and I've been a political activist here for a looooong time) has already set up meetings in three cities, just by online networking. 




  the answer is of course no.

The answer is "not yet". Somebody needs to take responsibility in every town and city to start a local campaign, and that involves ordering, prepaying for, and distributing/re-selling these at cost. Why wait to start that? If this campaign isn't about grassroots organizing, it's nothing. 




 Flat rate shipping is $15. Your problem here is not that you're too poor to buy from the official store, but that you're not ordering enough stuff. Can you find others in your area to put together a larger order? Maybe some local group would like to start distributing these, and you all could put together the front money for a whole pack of these items. Sooner or later *somebody* will do this in your area -- why not you, now? 




 Not for official merch that supports the campaign ... 




 No, sorry. When I have time (next month at this rate) I'll go looking. It was in some meta reddit, I think.

  nor does it fix the impression this person might now have of the sub or city in general.

Except in this case it did. 

And in my experience, that's pretty normal -- while willingness to make a meaningful apology is still very rare. For instance, you've now called me an "asshole" and such several times *without explaining what you mean*, and you show no inkling that this might be something that merits apology. If you can articulate what you mean, and apologize for name calling, we might have something to talk about. But even then, I'd have no idea who I'm talking to because you've erased your user history by changing names. For all anybody knows, you're one of the trolls who've been treating me unfairly for years here. Nobody has any basis to judge whether you're somebody whose criticisms are worth the time to read.

So unless you're ready to apologize for being overharsh and unspecific, we're done here. 
























 Read about Texas shelters elsewhere in this thread: that cat had zero chance there. It's precisely that the family did NOT try to find him a new home that angers some of us. 




  it's not their responsibility. 

Yes, it is. Just like very other aspect of the deceased's life that is now theirs to sort out -- but more so, because this "heirloom" is alive and sentient. They had a responsibility to try harder to place the cat, at least in a foster home, before dumping it at a kill shelter. 




 They could ASK for advice before dumping. And that advice will always be the same: commit to finding him a new home, and in the meantime, let's work together to find him a foster home.

Adding, the events that cause people to dump cats are almost never as sudden as the dumpers make them out to be. They just chose to ignore signs and refused to make contingency plans, then plead necessity where little of that actually exists. 




 What would you have them do if they could no longer provide a good home? 

Spend the time to recruit another family for him. It's doable; it just takes more time than people like this consider convenient. If they have to part ways with the cat immediately, they could place him in a foster home, then continue to work on finding a permanent placement. This goes on every day, where cat owners bother to think through their "sudden problem" and thus realize that others have  faced the same challenges before and found answers.

 I was there, about 50 feet from this scene, and know the people involved. This guy's whole rant is anti-gay. He comes to this same progressive festival every year, and that's all he rants about. The girl is smart and educated and knew exactly what this was all about -- she *wanted* to do this, all on her own. The girl's father (who shot the video) responded in several other reddits and on Facebook, and has been extensively quoted in press coverage of the viral phenom. Then the OP here leaves out the credits, and the same damn argument starts up again ... 




 No, that's exactly and only what he was ranting about. I was there. It's a progressive festival that he tries to disrupt every year. 




 The father (who shot the video) is a redditor who has posted elsewhere about this: the girl understands the issue very well and asked to do this. The only reason you haven't seen that is because the OP here ripped off the video and failed to link to the original post.

 My apology for this. I wasn't awake yet, and thought it was a different subreddit. I'll be more careful. 




 I think it's always a matter for public concern when an elected official has so little understanding of freedom of speech.

Also, this particular newspaper has historically banned reporters from using words as inoffensive as "vomit" -- the preferred usage as late as the early 2000s was "sick to one's stomach". So when things  in county government heat up like this, it's fun to see them struggle.  









 You're not "retarded" -- that's a completely offensive usage -- you're lazy. If you can't be bothered to do the most basic review of the largest collection of articles about this subject anywhere on reddit, why should someone else be expected to chew your food for you and hand it to you on a silver spoon? 




 There is no universe in which Joe Biden could ever be called a nonentity.

If you doubt that, you can see the Grucci standard at work in the NYC and Boston displays on TV tonight. 




 Also possible: the fireworks technicians may have a higher-paying job for a bigger city tomorrow night. In the northeast when I was growing up, we were always aware of which fireworks display company was working which night for what city. I don't know anything about that scene in Ohio.

 Why don't you read the comments before posting? It's been made abundantly clear that the OP is the photographer, that this happened at a progressive festival where everybody except the preacher was celebrating the SCOTUS decision, and that many people in this thread were also there.

Meanwhile: Mennonites are cool. There are many here, active in peace work. 




  This wasn't a political event, it's an annual music festival. 

Well, actually it is a *very* political event, because [Community Festival is all about promoting progressive politics](http://www.comfest.com/purpose.php) including, prominently, gay rights. But it's a celebration of those politics, and the anti-gay jerk was only there at all because he has a constitutional right to speak and a habit of suing over that. 




  I wouldn't take my kid at that girl's age to either event

That's your choice, because it's your family. But plenty of other families are built differently, on the belief that it's better to encounter and explain difference and diversity than to pretend children can be "protected" from things that require the parents to think hard and talk carefully. For those parents, and there are more of them every day, Community Festival *is* family friendly.

Adding, people who love to hate ComFest keep circulating claims about degenerate activities happening there that nobody who works the entire fest every year has *ever* encountered. Remember, organizers have to answer to the CPD, the neighbors and the insurance company, so we log every single bad incident and discuss them all in a public meeting. 

There are always a lot of rumors floating around, but the malicious lies are just ridiculous. If even 0.01% of them were true, the City would never let the festival happen. Instead, what happens is that police officers compete for a chance to work the fest, because *this is the safest event of its size in central Ohio*. 

Maybe it's time to pick a target for your rage that is actually guilty of something you can document.

  Its definitely not a "family festival" as some want you to believe

Tell that to the hundreds of families bring their kids to ComFest every year and rave about it.  Your view is obviously based on rumor and never exploring the whole fest.

Community Festival has a hugely popular KidsART program, which begins with kids designing entries for a contest to choose their own version of the official volunteer T-shirt (the design this year was awesome). Older children teach younger kids to make tie-dye; musicians teach songs and  how to play instruments, and the ComFest Museum exhibit is always packed with wide-eyed kids listening to docents.

You should come back next year with an open mind. You'll eat your words, no doubt about it.

 You think *you're* disgusted by the change? Ask anybody who was old enough to see the previous tenant evicted. [Tradewinds](http://www.columbusart.com/artscene/tradewinds.html) was the original campus area source for all those things plus import clothing and furnishings, gifts and alternative reading, from underground comics to underground newspapers. Both ComFest and the Columbus Free Press (in its earlier, saner incarnation) had deep roots in Tradewinds, whose female owners made all kinds of of street people, marginal characters, rebels and goofballs feel welcome. The demise of Tradewinds was considered by many area residents as the last straw in the University Partners takeover, the end of an era of independent shops along High near OSU. Students now can't begin to imagine what a  vibrant, creative scene existed there, and it's a damn shame.  




 Okay, the day of the week thing cinches it. The year not appearing on the leaflet itself is actually pretty common for the mid-70s. I still recall a fairly large demo for which the first print run failed to include any date at all -- it's hard now to imagine being so wrapped up in the moment and the issue that one could make such a mistake, but it happened a lot in the heat of the times.

Thanks for making the effort to sort out my confusion about this one. 




 Yes, I saw that -- but that's for a different leaflet, about a campaign that went on for many years. And it includes the kind of design and production that jibes with 1976, which is noticeably different from those in the OP's linked poster. YAWF always had a very recognizable graphic style, which became more sophisticated as they went along. The OP's link shows the later style with less text and larger graphics, but retains the use of Cooper Black typeface, so it can't be *very* far into the 80s, but I still think this is a later piece from the same campaign, not one from the first year of the campaign.

Of course, the simplest thing to do would be to ask the organization itself, which still exists as [The Party for Liberation and Socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_for_Socialism_and_Liberation) -- or better yet, ask some of the people involved at that time. Trying to figure things like this out without the participation of the people who were there at the time is just silly. This isn't really ancient history, and they're a great living resource. 




 How are you getting 1976 from this? The politics and design look more like early 80s.

 I'm sorry to seem rude, but I have to ask: if you know so little about the region and its people that you have to throw this very basic question out to a bunch of strangers, what makes you qualified to write for publication on this subject? Do you have any idea how many books are published every year on this subject by people with deep, longstanding ties to the subject? I'm guessing not, because you haven't cited any of them, including the ones that list the very info you seek here.

As an editor, I would turn down this pitch in a New York second. Unless this is headed for a vanity press (where the author pays the publisher), I don't see any book that starts out this way being publishable.

 The FBI and DoJ distinction between homegrown and domestic terrorism is a political creation and should be ended. The homegrown classification locates Muslims as foreign agents operating in the U.S., not as part of the social fabric of this country. The portrayal of U.S. Muslims as potential or actual representatives of global jihad is used to justify the denial of constitutional protections and leads to representing ordinary menasking religious questions, criticizing the U.S. government, or even going camping with their friendsas a threat to society. It is past time to apply the same constitutional protections to everyone, and develop a response to terrorism based in analysis of patterns of violence instead of political costs and benefits.

You don't like ComFest. We get it. Stop reaching so far for "reasons" and just plan something else for that weekend. 




 And of course *that* will never happen again. 




 (1) it was removed, which I as OP don't mind at all because  
(2) that headline is actually from a completely different article -- the one I was trying to post when something went wrong and I didn't catch it until this morning, after the post had been removed. 
























  Did you know Robert Lawson?

Yes. He was a sweetheart. He is missed. 



















 less reported on since 9/11

That's because the working federal definition of terrorism was reworked twice since then, and for most of that time domestic terrorism was not so defined, nor an enforcement priority. Events have required a course correction, and it now is recognized for what it always has been. 









 Where do you draw the line? If you don't speak up about planned crimes against property, do you also stay silent in the face of planned  crimes against persons?  




 If it's a permit area, residents can call to have those cars towed. If it's not a permit area, why haven't residents tried to get that designation? 

In any case, vandalism against cars legally parked on a public street is not the answer. I hope you pushed back when told about this plan. 




 You're welcome to try that notion out on the Joint Terrorism Task Force, which does regard this type of crime as terrorism. 




  This was a lone wolf type of crime, not a group or movement

"Lone wolf" crimes committed by white supremacists absolutely are part of a movement. This tactic was popularized by KKK leader Louis Beam in the 1980s as an extension of the "leaderless resistance" strategy proposed in the 1960s by Col. Ulius Louis Amoss to fight the alleged communist takeover of the US. In recent years the term has been extended almost beyond meaning by sloppy use in the popular press. But it is understood both by its adherents and by anti-terrorism LEOs as meaning exactly what it always meant: a paper-thin veneer of "plausible deniability" meant to conceal the existence of a white supremacist movement waging war on democratic rights.

Thre is a ton of material available online about this, but [here's a primer](http://www.publiceye.org/liberty/terrorism/insurgency/leaderless-resistance.html). 




 Some things to keep in mind: there are multiple agencies involved in policing this event, not all of which are willing to meet with organizers in advance, not all of which have the same priorities about what to police. Big props are due to the CPD, who overall do a great job. Last year, there was miscommunication about how to close in the middle of a downpour, complicated by a rumor (untrue) that an officer had been attacked. That won't happen again.

Also, remember that most of these citations and arrests are for really egregious violations of state laws, and many are for illegal drinking.
On the numbers *and* in the view of police, ComFest is consistently one of the safest major public events in Columbus. 

Those who are seriously concerned about policing should come to the Solar Stage at 4:55 PM Saturday for a workshop on police accountability, featuring organizers of the campaign for a civilian review board along with several attorneys who have spent decades representing victims of police misconduct -- and a retired CPD officer with long experience at ComFest. 




 You clearly have no idea how much money and hard work the festival organization does in Goodale Park -- planting trees, flowers and grass; upgrading the electric grid; helping to pay for bike stands and the fountain, etc. The park wouldn't be half as nice if ComFest hadn't spent the last 34 years working on it. Ask Friends Of Goodale Park if they want it gone. Ask any of the business groups in the area if they want it gone. 

Every year, the festival organizers have to get local residents to sign off on the permit -- and what that shows is that your opinion is in the tiny minority of whiners; most local residents love the fest.  




 If you didn't want to live in the prime entertainment district of a boomtown, why did you move there? This is like moving to the countryside, then complaining that farmers start their tractors at 4 AM.

 




 I gather you've never been stalked. 














 As long as they don't hire [Ethan Roeder](http://www.buzzfeed.com/evanmcsan/new-organizing-institute-implodes#.dbKw6ZY88), we're good.

 Nor you. 




 No, every newspaper gets that sort of complaints from readers. Most major dailies don't answer such crank complaints in front of the whole readership, under the editor's name, on the front page of the second section, week after week after week. This column has been an embarrassment for the Dispatch for years -- it makes the paper sound like a small town weekly, and shows Marrison as unbelievably thin-skinned.

The new editor, Alan Miller, may not continue this tradition, but brings other baggage. He's  a careerist, and so insecure that he once used his position as head of the Ohio Legislative Correspondents Association to ban reporters from alternative weeklies  -- who had been eating the Dispatch's lunch at professional awards ceremonies -- from the Statehouse press room.

We're farther than ever from having the paper Columbus needs.  




 You're kidding, right? The biggest offsite viewing area for RWB is Goodale Park, and every year the crowds leave literally tons of trash when they depart. If you never noticed that, it's because for many years ComFest volunteers did the cleanup for that, too. 
 




 Before you take the word of the single most negative troll in this subreddit, do yourself a favor and read about Community Festival. 

This is the fest that has won so many awards for "best festival in central Ohio" that the paid staff of other fests joke about giving ComFest an all-time award and taking it out of contention just to give others a chance. It's the fest that annually motivates 1,700 volunteers to work for free running six stages with over 250 performances and workshops. It's the organization that gives thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours of labor to keep Goodale Park green and blooming, and leaves the park pristine when the fest is over (unlike virtually every other festival in town). These are the folks who take nothing for themselves but give back profits from the event as grants to dozens of community organizations. 

You can read what the organization does,and why, at [the ComFest website](http://comfest.com), and find plenty of praise for the event just by searching for past news coverage. But the best way to learn how wrong the OP is would be to just come on down to this free event next weekend. You can find all the details about transportation, hours, performances, etc in the [2015 Community Festival Program Guide](http://www.comfest.com/program-guide.php), and read about the fest's history in the [40th anniversary commemorative book published in 2012](http://athensmessenger.com/app/emag/ComfestXL/ComfestXL.swf).

EDIT: removed true but tangential statement about OP in order to keep the focus where it belongs. 




  I equally hate Red, White and Boom

We'll be waiting for your preview hate post on that one. 




 I have no idea why you think this article was written by me. Considering that I found it on your Twitter account, I would think you knew better.

As for "not appropriate" -- this is the kind of essay that keeps people going when it seems like the task is too big. But it's your decision.  





























 What a great photo! Thanks for sharing. Dos he have a name yet? 









 There's one red flag that should have stopped anybody who looked at the website in their tracks: No Board of Directors is listed. This is the fastest shortcut to figuring out who's behind a new organization, and  in this case it just isn't there.

This group is doing most of their outreach through Facebook, where they ask for signatures on on after another "petition", "birthday card" or "thank you message". Given all the evidence, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that this is primarily a list-building operation, not an activist group.   









 I experienced a good illustration of how powerful muscle memory can be when I went to the Post Office recently to pick up mail from a box that I use only once a year (other folks in the same org use it the rest of the time): I didn't have the box number with me, so I just stood approximately where I remembered standing last year and *automatically* put the key into the right lock on the first try. I only thought to try that because I'd just seen some TV rerun in which a person who couldn't remember his name was handed a pen and paper and asked to sign his name. 

Muscle memory is real, and powerful, and weird.  




 What is your problem? 




 Say what?

 It sounds like he's annoyed that you're brushing him while he's eating. Both of those activities are pleasurable, but together they may be just too much stimulation.

 You talk about *watching* and *witnessing* what goes on -- how about that other choice, to work to improve the culture of the site? 




 One thing  you can do to help them get adopted is to take LOTS of pictures, especially portraits of the individual kittens. Then circulate those, relentlessly, as the kittens grow up. With luck you'll have a "reservation" for each kitten before they're old enough to leave mom -- and you'll be able to relive their kittenhood again and again, without the hassle. 




  I'm tired of reddit being not much more than circlejerks, memes, and advertising. 

It isn't that, if you choose your subscriptions carefully and avoid most of the defaults -- especially /r/all. If you do it right, reading your own front page plus your "friends" page can be amazing and not at all annoying. 




 Yes, that was 2010. The link I gave is *five years later* -- five critical growth years for Columbus. But even if there had been no change, 5.6% is not insignificant. The Dispatch thought this was an audience segment worth catering to; the fact that they did it so badly as to be unsustainable doesn't undercut the segment's growing importance.  




 I love the fact that sane redditors don't know about the "huge storm" raging in /r/all and some default reddits. This is about the admins' decision to ban subreddits like /r/FatPeopleHate whose subscribers had been taking their hate outside their home cesspool and going around to brigade other reddits. Since it's June, and millions of  teenage redditors have nothing better to do, they decided this was an unconscionable betrayal of reddit's supposed function as a free speech forum, and issued a call to arms against the admins. When nobody answered, they announced a mass exodus to voat. 

The only people who noticed were clickbait parasites like DailyDot and the British tabloids, who don't even know how the site works. It's been a bit more hilarious than the usual June reddit freakout. 




 It's not a meetup, but if he wants to meet more paramedics he might want to spend part of the weekend of June 26-28 volunteering for First Aid at Community Festival.  For volunteers, they need people with current certification in 1st Aid and CPR, or who have equivalent or superior certification  /or training  /or professional experience. 

It's a great way to meet people. The main First Aid station is located in the center of the park, so he'd get to talk to all sorts of people passing by, not just the sick ones. Every shift includes Fire/EMS workers, so that's another bunch of folks to meet. And when he gets off his 4-hour shift, he's already in the middle of the city's best party!

[Franklin comes in first among all Ohio counties for gaining the greatest number of ... Hispanic residents.](http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2014/06/26/hispanics-lead-state-population-increases.html)

 




 No, but I hear absolutely *dozens* of teenagers have done so.  




 Every single one of those incidents put SAR rangers in danger, and everybody involved -- at all the parks -- is grateful for anything that might reduce this unnecessary risk. If you've never read it, [this book](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/ranger-confidential-andrea-lankford/1110833684?ean=9780762752638) can help understand what it's like to be on the other side of dealing with this "statistically insignificant minority" of hikers. 




  If you can't score a permit for the main corridor campgrounds you could also try to get a permit for one of the other camping areas on other less popular trails that head down into the canyon.

This is not a good idea for any first-timer, let alone one who hasn't managed to locate the basic info about the Canyon. You correctly hiked the corridor trails, which should be the first step for any hiker.

Also, a lot has changed since 2008, including very prominently the demand for permits and the system for getting them. The increase in visitors is qualitative, with people showing up by the dozens or even hundreds to hike or run the corridor. There is so much demand now that there is serious consideration being given to instituting fees for every hiker who steps below the rim, whether they camp overnight or not. 

The answer to this is not for first-timers to try even the easiest of the lesser-known, less populated trails.  




 Nope. This particular group is so inept that their "secret" backing was exposed long before I encountered them.  




 I think I speak for many here when I say, "Wait -- Columbus has a *flag?*"  




 Just don't go getting involved with the GoTopless group -- they're a front for the [Raelian UFO cult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra%C3%ABlism).  




 Yes, you need a permit, and no, you don't have much chance of getting one at this point. Permits for October (a prime weather time) are already gone, having been grabbed up a month ago. There is a slight possibility that you could catch a cancellation, but you're going to be doing the corridor, and those are the most popular sites, so it's a very, very slight chance.

I'd offer more hope, but frankly it doesn't sound like you've done much thinking or research about this. How hard can it be to read the official website for the park, where all this is laid out in user-friendly fashion? I'm sorry to sound harsh, but what you're talking about is not a stroll in the park.

Go read the official website and check out kaibab.org, then come back and tell us more about your level of fitness, backpacking experience, etc. Then we can help you. 
 




 Yep: they're the problem, and the proof that no amount of signage or literature *at the site* makes much of a difference. They're why NPS initiated a whole new job category: *Preventive* Search and Rescue. These are the folks who stand at the trailhead and try to convince unprepared hikers to rethink. But even they have only limited success, and they don't have the legal ability to stop anybody, even the most unprepared. All they can do is try to talk these folks out of going ahead, thanks to some jerk who litigated for the right to be stupid. That's why I'm always happy to see any article that might cut down, even slightly, on the number of preventable tragedies.   




 Okay, that explains it. I've never used AdBlock. I just got in the habit of ignoring ads 20 years ago, so never saw the need for it. 




 Thanks for the reply. I thought you were saying the article was unnecessary. I'm happy to be wrong about that.  




 Can we see a picture of Patches? 




 Er, Charlie is a female ....? 




 Your premise is deeply flawed, so it's really not possible to answer. Some people don't like jazz, just as some people don't like rock or hiphop or classical music. But there's no evidence of any large number of people who *hate* jazz. The account you linked to seems designed to troll, for what reason nobody knows. In any case, that's one person,not a trend. 




  Nobody is experienced at this without first being one of the inexperienced nitwits. 

Not every first timer is a nitwit. Some take the time to read about what they plan to do, and ask those more experienced. Just because this mass audience article doesn't speak to you doesn't mean that it won't speak to others who would otherwise have continued as nitwits.

After 20 years hiking GCNP, I'm always glad to see this kind of preventive outreach, no matter how clumsy the style. *Any* such effort beats having to intercept unprepared hikers at the trailhead to try to convince them not to go ahead on a hike that *will* result in having to send SAR after them later. 




 No, it's not. 




 Outside the newsroom, Mr. Carroll was an eloquent and unapologetic defender of the ideals of journalism at a time of revolutionary change in the media industry. He saw editors and reporters almost as public servants and a free press as essential to a self-governing nation. In recent years, he watched with growing concern as the changing dynamics of the news business threatened basic journalistic values like deep reporting and patient persistence  rock-turning, as he called it.

Todays journalists are constantly being reminded that they are functionaries of business, yet they know in their hearts that the stock price is a hollow god, Mr. Carroll said in accepting the National Press Foundations Editor of the Year award in 1998. They sense that newspaper work can, and should, be a wonderfully satisfying and entertaining way to engage the world, and that in a free society there is no mightier sword than the written word.

 If you're going to be concerned about human trafficking, it's a good idea to double check any stats you read. The overwhelming majority of humans trafficked are *not* sex workers but agricultural, industrial or domestic workers. The reason you see so much about sex trafficking (which is a real but much smaller problem) is because the loudest voices on this are evangelical Christian groups that frame the issue in ways that serve their mission. Some of these evangelical groups write about the issue in a way that intentionally blurs a reader's understanding of which numbers are for all trafficking and which are for sex trafficking

Most NGOs working on the issue of human trafficking reject the model used by these groups, which focus on "rescue" of individuals (almost always women) rather than focusing on changing the economic inequality that forces people into sexual [or other] slavery. 

So please take this *whole* issue as seriously as it deserves, and be sure to read the critiques of those who were working on the big picture before American evangelicals saw their opportunity to use this one aspect to raise money and recruit well-intentioned suburban teenagers.

Note that all polling figures are from *before* the current controversy; current opinion is even more one-sided. 




 It wasn't necessary to be shopping for western wear to see that emblem all over that extremely visible prime shopping location -- it required only being moderately observant.

And I've met a *lot* of people who frequent this sub, all of them white. I'm aware of a couple of local redditors who are not, but -- seriously -- have you looked at photos of the Columbus Global reddit met-up over the years? Anyway, the assessment was based on what they just said here, not some baseless supposition. 




 I assumed that as soon as I saw the claim came from Pamela Geller. 




 It's implicit in every one of those statements, and not seeing that must require a huge effort -- mostly consisting of ignoring the opinion of people of color.  




 It has always been a big deal to millions of people, most of them not white, all of them better educated than those who insist this was just a matter of "heritage" and "honor". And the only people freaking out now are hard core reactionaries -- the overwhelming public reaction has been simply "It's about damn time". 




 It definitely was sold there, at the western wear stand on the southeast corner of 17th and the main pedestrian boulevard, across from Brown Arena. 

The fact that so many people here don't remember seeing this hateful emblem for sale there is testament to how cavalier white society got about its continued use -- and also likely due to how overwhelmingly white the user base for /r/Columbus is.  




 No -- the comment you replied to was the one I was referring to. I doubt that he'll see your cautions, however, since he's already said this was a throwaway that he created for this use and then forgot about.

 Um, you do realize that it's been 70 years now since the CIO merged with the AFL, right? What you laid out here is a distinction that hasn't had any legal meaning since 1955, although I'm guessing it's still the entirety of what many textbooks still assert.

**tl;dr** All trade unions are labor unions. There are differences in how various unions are structured (and more so every day), but all are governed by the same laws and consider each other equal partners in the struggle for workers' rights and dignity. The claim that they are "two completely separate things" is simply wrong.

 Glad to see it get more eyeballs on it, but as expected that turns out to be the SPLC map.

  At this point I stopped caring,

Yeah, no. From the tone of your comments, you stopped caring before you started this discussion. I'm a mod elsewhere, so I know how to deal with users who break the rules. You completely failed to cushion your explanation with compassion -- and instead, accused the OP of "ignoring" you when she was merely pointing to how confusing this rule can be even when the user is not dealing with shock and grief.

 I'm sorry for your loss, but that's not going to happen. 

The vet most likely had a legal obligation to treat any rabid animal the way she did Jiggie, and you could offer no assurance that it couldn't possibly be rabies, because you had allowed Jiggie to run loose. 

Some jurisdictions will allow a possibly rabid animal to live through a waiting period rather than kill it and dissect the brain (the only conclusive test), but even if your town allows this it won't matter because suing over veterinary care is something only a very wealthy person even *can* do.

The vet you went to lacks people skills, but suing won't change anything. Please just concentrate on remembering Jiggie at her strongest and best.

 Yes, because reddit is literally the government. 




 It wasn't a police brutality protest, although many of those people are also involved in that work.

The event today was [the Ohio Student Association](http://www.ohiostudentassociation.org/end_zero_tolerance) statewide protest about zero-tolerance school discipline policies. The press advisory explaining the goals of the  demonstration is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DdXbYlyHXnUwYTj08oRvvF0nD5RR6VX43XnXLqhD2wY/edit?pli=1). It will be interesting to see how this is covered on the 6:00 local news; at noon Ch. 4 managed to cover a different story from across the street from the education Department and the OSA demo was so loud it was hard to hear the reporter -- but they had no coverage of this event.

OSA is a relatively new but very impressive organization. It's part of [the Ohio Organizing Collaborative](http://www.ohorganizing.org/) which has member groups (including unions) all over the state, and an innovative approach to organizing that mobilizes and trains young people to be effective leaders in various reform struggles, including elimination of student debt.

For these reasons and more, OSA was voted the Community Festival Honored Community Organization for 2015 -- see page 15 [here](http://apgmediaofohio.com/emags/Comfest2015/index.html). 




 As one who just yesterday was [very negative about a superficially similar pitch for funds](https://www.reddit.com/r/ColumbusSocial/comments/3d9iom/help_prevent_a_homeless_veteran_from_ending_up_on/), I have to say that Star House is a worthy charity that *should* be supported. I wish their IndieGogo page had  included a link to their website, where the [archive of news articles](http://www.osustarhouse.com/News-and-Events/News.aspx) makes it very clear how necessary and good their work is AND why they had to turn to crowdfunding.

Adding, a good friend who works there brought some of these kids to work volunteer shifts at ComFest, and they did an outstanding job.   




 You should go back and see what OP said when he finally came back to this post. 




 Fire codes for residential buildings generally forbid accumulating large quantities of fuel.

Adding,common sense should stop you before that ...

 




 /r/worldnews has a HUGE volume of submissions, and in the context of *real* world news, this is not a topic that deserves space here.

 




 What kids these days don't have to put up with, and don't even appreciate the change: those crank handles for the windows, that somehow always gouged one partner in the back at exactly the wrong moment.  




 But *that* topic (news about reddit) doesn't belong *here*, which is why it has now been removed. 




 If she hasn't been to a vet, please take her for blood and other tests. She could be just finicky  -- my elder kitty values variety above flavor -- but it could also be something like kidney failure causing the anorexia and vomiting. (Adding, kidney failure is very treatable.) Your vet may prescribe one of the prescription varieties of Hill's.

FWIW, Friskies just introduced [a new dry kibble for sensitive stomachs.](http://www.petsmart.com/food-health/dry-food/purina-cat-chow-gentle-digestive-care-adult-cat-food-zid36-27685/cat-36-catid-200028;pgid=xpt4KH2GThxSRpgM1MAGIo1S00002POGOREb;sid=chGO33LBzjCP3ydn8OPM20DLvc8cExto62m3SZDk?var_id=36-27685 _t=pfm%3Dsearch) 




 ... and in the same week, Ohio re-upped for another Aramark prison contract, despite having had the actual maggots.

 Thanks for this post about an important political issue. Now, will it get deleted because it's not about the horse race between two particular candidates?  




 You're right, according to usual practice of the mods here. They must not be paying attention. Did you report it? I did, but the more reports, the more likely it will get dealt with. 




 It's not that. It's because there's an entire reddit for this subject: /r/redditinthenews

 Erma Bombeck was a national treasure, and I'd say she *did* use everything she was given, much of it to make the rest of us laugh. One of my favorite [quotes](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/e/erma_bombeck.html):

My theory on housework is, if the item doesn't multiply, smell, catch fire, or block the refrigerator door, let it be. No one else cares. Why should you?
 









 I just wondered because someone here might want to adopt one of these cuties! 




 Where is this shelter? 




 Cat feces should *not* smell so bad as that. If they do, something is wrong. I live with five cats, and only illness or bad food makes the task really unpleasant.

 I wouldn't give money to this nonprofit, and -- speaking as a nonprofit administrator --  I would not recommend to anyone that they do, either. 

In the first place, there's no evidence that this IS a non-profit, aside from OP's assertion. There's no website, no link to evidence of an IRS charter or even sponsorship by an existing 501(c)(3), no board of directors. Not only is there absolutely nothing to inspire confidence, but there's one huge red flag: the most developed post on the FB page is a series of photos of a particular old mansion these folks propose to "fix up for transitional housing" -- this from people who admit elsewhere that they have no idea beyond bake sales for fundraising.

And all that is just from looking at the material OP presented to *this* reddit. [The most compelling reasons why no one should give money to this group are in the answers to the disturbingly basic question the OP raised over at /r/nonprofit.](https://np.reddit.com/r/nonprofit/comments/3d9m83/struggling_college_student_executive_director_of/)

OP, I think you're probably sincere. But *you need to listen* to those folks. If you really want to help, be humble enough to volunteer for the established groups already working on these issues, and learn all the things that go into nonprofit work.

 You could be right about him being an alien. Here's how to be sure: holding Cheese with his face toward you, flatten his ears back and examine the resulting visage.

Just treat him like a cat; he'll do fine. 




 Does OP have any story to go with this?

And BTW, where is it still snowing? 




 Thank *you* for a thread that inspired me to upvote every top level comment except one troll!  




 What did you expect? [It's July sweeps.](http://www.tvjobs.com/sweeps.htm) 




 You should check out [The Boathouse](http://www.boathouserestaurantoh.com/events). The view of downtown Columbus will knock your guests' socks off, and their catering seems to be very flexible in terms of price.  I've attended a high-end wedding reception there, but also several events for thrifty non-profits like [Simply Living](http://www.simplyliving.org/) and [Community Festival](http://www.simplyliving.org/), and the food/service were always good.

  they're a whole lot better than other major concessions companies like Xanterra and Deleware North, both of which have awful reputations amongst seasonal employees.

However, both of those companies have better *customer* reviews.  




 That "family budget" model of thinking about the national economy is the biggest damn zombie lie in the whole argument. Does your family have the ability to regulate industry and commerce, and print money? Mine doesn't. 




 Yes. 




 I was the first commenter, and I also assumed eviction (see previous comment). I'm sorry now that I didn't stop to think how many other ways a family can become homeless, because I certainly didn't mean to make all of this harder.

I hope things are coming together for your friends.  




  When my dentist did my wisdoms they offered to set me up on a caresource(?) card.

That was probably [Care Credit](http://www.carecredit.com/), a healthcare-specific finance company that covers everything from dental to dogs. I think the plan you were offered is just one of many.

Adding a reminder that OSU has *three levels* of dental clinics, from student practitioners to interns to faculty, depending on how much the patient can pay.

 




 Amen. This is Rule One.

In this case, they left general info, but because it was not a National Park they were not required to leave an exact itinerary with Rangers. Then they took one wrong turn (despite using a good map and having skills), which led to another, which led to another ... 

... and then they did the absolute *right* thing: stop, stay together, make themselves visible from the air, ration their food. I think folks in other parts of the country who over-blame these hikers are failing to understand how difficult S R work is in terrain like Bridger-Teton. Much of the time they were missing was taken up by searchers even getting to that quadrant to start looking.

  And that's was the point from the beginning. 

Are you saying you think Bernie Sanders is a tool?  




 You jest, but it *is* serious business for rescue orgs, which have to scratch for every penny -- and a link to the original video would have offered the option to donate to the group that made folks here smile by rescuing those puppies.

/u/GallowBoob has explained his reasoning (users might be less likely to click a YouTube link than an imgur link); accepted the criticism that posting the gif could leave out critical info; and said he will post the original video link in the comments from now on. So it was worth a bit of conversation.  




 As I said originally:  

...this consequence of keeping info about rescue orgs from people who could support them...

/u/Gallowboob has accepted the criticism and says he will now post links to the  original video in the comments.
 




 That's a reasonable explanation, and a workable solution. Thank you. I'm looking forward to going back to upvoting you all over the place, as before. 




 He had not yet replied at the time I posted that comment -- and if you read his comment, he says that someone else did it for him. He didn't look it up himself, which takes all of about a minute.

I don't hate /u/GallowBoob or have it in for him. I just asked him to try harder to do better on sourcing. When he does that I'll *go back to* upvoting him.  




 RTFC.  




  weird vendetta 

That's not fair. I explained clearly that it's about cutting people off from info about the group that did the rescue work and are actively seeking donations at the YouTube sitefor the full video. 




 [He just can't be bothered.](https://np.reddit.com/r/HumansBeingBros/comments/3cxekg/rescuing_a_homeless_dog_family_from_under_a_house/cszulpc) 




 First thing is to call the Coalition for the Homeless'  24-hour Family Center Hotline: (614) 253-7970 to find emergency shelter. 

Starting Monday they should contact the [Ohio Benefits Bank](http://www.ohiobenefits.org/) for help with food assistance (food stamps), if they don't already receive them.

You're a good friend for doing this.  




 You can, you just don't bother to try. Now that the consequences have been spelled out, will you try harder? 




 [Yes, and it's not a harmless one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HumansBeingBros/comments/3cxekg/rescuing_a_homeless_dog_family_from_under_a_house/cszy08b) 




 Thank you for the full video link, which is what should have been posted in the first place.

The full video comes with full info, like where this happened, what *organization* (not random individuals) did the rescue, what happened to the puppies, and how to get in touch if you want to give the mama a home or donate money to this good work. All that got lost when the OP chose to snag this clip rather than go look for the whole thing.

The OP, of course, is /u/GallowBoob, who does this *all the time*. [I called him on it last week and he immediately deleted the post in question rather than let the criticism stand.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HumansBeingBros/comments/3cg3s7/the_dog_who_fell_in_tar/csv68rk)

I used to just ignore the complaints about his karma-whoring, but this consequence of keeping info about rescue orgs from people who could support them has put me on the warpath about sourcing. It's just not that hard, and it really matters. 




 What, exactly, are they looking for? Temporary housing, or what?

Adding, this general question, having to be asked by a third party *on a Saturday*, is a nightmare. One has to wonder: how did they come to be evicted -- under a law that requires plenty of notice -- without having explored options for themselves? I'm not blaming them. I've watched folks nearing the bottom of their resources go into a glazed state and so fail to ask for help in a timely way. It just hurts to watch, every time.

Anyway, tell us more specifics, and maybe someone here can offer specific help.     














 What's your basis for saying this? Do you know them personally? Just getting lost doesn't mean they were unprepared (unless that now means failure to carry a sat phone or avalanche beacon). 

Even the most experienced backpackers sometimes get lost, even with map and compass. And this was Bridger-Teton, FFS.  




 You may be thinking of [Durgin-Park](http://www.bostoncentral.com/restaurants/durgin_park/p20.php), a Boston restaurant famous for two things: roast beef and "sharp-tongued" waitresses who are *supposed* to be impatient and rude. I haven't been there for many years, but the food was totally worth the long wait and the attitude.  




 Bouzaglo says the decision to sell has nothing to do with lingering publicity from the show.

Still as honest as ever ... 

Don't miss the video clip in the sidebar about them chasing some guy out of the restaurant at knifepoint. I'm sure that had nothing to do with the decision to sell, either. 




 Not from reddit. From Twitter. Are you still mad?

 U.S. newsrooms have shed more than 20,000 in the last 10 years

 They certainly don't belong here, in a reddit where the rules clearly state  

Please do not submit news, especially not to start a debate. Submissions should be a great read above anything else.

OP, you even tried to pick a fight by changing the headline. Reddit isn't  in a "struggle to stay afloat" -- if you think so, you need to get outside the self-involved bubble of the relative handful of users shouting about this. 




 I'd join his campaign if I hadn't already committed to Bernie -- but how can anyone write an article about nonhuman candidates without a photo of [Pigasus?](https://craigsfire.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/picture-1.png) 




 I assume by "hate water" you mean they hate being wet -- but *drinking* enough water is the main thing you have to watch for. If one (esp. the elder kitty) isn't drinking enough, make sure s/he gets wet food with added water, or gravy. You could also brush them to remove extra fur (and show them you care).

Both of them should be fine, if cranky, unless the temps get to triple digits.  




 This is an interesting article, but it appears to have been lifted entirely from [this much more serious site](http://www.blackpast.org/aah/white-walter-f-1893-1955) and reposted on what's apparently a clickbait site, with the added insult that the "rewindingbalck.com" version actually *claims copyright* on the plagiarized text.

Thanks to the OP for posting -- but next time, may be you could check the source a bit more. 




 I think you're right! Your comment reminds me of my favorite quote from the writer who created your alter ego:  

["Get it right or let it alone. The conclusion you jump to may be your own."](http://www.gutenberg.ca/ebooks/thurberj-furtherfablesforourtime/thurberj-furtherfablesforourtime-00-h-dir/thurberj-furtherfablesforourtime-00-h.html) 




 That's not the worst way to go through life, actually ... 




 Ask local rescue groups as well as your local reddit for recommendations. Call ahead and talk to the receptionist -- this person's attitude will tell you a lot about whether this practice is the on for you. And wherever you wind up going, tell the doctor upfront that you have limited funds and want to know how much each step of assessment and care will cost *before* they start into it. 




 [Care Credit](http://www.carecredit.com/) may work for you. Have you specifically searched for low-cost vets in your area? You could ask your local reddit for suggestions. 




 A good article, but the headline makes it sound more crass than it really is. The money the author spent was shocking to her *in retrospect*, but it's clear that she was deciding on the basis of love (as she understood it then) as things went along and only noticing the financial cost later ... when she also belatedly recognized the cost in pain these treatments caused Kitty, and admitted having prioritized her own feelings above Kitty's well-being.

The decision to euthanize a beloved pet is always agonizing, and this author seems to have arrived at a better than average standard for making such decisions. Thanks to the OP for sharing that, and for opening up this discussion here. 




  I wonder if vets would allow me to post on their boards even if I'm not a customer? 

Yes, they probably will. As for places that will take 6 cats: probably no landlord will go for this. And that's why millions of renters lie about how many cats they have. As long as your rent is paid on time, and the cats aren't stinky or noisy, most landlords will choose an otherwise good tenant over the hassle of eviction and starting over to find a new tenant. I do think 6 in an apartment is probably too many for their sake, but if you haven't re-homed some/all of them by the time you move maybe you can keep them while you continue to look for new homes.

Offering one cat at a time really is best. Include some details about the cat's personality: what kind of toys it likes, what silly things it does, how it interacts with others, etc. Emphasize that there is a deadline (even if it's not firm) and that you're being slightly picky about who you'll allow to have your kitty. People are more likely to respond to the implied challenge of "are you good enough to adopt this particular wonderful cat?" than they are to the implied carelessness of "I've got too many cats -- want one?" 

Good luck!
 




 This sophistry is so far from "best of" material that OP should be thoroughly embarrassed to have submitted it here. 




 Kittens are adorable just the way they are.  




 It didn't burn down, it just got so decrepit as to be dangerously unusable. [It was closed in 1968 and torn down in 1971.](https://library.osu.edu/blogs/archives/2011/08/23/original-university-hall-razed-40-years-ago-today/) I've only gone in there once since, but I'm guessing they did not rebuild the old Green Room in the basement, because that's when they built the theater in the Drake Union to replace the one in U Hall.  




 OP isn't looking for a whole house, but rather an apartment in a big house that has been split into apartments. 




 Columbus doesn't have a lot of what you're talking about, except in the OSU area. What we do have is a lot of duplexes -- so that may be a term you want to look for. 




 Buying boots this close to the hike is not a good idea: they could not possibly be broken in before you start. OTOH, sneakers won't cut it. You should immediately buy a pair of trail runners or lowcut hiking shoes -- something that has serious tread and arch/ankle support, but will break in fast. Merrell has some shoes that don't require long break-in; Hi-Tec specializes in shoes that are wearable right out of the box (but don't last for as long as others).

More important is that this question raises another question: whether you've bitten off more than you can chew here. How accustomed are you to long-distance hiking? How strong are your knees? Have you backpacked much? Do you live at sea level? All of these questions are important, and if you give us more detail we can give you more help.

Two points that will help, no matter what your experience:  
(1) remember to cut your toenails before starting out; and
(2) you can make the whole trip easier by sending your pack and tent down and up again by mule. It costs $68.42 each way and is totally worth it. If you decide to use the [mule duffel service](http://www.grandcanyonlodges.com/lodging/phantom-ranch/duffel-services/) just on way, make it the downhill trip. That's much harder than the uphill, especially if you're going down the Kaibab and up BA. 

  




 That's a natural reaction, but I always have a second thought as well: a place this beautiful should never be the private property of any person, but should be available for everyone to share. 

Maybe that's because I grew up in [Connecticut, where the entire seashore is essentially privatized.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMS-EfcWrSw)  









 Nope. 




 I never offered an example. You're confusing me with another commenter, which happens when you're in too much of hurry -- much like the original problem, which was your failure to specify that you meant "the world's first (*major*) non-non opiate pain med". If you go back and read only the exchange between you and me, you can see where you started responding to the wrong person.  




 Link and Hagrid are so lucky to have been left at your house! Please keep us posted (with lots of photos) as they grow. 




 I never said you did. But by not being specific, you did make a ridiculous claim.  




 Please start by reading the reddit Guide to Columbus in the sidebar, and using the search function to find other threads about this (yours is at least the third one today!).

Then come back and tell us some relevant details, like how much you want to pay and whether you really need to be on the bus line, so people can help you in a meaningful way. 




 (1) read the reddit Guide to Columbus (linked in the sidebar);
(2) use the search function to find previous such threads;
(3) forget "property management companies" when looking for a house -- this only makes sense for apts.; and
(4) drive around the desired neighborhood looking for signs. 




 How did you come to be bottle feeding such a tiny (and adorable) kitten? 




 Fine. But that's not what was at issue here. /u/tomjoads made a flat assertion about *all* painkillers, and I was pointing out how ridiculous such a broad, nonspecific claim really is.

I can't take opiates, and I'm really tired of people leaping right past other pain control modalities to assume that opiates are the answer. That way of thinking (among docs as well as patients) is a big part of the problem the CDC describes. 




 What you said was

 the worlds first non opiate pain med

If you meant something different, some subset of that, you did not say so. That was my point.

 




 That's the idea! Just remember there are always other things on the ballot, even in a primary. 




 There are plenty of those already in existence. 




 [Details here.](http://www.tis-gdv.de/tis_e/ware/nuesse/pistazie/pistazie.htm#selbsterhitzung)

 I would love to vote Democrat in the general elections if we can get Bernie on the ticket past the primaries!

 It was *never* cool, and if you'd had to step over the many users who passed out *on the sidewalk*, or answer crisis calls from the girls who had been date raped because of sopors, you'd never want anything to do with it. There's a reason why so many young people at the time believed this drug flooded the streets as a  government plan to derail the anti-war movement, which was peaking in the early 70s. It's functionally the opposite of LSD, designed to make you useless and unconscious.   




 Submission statement: Quaaludes are the nearly forgotten drug Bill Cosby admitted using for date rape -- and he wasn't alone. This 1973 article delineates some of the reasons why activists at the time conducted a campaign against this "death drug" -- [here's more about that grassroots campaign](http://freeingjohnsinclair.aadl.org/node/195689). 









 See also this [anti-sopor campaign](http://freeingjohnsinclair.aadl.org/node/195689) by anti-war activists of the time. 









 Must have been very late 60s, because they really did show up very suddenly in 1970. A lot of memories have faded by now, but the plague of people falling down and passing out *on the sidewalk* is unfortunately still vivid, along with the epidemic of date rapes that pushed us to start the first rape crisis center in Ohio.

 




 Quaaludes -- also called "sopors" -- are a soporific (sleeping pill) that had a sudden rush of popularity in the early 70s as a recreational drug, with a very significant usage as a date-rape drug. 

There was a theory advanced by radical anti-war activists (mainly Yippies and the underground press, starting from Ann Arbor) that there was government involvement in the sudden widespread street-level availability of such "death drugs" -- as opposed to pot and LSD -- intended to blunt the rising popular opposition to the Viet Nam war and the recession. 

[Here is a 1973 article about the national anti-sopor campaign](http://freeingjohnsinclair.aadl.org/node/195689), showing the "WAKE UP! No more sleeping pills in our community" graphic that appeared on thousands of T-shirts and millions of posters that year. And [here is a history of Quaaludes](http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/unconsciousness-expansion-the-sopor-story-19730329) published that same year by Rolling Stone. 




 The first appearance of Quaaludes as a recreational drug was late 1970. There was a grassroots campaign at the time, started by activists in Ann Arbor and spread through the underground press, to convince young people to not use the drug. I still have my ["Wake Up! No more sleeping pills in our community" ](http://freeingjohnsinclair.aadl.org/node/195689) shirt, along with some leaflets and news articles ... somewhere in storage.

EDIT: [Here's a BIG flashback about the drug we called Sopors.](http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/unconsciousness-expansion-the-sopor-story-19730329)

 [Here's the full story, from the organization that saved this dog last year in India.](http://www.animalaidunlimited.com/blog/dog-submerged-in-rock-solid-tar-rescued/) They deserve the credit, not somebody who ripped off two frames of their video and posted them without context to imgur.

If I could find that in 2 minutes, so could you, /u/Gallowboob. 









 I know the headline here is a quote from the subject of this article, but as a headline it's tone deaf: most of the new social energy around climate change is coming from precisely "faith-based arguments that deal with climate change" -- from the opposite direction. When the Pope issued his Encyclical last week calling for a moral campaign against human-made climate change, he was standing on the base built over the past few years by many other religious leaders who say stewardship of the planet is a basic responsibility for people of faith. So this headline is just seriously odd, not to mention confusing.

 




 Date rape is what Quaaludes are famous for, and have been since the 1970s. Have you been living under a rock?  




 It's actually hilarious -- that's the problem. I stopped watching it when they went neanderthal in public, but I'm still tempted sometimes. 




 First, thank you for taking care of these kitties. You've done a good thing, and trolls can't change that.

Some questions:  
How old are they? Are they all neutered and vaccinated?    
Have your posts included photos? Have you advertised them all together, or separately? 
Have you posted to other local reddits, including school-specific ones?
How fast do you have to move on this? Is there an external pressure, or is it just time to move them along?

I don't have any magic trick. In my experience (I re-homed dozens of kittens over several years in another city), it comes down to sheer persistence and highlighting each cat individually. For leaflets and online posts, a good portrait photo plus a compelling back story helps. I've also gone to the extreme of taking the kittens to a place where they would be seen -- the parking lot of a gourmet grocery store or a popular restaurant on a Saturday afternoon -- and letting people hold them, which increases attraction exponentially. (I wouldn't hand them over permanently at first contact. Anyone interested in adopting would have to come by the next day and go through the interview.) 

You're doing the right things. Keep on keeping on with those, and keep asking for more help. In my experience, friends and family will make one perfunctory effort when you first ask, but it's only when you become relentless that something finally works. Don't be afraid of being the squeaky wheel! 

 




 He's the exception. I meant, he has zero chance *absent the intervention of a whole other network of volunteers trying to mitigate the effects of bad shelter policy.* Those networks can save only a fraction of the cats condemned by the failure to implement good public policy (subsidized spay/neuter; comprehensive humane education; mandatory licensing, etc.).  




 Are those rentals even legal? Residential landlords have to register with the county auditor.

And why are you talking to the police about fire codes?

EDIT: do you mean *housing* codes? 




 Says the redditor for 14 days. You're wrong about that, btw. 





























 they don't have to release information regarding their policies

I'm sure a fast-growing private equity buyout firm like BC Partners will mind their legal P Qs. But here the issue isn't whether it's legal to do it, but whether it's fair.

 the manager positions I mentioned are now off the career guide on the website.

You might also want to see if they are still visible through [the Internet Archive WayBack Machine](http://archive.org/web/) and if so take screenshots. At this point, I'd say document everything and figure out later which pieces are important.

 [Here's a video interview with the managing partner of BC Partners about his plans for PetSmart](http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/04/09/bc-partners-raymond-svider-on-buyouts-debt-and-his-affinity-for-cats/). 




 The union you want to talk with is probably United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW), the largest union for retail workers. I don't want to discourage anybody from joining a union, but it's not easy and this company is already so far along in restructuring that you may not be able to do anything to stop it.

A recognized union, with a contract, only works when it formalizes already existing unity among the workers. For PetSmart to reach the point of recognition and contract would be a many year long process, necessarily involving thousands of workers, that could only get started if the UFCW believed it had a good possibility of success ... and right now, UFCW has other and bigger companies in their sights.

HOWEVER: the changes you describe may well create a situation in which there could be enough unity among the workers in your particular shop to get some concessions even without a contract. Go talk to the organizing director of your regional UFCW office, and don't be shy. You don't have a lot to lose by doing so. And if several workers go together to management and announce their intention to form a union, you may even get additional protection from retaliation under the National Labor Relations Act.

You can and should double check anything I said here with your state AFL-CIO before acting on it. I *was* a national union staff organizer, but that was years ago and my recollection may be rusty. Good luck! 




 Huh? That's the *archive*. What's the issue? 




 This article is *four months old* -- in terms of what's been happening here recently, that's a lifetime -- and it was a big part of the external pressure that led to the admins' change of policy.

So I'm a little confused about why it shows up here now, long after it appeared on 15 other subreddits and was quoted or cited in numerous press reports about reddit. OP?

 Where? How much?

 




 Speaking of technical issues, can you address [this thread?](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/3dz6n3/do_not_forget_to_find_a_july_29th_event_and/cta84f4) 




   people are scheduling it for the wrong time.

I don't think "people" are doing this, at least not actively. There's a common problem with scheduling software that sets the default at 12 noon unless the organizer sets it for another time -- which experienced users would know to do because most of the uses for such software are for individual, time variable events. But it becomes a problem when a lot of new folks are using the system to set up gatherings at a fixed time, because many assume the software will do that for them.

In any case, you can't possibly repeat your caution too often! 




  That's a weird URL by the way.

Which one, and why? 




 That study was in 2014. The most recent available estimate for the total voting age population in the US was [237,657,645 in 2012.](https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2012/01/26/2012-1635/estimates-of-the-voting-age-population-for-2011) If the turnout is 40% (what Pew was expecting in 2014,not necessarily what happened), the approximate size of the Party of Non-Voters was then 60% of the total, or 142,594,587 individuals who need a reason to bother voting at all.

Of course those numbers are very rough, but the scale of it should provoke some hard thinking around here. To advance the campaign, much less win the nomination, will require refocusing from arguing with people who already read the news and vote to those who have everything to gain by voting (esp. for Bernie) but don't believe it yet.

And *that's* why face-to-face organizing matters. 




 OMG, I accidentally transposed two letters! That typo obviously means I'm an idiot. 




 So ... you got "volunteered" in your absence? 




 They're going to keep adopting and mistreating animals until someone convinces them to do better. Simply stopping them from getting this particular kitten, or taking it later, won't work. I think you have to do the more difficult task of sitting down with them and talking about your concerns, without precipitating bad feelings. 

And remember, even adults can grow up more, and maybe they have or are starting to do so. In this case, it's a good sign that they went to a shelter that vets the cat and requires an interview and fee -- many people would have just grabbed the nearest "free kittens" ad on Craiglist. Try to build on that: "You obviously care enough to select a healthy kitten and make sure it's medically protected. Do you need any info or help with raising it?" is the gist of the message, although I'm sure you can find better words. Speak to their better selves, give them a chance to do the right thing, and keep advocating if you see signs of trouble. If his parents are also your mate's parents (am I reading this right?) maybe they can also help.

Just don't assume, even with the evidence you cite, that this can't work. Help them make it work. 




 So where's the Sanders vote going to come from? The only place it could come from in order for him to win: Existing Hillary supporters.

This is the failure of imagination that informs all of the Beltway press skepticism about Sanders. In reality, the largest block of potential supporters is what the Pew Research Center, using methodology far superior to that used here, identified as [The Party of Non-Voters](http://www.people-press.org/2014/10/31/the-party-of-nonvoters-2/). This group could be the clear margin of victory *if they can be organized and mobilized* in  the next year. 

This 2014 study by Pew is so important that all Sanders supporters should read it and think deeply about what it will take to get these folks to believe it's worthwhile to vote at all. Fortunately, I'm willing to bet that many members of The Party of Nonvoters hang out on reddit.

The one sector of Clinton's base that is problematic for Sanders is her strong support among African-Americans, which may well prove to be unmovable.  




 ... and those short shorts with tall white socks! 




 Well, we do have a small lawn (in a bigger, non-lawn yard). Still: how do such rates compare to what it would cost if the cost were set by hourly wage rather than by the job? I can't see paying someone more for a half hour than most workers make in an hour.   




 Good point: just mowing. He's careful about edges, though. 




 Really! I pay an adult $15 to do ours. For $40, I'm tempted to do the OP's lawn myself. 




  If everyone that smoked weed signed the petition, this would be on the ballot.

Yes, because nobody who smokes pot has any critical thinking skills and would just automatically sign for anything that mentioned legalization. It's not like there has been a widespread campaign to discredit RO, or anything.

I prefer to call it mockery.

You can call it whatever you want. It won't change what it is.
 




 Well, for pandering ~~demagogeury~~ demagoguery, that was pretty impressive. 

EDIT: fixed typo 




 If no one here has a specific suggestion, you could ask at a nearby church or synagogue. The minister/rabbi will surely know of some reliable teenager in the congregation who will do it.  




  So it looks to me like a bunch of sanctimonious, pretentious leftists/progressives are the reason this was shot down.

This is not your conclusion, it was your premise -- and it's laughably wrong. Aside from not grasping how the political process worked here, your notion of who smokes is a baseless stereotype. Because you don't smoke, you have no idea how many lawyers, lawmakers, doctors, successful business owners, soldiers, soccer moms and other upright citizens smoke pot.

As for whose moral compass is broken, I'm happy to set my identity and record on this site alongside yours for comparison. I've never [set up a subreddit dedicated to hate](https://www.reddit.com/r/HamplanetHateMail/comments/31v2ko/i_started_a_subreddit_with_this_title_about_a/), let alone routinely used the word "retard" to disparage commenters who disagree.

 He said repeatedly, "Athens and Columbus". 




 Try for a *foster* home, while the search for a permanent home continues. Perhaps a relative, friend or neighbor of your mom's would be willing to do this; at least this pool of people should have someone in it who can help you place the cats so you can concentrate on your mom.  




 Even if it were what the OP thought he was linking to, it would still be a ridiculous post. This focus on attempting to micromanage headlines, for better or worse ("let's not put Trump in the same headline as Bernie") reveals a complete lack of understanding about how campaigns (and news orgs) work.

 Well, stop the presses.

Why does this merit a post? 




 If Sanders gets the nomination, sure. Before then, not a chance. 




 The problem is that it's still, for a campaign, necessarily contested terrain. New users don't know and can't easily find out about alternative subs to discuss the general issue, and so go to the obviously named "gateway" subreddit.  




 Lazy to nonexistent moderating is the likely cause.

  middle-class raised males who display minor hostilities towards anonymous women 

That's not who I was talking about -- and if that's who you were talking about, perhaps you're taking this rather too personally.



 




  raising awareness does precisely nothing to cure cancer other than take money that should be going to research... the funds raised at these events hardly ever actually make it to research

You may know a lot about cancer (or maybe not) but you clearly don't know much about fundraising, and your assertions are absurd. 




 Read more about domestic terrorism by hard rightwingers and miscellaneous spree shooters. What I stated about them is not remotely controversial among researchers and LEOs.  And although I wasn't talking about them, it's hardly a stretch to assert that these findings will prove useful in dealing with ISIS-recruited young American men given what we know about them.

Adding, we all "know" a lot of things about social psychology, but it takes studies producing consistent results over time to change norms and policies. It's not like the money for this even *could* be redirected, even if we were dealing with a zero sum budget, which we're not here.

 




 Exactly right, as I learned the hard way. Siphotrol does it all in one afternoon. But it really isn't necessary until your ankles are getting as many flea bites as the cats are. 




  Are people seriously funding research into "losers" who harass women?

You should take another look at the dominant pattern of lone wolf domestic terrorism in the US over the past three decades. Anger at losing control over or being unable to connect with women is the single most obvious recurring element aside from access to weapons. I'd be happy if results from this study *only* helped with this one issue -- and there are a lot for other benefits to learning what makes such men tick. 




 Wise move. That's one smart cat you have there! 




 I can't decide whether that's adorable or terrifying. If that's possible, what's to stop them from "borrowing" the car?

Step back and examine your assumptions, please. 




 As much as the money raised on the day, these events are about developing donor relations. Having participants sign up supporters is an effective way of outsourcing the process of finding new donors, and every step of the preparation and follow-up ties all those people closer together and closer to the cause. 




 Have you used the search function to find other discussions of this? It comes up fairly often. There may also be something about it in the reddit Guide to Columbus (sidebar). If there *isn't* such a thread linked in the reddit Guide, you could do everybody a favor by adding whatever you find to that wiki.

EDIT: [here's one discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/269e7k/best_places_to_go_star_gazing_in_or_around/)

 Are you a registered voter? That's often the bottom line. Voting for a long period from the same address also bumps you up the list. 









 ... and you just helped make things worse with that nasty, uninformed post about "stoners" being responsible for RO's petition failure. Why not try to improve the tone,rather than complaining about it and adding to it? 




 This analysis is assbackwards: Responsible Ohio's petition is failing because voters who support legalization have *succeeded* in organizing against this particular initiative, convincing others to not sign even to put it on the ballot because of the monopolistic structure of the proposed "reform". RO has so little support that they are having to use almost exclusively paid circulators, whose valid signature rate is laughable and probably won't get any better in the next 10 days.

We're all going to have to wait for something better, and it doesn't help that the competing "grassroots" initiative seems completely incapable of leading anything (for reasons that have nothing to do with being stoned).  




 I like you.  




 Caution: the "flea bombs" sold in most stores are a waste of money.

The best treatment for the whole house is NOT sold at the pet store, but at the vet's office, because this is what they use: Siphotrol Plus II Premise Spray. It's the nuclear bomb of flea treatments: works instantly and for months afterwards. But it's not to be used lightly -- if you're not being bitten, it's not time for this stuff yet. If you do have to use it, follow the directions to the letter ... and then relax, because the problem will be over for the year.   




 Congrats on providing a great life for Max. I think you've just significantly raised the bar on kitty birthday cakes! 




 I hope you're taking lots of pics at every stage, especially the pointy-tailed moment and the (later) jumping sideways stiff-legged stage. Those photos can make all the difference in finding homes for kittens. 




 It's a hard discipline. I still have the last four I tried to foster, eight years ago, so now I'm not allowed to even look at live kittens. When we go to PetSmart, I've asked my husband to make sure I stick to the main aisle and to stop me if I veer toward the adoption center. That's why I spend so much time looking at other people's kittens on reddit (usually with one or another grown cats plastered to my side).

 "The economy" can, should and will eventually be reorganized to value people before profit.  




 Maybe the answer is to create room in your budget by getting assistance with *other* necessary costs. Are you receiving Food Assistance? If not, it's very likely you're eligible, and this can make a huge difference. [The Ohio Benefits Bank](http://www.ohiobenefits.org/) can sit you down with a social worker who will assess your whole financial situation and show you what [programs are available to help you stay afloat and healthy](http://www.ohiobenefits.org/programs.php#health-healthystart). 




 I like this answer better than the real one.  




 Your general point is well taken, but if you mean the mural that literally says "Olde Town East", the sticker isn't ON the mural but on a traffic light switch box next to it.  




 Do you want all the comforts of home plus extras, or silence and solitude? 




 Capitalism. The same system that includes big, rich companies *and* a propaganda culture that promotes unrealistic expectations about entrepreneurship, mostly based on the notion that it's desirable to cut expenses at the expense of the very people who make profit possible. There are millions of businesses that are functionally under-capitalized and always will be, but their deserved demise is delayed by widespread acceptance of an unsustainable definition of value.

And that's all I have for now, because I have to go pick up my brilliant sweetie from his criminally underpaid job.

 




 I don't understand why you didn't answer my question.

Okay, then: yes. 

I'm referring to a whole system, not one business. I have sympathy for the employees tasked with enforcing the current definition of value by trying to hire people for far less than the true social value of their work, but that's not going to stop me from pointing out that the entire concept is distorted in a system that overvalues individual acquisition of wealth over social responsibility.

Managers who can't hire for this reason are being set up to fail by the people who set "the company budget". 




 In addition to listening to BLM, Bernie needs a reorientation on how to present his views on the relationship between race and class. His analysis is correct that eliminating wealth inequality is a necessary precondition to eliminating race and gender inequality. But simply making that assertion is insufficient, especially in a culture so divided by the history of slavery and the grotesque distortions of identity politics over the past 30 years. He has to be able to explain in plain English *why* that is the case.

Adding, the BLM folks were not attacking Bernie. They were trying to get the attention of a major conference of mostly white progressives -- and the national press there to cover Bernie. I don't know what panels NN15 did on racism or police accountability, but I do know they would never have been mentioned by the press if this hadn't happened. Sometimes, being formally "on the agenda" or even on the stage isn't enough. Sometimes, a little strategic rudeness is needed to reboot assumptions.   




 Who's setting the "value"? What if the current definition is not only wrongheaded, but massively unjust? 




 No particular suggestion better than those already posted, just a big THANK YOU FOR READING BOOKS!

 best customer service

Sure as hell ain't Best Buy. And both Lowes and Home Depot are structured in such a way that any appliance repair service is probably from the manufacturer rather than the mall-type retailer. (I'm sure someone will correct this if I'm wrong.) 

I've always bought from Sears because their Kenmore appliances are extremely durable and their prices (especially at the Outlet Stores) are easily the best. The installers are another story, and I would recommend having someone else do that if you can. 

But I must say that the last time an installer screwed up, on an AC window unit, my complaint to customer service resulted in them *setting aside for review and then losing the entire purchase record* for that and the $800 refrigerator purchased at the same time, with the result that I got both for free. Never underestimate the power of clerks who don't get paid enough to hassle. 




 True. That second comment was below my set display level and I didn't see it until you prompted my to go back and find out what you were referring to. 




  It's amazing how much good we can do for others just by being a little vulnerable.

Amen! There's persuasive evidence across many cultures that an unwillingness to admit vulnerability is the ultimate weakness, because it effectively cuts an individual off from from the healing power of community. Conventional gender roles have placed most of the pressure to hide self-doubt and sadness on men, but it hurts everybody because we all lose the gifts of the ones who remain silent too long. 




 You might want to go re-read your own comment history. You've spent a lot of time lately telling people they're stupid and wrong. Any competent shrink (let alone mature common sense) will testify that when you think you're the only smart one in the room, the problem isn't other people. I sincerely wish for you a moment of rigorous introspection, followed by asking for the help you so obviously need.

They're all decorative items produced for the mass market starting in the 1950s. "The Circle of Friends" may reference earlier, less commercial art, but don't be fooled by its pseudo-rustic appearance or the fact that some hippies may have bought it. It's from a time when decorative art in the US was all about appropriating themes from Other Cultures and adding exotic backstories. I'd bet that most people who bought early versions of it rightly expected that their friends would be wowed by their selection of a supposedly ancient and unique "artwork".

 .np = Non Participation. When you link to a post from another reddit, you're supposed to change the "www" to "np" in order to prevent brigading or just distortion of the vote balance because of input from people who aren't subscribed. If you vote or comment in an .np thread, you risk being banned by that sub's mods, or even shadowbanned by admins. This is a good thing, because it shores up the ability of subs to become communities based on the participation of people who actually care about it, rather than being disrupted by careless or hostile input.

It's such a shame when an obviously-named gateway sub -- the one with the name newbies will look for -- becomes useless because of bad modding. /r/politics is the one that makes me white-hot angry on a regular basis, not because it's dominated by one political viewpoint but because the mods have decided that the definition of "politics" includes only news about elected officials and candidates. They remove anything about advocacy groups, coverage of government agencies, major cultural developments that have political implications, etc. In that case, too, there are several alternative subs, but so far none has emerged as the consensus relocation site for an all-sided consideration of politics. 

Thanks again for the explanation. I have been lazy about where I post Native news, but I'll now work harder to make sure /r/IndianCountry is at least the *first* place I put things. 




  I just realized this conversation was taking place on /r/NativeAmerican instead of /r/IndianCountryso no point in reporting crazy racist stuff.

Could you explain this a bit? I subscribe to both, but never really understood the split. 

 




 just taking the piss, you know for the craic

I'm surprised by the number of commenters who don't understand this very basic aspect of what happened.  




  condescending

Exactly! My first thought was that the good folks over at /r/NativeAmerican would appreciate that thread.

 Your mom (and others) may be interested in [this radio documentary](http://servlet1.lib.berkeley.edu:8080/audio/stream.play.logic?coll=mrc filename=intheair.mp3) about anti-war activism in that area at the time. It's just one of the many great links at [The Pacifica Radio/UC Berkeley Social Activism Sound Recording Project: Anti-Vietnam War Protests in the
San Francisco Bay Area   Beyond](http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/pacificaviet.html)

You may also want to think about donating this poster, which is pretty rare, to an established archive like the one at [UC Irvine](http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt2489r5bk/). There's also a [significant market for such posters](http://www.bolerium.com/cgi-bin/bol48/results.html?search=1 category=Posters). I've always wanted to put my collection in a university archive, but looking at those prices, I don't know if I can afford to give them away. 




 What a great thread! I was laughing so hard that I upvoted almost the whole thing before remembering the page was in .np mode. 




 Yes -- but except at the beginning, that's not an autoworker speaking. That's Kenneth V. Cockrell Sr., who served as DRUM's attorney. The whole film is [here](http://wearemany.org/v/finally-got-news).

 So true, and so sad. What will it take to turn this sub around? 




 His submission history is still visible, and it seems he has some serious doubts about things like whether humans have been to the moon ... 




   It could happen.

It *does* happen, all the time, and seeing scapegoating as a major dynamic in politics clarifies a lot of what's happening now. [Here's a helpful analysis](http://www.politicalresearch.org/1995/02/05/the-snake-oil-of-scapegoating/#sthash.8MtBqC6G.dpbs) of how this plays out, especially in America.   




 At the time, at all levels of government, radical protesters were considered un-American at best, traitors at worst. Calling in the National Guard was not uncommon, and the practice only came into question when they [killed four white college students](http://dept.kent.edu/sociology/lewis/lewihen.htm). 




 Do you know where she was living at the time? 




 Aside from basic human decency, one reason is that bad food in prisons is a leading cause of prison riots, in which guards (who presumably get more empathy from the likes of you) get killed. 




 Nope. It's something reporters *aspire to*. 




 Depends on your experience, I guess. I love it because it reminds me of my grandmother, who had both a tree and a great recipe for black walnut bread that she shipped to all the grandkids every Christmas. So I pick them up and sniff them when I see them, and that transports me to a happier time. 




 Thank you! An hour later, there's no sign of further blood, and she's busy complaining about which flavor of Fancy Feast we gave her tonight. But when it happened, at 11:30 PM on a Friday, it was really scary.

BTW, I recognize you as a mod and want to say I really appreciate the work you all do here. I suspect I'm not alone in subscribing just to learn from your answers to concerns I haven't (yet) had to face with my own animals. It's a great service you provide!  




 When I moved to the southern US, I was terrified of unconsciously mimicking the regional accent. For trying not to sound like a jerk, my reward was being treated worse, because everybody said I was obviously a New Yorker. The joke is that I had moved there from Ohio.  




 I always plan time to go shopping when I get to the city nearest the step-off. 

And to make it all easier, I like to ship my equipment and most clothing ahead, so there's no chance of it becoming lost baggage. 




 What was the riddle? 




 ...except it's not true. Please read the link provided by /u/shitlord_prime ITT. 









 go away, idiot spammer.

reported.

again. 




 Not sure why you think this isn't an average pun thread, but it's a good one. I wish this happened more often -- it used to happen all over reddit, but now seems contained in /r/pics. I don't subscribe to that, so thanks for posting it here.

BTW, that's not an Italian song. It was written in 1952 by [American songwriters Harry Warren and Jack Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That%27s_Amore) for the Dean Martin/Jerry Lewis film *The Caddy*.  




 Thanks. Another user also clarified this below. You can see how I got confused! 




 Species: Feline

Age: 20 years

Sex/Neuter status: F/S

Breed: DSH

Body weight: 5.6 lb.

History: CKD Stage 3

Clinical signs: bleeding at SQ injection site

Duration: three minutes until stop

Your general location: Ohio

Our elder kitty has been diagnosed with stage 3 kidney disease, and has been on daily fluids for almost a year. She's doing remarkably well, staying active, eating well and accepting the ritual of being injected. But tonight blood started coming out of the injection site as soon as we finished. It was enough to freak us out, but apparently stopped after soaking just two facial  tissues. Did we do something wrong? Is she in trouble (she seems even more perky than usual today, coming and going)? Is her skin just losing elasticity, or what? I can call the vet in the morning, but any answer now would help us sleep tonight. 




 Does Tigs always wear a onesie, or is there a medical reason? 




 Thanks for clarifying that! Personally, I think one should always dress up to the max when rescuing kittens, but for me that just means a clean t-shirt, not a heavy coat ... 




 Tell me about it: I just dislocated a knee for what must be the 20th time, and realized this time will not be the same quick recovery I got used to in my 20s. The psychological aspects of getting older are fine by me, but the physical changes are a literal pain. 




 This is an important number, because it's what really matters in determining wages -- unlike the "index to inflation" which is much less. But dammit, if they're going to squeeze more work out of us in the same number of hours, it shouldn't be workers who absorb the difference.  




 Ouch! Hope you got lots of sympathy mileage out of it.

 




 I've always heard it as "turned out" meaning the firefighters are wearing their [turnout gear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunker_gear#Turnout_clothing). 




 I think OP meant "turned out", as in dressed in [turnout gear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunker_gear#Turnout_clothing). 




 Yep: cats can go all boneless when it suits them!  




 Well, if he winds up going to jail and somebody makes a movie about it, I hear former presidential candidate John Edwards might be available to star in it. (Seriously: I can't be the only one who sees that "separated at birth" aspect ...?) 




  that is going to set him back 150k

Your overall point is valid, but nobody on either side of a bill like that seriously expects it to be paid at face value. It will be drastically reduced through negotiation, and much of the remainder will be absorbed by the hospital. 

 




 Kitty has a strange notion of what "fit" means ... 




 When I die, I want to come back as a book shop cat. That's the life!

Lilly is gorgeous, and this is an excellent portrait of her. Thanks for sharing this beauty with us.  




 Thank you so much for this post! I just spent the time since you posted reading around the Justice Project and Open Communities websites, and I am totally inspired. I sent the link to my sister, a lifelong social justice activist who just moved to Winnetka and will be delighted to find these folks. What a great group!

Adding, you might be interested to look at [this project](http://www.comfest.com/purpose.php), which is not nearly as ambitious but has been plugging along, gathering fans and changing social norms, since 1972. 




 Wow: what an auto-fill fail. "Being Moody" is the name of the column and has nothing to do with the content of this piece. Much more relevant (and more likely to get readers to click the link) is that this is a report from the Netroots Nation conference. 




 That's already happening. I'm still hoping for a paradigm shift such that elders could spend their last years with their families (whether birth families or created collectives). Nursing homes, no matter how good, are a barrier to inter-generational respect and understanding.  




 Thanks! 




 Okay, thanks. I did get an answer from admin mail about my original question, and thus am now satisfied that admins can, in fact, see private/closed reddits. 




 Is the user I was talking to an admin?  




  when I get the chance, I do spread the word

The more people who do this, the fewer sad stories there will be about failed shelters. I don't know about other areas, but in Ohio there's a steady drumbeat of news stories about small rescue orgs getting overwhelmed and ending up dumping their charges into municipal kill shelters. So yes, let's spread the word! 




  next to the username 

I'm sorry to be obtuse, but whose username? I'm looking at a private reddit that I created, and don't see anything like that, whether logged in as myself or another account. Do you mean, if I find my way to a closed reddit for which I'm *not* a mod that "turn admin on" will be next to *my* username?  




 I may have oversold that idea. My parents had such a tree, and talked about someday harvesting it, but when they died the last thing on anybody's mind was dealing with a tree. Now, looking it up, [there are many reasons why an urban tree wouldn't be tempting to a lumber company.](http://ohioline.osu.edu/for-fact/0044.html) Sorry to dash your hopes! 




  re-authenticate

Que? 




 Point taken. Let's say, instead, *people of faith*. 




 Can we send you out to preach this to the rest of reddit? You're so right about the awesome stories -- we all have so much to learn from our elders, and the reflexive dismissal of older people's opinions is such a terrible waste. Elders are exactly the people who have *earned the right* to rant, even when they're nutty. We need to learn to understand that, too.  




 Thank you so much for posting this. It's such a disservice to people who do rescue and such work when people choose to make an imgur gif without linking to the video. I pitched a fit at/u/Gallowboob about this last week, because he's such a frequent offender, and he pointed out that redditors are more likely to click on an imgur link than a YouTube link. I get that, but:

**Everybody, please include the link to the full video in the comments when you post an edited gif about rescue work.** These folks deserve support!  




 Linked above ITT. 




 Looks *exactly* like a Black Walnut. OP, here's how to tell: do you hands look stained and have a strong smell after handling the nut? Is the ground underneath the tree inhospitable to other plants? That's a Black Walnut.

If you own the tree, do what you can to make sure it grows straight. The wood from this tree can be very valuable, but only if it grows straight enough to cut into lumber. 




 Eww -- not *at the table*, man. Wait until you get home. 




 Amen!

This is the fastest growing and often the most effective sector of the progressive movement (think Moral Mondays), yet it remains invisible to many young activists who have swallowed the New Atheism koolade. There's a lot to learn here, not just a audience ripe for recruiting. 




 "*interesting*"?!?

This guy deserves a taste of his own medicine. I bet he has some *interesting* stuff in his own closet. 




 Is IBM now a prison? [That's where the problem is.](http://www.10tv.com/content/stories/2014/07/15/columbus-ohio-maggots-in-food-among-new-ohio-prison-complaints.html) 

Aramark has different tiers of service -- from National Park hotels to schools to prisons -- and the ones near the top are qualitatively better.  




  To my knowledge there aren't any really active private subreddits that are about hate.

Source of this "knowledge"? 




  stupid fucks off reddit

Gee, thanks. Being a vet tech -- even in a rescue hospital -- doesn't give you license to act like a jerk. 

For others who may be tempted to take this dismissal at face value, I would advise taking this user's absolute dismissal with a grain or ten of salt. Refeeding syndrome is rarely seen in vet offices except in cases of hepatic lipidosis, precisely because veterinary care costs money and the cats that come in are more likely than not to have had basically good care. In rescue work and shelters it's another story, and the caution is *always* warranted when talking to someone who just found a starving kitten and knows nothing about cats. 




 It looks like you're right -- and just what this area *doesn't* need is one more threat to sycamore trees, dammit. 




 at the worst I think maybe two nights should acclimate most everyone. 

That's optimal for 7K. I try to convince people to give themselves at least 24 hrs. before starting down, but even that's a tough sell for people who don't recognize the issue. I'm glad you and your co-hikers have had no trouble, but I'm usually talking to unprepared/overeager newbies, and over the past 3 decades I've seen a lot of them felled by "mysterious" ailments that were actually predictable and preventable consequences of elevation change. And hiking with individuals who ignored the advice is not pleasant, so I keep pushing it.


  




  I'd appreciate it if you could link me to some convincing evidence supporting your claim, as I am interested, especially if they've been covering it up.

I can't because this all came out in a series of posts over a couple of years to the Grand Canyon Hikers and Backpackers Yahoo group, which is great day to day but not very searchable. The one person who knows the most (because he's an MD who practiced at the Canyon) has been effectively silenced by threats of a defamation suit. But it's something to keep in mind.

Anyway, thank you for this post. You may have saved somebody's life, and certainly saved some folks' vacations.

 




 (1) You've done more than enough for now. Be patient.

(2) Please tell us you got the cats out of the house when you bombed it. 

(3) If the problem is severe or widespread (i.e., fleas are biting *you*), the product that will end it completely is the stuff vet offices use: Siphotrol Plus II Premise Spray. You *should* buy this from a vet, so they can explain exactly how to use it. It's the nuclear bomb of flea eradication and should be handled with care.

 




 You forgot one thing: they're mostly coming from sea level states to rim elevations of 7,000 feet or more, with no idea they need time to acclimate. Blinding headaches, fatigue and fear are the usual result. 




 [I think you'll appreciate this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/grandcanyon/comments/34y44e/this_is_why_we_dont_hike_grand_canyon_in_the/cqz4icv) 




 You should know that a good number of experienced GC hikers have concluded that such water delivery systems are actually dangerous because they encourage the hiker to sip *too much* water, leading to the danger of hyponatremia. The manufacturer you cite is extremely aggressive about legal bullying to stop dissemination of that analysis, but after one experience of hyponatremia, I'll never stop pointing this out.

BTW, it would be a mitzvah if you would amend your original post to emphasize the danger of water intoxication and urge hikers to carry very salty snacks and use V-8 in place of energy drinks. 




 Hyponatremia -- also known as water intoxication -- is a huge, under-appreciated issue for desert hikers. Following the advice in the original post here could get you in serious trouble, because it does not address salt loss.

You're absolutely right about V-8 being the best re-hydrating drink. It has *all* the electrolytes you need, unlike sports drinks. After one experience with hyponatremia (that even a concerned Ranger didn't recognize as such) I started carrying a can of V-8 for every day in the Canyon. It's worth the weight! 




 Now that you've survived it, you'll probably enjoy [Over the Edge: Death in Grand Canyon](http://azdailysun.com/news/local/canyon-deaths-and-counting/article_ba588a05-e816-55be-87f6-80f15b76f744.html), the book every new GC hiker should read before stepping off. 




 I don't even begin to know what to say about this -- but don't miss the note at the bottom about the name of the realty company. 









 Also, isn't following a suspect out into the parking lot moving into another jurisdiction? The parking lot is owned by the mall, not the store. 




 I ... I just couldn't help myself. It was such a tantalizing subject. I blame all that late night TV for wearing down my commitment to FWC. Or maybe it was my parents' fault. Certainly not mine, anyway. Please don't ban me! 




 Just did that.

EDIT: actually, I just messaged the admins. What you  linked is an archive, not a contact. 




 I was going to ask why schadenfreude -- but your user history makes it clear: one of these jerks was your teacher. 




 That doesn't answer my question. My understanding (from many years ago) was that the *content* of private reddits is invisible to  the admins, although they could see the fact that such reddits existed. I never knew whether it was a technical matter or a policy decision, and it may have been a myth to begin with. But it will take a definitive answer from an admin to convince me either way.
