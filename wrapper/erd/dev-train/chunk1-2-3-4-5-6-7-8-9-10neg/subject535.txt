Seralini ran a bastardization between a sub chronic toxicity study and a carcinogenicity study, with using only 10 rats per sex per group and running it for 2 years.  
  
Also Seralini did not run any statistical analysis on mortality or tumor prevalence. His data, due to sample size and short duration was inadequate to determine if any of his observed effects were statitically significant.

The retraction statement could have been clearer, and should have referred to the relevant COPE guidelines. The data are inconclusive, therefore the claim (ie, conclusion) that Roundup Ready maize NK603 and/or the Roundup herbicide have a link to cancer is unreliable.

EFSA finds that the study as reported by Sralini et al. is of insufficient scientific quality for safety assessments.

**TLDR:** Seralini's 2012 study is full of elementary mistakes and follows an inadequate protocol that fails to support the conclusions it makes. 




 A big issue with the rat (Seralini) study was the very small sample size, it was small enough that they were unable to do any statistical analysis on tumor prevalence and mortality.  




 Monsanto has never sued over accidental cross pollination, they've sued over willful and intentional isolation of their seed and growing without a license.  




 and that their conclusions were predetermined (e.g., pseudoscience).
  
[Citation Needed] 




 Just to point out that the study that WTCMolybdenum4753 is citing was originally retracted for being of fundamentally flawed study design and conclusion.  




 That's because most GMOs such as corn are hybrids and don't bread true, [you get a similar effect with non GMO hybrids.](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/41560478_TRANSGRESSIVE_SEGREGATION_IN_F2_GENERATION_OF_MAIZE_HYBRIDS_GROWN_FOR_GRAIN_AND_SILAGE) 




 Yes, while there was a time in which sterile seeds/GURT was being developed they have never been brought to market.  




 This is due to them being hybrid varieties, not to being genetically engineered.  




 I stopped caring about Goodall when it came out that she plagiarized her book.  




 Seralini's study was retracted for being fundamentally flawed and down right worthless.  




 The WHO and Lancet studies should be honestly looked at and considered without prejudiced.
  
They are the same study.  




 [Here is a published response to Jack Heinemanns's study.](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14735903.2014.939842) 




 It's just that bird law in this countryit's not governed by reason. 




 I didn't call glyphosate a carcinogen. 
  
Edit: Apparently this was a joke that flew past my head.  




 They should see if they can get the specs of the Surface 3 into a phone, maybe down clock the CPU a bit for thermal/battery reasons.  




 Germany is much more fond of the precautionary principle than the US is.

 [Here is a point by point response to the book/film Genetic Roulette.](http://academicsreview.org/reviewed-content/genetic-roulette/) 




 Yes, some of them are written or funded in part by Monsanto but not all of them. One of the larger ones cited "the AHS" is [not.](http://aghealth.nih.gov/collaboration/) 
  
Also just because a study might be funded or authored by someone who has a conflict of interest does not mean that the science is flawed or inadequate.  




 What developed nations actively ban the use of glyphosate?
  
 There have been issues with farmers dying from direct contact with it since it came into use.
  
The only real cases of farmers dying from glyphosate exposure are easily suicide related when the farmer consumes large amounts of a concentrated solution.

 According to Argentina's union of medical professionals, Fesprosa, glyphosate, not only causes cancer. It is also associated with increased spontaneous abortions, birth defects, skin diseases, and respiratory and neurological disease. 

  
Here are some studies and reviews on the safety and risk of glyphosate.

There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect related toglyphosatetreatment. The lack of a plausible mechanism, along with published epidemiology studies, which fail to demonstrate clear, statistically significant, unbiased and non-confounded associations betweenglyphosateand cancer of any single etiology, and a compelling weight of evidence, support the conclusion thatglyphosatedoes not present concern with respect to carcinogenic potential in humans.

Note that there was a weak but slight association with multiple myeloma that the authors suggest that further follow up is required. Also this was among applicators who inherently are exposed to significantly higher amounts of glyphosate than end product consumers.

  
Also a re-analysis of the AHS data failed to show the same link between glyphosate and multiple meyloma.

[Epidemiologic studies of glyphosate and cancer: A review](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230012000943)
  
To examine potential cancer risks in humans, we reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humans. We also reviewed relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. Seven cohort studies and fourteen case-control studies examined the association between glyphosate and one or more cancer outcomes. Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate.

 The few times that I've used the base 5k I've noticed it a little during certain task. Also several reviews have also documented slight performance issues with the base GPU. The performance of the base might not be too big of an issue to you, but that is heavily dependent on the kind of work/programs you will be using.  




 The McLaren F1 is also a lot more expensive and rare then the LaFerrari.  




 There are a handful on the open market, and while Ferrari claims to make "x" amount of their hyper cars they rarely do. The Enzo sold a good 60+ beyond their official figure.  




 Stig's problem was due to the car not being set up properly in terms of its suspension.  




 You do know that GMO tomatoes don't exist on the market right? 




 There are several on the used market already.  




 Or Ikea! 




 I'd stay away from the 5K unless you are going for the top of the line version. The base mobile GPU is going to struggle pushing that many pixels.  




 They are better, but if you run the computer at the quasi full HD resolution you will get the occasional dropped frames and sluggishness.  




 Monsanto has never sued over accidental cross pollination of their crops. 
  
About the Schmeiser case.  

 I'll quote the actual court case.
  
[In late June or early July of 1997, Mr. Schmeiser and his employee Carlyle Moritz hand sprayed Roundup around power poles and in the ditches along the Bruno road where it bordered fields 1, 2, 3 and 4. This was part of his normal weed control practice. Several days after the spraying, he noticed that a large number of canola plants had survived the spraying. To determine why the canola plants had survived the Roundup spraying, Mr. Schmeiser conducted a test in field 2. Using a machine sprayer set to spray 40 feet, he sprayed Roundup on a section of field 2 in a strip along the road. He made two passes, the first weaving between and around the power poles and the second adjacent to the first pass, parallel to the power poles. He testified that by this means he sprayed a good three acres of field 2. According to Mr. Schmeiser's evidence, after some days, approximately 60% of the canola plants sprayed were still alive, growing in clumps that were thickest near the road and thinner as one moved into the field.[23]At harvest time in 1997 Mr. Schmeiser, who was then recovering from a leg injury, instructed Mr. Moritz to swath and combine field 2. Mr. Moritz did so, harvesting the canola in the field as well as the surviving canola along the roadside. The harvested seed was put into the box of a 1962 Ford pickup truck. The box was covered with a tarp and the truck with its tarped load of canola seed was stored in one of Mr. Schmeiser's buildings over the winter.[24]Mr. Schmeiser testified that in the spring of 1998 the seed from the Ford truck was transferred to another truck and taken to the Humboldt Flour Mill for treatment, a normal process to rid the seeds of disease before planting. The treated seed, mixed with untreated seed from his granary ("bin-run seed"), was planted in all or part of each of his nine fields, for a total of 1,030 acres.](http://decisions.fca-caf.gc.ca/en/2002/2002fca309/2002fca309.html)  
  
  
His crop did not magically become 95-98% RR canola purity overnight and the court realized this. Schmeiser was not sued over accidental cross pollination, but over intentionally isolating RR canola plants and planting the seed the following year.

The overall trend is striking. From 1980 until 1987, opium production only gradually increased. However after the defeat of the Soviets, opium production skyrocketed. This alarming trend was affected by a drought that occurred between 1995 and 1998. After the drought during Taliban rule, opium production surged to over 4,000 MT in 2000 (Blanchard 2009, 4). In 2001, the Taliban, caving into international pressure declared opium production illegal (Blanchard 2009, 3). This campaign was very effective, and in 2001, only 200 MT of opium was produced. But, in 2002, when the new, weak Karzai regime took control over Afghanistan, opium production increased and reached record levels, with an unprecedented yield of 8,200 MT, or 193,000 hectares in 2007 (Blanchard 2009, 4). The rise in the opium economy has created many opportunities for insurgent groups, militia, and warlords to finance their operations against one another.

  Trying to blame the life expectancy gap of wealth by saying it is due to obesity is a wild stretch.
  
I'm just saying that you haven't offered any evidence in defense of your original claim. Your data needs to be normalized to take into account obesity and socioeconomic status.  




 Considering that something like 80% of public schools in the US serve fast food
  
[Did you just pull that figure out of your ass? The actual figure is closer to 24%](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/business/SNDA3summ.pdf) 




 That doesn't prove what your quote is saying is true or not. Your data for expected life and income/education is not normalized to take into account obesity. There could be a chance that the reason why rich people live longer is due to that most are of a healthy weight, for we already know that obesity rates do in fact correlate with poverty and lack of education.  




 They are wrong, just by your weight alone puts you into a higher risk tier and any medical professional worth his/her salt should not ignore the pending risk. It would be like telling a smoker who appears healthy not to worry about the risk of smoking.

 You're doctor might not be aware of the current scientific knowledge on the risk associated with obesity. 




 In this large prospective study, obesity was strongly associated with the risk of death in both men and women in all racial and ethnic groups and at all ages. After we accounted for potential bias owing to preexisting disease and residual confounding by smoking status by using midlife BMI values and restricting the analysis to participants who had never smoked, we found that even moderate elevations in BMI conferred an increased risk of death. The risk among participants who were overweight at the age of 50 years was 20 to 40 percent higher than that among participants who had a BMI of 23.5 to 24.9 at that age. The risk among obese subjects was two to at least three times that of participants with a BMI of 23.5 to 24.9. The risk of death among underweight participants was attenuated.

 For the time being, but the fact that you are obese (BMI34) means you are at increase risk of chronic obesity related illness and disease. 
  
But over time, this group began to develop risk factors for chronic disease. After 10 years about 40 percent had become unhealthy obese, and by the 20-year mark 51 percent had fallen into the unhealthy category, the study found....This study suggests that obese people will eventually develop risk factors such as high blood sugar and bad cholesterol that lead to chronic illness and death, Bell and Freeman said.

To examine potential cancer risks in humans, we reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humans. We also reviewed relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. Seven cohort studies and fourteen case-control studies examined the association between glyphosate and one or more cancer outcomes. Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate.

 There is more to a good screen then just resolution. TN panels are cheap display usually found on budget netbooks, it's an insult that Apple is selling a $1000 machine with such a screen. The pro line on the other hand uses IPS which are vastly superior.  




  Isn't the point of a GMO is that you spray MORE pesticides?

Only herbicides, not insecticides like neonicotinoids. You can spray the same amount of neonics on GMO or conventional crops alike. 




 barely beats the 4-door saloon
  
It crushed it in the drag race, and on a track the difference would be even larger.  




 You said this.
  
Well the traditional approach usually limits the amount you spray because it can in turn damage the plant. GMOs are resistant to the pesticides, so they spray a LOT of them.
  
Which has nothing to do with the use of neonicotinoids. GMOs are not to blame at all for CCD.  




 Neonicotinoids are used on both GMO and non-GMO crops, there are no crops genetically engineered to be resistant to neonicotinoid application because neonicotinoids are an insecticide and not a herbicide.

 I was looking into replacing my old MBP with an Air, but the poor netbook quality screen pushed me off.  




 Except the Air uses a shitty TN display.  




 Pesticides known as neonicotinoids are commonly believed to be a contributor to CCD, Monsanto is not a manufacture of these chemicals. Companies such as Bayer and Syngenta are, blaming Monsanto in this case is idiotic. 




 [The link isn't as strong as is commonly claimed.](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118748) 




 You are being downvoted because you are wrong. 
  
The primary suspected cause of CCD are neonicotinoids which are an insecticide. They are applied to both GMO   non GMO crops alike and its application is not harmful to plants. 
  
Common GMOs are designed to be herbicide resistant or to produce their own pesticides in the form of bt-proteins. BT-proteins are not a suspected contributor to CCD.  




 Except none of Monsanto's products are believed to be a primary contributor to CCD.  




 Don't think any herbicide has been linked to bee die off.

 Though when the authority figure made a direct order to proceed with the experiment 100% of the participants refused to carry on.
  
[Furthermore, close analysis of the experimental sessions shows that participants are attentive to the demands made on them by the Learner as well as the Experimenter [38]. They are torn between two voices confronting them with irreconcilable moral imperatives, and the fact that they have to choose between them is a source of considerable anguish. They sweat, they laugh, they try to talk and argue their way out of the situation. But the experimental set-up does not allow them to do so. Ultimately, they tend to go along with the Experimenter if he justifies their actions in terms of the scientific benefits of the study (as he does with the prod The experiment requires that you continue) [39]. But if he gives them a direct order (You have no other choice, you must go on) participants typically refuse. Once again, received wisdom proves questionable. The Milgram studies seem to be less about people blindly conforming to orders than about getting people to believe in the importance of what they are doing [40].](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001426)

The data are inconclusive, therefore the claim (ie, conclusion) that Roundup Ready maize NK603 and/or the Roundup herbicide have a link to cancer is unreliable.

EFSA finds that the study as reported by Sralini et al. is of insufficient scientific quality for safety assessments. EFSA concludes that the currently available evidence does not impact on the ongoing re-evaluation of glyphosate and does not call for the reopening of the safety evaluations of maize NK603 and its related stacks.

  Consequently, the HCB Scientific Committee considers that the paper offers no information supporting the existence of a health risk associated with consumption of maize NK603, whether or not treated with a Roundup herbicide formulation.

**Conclusion on study Results**
  
[The significant results obtained before correction are not biologically coherent overall. However, biological data on the results would be needed to draw a definitive conclusion. At this point in time, in light of the information provided in the publication, the ECEAGs experts consider that the authors interpretations are not sufficiently corroborated by the study data. 
Moreover, during the hearing, the studys authors admitted that this study was not conclusive by itself and that, though subject to improvement, it had the merit of opening up an interesting line of research.

**TLDR:** Seralini's 2012 study is full of elementary mistakes and follows an inadequate protocol that fails to support the conclusions he makes. 




 So Monsanto is selling the same seed corn, world wide, which is all genetically identical.
  
They are not the same exact seed. The RR trait is commonly back crossed into existing plant lines, 




 Where in the article does it say that?

 They never made it criminal, they gave no binding voluntary guidelines for labeling back in 2001. 




 Luckily there are no sterile GMO crops on the market.

Yes, but it boils down to what extent of animal exploitation you are comfortable with. Frankly being 100% vegan is close to impossible, but I really wouldn't recommend allowing the perfect to become the enemy of the good.  




 I understand that there is no way to know 100% on anything, but in the case of almonds it's a pretty cut and dry case of being reliant on a domesticated/managed animal.  




 [Almond trees are pollinated by honey bees which are a non-native and domesticated incest which are trucked in from across the country.](http://www.almonds.com/growers/pollination)
  
In total, we observed 2416 flower visits by honeybees Apis mellifera
(70% of all visits), 378 by wild bees of at least 19 species
(11% of all visits), 327 by hover flies (10% of all visits) and 314
by other insects of various taxa (9% of all visits). Other insects
included flies (primarily Bombyliidae and Muscidae), ants
(Formicidae) and other infrequent visitors (Table S1, Supporting
Information). The most flower visits by wild bees were provided
by the ground-nesting sand bee Andrena cerasifolii
(Cockerell) accounting for more than 2% of all flower visits.
Sweat bees also frequently visited flowers, especially an undescribed
Lasioglossum (Evylaeus) species and Lasioglossum incompletum
(Crawford). These wild bees were present only in
orchards with nearby natural habitat. The blue orchard bee
Osmia lignaria propinqua Cresson, a species that could be managed
for almond production in California (Bosch   Kemp
2002), was only observed once.

 I meant you can. Plant patents have existed since the 30's and plant variety protection started in the 70s.  




 You can get a patent or PVP on an already existing crop, now if you modified the plant through conventional breeding or genetic engineering you can get protection on the newly created variety.

 Maybe you should read what you post. Bowman bought outbound grain and used glyphosate to select for Monsanto's trait. His actions were a willful and intentional attempt at avoiding paying Monsanto's licensing fees.  




 Polluting our food supply with their patented genes, and then seizing other farmers' crops when they test positive for those patented genes.

 What poisonous chemicals? 




 aggressively pursue farmers that grow these GMO crops despite the fact that they may spread their progeny naturally for miles around
  
Monsanto has never sued over accidental cross pollination, they only sue over willful and intentional isolation and growing without a licensee. Example being the case cited in Food Inc over Percy Scmeiser.
  
 I'll quote the actual court case.
  
[In late June or early July of 1997, Mr. Schmeiser and his employee Carlyle Moritz hand sprayed Roundup around power poles and in the ditches along the Bruno road where it bordered fields 1, 2, 3 and 4. This was part of his normal weed control practice. Several days after the spraying, he noticed that a large number of canola plants had survived the spraying. To determine why the canola plants had survived the Roundup spraying, Mr. Schmeiser conducted a test in field 2. Using a machine sprayer set to spray 40 feet, he sprayed Roundup on a section of field 2 in a strip along the road. He made two passes, the first weaving between and around the power poles and the second adjacent to the first pass, parallel to the power poles. He testified that by this means he sprayed a good three acres of field 2. According to Mr. Schmeiser's evidence, after some days, approximately 60% of the canola plants sprayed were still alive, growing in clumps that were thickest near the road and thinner as one moved into the field.[23]At harvest time in 1997 Mr. Schmeiser, who was then recovering from a leg injury, instructed Mr. Moritz to swath and combine field 2. Mr. Moritz did so, harvesting the canola in the field as well as the surviving canola along the roadside. The harvested seed was put into the box of a 1962 Ford pickup truck. The box was covered with a tarp and the truck with its tarped load of canola seed was stored in one of Mr. Schmeiser's buildings over the winter.[24]Mr. Schmeiser testified that in the spring of 1998 the seed from the Ford truck was transferred to another truck and taken to the Humboldt Flour Mill for treatment, a normal process to rid the seeds of disease before planting. The treated seed, mixed with untreated seed from his granary ("bin-run seed"), was planted in all or part of each of his nine fields, for a total of 1,030 acres.](http://decisions.fca-caf.gc.ca/en/2002/2002fca309/2002fca309.html)  
  
  
His crop did not magically become 95-98% RR canola purity overnight and the court realized this. Schmeiser was not sued over accidental cross pollination, but over intentionally isolating RR canola plants and planting the seed the following year. 
  
  
There was also the more recent OSGATA V. Monsanto case, in which OSGATA sued Monsanto over aggressive/bullying practices, the judge throughout the case because OSGATA could not prove their claim in court. 
  
  From the Court Case.  
  

[Taken together, it is clear that these circumstances do not 
amount to a substantial controversy and that there has been no 
injury traceable to defendants. We therefore do not have subject 
matter jurisdiction over this action, and it is, accordingly, 
dismissed](http://www.osgata.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/OSGATA-v-Monsanto-MTD-Decision.pdf)
  
Monsanto has actually sold these chemicals knowing that they are toxic both to humans, animals and the environment.
  
You're going to need a citation for this, but I believe you are talking about glyphosate/roundup which is generally safe and poses little harm to humans when properly used.

There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect related toglyphosatetreatment.

Note that there was a weak but slight association with multiple myeloma that the authors suggest that further follow up is required. Also this was among applicators who inherently are exposed to significantly higher amounts of glyphosate than end product consumers.

  
Also a re-analysis of the AHS data failed to show the same link between glyphosate and multiple meyloma.

Overall in terms of increase yields and decreased pesticide use Bt-cotton has been a significant plus to farmers in India. 
  
  
Also about suing farmers, Monsanto only sues over willful and intentional isolation of their license seed. They don't sue over accidental cross pollination. 
  
Also there is little evidence that Monsanto is aggressively going after farmers. Recently OSGATA a consortium of organic farmers attempted to preemptively sue Monsanto over aggressive actions, but the case failed due to lack of any evidence provided proving the claims against Monsanto were true.

 Stephen Ostroff has never worked for Monsanto. 




 Yes that's the current drug form GW Pharmaceutical, but that study was not blinded. It's the next stage that is planned to actually test for efficacy of the drug as a treatment for epilepsy.  




 Just under epilepsy most the the links were 404s and the only one that was at all relevant (blinded) had a really small sample and lack of statistical analysis.  




 How many of those are clinical controlled studies? 




 I'm just happy that my ideas are getting the mainstream attention that they deserve.  




 Alternative medicine is not marketed as a drug because it's illegal to do so the US. Hence why all herbal medicine comes with a disclaimer on the packaging.
  
 




 [I'd be shocked if either grew.](http://www.homedepot.com/catalog/productImages/400/d2/d21d4f32-78f9-4e2a-a3e9-dd99f8ef3057_400.jpg) 




 I disagree, I believe that its the governments responsibility to ensure safe guards when it comes to medication in order to ensure that there is a threshold of safety and efficacy taken into account. I don't believe that we should allow people to peddle snake oil and alternative medicine as scientifically effective treatments.  




 Are you saying those dozens of parents are lying and that it is just coincidental ?

  
Until there is actual controlled data we'll never know. It could be an actual effect, it could be confirmation bias, or it could be a placebo effect.  




 You mean supporting the current law when it comes to all medical drugs?  




 We should ban the marketing, selling, and prescription of herbal home remedies as an effective treatment for disease or illness.  




 I'm not talking about legalization of drugs, I'm talking about the use of a marijuana as medical drug used to effectively treat disease or illness.  




 A therapeutic index of 1. 




 There actually is a clinical trial being conducted at the moment looking into MMJ effect on seizures in children. So far there results look promising but the current completed phase wasn't blinded as it was only looking for safety of the concentrate/extract.  




  Just that things that only feel very good tend to be made more illegal than things just feel ok.

I think this is confirmation bias, for who cares about the things that don't make us feel good that are made illegal.  




 Again, my issue is with the use of it as a medical drug without the proper testing   studies. 
  
I'm ambivalent to its legalization and support removing it from its current DEA schedule 1 status. I'm against using it to treat disease and illness when there is no strong evidence supporting its efficacy.  




 Doctors and mmj clinics are prescribing and selling it as a drug in many states.  




 My stance is simple. MMJ lacks the required clinical evidence to support its use as a drug. Once proper testing is done I'd me fine with it being prescribed by trained professionals. 
  
You are the one who doesn't care about the actual evidence.  




 Yeah, because I desire adequate evidence before I want to see something marketed and sold as a drug.  




 [Citation Needed]  




 No one is claiming that jumping off a sky scraper is going to treat epilepsy.  




 And I agree, the punishments for marijuana use/possession are way to harsh and there is to much control over research of the plant and its chemicals.  




 Again, an anecdotal account is not sufficient evidence to base medical policy off of.  




 I don't believe marijuana is dangerous enough to be classified as a schedule 1 drug.  




 Deciding what drug to use to treat an illness or disease has nothing to do with DEA scheduling.  




 US isn't the only country, and many of these studies have been in the work long before the recent rounds of states legalizing it.
  
I'm not denying that there are too many regulations on the study of cannabis and its chemical derivatives.  




 And hundreds of families have traveled to Texas to be treated by Burzynski "medicine".  




 I don't really care what other people consume, I do care that people are marketing marijuana as an effective drug for treating hundreds of illnesses and disease without strong empirical evidence.  




 I'm not saying marijuana is bad for you, only that the evidence that supports its use as an effective medicine is weak.  




 GW Pharmaceutical is running trials in the US looking into cannabis as a treatment for epilepsy in children. They also have already put to market a cannabis based medication for the treatment of MS in Europe, and there are several trials looking into using it in cancer patients.  




 Nope, I just want some strong empirical evidence stemming from controlled clinical trials before I'm comfortable with selling anything as a drug. 




 Typo, I meant enema 
  
http://www.cancer-treatment-tips.com/coffee-enema.html 




 It's not, there are several on going trials as we speak.  




 Most illnesses that mmj is claimed to treat aren't support by controlled clinical trials. This is a fact. 




 We have anecdotal evidence that coffee edemas cure cancer and vaccines cause autism. Thank god we don't base medical decisions off these accounts. 




 You are making the assumption that this treatment is actually effective at treating seizures.  




 It's a lack of clinical controlled studies, the same threshold that any other new drug has to meet before it can be sold as a drug.  




 Studies are being done. 




 I'm against the current use of MMJ, from the lack of strong clinical data showing its efficacy to how it's administered/prescribed.  




 Self reported study and a case report. 
  
There is ample evidence to support further research of cannabis into treating epilepsy in children, but the evidence today is far short of supporting it as a proven medical treatment.  




 How? Evidence for the effectiveness of MMJ is lacking for many illnesses it is claimed to cure. Just because people have been using marijuana for "decades" doesn't make up for the lack of empirical evidence.  




 There's actually a current study going on that is looking into the effects of a MMJ extract on epilepsy in children.
  
[So far they have tested for safety of the extract and they are moving onto effectiveness of the treatment soon.](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/04/150413183743.htm) 




 No it doesn't.  




 It's not about not understanding the MoA, it's that most of MMJ health benefits are based on anecdotal accounts that are akin to snake oil and other alternative medicine.  




 This is what I believe, except it wasn't Cheney but NASA. For NASA was hiding the official tapes on how they faked the moon landing in the WTC, the Pentagon, and some random field in Pennsylvania.

I would say that Prince's transformation of these photos is way more creative and interesting then the originals.

[The largest comprehensive review on the data failed to find sufficient evidence that GMO bt-cotton was a major contributing factor to suicides of Indian farmers.](http://www.ifpri.org/publication/bt-cotton-and-farmer-suicides-india) 
  
We first show that there is no evidence in available data of a resurgence of farmer suicides in India in the last five years. Second, we find that Bt cotton technology has been very effective overall in India. However, the context in which Bt cotton was introduced has generated disappointing results in some particular districts and seasons. Third, our analysis clearly shows that Bt cotton is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the occurrence of farmer suicides. In contrast, many other factors have likely played a prominent role. Nevertheless, in specific regions and years, where Bt cotton may have indirectly contributed to farmer indebtedness, leading to suicides, its failure was mainly the result of the context or environment in which it was planted.  


[Here is the 2011 Version](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/jds/2011/00000047/00000002/art00007)

The analysis reveals considerable variation in trends in suicide rates across the nine cotton-growing states. The data, although not ideal, and the modeling do not, however, support the claim that GM cotton has led to an increase in farmer suicide rates: if anything the reverse is true.
The Indian farmer suicide story has become received wisdom for some anti-GM
campaigners. In fact, we find that the suicide rate for male Indian farmers is slightly lower
than the non-farmer rate. And Indian suicide rates as a whole, although contested, do not
appear to be notably high in a world context. The pattern of changes in suicide rates over
the last 15 years is consistent with a beneficial effect of Bt cotton for India as a whole
albeit perhaps not in every cotton-growing state.

  
  
Overall in terms of increase yields and decreased pesticide use Bt-cotton has been a significant plus to farmers in India.

  From areas that we have data, GMOs have been beneficial to developing nations.
  

[From a study which analyzed available data form the Philippines.](http://i.imgur.com/KXcsl0T.png)
  
Form their conclusion.  
  
[Using farm-level survey data from the Philippines and quantile regression techniques that control for selection problems, we find that the effect Bt corn on yields is generally more strongly felt by producers at the lower end of the yield distribution. If we subscribe to the typical belief that lower-yielding producers are mostly poor smallholders (i.e., subsistence farmers), then the results from our analysis provides some evidence that Bt corn technology has benefited poor corn farmers in the Philippines through higher relative yield effects as compared to the more commercial producers at the upper end of the yield distribution. It is likely that the proportionately higher yield effect observed for poor smallholders is made possible by the damage abating property being embedded within the Bt technology. This suggests that Bt technology does not require substantial levels of technical skills and learning for it to be an effective insect control technology (i.e., as compared to, say, some Integrated Pest Management control practices that require season-long Farmer Field School training to effectively implement).](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306919213001395)  
  
  
Also the net effect of Bt-cotton has mostly been favorable to farmers in India. . . 
 
 
  
The role of genetically modified (GM) crops for food security is the subject of public controversy. GM crops could contribute to food production increases and higher food availability. There may also be impacts on food quality and nutrient composition. Finally, growing GM crops may influence farmers income and thus their economic access to food. Smallholder farmers make up a large proportion of the undernourished people worldwide. Our study focuses on this latter aspect and provides the first ex post analysis of food security impacts of GM crops at the micro level. We use comprehensive panel data collected over several years from farm households in India, where insect-resistant GM cotton has been widely adopted. Controlling for other factors, the adoption of GM cotton has significantly improved calorie consumption and dietary quality, resulting from increased family incomes. This technology has reduced food insecurity by 1520% among cotton-producing households. GM crops alone will not solve the hunger problem, but they can be an important component in a broader food security strategy.

 Bt cotton has reduced pesticide applications by 50%, with the largest reductions of 70% occurring in the most toxic types of chemicals. Results of fixed-effects Poisson models confirm that Bt has notably reduced the incidence of acute pesticide poisoning among cotton growers. These effects have become more pronounced with increasing technology adoption rates. Bt cotton now helps to avoid several million cases of pesticide poisoning in India every year, which also entails sizeable health cost savings.

We address this shortcoming by
analyzing economic impacts and impact dynamics of Bt cotton in
India. Building on unique panel data collected between 2002 and
2008, and controlling for nonrandom selection bias in technology
adoption, we show that Bt has caused a 24% increase in cotton
yield per acre through reduced pest damage and a 50% gain in
cotton pro
fi
t among smallholders. These bene
fi
ts are stable; there
are even indications that they have increased over time. We
further show that Bt cotton adoption has raised consumption
expenditures, a common measure of household living standard, by
18% during the 2006

2008 period. We conclude that Bt cotton has
created large and sustainable bene
fi
ts, which contribute to posi-
tive economic and social development in India.

Accounting for possible selection bias, we show that the Bt pesticide reducing effect has been sustainable. In spite of an increase in pesticide sprays against secondary pests, total pesticide use has decreased significantly over time. Bt has also reduced pesticide applications by non-Bt farmers. These results mitigate the concern that Bt technology would soon become obsolete in small farmer environments. The survey data on actual pesticide use in farmers fields complement previous entomological research.

  There is a broad literature on the impact of Bt cotton adoption in different countries, but few studies have explicitly looked at environmental and health effects from an economic perspective. We analyse the impact of Bt cotton on environmental efficiency in Pakistan, using farm survey data and a doubly heteroskedastic stochastic production function framework. Negative environmental and health effects of chemical pesticide use are quantified with the environmental impact quotient. Bt-adopting farms have higher cotton yields, while using lower pesticide quantities and causing less environmental damage. Bt farms are both technically and environmentally more efficient than non-Bt farms. Bt adoption increases environmental efficiency by 37%. Achieving the same reduction in negative environmental and health impact without Bt would cost conventional cotton farmers US$ 54 per acre in terms of foregone yields and revenues (7% of total revenues). Extrapolating this shadow price of the technology's health and environmental benefits to the total Bt cotton area in Pakistan results in an aggregate value of US$ 370 million. These benefits are in addition to the profit gains for Bt-adopting farmers. Our results suggest that Bt technology can contribute to sustainable agricultural development.

 You're wrong, Bowman wasn't in Food Inc. Percy Schmeiser was.
  
Though Schmeiser also wasn't sued over cross pollination. 
  
 I'll quote the actual court case.
  
[In late June or early July of 1997, Mr. Schmeiser and his employee Carlyle Moritz hand sprayed Roundup around power poles and in the ditches along the Bruno road where it bordered fields 1, 2, 3 and 4. This was part of his normal weed control practice. Several days after the spraying, he noticed that a large number of canola plants had survived the spraying. To determine why the canola plants had survived the Roundup spraying, Mr. Schmeiser conducted a test in field 2. Using a machine sprayer set to spray 40 feet, he sprayed Roundup on a section of field 2 in a strip along the road. He made two passes, the first weaving between and around the power poles and the second adjacent to the first pass, parallel to the power poles. He testified that by this means he sprayed a good three acres of field 2. According to Mr. Schmeiser's evidence, after some days, approximately 60% of the canola plants sprayed were still alive, growing in clumps that were thickest near the road and thinner as one moved into the field.[23]At harvest time in 1997 Mr. Schmeiser, who was then recovering from a leg injury, instructed Mr. Moritz to swath and combine field 2. Mr. Moritz did so, harvesting the canola in the field as well as the surviving canola along the roadside. The harvested seed was put into the box of a 1962 Ford pickup truck. The box was covered with a tarp and the truck with its tarped load of canola seed was stored in one of Mr. Schmeiser's buildings over the winter.[24]Mr. Schmeiser testified that in the spring of 1998 the seed from the Ford truck was transferred to another truck and taken to the Humboldt Flour Mill for treatment, a normal process to rid the seeds of disease before planting. The treated seed, mixed with untreated seed from his granary ("bin-run seed"), was planted in all or part of each of his nine fields, for a total of 1,030 acres.](http://decisions.fca-caf.gc.ca/en/2002/2002fca309/2002fca309.html)  
  
  
His crop did not magically become 95-98% RR canola purity overnight and the court realized this. Schmeiser was not sued over accidental cross pollination, but over intentionally isolating RR canola plants and planting the seed the following year.

 They also keep claiming Roundup is 100% safe for human consumption and the environment, because Glyphosate[1] is very toxic to non-human entities. Our environment is just as important.

so why does Monsanto keep pushing it here? Other countries that DO need it aren't getting enough of it.
  
There has been a push for GMOs in many countries from India to the Philippines and in all instances it has shown to be a plus to local farmers from increase yields to decrease pesticide exposure. The issue is that GMOs have unfortunately become a political talking point and many countries that could gain from their use have decided to ban and halt their use.

What one? And there is little evidence that glyphosate is actually causing cancer in humans.
  
  
 IARC's findings are not a risk assessment, they didn't look at the actual risk of getting cancer from glyphosate exposure. Their classification and findings are based off if they believe it can from the available evidence. A chemical could cause cancer in 1:1billion people or 1:10 people and they can be classified under the same group.
  
When you look at human and animal studies the risk of glyphosate is overblown even among high risk groups such as applicators.
  
[Evaluation of carcinogenic potential of the herbicide glyphosate, drawing on tumor incidence data from fourteen chronic/carcinogenicity rodent studies](http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10408444.2014.1003423)
  
There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect related to glyphosate treatment. The lack of a plausible mechanism, along with published epidemiology studies, which fail to demonstrate clear, statistically significant, unbiased and non-confounded associations between glyphosate and cancer of any single etiology, and a compelling weight of evidence, support the conclusion that glyphosate does not present concern with respect to carcinogenic potential in humans.

Note that there was a weak but slight association with multiple myeloma that the authors suggest that further follow up is required. Also this was among applicators who inherently are exposed to significantly higher amounts of glyphosate than end product consumers.

  
Also a re-analysis of the AHS data failed to show the same link between glyphosate and multiple meyloma.

To examine potential cancer risks in humans, we reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humans. We also reviewed relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. Seven cohort studies and fourteen case-control studies examined the association between glyphosate and one or more cancer outcomes. Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate.

 It was more then just several scientist sending letters, virtually every major health and safety department from Europe to Brazil wrote up a report highlighting all the faults and errors in the original 2012 study.

EFSA finds that the study as reported by Sralini et al. is of insufficient scientific quality for safety assessments. EFSA concludes that the currently available evidence does not impact on the ongoing re-evaluation of glyphosate and does not call for the reopening of the safety evaluations of maize NK603 and its related stacks.
 
  
[Here is Health Canada's response.](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/gmf-agm/seralini-eng.php)

[Food Standards Australia/New Zealand](http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/consumer/gmfood/seralini/pages/default.aspx)  
  

  
On the basis of the many scientific deficiencies identified in the study, FSANZ does not accept the conclusions made by the authors [Seralini et al] and has therefore found no justification to reconsider the safety of NK603 corn

  Consequently, the HCB Scientific Committee considers that the paper offers no information supporting the existence of a health risk associated with consumption of maize NK603, whether or not treated with a Roundup herbicide formulation. 

[ANSES Opinion](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/2986ax1.pdf)

**Conclusion on study Results**
  
[The significant results obtained before correction are not biologically coherent overall. However, biological data on the results would be needed to draw a definitive conclusion. At this point in time, in light of the information provided in the publication, the ECEAGs experts consider that the authors interpretations are not sufficiently corroborated by the study data. 
Moreover, during the hearing, the studys authors admitted that this study was not conclusive by itself and that, though subject to improvement, it had the merit of opening up an interesting line of research.

 They do such as Bt-crops. Glyphosate is a herbicide and so it kills plants not insects. 




 Because they are a simplified model and shouldn't be used as the sole evidence for determining if something poses a significant risk in humans, especially when you have animal studies along with human studies to draw from.  




 Of the studies that I have linked to what ones are falsified or have been disproven by more recent research? 




 No one.  




 Cell cultures are not the only way to asses toxicity.  




 Yes, it does, but it classifies glyphosate as probably carcinogenic which is a completely different category.

  
They are not completely different categories as they are merely in different subcategories of Group 2 classification.   




 In cell cultures.  




 The organization is mentioned in the article and is the reason for the current ban.

There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect related to glyphosate treatment. The lack of a plausible mechanism, along with published epidemiology studies, which fail to demonstrate clear, statistically significant, unbiased and non-confounded associations between glyphosate and cancer of any single etiology, and a compelling weight of evidence, support the conclusion that glyphosate does not present concern with respect to carcinogenic potential in humans.

To examine potential cancer risks in humans, we reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humans. We also reviewed relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. Seven cohort studies and fourteen case-control studies examined the association between glyphosate and one or more cancer outcomes. Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate.

 Again, a single anecdotal account is hardly evidence.  




 There's a clinical trial going on right now in the U.S. looking at its effectiveness with treating seizures in children. 




 I was always asking for strong clinical controlled studies proving mmj effectiveness, the same threshold required for all drugs.  




 The issue with the current research on seizures is that the studies are small and not controlled. Which is fine for supporting further research, but not proving efficacy. 




 None of those are control clinical studies.  




 Maybe you wont because there are very few studies showing efficacy of mmj.  




 What studies? Please provide links to controlled clinical data showing cannabis effectiveness curing or treating disease/illness.  




 Anecdotal accounts are hardly compelling evidence.

 A lot of shit has been used for thousands of years, but that isn't proof that it is an effective medical treatment.  




 They can still gain exclusivity on it.  




 Except there is no Ferrari team at Le Mans 




 I noticed the Ferrari reference, but I wonder if Ford knows that Ferrari doesn't actually have a factory team at Le Mans anymore.

 You either have the creative urge or you don't. 
  
So it's the "urge" that make it art? So if Richard Prince had the "urge" to take comment and take photos off instagram then he's an artist right? Cause he had the "urger" right? So if someone who paints or takes photos purely to make money like a wedding photographer or a portrait painter then cause they lack the "urger" they are not true artist?  
  
So to reiterate, this crappy excuse of art is just some guy downloading other people's work, making insignificant changes that change absolutely nothing about the main focus of the piece
  
Why are they insignificant changes and how is the main focus unchanged?

Is he actually violating copyright? How is this work not protected under fair use as appropriation art?

[The largest comprehensive review on the data failed to find sufficient evidence that GMO bt-cotton was a major contributing factor to suicides of Indian farmers.](http://www.ifpri.org/publication/bt-cotton-and-farmer-suicides-india) 
  
We first show that there is no evidence in available data of a resurgence of farmer suicides in India in the last five years. Second, we find that Bt cotton technology has been very effective overall in India. However, the context in which Bt cotton was introduced has generated disappointing results in some particular districts and seasons. Third, our analysis clearly shows that Bt cotton is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the occurrence of farmer suicides. In contrast, many other factors have likely played a prominent role. Nevertheless, in specific regions and years, where Bt cotton may have indirectly contributed to farmer indebtedness, leading to suicides, its failure was mainly the result of the context or environment in which it was planted.

The analysis reveals considerable variation in trends in suicide rates across the nine cotton-growing states. The data, although not ideal, and the modeling do not, however, support the claim that GM cotton has led to an increase in farmer suicide rates: if anything the reverse is true.
The Indian farmer suicide story has become received wisdom for some anti-GM
campaigners. In fact, we find that the suicide rate for male Indian farmers is slightly lower
than the non-farmer rate. And Indian suicide rates as a whole, although contested, do not
appear to be notably high in a world context. The pattern of changes in suicide rates over
the last 15 years is consistent with a beneficial effect of Bt cotton for India as a whole
albeit perhaps not in every cotton-growing state.

  
  
Overall in terms of increase yields and decreased pesticide use Bt-cotton has been a significant plus to farmers in India.

 Dr. Perlak I first want to thank you for doing this AMA as I believe a lot of the concerns/fears of GMO is one rooted in a lack of dialogue between the public and the scientist behind this technology.
  
My first question is back in 1999 there was [this](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB919722577962514000) article in the WSJ about how Monsanto has a buddy system in which they pair up a scientist with someone from marketing/finance. Amsuingly you are mentioned in the 1999 WSJ article. My question is, does the buddy system still exist at Monsanto, and what is/was your opinion on the system?
  
Second question/s are on behalf of /u/MennoniteDan who unfortunely can't post himself due to doing some actual farm work.
  
A)Can you explain the process of discovery, and implementation, of the genetics behind the new Xtend series soybeans?"

B)"What changes in formulation has Monsanto (and BASF) made to the dicamba in Roundup Xtend, in order to lessen the chance of volatilization? I farm near crops that are very sensitive to dicamba (cucumbers, peppers, peas, tobacco and ginseng) ."
  
Edit: One last question.
  
Do you think that the current regulatory environment and public opinion on genetic engineering has negatively impacted research into genetically engineered crops? And if so what do you believe would be a good way to address this issue?
 




 Their genetically modified food is apparently causing most of the human cancers found
  
There is no strong evidence linking GMOs to cancer. 




 The real joke is that all the comments in that thread and the actual AMA are scripted paid Monsanto super secret employees. It's shills all the way down!  




 Cool, thanks for the insight.  




 Does anyone have a run down on what parts are plastic and what parts are metal? And what is the final weight of this controller?

They don't, this is a myth. 




 FDA has never approved a raw plant as a drug. Meth is a single purified chemical, even cocaine is not used as its raw plant form but just the desired purified chemical. 
  
The idea that eating an edible or smoking a blunt will ever be an FDA approved medication is absurd and I'm comfortable putting money on it that we will never see it happen. 
  
 




 Even if marijuana was not a schedule I drug the FDA would still not touch it in it's raw form let alone made into an "edible" with a 10ft pole.

 the most noticeable difference between a lower model 7 series and an upper model 5 series is size.
  
That's not really a fair comparison, you should look at similarly optioned cars. In the case of base models the 5 series is only 50k vs the 7 series 74k.
  
Most luxury cars that IIHS are in the 45-52k range with the sole exception being the new Maserati. 
  
IIHS have said they do not plan to test the Model S at all. wonder why.
  
Probably because the car is too expensive and has too low of sale numbers to justify it, if Tesla wanted to they can pay for a test of the car themselves.

To examine potential cancer risks in humans, we reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humans. We also reviewed relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. Seven cohort studies and fourteen case-control studies examined the association between glyphosate and one or more cancer outcomes. Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate.

 Just to clarify IARC's findings are not a risk assessment, they didn't look at the actual risk of getting cancer from 2,4-D exposure. Their classification and findings are based off if they believe it can from the available evidence.

 I totally agree. Saying plague isn't life threatening is like saying a bullet wound isn't life threatening.  




 [Here you go](http://i.imgur.com/PZyKJVE.png), of note for some of the graphs I couldn't locate all the rounds for Gears1 as they probably overlapped with other shots.
  
  
The only range that Gears Beta showed statistical significance was at far range. I still think sample size is too small to make any large conclusion though. 
  
Also my math was quickly done so double check it if you want.
  
Edit: How positive are you that each map holds the same dimensions? For if the map is a slightly bit smaller or larger that could have a drastic effect on spread.  




 I'd say 40% more GPU power is more then slightly.  




 At least I won't die from ass cancer or heart failure.

  
Meat is a risk factor, it's not necessarily a cause. You can still get ass cancer or have heart failure if you don't eat meat.  




 The issue wasn't the type of rat used, it was that the sample size was far too small for the duration ran. Testing for carciongencity with this type of rat requires 50+ rodents per group/sex, Seralini decided on using only 10 per group/sex.  




 You need more shots per group and actually measure the distance from the center each pellet lies. That way you can do the calculations and see if the spread difference between the games is statistically significant.

A chemical could cause cancer in 1:1billion people or 1:10 people and they can be classified under the same group.
  
The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment which conducted a risk assessment on behalf of the EU found glyphosate to be non-carcinogenic and they recently made a statement in [response to the IARCs finding.](http://www.bfr.bund.de/cm/349/does-glyphosate-cause-cancer.pdf)
  
The new IARC classification for glyphosate as a carcinogenic substance is based firstly on
limited evidence in humans. This risk is derived from three epidemiological studies in the
USA, Canada and Sweden based on a statistical correlation between exposure to glyphosate
and an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. However, this assessment was not confirmed
in a very large cohort of the also cited "Agricultural Health Study" or in other studies. A
recent publication from 2012 has reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether
exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humans and the relevant
methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. The review found non-consistent
patterns of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer or any
site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate. The current report of BfR to the EU based
on the evaluation of over 30 epidemiological studies came to the overall assessment that
there is no validated or significant relationship between exposure to glyphosate and an increased
risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma or other types of cancer.

 Not even close. The low production rate is between 95-115million per plane (without engine). The price is planned to come down when the plane actually enters full production.  




 but you already know thats not true by the number of rats used. why do you misinform people so much while claiming to be a champion of science?
  
It was neither a chronic toxicity study due to the duration and number of rats that where used. His study differed more from a chronic toxicity study then it did for a carcinogencity study. 
  
again, you already know he modelled the test after monsantos. 
  
No he didn't, duration was way too long and sample size was way to small to be able to gain any meaningful data. Monsanto looked at sub chronic toxicity and Seralini just through shit at the wall and hoped something stuck. 
  
if he use wistar rats like many other carcinogenity studies amd presented tumors as evidence you might
  
Wistar and SD rats are both commonly used for testing either toxicity or carcinogencity. 
  
And he did in fact present his findings on tumor prevalence as evidence against both glyphosate and GMO feed [despite not running any statistical analysis](http://i.imgur.com/F3MtjXB.png), maybe you should actually read the paper?
  
Suffering inducing euthanasia and deaths corresponded mostly
in females to the development of large mammary tumors. These
appeared to be clearly related to the various treatments when
compared to the control groups. These tumors are generally known
to be mostly estrogen-dependent (Harvell et al., 2000). We observed
a strikingly marked induction of mammary tumors by R
alone, a major formulated pesticide, even at the very lowest dose
administered
  
...
  
  
Interestingly, in the groups of animals fed with the NK603 without
R application, similar effects with respect to enhanced tumor
incidence and mortality rates were observed. 
  

 




 Tumor prevalence was a major finding of his study and any toxicologist worth his shit would be aware of the rate of spontaneous tumors in SD rats when taken out to 18+ months. Again, there is little reason anyone would run a rat study with SD rats out to 2 years unless you were looking for carcinogencity. Chronic toxicity is usually 1 year at 20 rats per sex per group (OECD 452). Seralini didn't not follow protocol for any international recognized toxicity study, his protocol and how he reported his findings most matched a carcinogencity trial. 
  
The only person misinformed is you and your pestering that Seralini's study actually means anything in terms of GMO safety. There is a reason why the study was retracted and many health and safety boards published their own independent reviews citing faults and errors in it.

Seralini ran a bastardization between a sub chronic toxicity study and a carcinogenicity study, with using only 10 rats per sex per group and running it for 2 years.  
  
Also Seralini did not run any statistical analysis on mortality or tumor prevalence. His data, due to sample size and short duration was inadequate to determine if any of his observed effects were statitically significant.

EFSA finds that the study as reported by Sralini et al. is of insufficient scientific quality for safety assessments.

 Our primary finding provides initial longitudinal evidence that cannabis use might elevate the risk of lung cancer.

  There were 79 cases of lung cancer and 324 controls. The risk of lung cancer increased 8% (95% CI 2% to 15%) for each joint-year of cannabis smoking, after adjustment for confounding variables including cigarette smoking, and 7% (95% CI 5% to 9%) for each pack-year of cigarette smoking, after adjustment for confounding variables including cannabis smoking. The highest tertile of cannabis use was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer RR=5.7 (95% CI 1.5 to 21.6), after adjustment for confounding variables including cigarette smoking.

 Of sixteen agitated depressions twelve recovered sufficiently to live in their own homes, and continue to live at home in a relatively satisfactory degree of emotional adjustment.

The bimedial procedure gave the best results, in that 54% of these patients were working full time and productively five years after operation. The corresponding figures for the bilateral and unilateral groups were 33% and 29%. These results were striking, since these were all patients whose mental illness had been unremitting for at least 2 1/2 years before surgery and had been refractory to insulin coma, electric shock treatment, and intensive psychotherapy. 




 Because it was a an effective treatment for dealing with certain psychological diseases before the introduction of an effective drug for dealing with the same disease.

 Autozeitung (German car magazine) test track times really highlight how the P85D is lacking in certain areas.
  
The Tesla laps their track a hair faster then a Porsche Cayenne S and the same time as a 4 year old 535i.  




 He should have double downed and claimed that you stole his work.  




 [BMI and BF% correlate fairly well together for the vast majority of the population.](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/89/2/500.full) 




 It's because for the vast majority of the population BMI is a good and simple tool to guide someones health in relationship to their weight. Yes, there are some very small groups who are outliers, but that's hardly justification to remove an effective tool.  




 Lack of lap times is a bit disappointing.

 Except the leveling system, in which you are a GOD one minute and dead the next.  




 The P85D is only about 3-5mph faster in the quarter then the P85S despite having more torque and horsepower. 
  
The P85D takes over 18 seconds to get to 135mph.  




 it would still have no problems doing a quarter mile in less than 10 seconds.
  
  
I really don't think this car will easily get under 10sec through the quarter mile, gear starts to become a huge issue for electric cars as you gain in speed. 
  

 




 My guess is similar to the new Model S, with maybe a tenth saved off in 0-60 rush and .5 sec shaved off in the quarter. I'd be shocked if the car can pull more then 125mph in the quarter mile and do well on a track unless Tesla invest a lot into cooling. 
  
Frankly I'd be impressed if the car can run comparable to a 911 turbo on a track, and I'm confident that it will be far off future hyper cars that will be out by then.  




 Quickest through 60mph and the quarter mile, not fastest though.

 THC and Dronabinol are structurally the same chemical and both are technically schedule I drugs. The weird thing is that Dronabinol in sesame seed oil "Marinol" and approved by the FDA is classified as a schedule III drug.  




 MARINOL (Dronabinol) Capsules is one of the psychoactive compounds present in cannabis, and is
abusable and controlled [Schedule III (CIII)] under the Controlled Substances Act. Both psychological
and physiological dependence have been noted in healthy individuals receiving dronabinol, but
addiction is uncommon and has only been seen after prolonged high dose administration. 
  
Cannabis != THC
  
Edit: Did some looking into it and turns out that THC/Dronabinol is still a Schedule I unless it's in sesame seed oil and approved by the FDA...then it's schedule III.

[Here is a very simple graph on suicides in India.](http://i.imgur.com/FovwdC0.png) 
  
  
[The largest comprehensive review on the data failed to find sufficient evidence that GMO bt-cotton was a major contributing factor to suicides of Indian farmers.](http://www.ifpri.org/publication/bt-cotton-and-farmer-suicides-india) 
  
We first show that there is no evidence in available data of a resurgence of farmer suicides in India in the last five years. Second, we find that Bt cotton technology has been very effective overall in India. However, the context in which Bt cotton was introduced has generated disappointing results in some particular districts and seasons. Third, our analysis clearly shows that Bt cotton is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the occurrence of farmer suicides. In contrast, many other factors have likely played a prominent role. Nevertheless, in specific regions and years, where Bt cotton may have indirectly contributed to farmer indebtedness, leading to suicides, its failure was mainly the result of the context or environment in which it was planted.  


[Here is the 2011 Version](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/jds/2011/00000047/00000002/art00007)
  

  
  
[And a more recent report.](http://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2014/03/05/new-research-paper-gm-cotton-in-india-has-probably-reduced-farmer-suicides-not-caused-them/#.UxqR46hn8Uu)
 
The analysis reveals considerable variation in trends in suicide rates across the nine cotton-growing states. The data, although not ideal, and the modeling do not, however, support the claim that GM cotton has led to an increase in farmer suicide rates: if anything the reverse is true.
The Indian farmer suicide story has become received wisdom for some anti-GM
campaigners. In fact, we find that the suicide rate for male Indian farmers is slightly lower
than the non-farmer rate. And Indian suicide rates as a whole, although contested, do not
appear to be notably high in a world context. The pattern of changes in suicide rates over
the last 15 years is consistent with a beneficial effect of Bt cotton for India as a whole
albeit perhaps not in every cotton-growing state.

  
  
Overall in terms of increase yields and decreased pesticide use Bt-cotton has been a significant plus to farmers in India. 
   




 No it doesn't. Your link is not looking at cancer risk from smoking weed. 
  
Our primary finding provides initial longitudinal evidence that cannabis use might elevate the risk of lung cancer. In light of the widespread use of marijuana, especially among adolescents and young adults, our study provides important data for informing the risk-benefit calculus of marijuana smoking in medical, public-health, and drug-policy settings.

  
-[Source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23846283)
  

  There were 79 cases of lung cancer and 324 controls. The risk of lung cancer increased 8% (95% CI 2% to 15%) for each joint-year of cannabis smoking, after adjustment for confounding variables including cigarette smoking, and 7% (95% CI 5% to 9%) for each pack-year of cigarette smoking, after adjustment for confounding variables including cannabis smoking. The highest tertile of cannabis use was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer RR=5.7 (95% CI 1.5 to 21.6), after adjustment for confounding variables including cigarette smoking.

 UK already has marijuana derived extracts that are approved for the treatment of disease/illness.  




 Runyon was investigated under the assumption of illegally saving seed, Runyon refused to "cooperate" with Monsanto. There was no lawsuit over accidental cross pollination involved, and Monsanto just resorted to blacklisting him from buying their products. He can still by from other seed providers such as Bayer, Dow, Dupont, or Syngenta. He was not sued over accidental cross pollination.  


[Moe Parr was sued over saving seed and telling other farmers that it was "legal" to save Monsanto's patented seed. He continued this practice even after Monsanto informed him that he is not allowed to to this.](http://i.imgur.com/wtW4xjA.png)

 I'm not saying I'm right or not, but without some sort of quantification of headphone quality the hate on beats appears to be a circlejerk among audiophile and no something backed by concrete evidence.

http://www.innerfidelity.com/content/time-rethink-beats-solo2-excellent-page-2#sk2OCyKxg2tkYJc3.97

The real reason is that most jewelers/outlets sell diamonds on consignment form a wholesaler. When they buy used diamonds they have to fork over a large sum of capital and liability in hoping that they can sell it.

 Same thing holds for rubies, but they have even less of a use outside of jewelry.  




 You're second link doesn't actually support that cannabis doesn't increase ones risk of dementia.

 And that is pathetic on corvettes part. 




 Not likely, the previous P85S has cooling issues and is forced into a limp performance mode after a few minutes of being pushed.  




 But quarter mile times are only 6% quicker. 
  
The standard P85D is really slow to 155mph to begin with anyways at 35.8sec. Some perspective is that a M5 gets to 150mph in under 20secs. 
  
 




 Forza Jules 




 Because with a 280hp   AWD advantage the P85D was only 4mph faster then the old P85S. The new P85D only has 71 more horsepower so I'd be shocked if it gains anything more then 5mph in the quarter.  




 Tesla doesn't consume a gallon of gasoline for every mile it drives.
  
Even a F150 is getting well more then a gallon per mile.  




 Seeing has how the speed limit in the US is about 70mph then no car actually needs more then 150hp. But alas people like fast cars and when you make a fast car don't be surprise that it gets compared to other fast cars.  




 I'm talking about the old P85S, not the P85D.
  
  
Seeing that despite all the power and having AWD the P85D is only 4mph faster in the quarter mile then weaker P85S. 
  

 




 We are talking about a high performance car.
  
It's like saying you're an A+ student because you got a A+ in math while getting C's in everything else.  




 Extra weight.
  
And battery size determines how much energy you can draw and how much power your car will have. 




 I know, it's only 71hp more then the current car so I doubt it will be that much quicker in the top end.  




 Nearly a minute slower then a gas car from two years ago.  




 Unless they are adding substantially more power I doubt we will see more then a 5mph gain. The old P85s with 415hp was only 3.1mph slower in the quarter mile while lacking nearly 300hp, a ton of torque and being RWD.  




 I'm not talking about top speed, acceleration of the Model S drops off pretty dramatically at 100+mph. 
  
Some perspective the 691hp P85D has a quarter mile trap speed of 115mph.
  
A Ferrari FF which has 651hp has a quarter mile trap speed of 127mph.
  
BMW M5 with 575hp has a trap speed of 122.2mph.
  
Mercedes E63 with 577hp has a trap speed of 121.8 




 Weight is only one issue, cooling is the biggest concern. It's why the Model S can't lap the Nurburgring at full power, the batteries just get too hot. Also a good aero set up for a track is rarely a good one for increasing range.  




 
I'm not comparing it to a McLaren, I'm comparing it to other performance sedans like a BMW M5, AMG 63, or Porsche Panamera.
  

 




 Keeping large batteries cool when they are heavily push requires a lot of cooling. 




 Most likely that will only be for the top of the range Model X, I bet you the base model is going to be between 5-6s to 60mph.  




 The 918 does it in 2.2, the P1 and LaF don't mostly due to not having AWD and thus struggling to put down all their power.  




 Also just how much it struggles for grip at the low end, doesn't really catch traction for 2sec.  




 We are talking about a car that is marketed and sold as a performance machine.  




 But it's not a race car. It's simply a high-performance car.

  
I know, neither are any other car you can drive on the street. [But when a 400+hp is merely as fast as a 6 year old BMW or Ford Focus ST then I have a hard time calling it a performance car.](http://fastestlaps.com/tracks/laguna_seca.html) 




 except for the ability to run at full throttle for more than 10 continuous minutes.

  
Then we have very different views on what makes a car "high performance".  




 I'd be shocked if the next gen Roadster doesn't have the same issues that the old roadster and the current Model S do.  




 They are extremely high performance consumer cars. Not race cars.

  
Neither is any Porsche, M BMW, or AMG Mercedes yet all of them can easily manage a track day without issue.  




 Never going to happen, dropping the Gamebryo engine is going to really kill/hurt the modding community beyond the game.  




 Electric vehicles already match and beat the performance of high-end gas-powered cars at a similar price point, and it's likely a matter of time before they are competitive with low end combustion-powered vehicles.

  
In a straight line up to about 115mph, after that anything high end exotic is going to leave a tesla in the dust. On a track Teslas are really slow compared to their rivals due to overheating of batteries. They are hardly true performance cars and are more akin to straight line muscle cars of the 70s. Maybe once they can make an electric car that can actually hold up to a base 911 around a track will they become an actual performance car.
  
 




 Depends on how you define "quicker", Electric cars for the most part are one trick ponies posting insane low end acceleration figures. But beyond 0-60mph they tapper off real quick.  




 I hope they don't mind when I spit on the cash I will be paying with. 




 You know what, I'm going out tonight and I'm not going to tip! Not even a penny! 




 And that my friend is how /u/majornelson became /u/minornelson. 




 Over several years, the whole F35 program (development, procurement, maintenance/upgrades) which is about 50 years will cost us roughly 1trillion dollars in today dollars. Education is about 140billion every single year.  




 A whole lot worse. We spend 140billion+ a year on education while only about 20billion on the F35 program.  




 He's the one lacking evidence. 




 So then it needn't be removed from Schedule 1
  
Ideally yes. Nabiximol which is currently making its way through FDA required clinical trails for treatment of pain in cancer patients though unfortunately their last trail produce weak results. Though they are also proceeding with getting it approved for treating spasticity in MS patients, which it has already in approved for in the UK, Canada, and parts of Europe. 
  
The big advantage of removing cannabis from schedule 1 status will that it will allow more ease in letting pharmaceutical companies research and derive products for treating a greater spectrum of disease and illness. 
  

   




 We kinda do. There is a cannabis extract that showed a positive effect in MS patients in large clinical trails and there is a current trial going on in the US to see if it can decrease seizures in certain epileptic children.  




 I love anecdotal accounts!  




 It's cause we are independent contractors!  




 There is some evidence for pain relief that is promising, but the most recent large clinical trial for a cannabis derived extract had disappointing results. 

 

 http://news.yahoo.com/gw-pharmas-cannabis-drug-fails-cancer-pain-study-122308627--finance.html 




 You can still get FDA exclusivity on any drug, even those derived from marijuana. As of now there are several marijuana derived drugs in development or in human clinical trials.  




 but would that come across as irresponsible/weird to the clinicians?
  
Not at all, there are many reasons why someone would change their schedule for a medical appointment.

 "It has created a lot of confusion," Begemann said of the IARC cancer link finding. "This panel is going to review the data thoroughly, and they are going to make their findings available to everyone for review."

Monsanto said the process and the findings will be independent and will be transparent. But the company said it would be involved in providing information and data for the review.
  
If their findings are open and transparent I really don't see what's the big deal about Monsanto seeking out a review by an independent party.
  
 




 There's a lot of evidence that runs contradictory to the IARCs opinion on their classification. It isn't really that surprising that Monsanto would want to seek out an independent review.

There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect related toglyphosatetreatment. The lack of a plausible mechanism, along with published epidemiology studies, which fail to demonstrate clear, statistically significant, unbiased and non-confounded associations betweenglyphosateand cancer of any single etiology, and a compelling weight of evidence, support the conclusion thatglyphosatedoes not present concern with respect to carcinogenic potential in humans.

We also reviewed relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate.
