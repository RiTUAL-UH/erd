 It's a good point, perhaps the phrase "transcription factor *recognition* site" should have been used, as is done in the abstract of the article, instead of "binding site". However I am not familiar with the distinction between the two. 




 That abstract is from an accompanying perspective article. The abstract of the actual paper in question is here:

 Exonic Transcription Factor Binding Directs Codon Choice and Affects Protein Evolution

 Genomes contain both a genetic code specifying amino acids and a regulatory code specifying transcription factor (TF) recognition sequences. We used genomic deoxyribonuclease I footprinting to map nucleotide resolution TF occupancy across the human exome in 81 diverse cell types. We found that ~15% of human codons are dual-use codons (duons) that simultaneously specify both amino acids and TF recognition sites. Duons are highly conserved and have shaped protein evolution, and TF-imposed constraint appears to be a major driver of codon usage bias. Conversely, the regulatory code has been selectively depleted of TFs that recognize stop codons. More than 17% of single-nucleotide variants within duons directly alter TF binding. Pervasive dual encoding of amino acid and regulatory information appears to be a fundamental feature of genome evolution.
 




 It does. The research article is [here](https://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6164/1367.full) and says that [codons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code), the three-letter codes in our DNA that stand for an amino acid in protein synthesis, can **simultaneously** code for an amino acid **and** a transcription factor binding site. [Transcription factors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor) control the expression of genes, i.e. turning them on or off. These dual-use codons, or "duons" as they have called them, represent the "second code" that OP's article is talking about. Even though I only just read it, it looks like a big deal. 




 Yes, and it seems that codon bias - the observed preference of some redundant codons over others - may be explained by these "duons", which would be one of the major findings of this paper from a molecular evolution angle. From the abstract:

 Duons are highly conserved and have shaped protein evolution, and TF-imposed constraint appears to be a major driver of codon usage bias.  




 The research article is [here](https://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6164/1367.full). As mentioned in OP's link, it seems that some codons (of which there are 64 in the standard [genetic code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code)), can simultaneously encode an amino acid and a transcription factor binding site. [Transcription factors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor), put very crudely, control how genes are turned on or off. The discovery of these codons with dual use, hence the term "duons", is very interesting.

 Yes DNA is still fragmented and assembled with PacBio's own proprietary assembly software HGAP. The advantage of SMRT is much longer read lengths (thousands of bases) compared to Illumina for example (50-150 bases). Despite the lower base calling accuracy of SMRT (although I hear the accuracy is getting better all the time) the longer read length helps with assembly greatly, and I can say from personal experience that this gives some *very* promising preliminary results for genome sequencing. 




 For clarity, it should be also noted that these technologies are just different ways of sequencing sequence fragments. No matter how long they are, especially for SMRT, they still need to be computationally assembled to recover an entire chromosome, for instance. Until someone can rapidly sequence an entire chromosome linearly from start to end, it is still "shotgun sequencing". 




 OK, perhaps in the future, but there's no way these technologies are routinely used for genome sequencing now, especially novel genomes, which was my initial point. 




 Huh? All next generation sequencing technologies sequence short random fragments of a larger DNA (or RNA, now) molecule, which are then assembled in silico to recover the larger sequence they came from. This is the essence of shotgun sequencing. 




 OP's link is explicitly about the project resulting in the first draft human genome, which finished in 2000. The X prize didn't start until 2006. 




 This is partly due to competition from Celera Genomics, Craig Venter's private company, whose improved method, shotgun sequencing, is now routinely used for genome sequencing. This article doesn't seem to mention this at all.

 I'm curious about the "Harvey Hotel" and "Lakeview Hotel" near Lachine. 




 Portuguese to english translation (via google with some formatting) for the lazy...

**Cetaceans, sex and sea serpents**

In 1741 the missionary Hans Egede published the report of a "terrible monster" seen at sea near the coast of Greenland. Accompanied by an illustration of himself which you can see below, would become a particularly famous story in the collection of stories about "sea snakes".

Over the centuries, various explanations have been suggested to the event, like the sailors might have seen a giant squid (Architeuthis) with a raised tentacles confused with a tail.
But Charles Paxton, University of Saint Andrews in England recently suggested a more interesting hypothesis. Paxton has received the Ig Nobel biology prize in 2002 for his study on the procession of excited to British farmers ostriches, so it's not so surprising that one of the ideas outlined by scientist to explain the story of Egede is that sailors have seen a whale penis.

Yes, a male whale of a species unknown to mariners, excited for some reason and taking his erect member - which can reach almost two meters long - confused by the tail of a sea serpent .One image, however, may be worth more than the past thirty-five words:

The suggestion is serious, and is contained in a paper published in the journal Archives of Natural History, "Cetaceans, fri   sea serpents: an analysis of the Egede accounts of a Most Dreadful Monster seen off the coast of Greenland in 1734".
At work, Paxton together with Erik Knatterud and Sharon Hedley, discusses thoughtfully:

*We do not have "absolute confidence" in our interpretation of the creature Egede. Nor are we suggesting that whale cocks are a universal source of marine sightings of snakes, although we believe that another sighting, the merchant ship Pauline in 1875 when a sea serpent as a White pillar? of views between various sperm? frantic with excitement? (Heuvelmans 1968; Oudemans, 1892), could be a mistake of this nature (penis sperm whales can be white (Harrison, 1938)) .In the case of Egedes, we assume that the use of facsimile snake and drawings were not completely accurate. If they were accurate, then the strongest objection to the interpretation of whale sighting Egede is evident the presence of teeth in the drawing.*

*Our explanation also assumes that the witnesses would not have recognized the penis of a whale and that some species exhibit their penises in the summer of Greenland. Hans Egede (1741 ,1745) described the great Manhood a whale but Egedes may not have realized that he could be seen at sea.*

*Despite these objections, even if the monster was an unknown species, characteristics suggest a cetacean diagnosed. In the end, we will never know for sure. Whatever Poul Egede had seen that day, be a loving whale, a whale without a tail or an unknown species, was a very unusual sight both then and today.*

Which brings us to another fascinating image comparing frightening medieval illustrations with casual pictures whales wildly excited. The first image of a whale penis in this note comes from this site, and second, this. You can also watch the video of a terrifying encounter with sea serpents fighting with whales, whales mating confused with this link .

 There are 69 story missions in GTA5. Here is a useful guide to them all:

http://gta.wikia.com/Missions_in_GTA_V

As we know, the order of most of these is optional. You can choose Michael, Trevor or Franklin (or sometimes a combination of the three) before each is begun. Of course, some can only be completed in order, such as the prologue and the ones involving Franklin at the beginning of the story. 

Let's make a very conservative estimate that only 30 of these missions are of the type that can be started in an optional order, and that there is a choice of only 2 before each. Then, there are

2 to the power 30 = 1073741824  **1 billion** ways to complete GTA5, depending on the order of missions.

What if the big easter eggs we would all like to see required someone to complete the story with one specific order of missions? Wouldn't that be the kind of elaborate puzzle that rewarded true fans, which Rockstar is likely to set up?

The chance of someone already finishing the game in the correct order yet is miniscule, and Rockstar needs to leave an elaborate clue about the order required. What in the game looks like it could provide those clues? **The Chiliad Mural**.

This post is an extension of the ideas started in this thread started by /u/Notaredditr from a few days ago:

http://www.reddit.com/r/chiliadmystery/comments/1wny24/my_mural_theorya_hunter_never_really_stops/

Basically, the lines and glyphs in the mural are a represntation of the GTA5 main story. the ufo is Michael, the egg is Franklin and the jetpack is Trevor. Thankfully the mural is to the right of this post, so you can follow along. Now, here are the key pieces of evidence that this whacky theory may be true and why I believe it should be investigated further:

* the line joining the ufo and the jetpack is the Prologue, because it is at the bottom of the mural and only Michale and Trevor are involved in it. As the story progresses, we go up the mural.

* After the Prologue, we start with Franklin (the egg). He goes up the first middle line, turns left, and eventually meets Michael (the ufo). Then they both come to the first heist, the Jewel Store Job, the first red X. Only those two are involved with that.

* The other red Xs are other heists. I come to the final heist in a bit.

* There are 4 lines which seem to leave the main set of lines, two of which even leave the "mountain" on the mural. These could represent the trip to North Yankton and Did Someone say Yoga, where Michael literally leaves the story, for a while.

* There are 6 heists in GTA5 but only 5 red Xs. The final heist is the eye at the top of the mural, representing the end of the story. What about the 5 lines on top of the eye and the two below? Well, after the final heist you can either kill Michael or Trevor. Those are the two lines below. In the Third Way, the five lines represent the first fight plus the 4 people you have to assassinate in that mission.

How does this relate to completing the missions in a specific order? I believe a good place to start thinking about this is to "travel" along the lines in the mural *which cover the shortest possible distance*. Beyond that, I believe someone with more familiarity with the "mission tree" of GTA5 might be able to identify more parts of the mural's lines, in order to confirm or debunk this theory. 




 Update: the man who was shot has died.

http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/man-dies-after-police-shooting-outside-montreal-bus-station-1.2521309 









 Ah you do indeed. My bad. 




 I should point out that under this theory, the line underneath connecting M/ufo and T/jetpack would certainly represent the prologue, since these two are involved in that. 




 Right, is it possible to complete the main storyline by "traversing" the lines in the mural with this idea of M/UFO, F/Egg and T/jetpack in a way that makes any sense? Perhaps by covering the shortest possible distance? This doesn't preclude some big payoff at the end. After all, it's "not how you won or lost, but how you played the game". 




 OK I'll bite. Could the Xs represent the heists? The first heist, Jewel Store Job, involves only Michael (UFO) and Franklin (Egg), it would be the X on the lower left, most connected to the UFO and Egg. The second last heist (Bureau Raid) also only involves these two, it would be the X on the upper left. The other three heists (Merryweather, Blitz Play and Paleto Score) involve all three characters, and could be the three Xs on the right. The final heist (Big Score) could be represented by the eye at the top, which represents the end of the story. "Come back when your story is complete". The lines in between these could represent the paths of the characters in between the heists, i.e. the intervening missions. Therefore the mural could be a graphical representation of the story.

 It also depends on the amount wanted. 25 grams of the L-glucose is $1565, way less than 25 times the price of 1 gram. For these amounts the "50% more expensive" stat will be more accurate. 




 Seems about right. You can buy a gram of L-glucose [here](http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/g5500?lang=en region=US) for $84.90. Gold is currently $42 a gram, so yeah at least 50% more than gold by weight.

Google tells me that there are 39 grams of sugar in a can of coke, so a can of left handed coke would cost over $3300.


^(edit: to all those pointing out that 84 is 100% more than 42: this post is intended as a back-of-the-envelope sanity check on the information in the post title. Hence "at least". Many factors can influence the relative costs, including the amount and source of L-glucose, as has been pointed out in comments.)

 It has become clear that there is an important eukaryotic component to the gut microbiome of ruminant mammals, mainly in the form of anaerobic fungi and protozoa.

If so, do they play an important role, with potential clinical implications? 









  The process by which the medication was made available to Brantly and Writebol is highly unusual. It may have fallen under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's "compassionate use" regulation, which allows access to investigational drugs outside clinical trials. Getting approval for compassionate use is often long and laborious. 

A sad fact is we're looking at years if not decades before this treatment is approved for widespread use after the requisite clinical trials, and even then it may be prohibitively expensive for use in Africa. I may be proven wrong, but I don't see it being distributed to the hundreds of sick in the current outbreak.

  I want to apologize for inconveniencing you while trying to protect the lives of millions.

Very true. What this quarantine is doing is protecting the political lives of Governors Christie and Cuomo. 




 This would be right if this quarantine *was* "protecting people from a seriously lethal threat". It isn't. Ebola isn't transmissable until an infected person is gravely ill. We knew that before, and we know that now. The *only* two cases transmitted in the US were nurses who treated patient zero Duncan near death spewing infected fluid everywhere, while wearing ineffective PPE.

It was the pathetic initial response by the CDC in providing the Dallas hospital with adequate protection that was a "seriously lethal threat" to these nurses. Thankfully they have recovered. What's happening now is a fearful over-reaction. 









 The study being referenced is [here.](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-014-2995-6/fulltext.html)

 This is what they should have done with Duncan when he was diagnosed. The Dallas hospital was *not* prepared for ebola - two infected nurses demonstrate that. 









 [This article](http://jezebel.com/5899815/how-does-ovulation-affect-a-strippers-income-it-doesnt) explains how the study behind this "fact" may be flawed. The sample size was way too small:

 Two researchers at UNM in Albuquerque studied dancers for two months. They studied 18 dancers. In one club, in one city. For two cycles.

Evidently, a **lot** more field research needs to be done on this phenomenon, before it can be confirmed.

 Serge Abrahamovitch Voronoff (Russian:   ; c. July 10, 1866  September 3, 1951) was a French surgeon of Russian extraction who gained fame for his technique of grafting monkey testicle tissue on to the testicles of men for purportedly therapeutic purposes while working in France in the 1920s and 1930s. 

(edit) and:

 By the early 1930s, over 500 men had been treated in France by his rejuvenation technique, and thousands more around the world, such as in a special clinic set up in Algiers.[15] Noteworthy people who had the surgery included Harold McCormick, chairman of the board of International Harvester Company.

 OK so make the rules unambiguous then. It *still* says, in the post:

 linking to a page that contains a video is not allowed.

I'm not being pedantic on purpose, but rules are rules, let us know what they are, and we will follow them. 




 I'm sorry but this is simply false. Here is the text of the new rules:

 (since we don't allow videos, linking to a page that contains a video is not allowed.)

either you need to edit it or explain why we can't post links that contain videos. 









 It has always been like this. Or at least since I have been on /r/science. The top comments are always variations of these themes:

- "There is nothing new about this. This has been known for some time."

- "Correlation does not imply causation"

- "Sensationalized clickbait title"

Most of the meaningful discussion happens when you scroll down. 




 I agree but sometimes a truly interesting study that belongs here is the meat behind a garbage title.  




 Quite a few headlines in science stories from the mainstream press would violate these rules. So if someone wants to post to /r/science they should adjust them accordingly, rather than use the same headline verbatim? (I agree with the notion, for the record.) 




 Here's the full study in Lancet Psychiatry:

 There's a lot of nonsense in this thread about maternal mortality and war, but if you read [the authors' own abstract](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/07/01/1421942112), it's very interesting that they seem to attribute the "mortality gap" to a reduction in infectious disease death rates. We all know that antibiotics have had a profound affect on health:

 The remaining excess male mortality may be explained by underlying traits of vulnerability to cardiovascular disease that emerged with the reduction of infections and changes in diet and other lifestyle factors. 

In other words, infectious diseases killed men and women equally prior to the 20th century, but since then, people lived long enough for the lifestyle factors of men relative to women to make a difference in mortality rates in middle age and beyond. 




 It looks like there may well be some indication of what you are talking about in this study's data. The first figure in OP's article (not the one with the US soccer team) shows a strange outlier of more men than women people dying in their early 40s, say 40 to 45, who were born from 1860 to 1879, compared to the other age cohorts. It's the dark blue part of the graph, and stands out quite a bit.

People who were born from 1860 to 1879 were 40 to 45 from 1900 to 1924. i.e. a large proportion of them were those ages during World War I. Given that we know WWI was catastrophically deadly, and that men were presumably fighting at or over age 40, *and* that this study used data from people in developed countries, I would not be surprised if that dark blue outlier in the chart is an artifact of World War I.

It may be addressed in actual paper, but I don't have access to it right now (paywalled). 




 *Sigh*

Look at the figure in this write-up of the paper - access to the paper itself isn't needed, it is paywalled. The values on the y axis are the male-to-female mortality rate ratios amongst various cohorts for deaths from age 60 to 90 **at those ages**.

Let's take the age 60 for example, as the text does. It clearly shows that a greater ratio of men to women die **at age 60** for those born from 1900-1935 (red and pale blue) than those born from 1800-1839 (grey and black).

This data has nothing to do with life expectancies **at birth**, which I agree, would be skewed by maternal mortality rates.
