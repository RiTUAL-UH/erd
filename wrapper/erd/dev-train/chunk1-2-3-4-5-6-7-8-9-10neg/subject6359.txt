 those classes aren't about actually learning art. they're about having fun and that's exactly what this guy did. 




 it makes no sense to me that everybody on here is claiming they have no problem with growth hormone and then simultaneously downvoting you for saying you wish it were socially acceptable. 




 his point is that nobody can deny that steroids are taboo among the vast majority of people and he's definitely right. he's just saying he wishes it wasn't the case and all you people are advocating hgh and then downvoting this guy for saying he wishes it were socially acceptable and that makes absolutely no sense regardless of where you stand on the issue.

 reminded me of the automatic pilot from Airplane 




 First off, I got my car brand new. this is in response to the guy who followed the car thief because he recognized the car from Facebook. Do people still steal newer cars? Can you get around the system and get different plates or if the theif sells, does the buyer then just drive the car unregistered to his name because I would think when you register it they'd catch you. I can't understand how stealing a car is worth the trouble.

 You are goddamn right. 




 THATS MY FUCKING COMMENT. BlockoManWINS is my other account.  




 think of it this way. when you have no friends you can wear a cloak out in public and not have to worry what people think. honestly cloaks look warm and comfortable as fuck. 




 I don't understand why your comment is acceptable and mine is not 




 got a place near there. I will definitely be keeping my eyes peeled! 




 infiniti logo is not just a circle with a triangle missing. it's a road going off into the distance. another obvious thing that took me ages to notice.

 there's no way this car is real. it's too beautiful. definitely just an urban legend.

 I made a sticky and sparten did a self post. everyone who bothered to respond liked it. 




 can confirm. One of those was me. 




 I'm not saying what he did was ok but you literally cannot mention his name now without an army of self righteous fucks suddenly pretending that they are above being upset about this. he was the carpet in the Big Lebowski. he held the show together which is why he did all the celebrity interviews. we are all sad that top gear as we know it is gone and it's oh so reassuring to me that people are so quick to demonize someone that they loved for so long. I'm done arguing about this. 




 so ALL those years of entertainment he gave you mean nothing because he made one mistake. because you're perfect and have never made a mistake. got it. 




 how about next time you leave constructive criticism instead of being passive aggresive

 I could see aquaman driving that 




 it was from a  post about sports so manly that they aren't in the Olympics or something. the guy is standing on a plank of wood being pulled by a 2 cowpower engine through some mud. the Scottish tree throwing thing was in there too.

 yeah with creepy statues and like... poems carved into trees. would be so cool 




 there are a couple issues with the font. text fields for submitting posts and the drop-down menu for "my subreddits" are too light so the font is hard to see. if I post the code will someone take a look at it?

 I tried to do that to mine and hed pee in the litter box but then hed perk his ears and launch himelf out, kicking litter everywhere, and sprint up to my roommates door where hed leave a pile of poo and just lay. I think he was just a jerk. 




 I watched a couple of them and he is extremely annoying. everything he says is redundant. it's a shame because I really like the videos otherwise 




 aw you jerks I just saw this today and was going to post it 
























 if I ever go bald I am going to march right over to gods house and take a poo on his sofa. 




 my dad was a weaver

 and now that dad is in jail nothing can take that away from us! 




 I won't claim to know how an octopus tank size effects its stress level I'm just saying that its intelligence won't have anything to do with the argument. it's a sedentary animal so if all its needs are accounted for it will stay put whereas a tang is highly energetic. it's like having a small apartment and putting a sleepy dog vs a nutty dog in it. they could be the same breed but the nutty one will be stressed and the sleepy one won't be bothered. 




 how does that make any sense? an animals territory size is in no way related to its intelligence. the only reason an octopus moves at all is to find food or mate. 




 I have an exam tomorrow and I'm going to get less than 5 hours of sleep thanks to OP. ain't even mad. 




 I'm down. let's bring a bunch of booze and figure out a way to turn this into the ultimate drinking game?

 I shall die in a pool of vomit, convulsing on the floor from heart failure but happy nonetheless 




 awww thank you sweetie I love me too :) 




 I'm going to make these for me because I love me so much :) 




 bb I'm bout to plug dis dongle in and charge u RIGHT up (    ) 




 and then a cartoon series based on the toy 




 how does this relate? particle accelerators are not that hard to understand. In fact I will explain to you right now how they work: shit is magic. 




 could you not? id like to keep my methods on the down low until it's published. 




 actually mammatus comes from the same root as mammary because these clouds looked like boobs to whoever named them. 




 I don't understand people like you. that's literally 1 bite of food. I have friends who will eat a hamburger and leave the LAST bite to waste and it makes me go ape shit. 




 it didn't smell at all it was just the taste. it's one of those things that I can see why people would like it but for the price id rather just have tuna or tako 




 marinade it first. delicious. 




 go to Greek Islands and try their octopus. it is absolutely phenomenal. my mom tells me that when I was a kid I refused to eat anything except pb j, hamburgers, and cold octopus salad 




 no way man the texture was great but it tastes the way a tidepool smells. oddly charming but all in all just bad. 




 an identified driving object? 




 my brain is struggling to turn that into a sex joke 




 incorrect. train_subject6359 shifts significantly faster with an average shift time of approximately 0ms. some say he shifts so fast that his lap times are negative. 




 I don't know that there is a wrong way to use it. 




 was he doing curls on the calf machine and going TSATT. HUNNNHHHH with every rep because if so I think you nailed it. 




 go buy as many lottery tickets as you can afford. someone upstairs has your back today. 




 I did a study the other day which conclusively proved that I don't like diet soda as much as I like regular soda and therefore regular is better. still waiting to hear back from the new England journal of medicine. 




 oooh ooh ooh that's a party foul. I wish you hadn't pointed that out. this is amazing otherwise. 




 the high rev is absolutely beautiful but I can't decide if my love for it outweighs my disdain for loud idling.

 that god damn thing is already louder than my 500w amp

 he's been living in the desert under a rock, watching reruns of 90s sitcoms no doubt. 




 because his light was about to turn green so in my haste I didnt realize the diglet was blocking part of the camera 









 just stop. nobody wants you here.

 maybe he's in Australia so when it turns upside down its actually right side up? 




 frankly I'm not sure 




 but who will clean the cleaner of the cleaner? 




 dead like your social life 




 people on reddit will go ape shit for the 800th ok looking girl to put a chicken on her shoulder but when a guy like you decides to poke fun at how tired this lame fucking joke is, you get torn apart for being bald. today is the day I unsubscribe.

 Do you not realize that YOURE a shitty enthusiast? There is nothing wrong with driving a Camry or a corolla. They're sensibly priced and fairly reliable.  




 True that. My first car was a shitty 95 integra and my second was a pretty nice 2005 TL. The integra was a blast because I always felt like I could die at any minute. The TL was a bit boring in comparison. 




 Looks like its past someone's bedtime 




 Having a car that you think looks like crap is awesome. You can park anywhere you want, drive carefree, and leave it on the street without worrying about teenagers fucking with it. I miss my beat up 95 integra sometimes.

 How dare you post Stlenhag without personally alerting me. You knew he was my favorite.

 I've been to reefs in 5 different countries and spent a week in a compound in Belize surveying one. And if I wasn't going into medicine I might have done marine biology. As for captive raising, eels are sedentary and the only reason they will even leave their burrow is to hunt so if the eel is placed in a tank with sufficient burrowing space and fed properly then it is irrelevant whether the burrow is in a tank or in the ocean or on the moon because it will not leave. I'm going to quit arguing here though because I know you're just going to keep nitpicking. 




 Please don't tell my dad. I don't want to get the belt again 




 I can't tell if you're trolling but he was captive bred and moved to a 500 gallon tank when he got too big. Keeping a saltwater aquarium isn't like keeping a hamster. It costs easily thousands and is an enormous time commitment and the people who are dedicated enough to get into it have actually contributed hugely to our understanding and awareness of coral reefs so maybe next time do your research before spouting bullshit about "horrible industry" and accusing people of not knowing what they are doing when you're the one who clearly has no idea what you're talking about. 




 Saw him at the pet store and told the guy "I need this" 




 I had a moray eel that I had to give up because he was way too big. He seemed thrilled with his new home which was 25 times bigger. I always wonder how he's doing since those guys live for like 40 years

 I always wish I didn't have a warranty do that I could do stuff to it without feeling bad but then I remember I'm broke. 




 I've never seen a street car that could make army green look good until I saw a c7 do it. Its like blake lively. You could throw a clown suit on it and it'd still make my heart flutter.

 More specifically, an amphipod eating all the crap in your tank is good because it prevents bacteria from getting at it and turning it into ammonia. Anything that slows down the decay process is good. 




 The water looks very cloudy. Either your filter is too high above the tank and its producing too many microbubbles or your phosphates or nitrates are off. The odds of a hitchhiker killing fish are almost 0 unless you get very unlucky and have tiny fish. 




 You're uh... You're beautiful...

 Quality control? If you outsource something as important as the motor and your manufacture starts cutting corners, especially with cutting edge tech like this, you're going to fuck yourself over. If one car catches fire you will never hear the end of it.

 Storytime. Some douche in an admittedly awesome supercharged mustang was driving around Chicago revving his engine and cutting people off and stuff so our cab driver in his Sorrento revved his engine at the stop light and then when it turned green floored it into the parking lane and overtook the mustang. The mustang guy was so pissed he parked outside the bar we were at and waited for at least 20 minutes. It was awesome.

 If you're gonna use filters with cartridges, its better to get two small ones instead of one big one.

 Can I blatantly repost this in 2 months and tell everyone that I made it? Awesome work man the black and white mountain goats are chilling on my lock screen right now. 
























 Half of the world doesn't get it haha 




 Woooow great joke bro. I am LITERALLY rolling on the ground laughing 




 if you like, theres more at http://www.train_subject6359.com. thanks for looking :) 









 They are the clowns of the dog world! Mine never stops derping 




 Around $40. Each frame cost probably $4  




 This makes so much more sense than my way 




 Haha it's just a joke. 400 degrees for 10 minutes with a pan of boiling water on the lower rack is what the internet said to do 




 Where the light touches the emulsion, it hardens to the screen. The part that a covered does not so you can then wash that part out and it becomes a stencil pretty much 




 Bangalore. Represent 




 This is so cool! Ah that skull. I'm an artist and I would love to have used that for something. 




 It was [based off a painting I did](http://i.imgur.com/s627PN7.jpg). I didn't know about the wendigo at the time but people kept asking me if that's what it was so I looked it up and god damn that is some cool folklore. 




 I was considering using 14k halides from my aquarium. Good thing it happened to be sunny that day :p 




 That depends on how fond of drinking beer and passing out in the sun with your dog you are. In other words, yes. 




 I'm sure it will work the same assuming you use ink that is meant for metal. I have a Gibson LPJ myself ;) 




 bulldog jammie borthers for life 




 I read online that they have to get above 320 Fahrenheit to cure properly. It's swampy as hell in Chicago too though. So glad I chose a tank over a tee haha 




 I've been doing some research on rigs. As an added bonus it will give me an excuse to go to home depot, my favorite store haha. If I can sell a few paintings this summer I will definitely make it happen 




 If I were to cook a shirt in the oven, I'd put it in a pan in a 400 degree oven with another pan of boiling water below it for 10 minutes but I would never do that, nor would I encourage others to do it. 




 I'm not sure of the mesh size but thanks for the info! I want to give multicolor a try later this summer I'll have to try and save up for aluminum. This one was just a simple design though so I felt like I could pull off doing it on the cheap 




 Should have clarified that. But I want to give multicolor a try later this summer 




 I cleaned it. That's strange I will have to see what happens with mine. Only used it once so far 




 Your jealousy is understandable 




 You can buy premade screens! You'll never know til you try 




 I used the oven. 2 washes in and the design is still looking like new. Just make sure you keep an eye on it if you do 




 I meant for a simple design like this. I'm sure it takes a while to learn multiple colors and finer details. Thanks for the tips! 




 I need them to be long so that they'll fit around the necks of my foot strangling victims 




 Wait what? I ate like half the jar 




 $12 for emulsion

$10 for ink

$4 for wood and screen

$7 for squeegee

$7 for transparency

So about 40 bucks I'd say 




 I like to bend it backwards when my thumb is pinned and insist that it's still up. Technically correct is the best kind of correct. 




 To be determined haha. Hopefully forever! 




 Yep I flooded this one. I'm looking into all that for the future. I just applied the emulsion with the squeegee but I don't like how it dripped 




 The sun hardens the emulsion so that it is not soluble in water 




 [is this normal](http://i.imgur.com/Ldejocs.jpg) 




 That and it also guides the screw in nice straight 




 Water based. The best way to make sure you don't destroy the emulsion is to let the water pressure do all the work. You can see mine has some rough edges but that's actually how the positive was. It came out almost identical 




 I considered doing that but this way is just so cool and science-riffic 




 I used the speedball fabric ink. I am 2 washes in and very happy with the results. 




 Thanks for the invite. I'll bring the beer 




 Hey I still have 2 screens left. Anything could happen 




 I skip leg day to screen print. 




 People like you are the reason I love the internet. 




 Any kind of heat as long as it exceeds 320 degrees. Safest way is to put a towel over it and just iron it 














 1st year medical student here, can confirm I know less than Chapped_Assets 




 I love his little leggies 




 Approximately infinty 




 His opinion is also wrong. 




 I dunno man that saint Virginia looks like she could have died a week ago and has no mask. I wonder how they did that 




 Dammit 




 That area controls motor and sensory functions, language, and probably some memory among other things but nothing particularly vital located in there so you could definitely survive that. It would just be a very rough life. The more important stuff is located in the basal ganglia and brainstem which are inside and below the brain.

Edit: whoosh :( 




 I agree about this piece and a lot of others but there is still good stuff here fairly often. If you come across an r/heaviermind let me know 




 Ironic you should say that because "whooooooa it's almost like I'm 14 again" is about as unoriginal as a comment can get on this subreddit.

 




 Nobody's forcing you to subscribe 




 This is true 




 Mwditerranean diet. Good luck finding a problem with that one. 




 I woke up in a certified preowned bugatti 




 Damn dude my friends live in Lakeview and pay around 700 each for 4 people. Living alone is pricey 




 I fully agree with you but when you throw around words like "stancefags" you kind of sound like a douche 




 My rule of thumb is that if you're wondering if it's a birstleworm or a fireworm then it's a birstleworm. Of it's a fireworm you'll know 




 I had a moray who could have easily swallowed my electric blue damsel whole but that fucker bullied the moray to the point where I had to take the damsel back to the store. They're bad news man 




 Keep an eye on it dude they invert their mouths to eat. Awesome and creepy

Edit: evert 




 I fucking love it 




 Jumping from like 10 feet is scary. Anticipating the ankle shock 









 Did Tampa let it go to waste or did chicago show them who's boss ;) 




 Wait I'm confused. So you carry the zeros and multiply it by 100 since its a percent so... in the end he gave him... a handjob? 




 A lot of heavy art uses antlers so I'm sure there's been something similar in here 




 I can show you the yellow king. 




 I agree, awesome art style. Looks like someone skips leg day though haha 




 I left my jeeyacket and my peeyants in my beeyackpeeyack 




 I am honored :) 




 there's just something otherworldly about them 




 Thanks man! Does look a little similar 




 Thanks man! I like to stick with black and white since I'm too lazy to mix colors :p There are prints on the site if you're interested. 




 Actually that's a good idea. I'll see if I can figure out how to do that. Thanks!

 Come on man, were nowhere near as bad as Wiscahnsin 




 Speak for yourself man. The winters here are brutal. I'm all for moving to Mercury. 




 Yin Yang by motherfucking literal second coming of Jesus with a side of bacon, Dalip Singh. 




 EXACTLY. nobody knows who he is and that's the genius of his plan. 




 Can confirm. Our basement flooded flooded when we were on vacation and if not for good guy neighbor, my drums among other things would have been fucked. 




 Yessir 




 Thanks man. They didn't like it much over in r/bladerunner so I appreciate "relevant" :) 




 I didn't mean it condescendingly. A robot has no reason to feel any emotional response toward rain without a sense of wonder, which is a uniquely human trait. Which is what I tried to portray. If you didn't get that from it then my style just isn't for you I suppose. 




 How was I being a dick? The whole motive of the replicants was that they were in love and wanted longer life to experience it. 




 It's a nonhuman looking to experience the things that humans do. The plot of the entire movie.

 Did someone say Ra Lu? 




 Hahaha me too. Reminded me of a car trying to do a lap on a track covered in jello. 




 I had a blue damsel that would back up into my snowflake eels face and use his tail to blast sand into the poor guys eyes. He easily could have eaten the damsel if he wanted. I ended up returning the damsel. Those fuckers are crazy. 




 Who the fuck cares? Its reasonably detailed instructions on how to do it and just happens to have a kick starter link. As long as the instructions are there I don't see a reason to be upset. He even posted what magnets he used. 




 Stop youre going to make him have another episode. 




 I did a project on this in grade school. deep ocean is my shit. So much cool stuff down there. 




 Hahaha I know. Half the videos on this sub are pretty ridiculous. Did not know that about the banana though. That's pretty cool. 
























 I didn't submit it to pics this is r/funny 




 It's been claimed already but I appreciate the interest! 




 You totally would 




 If it gives a few people a chuckle I've accomplished my goal 




 Check out my website! http://www.train_subject6359.com 




 Check out my website! http://www.studioRalu.com 














 Someone who plays a big part in AMAs got fired and the admins didn't even let the mods know it was going to happen so a bunch of subs went dark to protest how the admins don't care about the mods. 




 I have a hard time rolling over to pick up my phone. I can't imagine actually standing up  




 As soon as I looked at it, I thought "sockem boppers." 




 I have no science to back this up but I always keep my stomach sucked in because I firmly believe that if you don't keep your transversus muscles busy, you'll get a beer belly. 




 Alcoholism 




 I caught mewtwo with a pokeball. He was burned and the last burn brought him down to his last shred of life. It was good bc I hadn't saved beforehand and I wasted my masterball on snorlax. 




 More specifically a lot of floor space 




 Some kind of nature. Some kind of soul. 




 We will not be going dark. While I support the rest of the mods wholeheartedly, I don't think this sub is big enough that it would even matter. Enjoy the tingles folks :) 




 None of those are large words if you're reading above a 3rd grade level... 




 We're all Spartacus 




 That short hair though

EDIT: I meant that in a good way as in I like the short hair. Poor phrasing. 




 I'm not a religious man but sometimes little blessings like this make me wonder. 




 People who forget to check what sub they're in. I thought this was r/funny til I read the comments 




 This guy knows. Literally this. 




 I'm just yanking your chain. This is definitely the best advice you can give a young person. But in my case I've been all over the world already and after 30 years of school I'll be looking forward to some good old fashioned materialism. 




 As someone who lives in a place with snow half the year and temps below 0, fuck my life 




 Driving home in an F type or a z06 would bring tears to my eyes followed by years of happiness too though 




 Is it supposed to be slenderman 




 I've sold a few paintings on reddit and I wanted a new username that would match my email and website. Too lazy to switch back and forth between accounts so I just don't use the old one. The 3rd was a novelty account. 




 Also where is your spare key hidden? 




 When I'm out of school im going to spend 80k on a new car and there's not a god damn thing you can do about it 3 




 Probably on the driveway. As awesome as this is, I'd feel selfish evicting my car 




 You are an adult now so you can't blame your parents anymore. Go on r/fitness it's amazing what you can accomplish in just a couple months. 




 I've been here for more than 5 years in my other accounts and it was the same then as it is now. 




 I was JUST saying to my friend how I've never had a desire to own an army green car until I saw a c7 wearing it in the Chicago burbs 




 That's what I figured but I thought there was a funnier explanation haha 




 Explanation? 




 I use c.t.o.mf

"Check this out, motherfuckers" 




 I guess you could call them tan but the one in the pic is the same color as mine regardless 




 If I were you I'd use flatworm exit right away. They got so bad in mine it was such a nightmare. Those same little red ones. 




 a squirrel who turned on me

Did the squirrel have sex with your wife? Same thing happened to me bro 




 I suppose you're right 




 I started black and white because paint is expensive and I couldn't be bothered to mix colors :p but it fits the subject matter of my paintings pretty well so I stuck with it. A style itself is kind of just a function of how your mind naturally works. Happens on its own. Glad you like them!

Edit: also check out Simon Stlenhag's work 




 No need to be a jerk. So many people in this thread complaining about people downvoting opposite opinions and then simultaneously doing exactly that.  




 I loved bouncing. My bar used to have a line around the block on Thursdays. Never a dull moment. Also I used to make bank off of bribes :) 




 Keep ya pimp hand strong homeboy 




 It's weird I tried to cultivate mojos in mine because I liked how they clustered at my lfs. People say they are pests but they took ages to grow  in my tank and mostly kept to themselves. 




 No need to use bleach just use hot fresh water. But make sure to rinse the crap out of it after or it will give you a N spike 




 There's nothing to get just use your imagination. 




 Your analogy only works if you assume that I don't already know the time and the person asking me is showing me a watch with a blacked out face and expecting me to be able to read it. 




 You don't need knowledge, vocabulary, or an SLR to realize that if we can't see it then we can't ID it. 




 Stop stop I wasn't ready. Can you start over 




 When you want to look like you 6 mm tall and drive a hotwheels 




 I don't know why but i imagine him laughing with a French accent. Oh hohohohohoho 




 If someone asks for an ID and its a blurry, unlabeled picture of rocks, im downvoting it.  




 Don't tell him what to do. 




 Poetry. 




 Thanks man! I have a summer job atm so I actually just lowered all the prices. Good timing! 




 I started a year and a half ago. I think you're thinking of "I speak for the trees." that guy had been doing that in a lot of subreddits so the mod and I ended up getting him IP banned ;) 




 It's more than some pretty face beside a train  




 yep! 




 Samurai Jack had some of the coolest ideas. Im sure they subconsciously find their way into my art! 




 Hahaha I like your interpretation the best 




 Not exactly a fan but I like what I've heard from them. And triangles are my favorite shape too 




 I think I would poop my pants if they used my art 




 Any time. Keep it up! 














 Acrylic on canvas. Creepier stuff at http://www.train_subject6359.com. Thanks for looking :) 









 thanks :) I was going for a "where the wild things are" vibe 




 Hey you. Glad to see you finally posted this! Told you theyd like it ;)

 You need to stop posting because your work makes mine look amateur. Awesome piece as usual! 




 That r2d2 air filter is sexy 




 A new record! 




 Your username is an instant classic 




 Because it feels wrong and exciting 




 Ill tell her you said that when I see her tonight. Heyo! 




 Maybe show the whole car 




 Why not just use the monolith as mood lighting since its the bedroom and have an actual lamp for when you need actual light 




 And the lack of tits. Oh you already said that. 




 Did you know: the frog is designed like that to minimize the amount of air that can get underneath it, creating more downforce which allows for more grip on the road. This allows the frog to go from zero to a hunnit real quick. On your marks, get set, science. 




 Hahaha classic Jamal 




 Haha you replied to the thread instead of to the comment ya goof 




 That's what I was thinking too. Kinda gives me this warm feeling like I'm actually at a party 




 Their customer service is heroic. I left a not great but not terrible review of a dual port charger and they called me on the phone to apologize and sent a brand new charger completely free. The second one worked better. 




 God dammit 




 Take that ugly pvc pipe and roll it in superglue and then roll it in live rock rubble. Did that with my pvc jawfish cave and it looked vastly better 




 Yeah the length of that title constitutes an overreaction 




 I think he means cinnamon toast crunch. God it's even in the title. What an idiot 




 And BMW builds the Mini :p 




 The god damn fucking red left turn signals in the MIDDLE OF THE FUCKING NIGHT. I have to wait there like an asshole for it to turn green knowing I could probably just blow it and never get caught. Fuck the suburbs  




 Poor advice.  I once injected nanobots into a girl I was dating and she never picked up my calls again. 




 Love it. Reminds me of salad fingers somehow 




 I thought it was a beetle 




 "Turdherder" is good but I prefer "poostabber" 




 Thanks man! If I'm honest, it's because I have a hard time with human form and doing an anatomically correct skinny figure is harder than doing a bulky one :p  




 I'm the humblest person who ever lived. 1000 years from now they'll write poems about my humility. 




 Mid twenties. Internet five 




 His is massive though. Never seen one that big 




 Is this an arrested development reference too? 




 I was shoulder pressing 65 pound dumbbells once and a pretty large dude was lifting with his friend next to me. His friend told him to go grab 50s but he was watching me and must have thought since he was bigger than me he should be doing at least 65 so he grabbed those instead. He couldn't even get them up. Felt good. 




 I prefer "tickle monster" 




 I live under a rock and don't get it so I'm just going to assume it's an Arrested Development reference. 




 Oh my god dude that is yours?? Your ancestors must have been able to digest solid steel. 




 I agree. It's disgusting. Back in my day if we had to have a foot sawed off we would ice it and watch a couple episodes of Hey Arnold and then walk to school anyway. 




 It doesn't hurt when you first break it. I've broken 2 bones. The next day though... Misery 
























 If it creates a story in your head then I've done my job! 




 Glad to hear that :) thank you! 




 Soak part of the palette in water and then dab in some white paint so it gets nice and dilute. And then use less and less dilute paint to get a nice face into pure bright white. Helps to use a soft bushy brush

 This fucking guy, man. This fucking guy. 




 Or me :( 




 I use jacquard. I'm new to screen printing but I expose it to sunlight for 30 seconds and it transfers almost exactly what is on the transparency sheet. Only complaint is that they did not send me enough sensitizer so I had to order an additional sensitizer bottle. 




 Normally I'd judge but this time I'll allow it 




 Gonna go ahead and say she made the right choice 




 Road trip. Next question. 




 Heather Graham 




 Cute kitten and all but the real question is which character does she pick in smash bros 




 Lady Gaga played to almost no one at Lollapalooza on one of the side stages. 2 or 3 years later she was headlining! 




 Thread closed. This guy nailed it 




 I'm not a girl I'm a guy. And yeah i realize it's an unpopular opinion but I guess I'm just old fashioned about dating :p if I like you enough to ask you out then I like you enough to cover the dinner. 




 You got me there haha. XKCD always one step ahead... 




 You tell your mates too you fuck. You tell them that we are smarter than we seem. 




 I edited my comment 




 He's your boyfriend though! I'm sure he payed for the first few dates which is more what I was referring to 




 Phones are one thing. But now people are bringing ipads to events? Come on... 




 You are 100% correct and I am absolutely going to do the same thing for mine. Good on you 




 My cousin got married last month and half the people there watched her say "I do" through the screen of their iphones. Youre never going to look at that shit. Just put the camera away and focus on having a good time. 




 I kind of like it 




 That little red 100 symbol is on every single girl's "recent" emoji tab 




 Because they look comfy as fuck 




 Dude is definitely a bird and he's just trying to deny it so that he fits in here. Classic bird move. 




 I guess I mean know what you want, when you need it, and what you're willing to pay for it. I feel like most people think they can take advantage of artists by being vague. 




 You can frame it normally if you want. its just personal preference. Thanks man glad you like it! 




 1 more coming up in the next few days 




 The feeling of someone recognizing your work is indescribably amazing :) thanks man 




 I tried to measure it but my attention span doesn't allow for perfection :p 




 That's what I like to hear :) thanks man 




 People asking for commissions have been nothing but flaky so far but I'd definitely consider a serious offer! 




 That's a compliment to me. Means the painting struck you somehow. Thanks :)

 Because he's clean and sober 




 Their hitchhiker page was amazing. And the harlequin shrimp one was what got me into keeping harlies 




 You can use whatever color you want 




 All the comments outlining how theyd go about killing tribesmen with a gun are so cringeworthy. It's amazing that some people aren't choked to death by the size of their own neckbeards. 




 This is awesome. I wish you could remove the canvas texture and just have smooth colors 




 He's not responding to you he's supplementing your comment. "Hope this helps" was directed at OP 




 Your tank is the hotel california 




 Looks like a jewel scarab (genus chrysina) maybe? Very cool 




 I enjoyed reading it

 I think when you apply for American citizenship one of the questions on the sheet should be "do you like the challenger"

 Lonestar 




 I will never understand how every single comment is about how shitty the post is but somehow it still makes it to the front page 




 No I'm done feeding your self-righteousness. 




 Here's an example of entitlement for you. Graduating and immediately getting a job. Don't even try to pretend that we have it easy. 




 Yeah because your generation wasn't exactly the same way. The 60s 70s and 80s were oh so classy and selfless 




 This is your tank on drugs 




 Non Americans don't have boogers 




 Think about how when you're really drunk you want to stay awake and keep having fun. You don't want to go to sleep but it's so easy and feels so good to just kind of slip away. I imagine death as being similar to that. Why should I waste life being afraid of something that's easy. 




 I had a porcelain crab that hosted a green star colony. Hed rub his butt in them and use his claws to pull them up around his face.  It was weirdly adorable to watch

 With that attitude you DEFINITELY wont 




 The universe's vagina. Such a sight to behold! 




 I had a beautiful reef lobster who I was worried about putting in with my eel but he was so much bigger that I thought there's no way anything could happen. Until he got bitten clear in half. Don't feel bad OP there are just some things you dont foresee. 




 I used to make aluminum wallets out of soda cans. They were cool but they fuck your jeans up pretty fast 




 Seems like it's always ugly girls trying to flirt with you that do this. 




 False. I thoroughly enjoyed the attention I got as a male bartender. 




 Stress relief part 1. I show this episode to everyone who's never seen the show. Fucking amazing 




 Mandolin tax fulfilled 




 No for me it's because the newer labels make it look cleaner and less like a shitty beer. When I see blue and silver cans/labels I think "shitty beer."

I still don't buy it but it looks way more appealing.

 As would my 23 - 25 year old friends :p
