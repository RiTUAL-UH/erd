 Somewhat more detail here: http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/farmers-in-sahel-beat-back-drought-and-climate-change-with-trees/ and here: http://planetsave.com/2013/04/21/the-great-green-wall-of-africa-a-4000-mile-defense-against-climate-change/

 The trees will act as a barrier against desert winds, help to hold moisture in the air and soil, reduce erosion, enhance biodiversity, provide new grazing land and be a source of vegetation. The project is also recognized for the role it will play in local agriculture and employment.  
People used to go to towns to seek paid work during the lean season, but since the project started, that has changed, says Papa Sarr, Technical Director of the Senegal National Agency of the Great Green Wall.

 you still do ! 



























































 too soon ? 




 it really helps if you are living in a big city so you have excuses to get out . also nice if you can reconfigure the space somewhat so it feels like different places and makes it feel larger . 




 someone really needs to loop this ! 














 [like this guy ?](http://imgur.com/dw1tObq) 




 i do not think it is working . see the red dripping down the beard ? 





























 i am thinking this is fake or a joke but ok either way ! 



























































 no its clearly white and black 




 given how many people are expressing interest they may really want to think about doing that 




 very nice he must be happy to see it going into even wider production ! 


































 yes but that is top secret and unrelated to this optical illusion 




 that one on the bottom is definitely looking to get in on the meme game 




 dude ! 




 now do it with mary and sell it on ebay ! 







































 why yes, i am the bomb ! wait no you meant 




 hail corporate ! 



























































 if it were that easy wouldnt everyone be happy ? 
























 or poop at home 
























 obviously i did not see the other one and deleted this when you pointed it out so how stupid are you ? 














 sign me up for that gig ! 









 didnt see it bite my head off why dont you 




 no 









 i find the stacks are confusing and cause me anxiety and sometimes have signs that contradict other signs 



















 oh did not know thanks ! 





























 yes she is chalk full of crazy 






















































 close but they have a long ways to go yet 




 except that is not how you actually make a polar panoramic 




 but then what state will house our crazies ? 




 really not as bad as i might have expected ! 




 but what happens next ? 














 sc*a*red p*a*nd*a* 




 beware: now entering the lawn of donny darko ! 
































































 definitely went exactly as planned ! 














 coming from a marmoset i will take that as a compliment ! 














 tacocat spelled backward is tacocat 





























 i think he is good but i would be happier if they just rotated between various people on the show to keep it fresh 












































 really sad that such a neutral agency should be a target . nasa inspires everyone far beyond party lines 














 the essence of traveling by train illegally has not changed, but the tools used by those who do it have evolved dramatically over the last decade 



























































 it is definitely one of the best titles of all time ! 














 pretty ironic right ? 




 Arrover Queen by day , Arroof by night ! 




 it turned her into ... Arrover (which also sounds a lot like a cartoon dog saying Oliver) 




 one has to wonder if he slipped his friend anything in return, if you know what i mean 




 #NowThatWouldBeOneForTheHistoryBooks 




 Arroof ! aka Arrover Queen ? 




 Arroof 




 i was hoping he would get back into the end of the line and the first person would go again, all leap frogging the rest of the set . 



























































 unfortunately webpages have these things called archives 














 nice to know they are that secure 




 that is a lot of effort to make something intentionally look like a piece of shit ! a+ 




 be sure to post this to /r/lifehacks too ! 












































 or they just realize how fun life is without them 






















































 that is just about exactly what i would have guessed 









 because we basically all eat them already ? 
































































 ok good to know so now what if i do it intentionally then ? 




 i guess if they did it for free everyone would just start prank calling nepal ? 




 [are you not entertained ?](http://thearabdailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/are-you-not-entertained-w-text-720x396.jpg) 



























































 do you get high if you accidentally inhale those spores ? 




 i first thought your friend got shot and was scared of the picture . then i saw the picture and thought your bald eagle friend got shot which was almost as bad . then i realized i need more coffee . 




 "you're not fully klean unless you're karmafully klean" (to the tune of zest commercial) 




 i think they paused it at the end to empty water from the pool . there is a little jump and then suddenly it is less full before entering the house 









 wait your turn fred ! 




 looks like the 'verified' flair confirms that i do suck 




 that is just so meta 




 i for one was not expecting the total destruction of the car  


































 sorry i guess just 'car wash' might have been better ! 


































 reddit ? 




 this exchange makes me wonder about the whole state of PA 




 he could only hold onto the invisible bike for so long 




 and true because it's funny 






















































 was just thinking that it would be impossible to see what you are doing 



















 ears of corn would be great ! 




 true ! 






















































 that is uncanny and [from this angle too](http://www.theforce.net/swtc/Pix/dvd/zs/rotj/unmasked3.jpg) 









 thought it was a joke but here is a [second source](http://wgntv.com/2015/04/21/canadian-town-known-as-land-of-rape-and-honey-finally-rethinks-its-slogan/) ! 




 is that a phallus sticking out toward the pole or are you just wait what is that other thing ? 




 where did you see this and any more information on it ? very rad ! 










































































 maybe he should pet it and ask it nicely ! 




 as long as we model it on one of the more successful existing systems around the world it could be a big improvement 




 if you never grew out of the 90s you will love it . i didn't and i do ! 






















































 the title is a bit overboard but i am intrigued by the book still 












































 how many practice rounds i wonder and how many pieces can he do like this or is it just a one-trick pony show ? 




 unfortunately this is nothing new and there is no easy fix except to hold currency abroad or hard assets 




 i love watching them squirm around what they claim is a tiny percentage of people we should not care about 










































































 what shall we do with a drunken sailor ? 


































 i'm no chicken but i'm pretty sure that's unidan 




 oh how quickly the tables have turned 




 *at the same time !* 



















 most people who are homeless are not homeless by choice . poverty and mental illness are key drivers  
























 i can imagine it doing that if not now then someday , but then who gets the liability for the decision if people are still injured just fewer than would have been otherwise ? could be very problematic 
























 that is one of the big questions i think . can google choose the lesser of two evils in a bad situation ? 




 not bad 

















































 **and whatever you do do not finish eating the forbidden donut* 




 no just disappointed 




 you should go to hell ! 





























 resubmitted was not just you !

 ok i can fix this ! 




 because the south 




 hey now we all know the pitchfork thing is fake just like jesus being a brown person instead of a blond white bearded guy ! 









 sell one soul and get twice as much on your second trade-in ! 




 pretty sure it is the whole canopy as shown in the later images and not the one module . rooftops would be a great application as well as the exterior walls of buildings for sun and shade modulation . 









 ~~lots of possibilities including self-sufficient and off-grid architecture as well as self-regulating building climates and shading systems . sort of like growing crops, simple materials can produce compelling outputs organically .~~

so i read that wrong ! biological systems require a lot of upkeep and retrofitting such systems to existing buildings would be costly and take a long time to pay off . also what /u/finalfate said [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/35k0tx/unveiled_in_milan_the_worlds_first_biodigital/cr5762l)

 jesus herpes christ ! 




 and what if they find a tiny smudge next to a larger pile and test the smudge ? seems like a lot of potential problems 




 or focus more on alternatives and stop subsidizing oil 




 it seems likely . hard to picture they would just stand down  









 it seems like there could still be a breakthrough that lets us travel farther and faster than we currently think possible 




 seems really complicated but also fun ?

 just far far cooler than its cousins ! 
















































































































































 both . they would play then it would end bad . 




 if it really wanted to get through that is probably true 




 well i guess that would be the cloud inside the silver lining .  suppose they should just go home to genocidal areas and suck it up huh ?

 that is certainly the hope because it would cost everyone involved more than it would help anyone 




 well that is certainly the silver lining ! 





























 the spillover effects economically will be big as well though since greece impacts europe and europe is a quarter of the global market 




 i always thought it would be fun to reverse it the other way and make it so the back was forward and it looks like you are driving backward but then it would probably cause an accident and get me killed
