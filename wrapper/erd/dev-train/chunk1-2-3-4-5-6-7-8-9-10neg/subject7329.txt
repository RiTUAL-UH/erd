 i have been using recreationally for about 10 years now and i am still relatively young at 30.  I have been really good with not getting out of control in the amount i take as well.  i have only done pills like vicodin, percocet, norco, etc. never smoked, snorted or iv anything.  i'd say the most i've taken at once was only around 30mgs and when i use its around 20mg so yeah i would like to think that i am pretty responsible with my habit. I have had morphine in the hospital and it was great but i couldn't function whatsoever and have never tried seeking it out otherwise.  getting to your question:  Man, that's a hard one.  I'd really like to hope things never get that bad where I would feel the need to shoot heroin.  I enjoy life and need to be a functioning member of society or at least try to be lol and i feel that if i was shooting up heroin then that wouldn't be possible.  I just feel like if life is so bad where you are using heroin and I have rarely heard of a heroin user who cannot go a day without using, then your fucked basically.  Who knows, I might end up one day going that route but i'd really not want to at this point in my life. hope this makes some sense.    




 haha yeah but this was exactly what i was going to put as a comment til i saw someone already posted it so i just copied and pasted it in agreement lol

Dude, stop thinking about it and don't look back. Your life can only improve without opiates.
 




 definately do not do it!! i drank a bottle of expired codiene once and fuck.......... long story short, lets just say it was one of the worst experiences of my life.  oh and the stuff i drank was maybe 2 years overdue.  but 1991?!?! LOL holy shit!!! 




 i would say shoegaze type music. think my bloody valentine or lush. 




 i'm not denying that you can score there. probably the easiest spot in the city actually but assuming this person is a white upper middle class looking dude who is walking thru the TL paints a funny picture to me haha.  anyways if he wants it that bad he'll find it. 




 damn your straight up telling this guy to go to the tenderloin hahaha.  i guess if you are that desperate.  i am from SF all my life and its common knowledge to stay clear of this area but hey i am sure he will find what he needs there. 




 wow be careful with that haha. hopefully she isn't driving while taking that pic too lol! 




 have you been on a large dose for a long time? i have been on 10/325 for about 8 months and never any issues. seems like a nosey person. even if you were on a large dose for a long time it shouldn't matter i don't thinks its really their business as the pharmichist is really just a middle man. 




 i thought trainspotting was really good. it seems unbiased. 




 i got a killer hang nail. need a morphine drip stat 




 yeah my buddy is trying to talk me into driving cross country to go there after seeing oxycontin express.  i said naw i'm cool off driving that far for a possibility of getting pills lol.  i tried to explain to him that as far as what i have heard things have tightened up quite a bit there. 




 yep florida in its heyday was amazing i bet........ 




 if you can somehow prove the nerve is exposed i bet you'll do ok.  i've had about 5 root canals. knocked a couple out and a couple due to grinding my teeth when i slept. i was given a small amount of 5/500s. 20 pills with 3 refills i believe.  this was all done in sf bay area so i dunno but thats my experience with that. 




 I think you might have to jump thru some hoops and stuff a bit but if you have around 300 bucks you probably will get something.  I was about to go this route but needed a referral plus xrays from an immediate care place and it was getting too pricey so i didn't even do it.  I wasn't too into dropping that much $$ for potentially ending up with nothing.   




 i do tonic water sometimes. seems to help but i think its just a placebo effect.
 




 ive tried grapefruit juice for potentiation. didn't seem to do shit for me.   




 yeah i know. i'm not looking for opanas anyways haha
 




 never tried opana.  actually never really even heard of it til about a year ago.  anytime i'd get anything good for pain it was always just generic vicodin 5/500s and now finally norcos but it was never even discussed with my doc about percs, opana or other opiates. maybe because i have kaiser and they don't do business with the makers of opana and percocet?  because aren't those just the brand names?  like norco is the brand name of 10/325 hydrocodones too right?!!??  when kaiser prescribed me them they are generics and made by mallikondrit or whatever company that is.  i suppose if i wanted to i could ask for the brand name but it'd be way more expensive. sorry for all the noobish questions haha!!
 




 is that the ingredient in percocet? if so i have hads percs before. really weak 2.5's tho haha. they were white with blue speckles. 




 i'd say you are lucky to even have a dealer!! haha its pretty much impossible for me to find anything on the streets where i am.  plus the fact that he seems to lag is a characteristic seen in almost every drug dealer its like instilled in them to be flaky/late.  you'd think that dealers would be capable of being on time if all they have to do is hand over some pills and make a grip of money all in under a few mins but for some reason at least for the people i have dealt with almost don't want to make the easiest money ever. 




 yeah but if you say that you might run the risk of the doctor running you thru a buncha shit like xrays/ct scans etc thinking he will need to re operate or something.  i have been thru a similar experience is why i say this. in the end i didnt get any more meds but ended up spending a couple hundred bucks and wasting a lot of time.   




 yeah i can def see that happening.  i am usually best when i'm alone since a few times people have kinda killed my buzz when they have tried to have conversations with me haha.  sounds kinda selfish but yeah.  its kinda like i gotta focus on my high and not do anything that requires a lot of thinking lol.  I only use 20mg hydrocodone to just buzz so i'm obviously not nodding out.   




 yeah either that or the acetominophen.  i mean how much would there be if you really ingested 100mg of actual hydrocodone?  a lot, that's all i know haha.  i think it is just shitty reporting/wrong facts/reporters don't know shit about medicine.  
 




 yeah i can see how that happens like when i drink sometimes i get overly emotional but luckily for me never happens on opiates. always a good mood.   




 my point exactly!?!? i dunno man. some people pointed out opi rage which i have never encountered. 




 ive never taken near 100mg of vicodin haha.   




 ahh ok.  i have never experienced that. opposite effect on me.   




 noob question, but what is opi rage?  i have heard the term used before but can only speculate as to what it means. 




 good luck mine were impacted needed to be cut out and i got darvocet woohoo!!! 




 i'd think taking 100mg of vicodin would make him mellow out and not want to shoot anyone if having any effect at all on how he acted.  always makes me feel way more peaceful and less angry/agitated. just my 2cents. 




 why the fuck would you post this disclaimer or not.   




 i've taken them before. they were weird shaped but had that cursive v on them like the 5/500 vics i'm used to. anyways they weren't that great it felt like i had to take a lot to get anywhere but i did feel it a bit.  
 




 yeah i'm basically in the same boat. i just kinda went through the motions and graduated high school.  then at least when i went to college i was able to have a lot more control of the type of classes i could take so it was a bit easier but i still hate sitting in a classroom for x amount of hours. i know a lot of people that use add/adhd as an excuse for a lot of their shortcomings and it's just annoying. 




 never tried adderall but i was on dexedrine which is similar to ritalin i believe.  i dunno, i was in middle school when i was prescribed it for "adhd"  i quote that because i seriously can't say if i have it or not.  its kinda a crutch a lot of people use for being dumb shits imo haha. anyways, that shit didn't really do much other than make me loose my appetite and not want to eat much.  I only took them for a few years.  I have noticed that when i take opiates i am a lot more easy going and just in a better mood all together than when i'm not on them.   




 i have done the raid the medication drawer thing many a time before.  i felt/ feel really shitty about doing it but it was impossible for me not to grab a few pills when they are right there in front of me. most of the time it was just 5/500 vicodins that were leftovers (i checked the dates on the bottles if i had enough time).  that doesn't justify what i did though i know.  this was before i was able to get a legit script and i haven't done it since.  




 sorry to say but you are an alcoholic.  I went thru something similar for a few years straight.  Just try to go 24 hours without any booze.  Once you get that first day, it get way easier after that. 




 10 bucks for 60 10/325's a month from my doc.  I think I can afford that!! 




 i've actually never tried tramadol. heard it was not gonna do anything and i don't want to take any more pills than I need to so yeah i just chucked the script i had for like 20 of them.  i have had darvocet if it is like that. 




 to add onto what i just posted the last time i got tramadol i just threw it out. i thought it wouldn't do anything for me and i'm a lightweight (20mgs hydrocodone and i'm good)  is tramadol even comparable to say 5/500's?
 




 all this over tramadol?!?!   




 and yeah i always knew it was spelled contin not cotton. duh. haha. 




 i did?? i dunno, it wasn't intentional.  i guess i am not good at using this thing haha. 




 ah i thought you opiate users were supposed to me mellowwww broooo!!   




 i believe that is how mr wyte spells it! 




 the link:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMLtj6qSsc 









 yeah they do the job for me! 




 lol i know this. read the comments i already posted!! 




 thanks man. only a couple a day work for me i'm not trying to get too crazy here haha 




 i know that and i'm not snorting them haha wtf.  i don't like swallowing pills so i usually just crush em.  this is a lot better than what i use to have to take- 5/500s.  i don't use a lot anyways i take like 2 a day 




 why wouldn't you? but you know best so tell me why not 




 you mean physically big?? they aren't when you crush em!! 









 Interesting. I now have a new bookmark and that kinda means a lot because I rarely bookmark shit hahaha 




 i had some prescribed to me and didnt want to take them cause I knew they wouldnt do shit and nobody would buy them off me so i threw em out.  i'd say they are useless. 




 if you have 1 or 2 beers you should be fine.  at least you arent taking 500's. I'd be worried most of the apap but i still wouldnt pop 6 10/325s and drink any alcohol at the same time though.  I will admit in the past i have drank and taken pills at the same time but i'm talking a few beers and 1 norco.  Its a good mellow feeling and intensifies both the beer buzz and the opiate high but I don't mix pills/alcohol anymore. 




 thats tough. i just turned 30 and look a lot younger so its been really hard for me to get docs to even to give me anything even though i have quiet a file at my hospital for surgeries/ dumb accidents. but yeah hopefully you feel better with that medicine and you are able to be functional!!  




 damn thats gnarly and you are only in your 20's!?!  i'm sorry to hear that- back injuries suck!  good luck with your pain management.   




 not trying to be a dick but how do you get these prescribed to you then turn around and be able to flaunt it to the net?!? shouldnt you be keeled over in pain right now!?!?!  (jealous)  




 btw what state are you in?? i am in california, bay area. 




 thats total bullshit. i am in the same boat as you i believe.  young, in actual real pain yet I do like to take pills and I will admit i love the way they make me feel.  I have quite an extensive file for injuries/surgeries for my young age so that is to my advantage but yeah its still fucking stupid how dumb it is to legally get anything. even 5mg vics. so what else is there for people like us to do?!?! i'm not gonna start going on the streets to find heroin, i know that much.....  right now i got my doc to scribe me 10/325 norcos. i only take 2 a day so i am barely scraping the surface of most of the peoples use on this reddit but i feel guilty already with that. it sucks cause i had to even build up to that with my doc!!  anyways that was really lame of her to judge you, i've had docs do that to me before. 




 that sucks, that doc sounds like a fucking dick.  were you really pressing him or trying to get some really strong shit that he would obviously know you were just going to abuse!?!?   




 they work a ton faster and are much safer than a razor blade imo!! 




 i've had that one but the clear and blue pod looking one works better for me. 




 I have owned that exact same one as in the pic.  I have a bit different styled one now that i believe works better. I think i got it at wallgreens 




 I always notice it kills my buzz when i start eating that is why i usually ingest on an empty stomach. 




 i usually only get presealed bottles made by qualitest via kaiser so i assume that they are going to be accurate. 




 non existent  




 For me its having a longtime doctor that trusts me to responsible with what she prescribes me (lortab 10's).  I have been good about not burning thru them quickly so i always get my refills.    




 yeah muscle relaxers. i have a shitload of samples of them for some reason. never taken any though.  they are probably expired now. 




 thats about when i had mine taken out.  I hadnt discovered opiates yet so i didn't even both to ask the surgeon but i shouln't of had to- its his job to prescribe what is needed for pain and trust me i was in pain for about a week after with only ibu 800s woohoo!!! 




 You got so damn lucky.  I didnt get any narcotics for mine and my wisdoms were impacted!!! 




 never used it but have been to it.  seems too risky and most people on there seem like scammers.  not taking a risk sending cash to someone i don't know without any knowing that i will ever receive my product. 




 ok i wasnt sure as I have never messed with any pill like that but they work great on regular pills. 




 for several things but mainly because I have been getting my whole mouth filled with dental implants due to grinding them away when i sleep.  also had to have about 5 pulled and have gum surgery on my upper gums.  Other than that I have had about 5 surgeries for broken bones just from dumb luck.  I am relatively young too (30 y/o) so my doc is really sympathetic to my condition haha!! 




 $10 for my prescription of lortab 10's.  i get 60 of them about every month.  I'm not a heavy user so i think I can afford 10 bucks about every month or so haha. 




 get a pill crusher from wallgreens or somewhere like that. i do it with norcos and take them orally and it hits me harder than if i just popped it.  I never have had your kinda pills so not positive it would work with them but it def. does with a regular pill. 




 i doubt you'll get anything. i've had about 5 done and never get anything. the point of a root canal is to end the pain you have been having.   




 near chico ca and its dry as fuck out here..... 




 how do you guys get so much strong shit prescribed to you?!?!?!   




 I am near chico and you would think it'd be easy to find something but I havent had any luck!!!   
























 thats lame as fuck. find a new doctor.  total bullshit man.  sorry to hear that shit.   




 I've had shitty and good ER experiences. Mainly shitty but i'd say its pretty hit or miss and just depends on who is working that shift in the ER. 




 i like peppermint schnapps with just regular coke. 




 lol can't agree with you more yet i am kinda empathetic to the OP. 




 yeah im pretty much in the same boat as you. its hard for me to just have like 3 beers cause i don't like them much so I drink harder stuff and it usually makes me too drunk haha. 




 "I don't know much about beer and dislike the taste of most I've tried. Any recommendations?"  Yeah I have a recommendation- if you don't like it, don't drink it!!  I am not trying to sound/be a dick but if you honestly don't like it just stick to what you like!!  Everyone around where I live loves Sierra Nevada beer.  I have tried it several times but I just don't like it much. Its too heavy of a beer and I agree with you about light beer as I am not a huge beer guy myself and find that stuff easier to drink. I guess a lot of drinks are an acquired taste so I dunno I'm just saying if you have tried to drink beer quite a bit and still don't like it just skip it!!  haha I mean this in the best and nicest way lol.   Good luck in finding the right beer if you choose to keep trying!! 




 I don't go around telling everyone but I don't keep it a secret as well.  I mean it comes up sometimes when I am talking to someone about drugs.  For instance my parents know.  Btw I am on a legal prescription for norcos and I don't use any other drugs not even pot.  I just find that being honest is the best way to go. 




 I think it does.  When I drink wine I get a different feeling than when I drink other liquors. Hard to explain but I do notice a difference.   




 murder city devils 




 just a normal doctor at kaiser who i've been with for about 8 years.  i'm not looking to get into any real heavy stuff but want a modest increase in the medicine i am receiving right now and just a bit worried about bringing it up with her as it might make things worse.  what experiences with pain mgmt have you had? I've never been.... 




 thanks man you too!! it just sucks being young and actually having legitimate pain but getting profiled because you are young!  That's kinda why i was looking for advice/ other peoples stories with this situation because up until here I have only been kinda judged by every doctor i've seen. 




 yeah i know i can do that and i'm pretty good at telling stories if I need to haha. but the messed up thing is that I am not trying to scam my doctor cause I want to be high all day, I feel that I need a small up on my dosage for legit reasons.  I am just worried that this proposition to her might backfire you know?   




 hah i wasn't trying to sound like a dick. i just read what i wrote and it came off that way.  but yeah tolerance sucks! 




 exactly what i'm afraid of. 




 are they steroid shots? i've been wanting to get steroid shots but been pretty much talked out of them by all the doctors i've seen saying it won't help much. 




 wow that was fast!  ive been on opiates for about 10 years. 




 ok we sound in about the same place :)  I have had this doc for about 7 years now and we have a great relationship which I don't want to mess up but I feel like I do have a legitimate reason to get a bit more meds.  I've never done the doctor shopping thing and the pain managment clinics are very pricy since I am going thru Kaiser Permanente and its really cheap but which from what i have heard is the Wal Mart of hospitals but it is all I have I known.  Thanks for the response!! 




 not sourcing whatsoever.....  i get 60 10/325s prescribed to me 1 month for legitimate pain from my doctor after being on 5/500s for about 5 years, yeah i know gross. i do have real pain and have the xrays/mris/etc to prove it.  I have been limiting myself to about 2 of the 10mgs a day just to get mobile.  I just feel like a junkie trying to get more opiates but at the same time i need them for the pain.  Problem is I am young (30) and I just don't want my trusting doctor to cut me off.....  Any suggestions?   




 nick cave or golden brown!?! dude both of them are my jams haha 




 damn. how long did it take you to build up that tolerance?? 




 Ahhh i know!! My tolerance is still relatively low (20-30mg gets me good), but I remember when 7.5 mg got me feeling good.  I shit you not!! 




 hah! love it but i would never wear it!   




 lookin good bro! 




 haha i dunno what i was doing. haha thanks!! 




 thanks man. i'm a total internet noob. i tried imgur but they were down. 




 fuck yeah love that song!!! took me years to figure it out though haha. heard it first on a video that my friend made of some bay area skateboarding:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0HfQMKsiYg

 i like opium tea by nick cave......  














 what did you post like saying that you couldn't find any liberal doctors or what? i've seen people on CL straight up asking for norcos and stuff which to me seems a bit sketchy. 




 yeah ive seen ads like that saying its leftover surgery stuff. and yeah when i've ever bought/sold shit off CL no matter what it was always met in a neutral location and try to bring a friend. 




 sounds like what i am dealing with. i do have legit pain and have a small monthly script for norcos and just don't want to blow it by asking my doctor to up my script so i was seeing if i could kinda play a bit of catch up on CL you know?  I don't smoke weed for various reasons so I just have the norcos to rely on for the pain. only stuff that makes me actually mobile. 




 sf bay area. just typed in meds or pain meds under for sale. found a lot of interesting stuff.
 




 yeah i was searching in sf bay area and found everything from 5mg vic's to methadone and everything in between! 




 exactly how i'm feeling about it haha. but i guess if you read stampbag's reply, you can't even register for the SR right now...... 




 I have heard of this and similar stories on the news as well and you have a good point too. 




 Alright thanks everyone for the input!! I am glad this thread seems to have been a success (haha at least for me)  Also interesting to hear from you guys and your CL stories.  I only mess with pills- no H ever so its not like I could do the open air market deal is why I was mainly contemplating CL.  Sucks that it seems wayyyy easier to get heroin than some wimpy norcos haha!! I am not that hard up for pills so I doubt i'll actually ever get the balls up to do it. Still wish I knew how the SR worked 100% so I could confidently pull it off.  Anyways thanks everyone once again!! 




 lol totally agreed 




 I agree with you about the risk/sketchiness. I have known of silk road for a while now but I am still not 100% sure how it works haha. and i don't want to use it until i am full able to understand the process of it. 




 anyone ever try buying opiates off craigslist? i've been contemplating doing this for some time now but haven't quite figured out if its worth the risk.  just wanting to get a feel for any good or bad stories from anyone here that has gone that route. 




 i don't really think so cause i was getting 100 5/500's a month. now getting 60 10/325s a month.  i just told her i am concerned about my liver and she changed it up for me.  I have a ton of different pain issues on various parts of my body lol so thats what they are for.  I am only taking no more than 3 a day so I would like to think that isn't too much?   




 oh and i'm not sure if you mean by your question will it kill someone due to an acute liver failure or just by prolonged use or both?   




 norcos being 10/325 i would think that one would have to take a lot of them over a long period of time to die from fucking their liver up but everyone is different.  I'm just glad my doctor switched me from 5/500's to norcos for the sake of my liver. 




 Man you are lucky to live there. I am on the other side of the country in california and the doctors here are pretty stingy.  my friend was trying to get me to take a roadtrip to FL and I told him after that movie it was virtually dead but I guess its not!!  Still, i'm not going to take a cross country journey for something that still is not a 100% sure thing haha.  even though it sounds like it is pretty close to that. 




 ok i just wasn't sure is all and honestly didn't read the whole wiki link you sent me about eds and ibs.  sorry for any mix up! 




 ok so why'd you mention ibs haha seems a bit personal to mention if it didn't relate to receiving pain meds for it! 




 Troll 2  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyophYBP_w4 




 you get them for IBS?? Just wondering, not judging.  I haven't experienced IBS so I can't talk but I didn't know it could be so painful.  Either way you are lucky to find 1 of the last few liberal doctors around haha 




 Damn so its still got it going on down there?!? I heard that FL dried up after all the pain clinic stuff being exposed and The Oxycontin Express movie.  I've never been so I can't say either way.  You live in Florida I take it? 




 never smoked either regularly. actually tried to start smoking cigs recently (yeah dumb i know) because i was subjected to so much second hand smoke it made me crave it but i couldn't even make it thru the pack.  For me nicotine is something I never had an issue with.  Alcohol and opiates, haha............ 




 fuck man, me too!! too bad mine is only 60 norcos a month!! may i ask how you legally get these?  i need to step my game up...... 




 i agree with your statement but 22 ounces of wine is quite a bit considering wine usually starts at about 8-9% alcohol content. 




 never done cocaine but considering that is a stimulant it would produce a different high completely.  but i totally understand what you are talking about considering i asked a similar question not too long ago:  http://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/zsyaa/cleaning_your_house/ 




 awesome. i'm feeling this pic! 




 whats worse is the fact that it is tramadol. 




 i'm done talking to you kook 




 Let me rephrase that.  I came to this place to ask questions and offer my advice when needed.  In this instance I was asking a question and the thread was going fine until you showed up. 




 i came here to be positive and help people out. not to be a kook like you. 




 ironically i just found this in my bathroom  http://imgur.com/tqY9g 




 haha yeah i can totally understand on a drug like speed although ive never used it.  i sometimes lose my appetite though on opiates. 




 yeah for me it usually just ends up in cleaning my house but i guess its good cause it probably wouldn't get cleaned otherwise  haha 




 ah ok thanks! 




 ahh gnarly haha.  id be worried it would get dropped on the carpet and stain it up really bad. 




 like to disinfect stuff?  god i hate the smell of that stuff haha 




 BA= body absorption?  haha i'm a noob.  just guessing that is what it means.
 




 ah ok good story!! i've never used anything more than pills orally and i would think it'd be kinda hard to clean after shooting up so i'm not surprised haha 




 Did a search and found something posted about 6 months ago and couldn't comment so decided to start a new thread.  Sorry i'm high!!  anyways I always have an urge sometimes after I take a couple norcos, about 20-30mg to just start cleaning and its great the feeling I get from it.  Kinda funny cause it seems like something a meth head would do.  either way my place is taken care of at least once a week without hiring a maid haha. Just wondering if others get these urges and would like to hear some stories from you all. 




 yes  




 oh ok yeah it is.  i was just scared my doc might just cut me off if i asked for stronger stuff quickly. 




 oh and i do get blood tests every month from my doctor. one thing that is checked is my liver and it is fine. 




 i know it doesn't but somehow its worked for me for the last 10 odd years. 




 325x2=650mg of tylenol a day for me...... 




 oh and thanks!! good luck with your opiate adventures!
 




 i hope so.......... i am trying my hardest as much as i love those opiates haha. like i said before i am trying to sound like a jerk or snob, i just hate withdrawls and really don't need a hell of a lot to get a nice buzz so I have always been very moderate with my opiate usage. 




 agreed.  its a hard juggling act for a lot but moderation is key.  I know moderation and opiates probably don't go hand in hand but its essential. 




 lol i forgot about that one. it does mess up your number 2's!!
 




 only made mine better. cured my actual physical pain and also emotional.  i have a super cheap co pay and have rarely had to cop pills from the street(never touched anything stronger)  my tolerance has gone up a bit but I have been on the same program for about 10 years now and i'm only 30 so I feel that I have really good willpower. I understand how strong drugs are, especially opiates and I respect them never going on binges.....  I know i'll catch shit for what I wrote already saying i'm naive and cocky or whatever but I am this is how I humbly put it.  Losing both of my parents at a very young age from drugs has helped me pace myself with my addictions to put a long story short........ 




 when i was taking the 5/500s I took about 3-4 a day max.  i consider that not much right!?!?  I am not sure, everyone is different but I am/was taking them for pain but I do like how opiates make me feel I won't lie haha. 




 was on just 5/500s for like 3 years. told my doc i wanted 10/325s so my liver could be healthy and she switched me up no questions asked.  i am light user though......... i think haha  




 yeah its fucked!!  I am just looking for pills. its funny that i can get heroin here easier than just like norcos. 




 never used meth but this whole area has a really bad  meth problem so i hear...... 




 you would think a college town like chico california would be too easy but I guess they have been cracking down or something cause I can't find anything. 




 haha very well said!! you got my upvote. 




 i agree with you.  i'm not taking the naive/ignorant route on this one.   




 Its all good. what you said was just kinda open ended sounding is all haha 




 is this a response to me? i cannot tell. 





























 :57 secs http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtA869eH21c 




 I'm still trying to figure out how this is legal to sell since making the tea is supposedly giving you the same effect as taking an opiate in which you need a script for. Is it just some weird loophole that the FDA hasn't realized yet?  Don't get me wrong I love opiates so I am not bitching about it but it's fascinating that there isn't some kind of restriction on it.  I haven't tried making the tea yet either but I have been contemplating it.  Anything I should be aware of before I make it or any really bad side effects? 




 I've never had that happen with the blurred vision or nausea unless in a car.  I kinda wish in a way that opiates always made me feel crappy so i wouldn't love them like I do haha. 




 I was taking my normal dosage though and I have never gotten nauseated when taking them while not in a moving vehicle is why I was wondering.  I think i should just avoid taking meds and being in a car haha. 




 I did a search for it and doesn't look like anyone has posted about getting car sick while on opiates.  The other night I took 3 norcos while being a passenger in a vehicle.  Felt alright for about 30mins then felt really nauseous like classic carsickness. Just tried to focus on the yellow line until I got home about 20 mins later and felt like shit so I laid down for about 20 mins and felt better but it sucked and kinda ruined my buzz haha.  The last time this happened to me was about 8 years ago after I had gotten out of the hospital and was on vicodin I got car sick as well.  I always have avoided being in a car while on opiates because of that first experience but 2 out of 2 times now I have gotten carsick while on opiates.  I never get carsick if I'm sober or even drunk I do better than when on opiates. 




 Did it.   




 damn. iggy pop holding you up is saying a lot!! haha 




 forgot about him for some dumb reason but my #1. chinese rocks. 




 gg allin haha 




 the only reason i was thinking it would be more efficient than swallowing the powder is because when i try that i usually choke on some and/or some gets caught in my mouth.  i thought if they went down to my stomach in a neat little package then dissolved that might work better. 




 it was a fine powder.  norco 10/325s 




 i usually just crush up my pills and swallow the powder but tonight i decided to parachute for the first time.  i did it correctly and didn't lose any powder but it is taking forever for the high to come on.  I thought it was supposed to be quicker this way than just swallowing the powder but i'm starting to have second thoughts. What are your guys opinions on parachuting versus just eating them or crush then down the hatch? 




 lol 




 haha c'mon guys calm down!!  




 I know i'm not knocking those people.  Just had to agree with the guy who doesn't like that word haha. 




 Oh well. I don't insufflate or however you say it haha I take my pills orally. 




 I have to agree with callmedarlin as I have never heard the term " insufflation" in my life and it does annoy the fuck outta me. I had to google that shit just to find out what it was...... 




 I dunno go try to buy some and get back to us haha 




 I get blood tests done monthly and one thing they check is my liver.  I have been on 5/500s for about 4 years and recently switched to 10/325s.  My liver readings are slightly and i mean trivially high. my alt serum test is at 40 which is 3 points higher than recommended. What really made my liver readings go threw the roof in the past was when I was drinking a lot of alcohol on a daily basis at that point my liver reading was 150!! Since I have stopped drinking almost completely my liver readings are back to normal.  I don't know if this answers really anything about your question but it does go to show that the liver is capable of repairing itself when a person stops abusing it like i was at one point. 




 they are 7.5s. watson 387 




 http://imgur.com/6fm02NX 




 ok its an opiate like medicine.... 




 I have been prescribed it yet I have never taken it just because i thought it was pointless for a high and I have heard weird things like what you explained about tramadol as well that made me not really want to take it haha. 




 if you are just looking for tramadol i'd say you are ok.  that seems to be the go to opiate that doctors rx because its supposedly harder to get addicted to but that is just what i have heard so i'm not certain.... 




 I'm from the bay area born and raised until about 1.5 years ago. now i am in Chico. zzzzzzzz (snoring) haha 




 i only get my tats done sober 




 haha well it was from safeway which was located on a street so yeah i'd say your are correct! 




 yeah they have a ton of dispensaries here and i would assume they might come in pill type bottles. i wouldn't know i don't smoke.  and yeah thats nice about the bag. i totally forgot about that since i've never bought a crown royal bottle before. 




 I guess it's a bit hard to sense sarcasm over type!!  i think you guys looked into this whole streets thing a bit much haha 




 too late already did last night and i'm here to tell. that is just how street i am lol 




 crown royal maple. its a seasonal thing. 




 sorry i'm such a noob. i am from the streets and don't really fuck with the net but here:   http://imgur.com/mt6Nf 









 ha this is good. never seen this or the website it's on. 




 lovin the old peoples medicine reminder container haha!! 




 I know the money is tempting but these are worth their weight or more in gold to me!! i still might need to sell some to make ends meet tho.... 




 If you really have migraines and cannot get a legit script that sucks.  have you tried to?   




 because i needed to take twice as many 5/500s and i didn't want to be taking too much tylenol and mess up my liver.   




 Damn i didn't know that. That sucks but at least im one of the people that can't tell  too much difference between them  




 Sorry i meant 1 hour 30mins. must of still been higher than i thought lol!! 




 What's 5 minutes refer to? 




 around 180 since i mixed some in of my last script.  they are for pain!! haha 




 yeah your right 




 my joints are pretty messed up in my ankles and both require surgery. i have the xrays/mris to back this up.  that is the main reason i take them but i did also just have a total mouth reconstruction in the last year as well amongst other things. 




 i mixed in some of my last prescription haha so there might be around 180.   




 haha yeah your right 




 train_subject7329 is from the movie bad santa lol if you've ever seen it!! I started on 5/500 generic vics and eventually just recently got bumped to the norcos cause i complained about the apap.  yeah they are all 10/325s if they are the yellow twinkies or the m367s. the m357s are the 5/500s i believe.  I take no more than 3 norcos a day. I have known of the CWE for years now but I am too scared to actually try it and potentially waste good pills!! 




 nice man you too!! i always dose the same so i should be good!! :) 




 thanks so much man. took 3 of em about 1/12 hours ago and still feeling them. i hate tolerance!! 




 never had oxys personally. i just never have seen em in CA. maybe its more of a regional thing.  how do they hit? any different than normal hydrocodone?  and yeah i feel ya, i'm 10 years in and only have my tolerence up to 30mgs a day but its really hard to keep that in check! 




 I had my appendix totally burst on me about 10 years ago and since then my number 2's havent ever been the same.  My opiate use also has impeded this as well lol.  I would recommend a fiber supplement which you know you can get at safeway, luckys, etc. or just get an enema if you are really blocked up.  Trust me, I have been there. Good luck my friend...... 




 thanks so much!! i am finally in good hands legally i think!! i hope you have great opiate adventures. 




 thanks so much man!!! and it was all legal!! i almost had to go to the streets for it :(  i send good vibes to you!!! 




 norco twinkies/nannas!! at least 120 of em!!!finally got bumped up!!  




 the most i've ever had at once. i respect da opiates though and have decent self control.  love you guys don't overdo it!!  i'm about to sample these bad boys.......  http://imgur.com/LLnC4 and hey i know it's not much and i don't want to go saying this is pill porn either haha. 




 Well since i have tried all 3 i really haven't noticed too much difference between them but i do know most people favor the yellows 




 You should get a pill crusher unless you really like the taste! 


 




 Also called twinkies haha. That pill is an m367 just a generic norco 




 Guess how many. imgur.com/td81d 




 They are m367s not 357s 




 I believe they all are 325mg apap 




 I use them orally  




 What do you guys prefer? I know the yellows seem popular.  I feel that the white ones crush better though imgur.com/S1gOm 




 they sell this at Costco. 




 pretty much what has already been said. from my experiences drinking higher quality liquors tend to make a hangover not as bad or nonexistent.  ibuprofen, not tylenol if you need to take a pain reliever cause of the acetominophen in the tylenol. 




 Motorhead said it best- The chase is better than the catch.  Where I live its so dry and hokey pokey with people who have just pills that I have spent the better part of a day on a wild goose chase just to go home empty handed.  Maybe I should bump up to morphine or heroin since I know i can get that way easier than my lowly pharms........ anyways I feel ya !! 




 actually now that i think about it i only pay $10 for a bottle of 60 norcos via kaiser pharmacy!!  too bad i would never sell any, i'd make a killing. 




 $10!?!?! i need to meet your dealer!! 




 alright i'm in no huge rush but i finally think i figured it out and feel confident with it so i thought i'd at least try and log in.   




 uh yeah i think so too. just wondering I will ever be able to get onto it. 




 I just finally tried joining SR and it told me that they aren't accepting new users at this time.  Anyone know the deal with that?  I'm a total noob here with it so take it easy haha. 




 that area is pretty sketchy and there is a cop shop right in that area as well.  i have never tried purchasing anything from the TL. 




 damn that sucks. i just mess with pills and can never find anyone up here with norcos or anything!! 




 i live up near chico now but i'm from the bay is why i was lookin on there.  plus this area is dry as fuck!! 




 i haven't been that desperate yet to do any craigslist stuff.  hope it will never come to that. 




 yeah man there are a ton of em in sfbay craigslist but i am still yet to fuck with any of them. 




 weird. i guess don't believe everything you read! hah 




 also this thread reminded me to check my local craigslist.  found several interesting ads including this one that looks very fishy:   http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/hab/3497829163.html 




 isn't SR dead?  i read an article saying its thru. 




 i made a thread about this:  http://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/13flyu/craigslist/  might find some more info there. 




 thanks! and yeah i'm not necessarily trying to get a pain mgmt doc just for opiates :)  if there are other treatments to help my situation that they can introduce to me I am into it.  thanks! 




   i think my doctor just went off my word but i do have xrays/mris to prove that both my ankles are f'd up.  i'm not going in busting the doors open demanding more meds haha so yeah thats why i wanted to know what people thought. 




 i think i would need a referral, i dunno that's what i have heard.  I am just doing this mainly because i know my normal doctor is getting to the end of her string with prescribing me my stuff and i really don't think i should ask her for any more than i am getting already.  I don't use any other drugs than the norco, prescribed or otherwise so i don't have a problem with a pee test and i don't go on binges or abuse my meds so i should be good with adhering to some kind of policy that the pain mgmt place would make me sign.  thanks for the response!! 




 here's the deal i've been working with my doctor who is just a general practicioner at kaiser permanente for about 5 years now. she recently (and hesitantly) bumped me up from vicodin per my request that i was concerned about my liver. i have an app with her in early jan for just a check up.  I am thinking about asking her to refer me to a pain mgmt doc but not sure how she will react to this.  I am getting 60 norcos a month from her and I feel I am twisting her arm with just that amount not because I have been bugging her about upping my dose but I did hear that general medical docs have to be careful with the amount of narcotics they prescribe because of liability?  I just get a feeling i'm skating on thin ice at that amount lol.  Anyways, i'd like anyones input on my situation or experiences.  Thanks in advance friends! 
























 gay porn 




 this exactly haha 




 You get 180 norcos per month?!?! May I ask how you obtain them? 




 Is that relatively high?  haha now your making me feel bad.  it's taken me about 10 years to get here though. 




 Yeah i think that is the best way to describe it although i don't really "nod" anymore since my tolerance has gone up with the amount i take :(    I could just take more norco to achieve that nod but i'd run out of my script way too fast haha 




 I am sure there are tons of threads on this, maybe not but fuck it haha I thought I would share my experience as it happens. I was bored and took a super low dose of Diphenhydramine (15mg) then 4 norcos about 30 mins later.  It has been about 45 mins since the norco dose and it feels a bit stronger than usual but not like out of control sedated.  I really haven't tried to potentiate my meds before other than tonic water and gf juice which I thought were very trivial potentiators.  What does everyone prefer to use for potentiators, or do most of you just think they are a waste of time?   




 yeah i saw that rashes are a side effect. i think she prescribed this to me because I told her I was having trouble sleeping and I have taken ambien before and didn't really want to get on it again. 




 yeah that is what my doctor said about it possibly helping me sleep.   




 probably not a good thing? 




 haha ok 




 oh ok guess i just gotta try it!
 




 ok so it helps with wds?  have you taken it with any opiates? does it enhance anything or no. 




 so is it like ambien in way? i have had ambien so that would be a comparison point to me. dunno if you have. 
 




 My doctor is going to prescribe this to supplement my norco. I barely think I've even heard of this. Will it help with my pain?  Any input on it is appreciated. 




 crying is good sometimes! 




 no problem haha thanks for giving me an idea to vent on! 




 I can relate with a lot of you said in this post.  I am as well addicted to food and was anorexic at age 18-20.  luckily that passed quickly and I spent most of my 20s focusing on alcohol to where it became a daily chore just to maintain my buzz. that got old and i had a couple years of no real issues which was nice.  the last few years I have been bulimic and i honestly don't know why i even do it or how I started it. I don't do it so I can look pretty for other people, its strictly personal.    I have always been extremely anxious as well and I think that is part of the reason that I get hung up in these situations.  I also feel that having an eating disorder and being a male makes it a bit harder for people to understand- at least the people around me in my life.   




 i guess what I mean is that you are lucky to not have that craving/tendency/disposition/etc to be an IV heroin user like so many other people.
 




 i've never tried heroin yet i do love opiates in general.  i'd consider yourself extremely lucky to have had 3 "disappointing"  experiences with heroin since I can't recall ever reading a story about disappointing heroin experiences unless they ended in death.   




 I got the REAL results back.  false positive.   




 i'm hoping its just a false positive as the only drugs I ever do are my prescriptions which are norco and paxil both prescribed by my doctor so yeah i'm just waiting to hear back from them. 




 I take paxil as well but it is prescribed to me by the same doctor so I would think that they would catch that.  no benadryl or morphine. 




 haha of course!! 




 I dunno. This isn't for work or probation but it would probably put another fork in the road on my route into the pain program in which the questioning doctor reffered me to. 




 yes she does she is the same doctor prescribing it!! haha 




 she responded saying that different meds can interact and and labs can come up as "false positives." 




 yeah this was sent over type not verbally and my doctors main question was why is hydromorphone in your system.
 




 Well I get my tests done thru Kaiser Permanente which is like the Wal Mart of hospitals so I assume its a screw up on their end.  I already messaged my doctor back telling her I am more than willing to re take the test.  it sucks because I am trying to get into this pain program and I am already getting pigeon holed for shit I haven't even done haha! 




 had a urine test and it came back positive for Dilaudid which I have never done in my life.  I take norco everyday for pain and have a legit script for that. any reason why this would happen?  i understand i would test positive for some kind of opiate but my doctor told me today about the dilaudid and I was like wtf I have no idea.   




 I'm gonna with the easy one: dying in my sleep.  but runners up are a quick accident where it happens so fast i'm dead before I know it or being doped up to the gills and go out peacefully if i had some kind of terminal illness. 




 agreed! he just stuck out to me so far. i'm still not done I keep getting distracted haha. 




 watching it right now about 1/2 way thru.  not too surprised this takes place in west virginia.  the guy with brain cancer makes me a bit sad i feel bad for him. 




 Pissing in a river watching it rise 




 I still get the exact same ones! 




 mac dre! you from the bay? 




 haha yeah i'm pretty versed in that schitk or however you spell it. 




 yep physical therapy and yoga is gonna be the 1st thing they want me to do. i have done a bit of research.  fuck man i have already done so much damn PT. 




 i have the same feeling that they will if i am lucky at least get me something that will last longer than my norcos which only last about 3 hours. 




 here is the deal i've been with the same doc for about 5 years now and have developed a rapport with her.  I am currently being prescribed 120 norcos a month for legitimate pain that MRI's will back up. I take usually about 3-4 a day so I don't feel that I am abusing them since when I take them I can actually move around and be somewhat limber.  I actually have a bit of a stockpile of them cause i've been a good guy haha.  Anyways last time I met up with her she wanted to refer me to the chronic pain program. I have never been in a situation like this. Is this good or bad?  FYI I am going thru Kaiser Permanente in northern california so if anyone has any experiences please share. thanks! 




 haha thats a jacket. 




 haha thanks for the comments guys.  just thought i'd share. 




 norcos
 









 wow. jackpot!! kudos to you!! 




 I'd be really surprised if they shipped to anywhere that you would need a script 




 That's a good deal. Did the person selling know what they had or just being generous?!? 




 hope you're not the one operating the boat. 




 Never seen these. Seen other generic whites but not shaped like the yellows  




 yeah i'm talking more like 5/500's. something with a lot of apap in it. 




 so it'd basically be like canada then with codiene more or less is what you are saying? 




 If heroin or opiates in general were legal to purchase in the US meaning you can go to Walgreens and buy opiate pills as you would like at anytime just like say ibuprofen then I believe possibly a lot more people would start using them because they would realize how much more effective they actually are than non narcotics when it comes to real pain. the problem with this of course is you have a small percentage of idiots who will of course abuse and od on said narcotics.  Natural selection perhaps?!?! I don't even have to state that crime would rapidly decrease if this were the case though.  For the record I am legally prescribed a small amount of opiate painkillers which I do take daily and responsibly.   




 OK good to know since I don't want to snort anything haha 




 I am still at around 3 norcos to do the trick and have somehow made this work for several years now.  Good self control/ tolerance i suppose although i have had to taper around to keep my tolerance in check.  I have only taken them orally.  Is it even worth it to snort them?  I have heard some people say its a waste of time but i'd like to hear people's opinions. 




 lol. hopefully i'll never be caught posting there!! 




 thats a weird subreddit never knew about it. 




 i might i just haven't ever taken one before so i get weirded out sometimes when i haven't used it before.  I know this sounds exceptionally funny coming from an opiate user too hahaha but i am weird when it comes to dumb shit like this sometimes. 




 And if any of you guys lived nearby I'd gladly give it up im just not gonna risk mailing it 




 Paying $80 for 1 tiny little pill no matter what it is just seems so frivolous 




 Haha I shouldn't have phrased it that way 




 I already stated my location in a previous post in this thread.  if you can find it then you win!! haha. 




 i'm not telling anyone at work what so ever. i do have a few ideas on who it could of been. plus the fact that its a kitchen that caters to down and out types of people could mean it was one of theirs as well so who knows. 




 for the record i don't plan on taking it. i frequent this forum and have a tolerance of 30mg hydrocodone daily. just thought it was crazy to find this under the circumstances that i did being a church and all.  best thing is 1st thing that crossed my mind: post this on r/opiates lol!! 




 thats what is kiling me is i want to know who dropped it!! i do work in a soup kitchen that caters to down and out types though so it could of came from one of them. 




 I just can't believe that i mopped the shit outta it and it was still intact. hahaha wow.  I wish 1 of you guys were here now so I could give it to you, I love my brops!! 




 northern california 




 damn thats crazy.  so these are the ones they discontinued?  I was thinking that they are. 




 I take norcos daily about 30mg and have had morphine in the hospital but I'm a bit worried about taking it since I hear that these are the  best ones and with my addictive personality and family history I might take it and never look back haha. I would honestly just give it to one of you guys so my curiosity doesn't get the best of me. What's the street value on these $30-50? 




 yeah its an oc 80.  so weird that i somehow found it while mopping up in a church kitchen lol.  its killing me to know whose it was!!   




 i work in a church kitchen and literally mopped up over this thinking it was a piece of candy.  never done these but have heard about them from this subreddit.  score?!?!  i don't know what i'm gonna do with it- i havent touched anything stronger than norcos.  http://imgur.com/t9pNREv 




 http://imgur.com/XUP6kk9 




 i saw a lot of people talked shit on my last pic post of 3 norcos in my grinder and thats cool doesnt bother me because it's people like me with self control that can stockpile their shit and make it through the rough and tough times.  good vibes everyone that has been cool to me.  http://imgur.com/XUP6kk9 




 i had an empty one in my car after buying about 15 norcos. Since all the guy gave me was the cellophane wrapping from a cig package to put em in I just threw em the tic tac container for the hour long drive back so they didn't get lost.  Will do it again if i don't have an actual pill bottle and recommend it as well haha! 




 lol i've actually had to do this before!! 




 i have done this several times on around 15-20mg a day habit for a couple years then cold turkey cause i ran out.  for about for days its uncomfortable but not that bad where it really affected me so much i couldn't function so i agree with your statement. 




 I did once on codiene cough syrup. one of the worst experiences of my life. drank about 1/2 bottle of the syrup and drank alcohol through out the course of the night. i had tried codiene cough syrup before but only in small doses and it felt great but this time around i honestly did not feel that buzzed so i just got bored and fell asleep.  next morning i woke up (luckily) and i felt extremely depressed/anxious and just crappy mentally. Like so much after a few days of feeling this way I got scared and actually went and saw a psycharatrist and told him what had happened and that i was starting to get very worried that i could of really fucked myself up mentally for life.  he said that basically what i was going thru was more or less normal and it was me withdrawing from the drugs. I have gone thru withdrawls from opiates before and this was nothing like it has ever been for me but yeah.  He gave me some valium which i only ended up taking 1 because it just made me feel loopy i guess and didn't really solve anything.  I'd say that it took the better part of a month to actually feel back to normal mentally.  Very scary stuff!! 




 yeah it might be related to different classes of people but i've only heard black people use the term up until this thread! 




 haha naw i know how to say it but i was just curious. 




 yeah if its a one time thing i'd think you be fine just don't make a daily habit of 4,500 mg acetaminophen but i hope you would know that already haha.
 




 haha then you are the first white guy i have heard use that term!  i was assuming it was a regional or hood type slang.  good to know. 




 how come black people always call it this and i've never heard any other race use this term for heroin?  just a dumb question that i have wondered for a long time haha. 




 Haha thanks man my tolerance is definitely higher than what it used to be but i am still trying to keep it relatively low so i can be a productive member of society and not a complete burnout  




 Not snorting them 




 I still can't believe how worked up some of you have gotten over this hahaha 




 a simple pill crusher. and a wood table that needs restoration, just bare wood is all. 




 hahaha i'm loving what my dumb thread has started.  I am totally sober now. it was a bit of a joke to begin with. 
























 it makes sense. kind like how suboxone works for me. 




 yeah i'm not expecting much from these but thought i might as well try them. my tolerance is about 60-80mg hydro 




 well it can't be worse coming off of than hydroodone? 




 ok for sure thanks!! what's the buzz like? 




 I probably can if i wanted to. i live in kinda a cutty place though.  I have a ton of suboxone and will eventually do the subs but for the time being i want to have a bit of fun and never tried tramadol. 




 ok cool. thanks for the heads up. i'm gonna start low obviously. not sure what mgs they will be prescribing me.
 




 ah ok well i havent in the past. 




 fucking ehhh man!! i wish i was in your fucking shoes right now!! en fucking joy!!! haha sorry for all the swears but i had to emphasize my excitment!!
 




 ok so if anyone has been somewhat following any of my recent posts, I basically was cut off from a 120 a month norco script that I was on for over a year. I was able to come to a comprimise with my doctor and she is going to give me ultram to help with my withdrawls.  what can i do with this stuff? i have avoided it in the past due to reading that it can cause gnarly seizsures.  should I take a chance on this stuff and is it any fun?? 




 how much do norcos go for in your neck of the woods?  They just seem really hard to come by nowadays. 




 no problem hah 




 Haha swim is not necessary around here fyi 




 oh i know that. you would have to consum a lot of poppyseeds to test positive on a pee test.   




 I don't know why i got a bit worried when i ate a poppyseed bagel the night before a pee test. Nothing happened obviously but i just kept thinking about that Seinfeld episode haha 




 not bad, just desparate haha
 




 i bet you are right. what is crazy is doc tried to start me on 8mg strips 2 times a day!! i stuck with 1 8mg strip a day. 




 hahahaha best story ever!! love it. 




 Yeah i guess so. Like i said first time for me on subs so i hope i didn't somehow blowout my opiate receptors lol 




 What i meant was that before subs 4 norcos would get me started good 




 Yep. I stopped at 10.  Its like  4 pills equal. 2 pills etc.  I can always take 4 and feel it nicely. I just don't want to waste my pills to not really achieve anything 




 I mran i can feel them but on day 3 still no warm euphoria like before the subs. I'm honestly getting kinda scared  




 8mgs for 5 days with no prior sub experience.  I feel the norcos but its like half as powerful as before subs 




 so i started on subs a week ago.  lasted a week but had a ton of norco so 2 days ago i took some.  i waited about 30 hours for it to be out of my system.  Problem is that its not hitting me the same as it did before I took subs.  I know the whole thing about the bupe blocking your opiate receptors and it could take a bit for real opiates to work.  Its now friday afternoon and i last dosed my subs at 11am tuesday.  Do I need to keep waiting or are my receptors just fried??  I hope I can still get somewhat high again.  I am a noob to subs but not to opiates. 




 jump in front of a car.  i am actually serious with that.  its going to be really hard to get any legit scripts from now on. 




 yep its coming down to it now where its really going to be hard unless you are a parapalegic or dying of cancer to get anything more than 30 5/500 vicodin.  i have posted a few things on this sub lately warning people after what happened to me about how hard its going to get but nobody really seems like that they want to believe that that is what is really going to happen. 




 same thing basically happened to me but i got completely cut off.  I had an appoinment yesterday with a "pain phychiratrist"  and she said that about 8-10 years ago it was fairly easy to get opiates prescribed from your doctor but in just the last year or 2 they have really been tightening up and its only going to be harder to get legal dope. she cited the obvious reasons - the DEA and all the dumbass famous people that couldnt handle their shit that is all in the media BUTTT  she also said that there have been recent studies showing that opiates do not really help for long term pain unless you are really old/have cancer its going to be near impossible and the fact that I am 32 not 62 makes it a lot harder for me to acquire those meds. that is basically what she told me.  She was really nice, straightforward and honest so I have no reason not to believe what she told me. 




 Yes me too. Let's hope that shit is true though.   If your insurance pays for your subs your doctor will probably find out  that is why i went somewhere else to get my subs 




 I just started on subs last week. Not through my insurance i went to a private clinic.  The lady said it would be confidential because of the HIPAA law 




 ok good to know. i'm just going to keep it up at least until my meeting on tuesday.  the doctor said he was giving me so much at first for cravings so you are correct. 




 i just started on subs this week too.  the doc wants me to take 2 8mg strips daily.  I thought that was overkill so i have been doing some experimenting on my dosages.  I am only 3 days in but i still feel nausea, headache and tired.  I hear that after 5 or so days this should go away? I feel like the side effects are outweighing the good effects. 




 thats the plan to wait as long as possible so i don't waste the pills. 




 haha it all depends on your tolerance. i remember when 2 norcos were nod time for me!! 




 Me too and I'm only on my third day haha. They have been great for withdrawals for sure though  




 I guess i am but it's not a good high. 




 i put myself on them. 




 Nausea. Headache.  Sleepy.  Basic side effects  




 headache, almost threw up, nausea.  basic side effects I guess. 




 yep i had crazy good self control for months when i was getting 120 norcos a month.  i kinda binged the last couple months though haha. 




 lol they gave me 16mg the 1st day!!. i'm on my 3rd day and taking maybe 4mg tops.  the subs seem to make me want my DOC less (norco) but the side effects are not fun.  apparently they should subside in several days?? 




 sounds like a good plan! 




 thats kinda what i want to do haha. i'm about 2 days in.  i don't have the craving for my norcos like I used to but the side effects of the subs really suck!! 




 just started on subs but still have a stockpile of these.   




 i started up on subs about 2 days ago. 




 [IMG]http://i42.tinypic.com/14cw30y.jpg[/IMG] 




 I know but at the same time they are so relentless talking about DEA and Obamacare that I am not going to be able get through to these people meaning that I need to get out of this program totally. 




 "any doctor who knows anything about pain though will know that opioids are a fundamental part of any good pain management"   LOL tell that to the pain mgmt doctor that I was referred to!!!  he is the reason that I now have NO form of opiate medication when I had it prescribed for 4 years.  

 




 Well i took my first ever dose today.  I waited close to 30 hours since my last opiate.  The doctor wanted me to take a whole 8mg strip. I thought that was too much so i cut it in half and they had me sit in a room for a while then i took the second half.  To be honest i thought id either get really sick or really buzzed. Neither of those 2 have happened yet and its been over 2 hours.  




 awesome man thanks for the input!! i will keep you updated!  




 looks like something i left in my toilet this morning. 




 ok thanks. so at this point i don't get a euphoria any more with my habit. i do feel good though. what can I possibly expect from subs as far as how i feel on it? i know everyone's experience is different but how did the subs make you feel?
 




 ok good to know. i am on the same page as you being that a small dose goes just as far as a large dose when it comes to subs.
 




 ok cool. thanks for sharing. that is basically what i have found so far. I will tell the doctor on tuesday to be gentle haha. but he should know how much to give me because I will be doing an interview beforehand telling a person my habit/tolerance.  once again thanks again!! i am still a bit nervous to start on subs. 




 thanks! i will. like i said its a monkey on my back that i will always most likely have unless i have some kind of "crutch" like suboxone.  but fuck it. if subs work then that would be awesome. 




 meaning to give me just a tiny bit since the research that I have done so far leads me to believe that a small amount of sub goes a long way.
 




 yes that is what i am going to tell them when they induce me.   




 so this week I am waving the white flag and going to try suboxone after having my doctor cut me off after prescribing me opiates for about 5 years.  I have been using around 10 norcos daily for the last 6 months.  I have heard people say that subs might be a bit too much for my habit but i really don't know what to do as I will soon be out of norcos with no script anymore.  both of my parents and a lot of my family have died from drugs so the addiction and craving is pretty instilled in me.  thinking subs might help with that.  thoughts?!?!  thanks!! 




 yep i fully agree with you that opiates should be used for depression. but i'm not holding my breath on that one haha.  that would be awesome though.  Well since I got cut off my plan on tuesday is to just put up the white flag and get on suboxone.  i am just sick and tired of playing the game with my doctor and sometimes going to the streets since my tolerance has gone up.  I got screwed but fuck it.  Just hope that people will take heed to my warning even if they are set up with a cushy doctor like I was.   




 lol for sure. do what you gotta do.   




 honestly I just wish they could prescribe opiates for depression!! I have been on Paxil for about 12 years and i feel like it does jack shit.  but the minute I take a pain pill i'm a new person.  and to top it off it does alleviate my physical pain as well when I can take all the ibuprofen in the world and that won't cut it.  I am definatly mentally and physically addicted to pain meds and have to qualms admitting that.  yes I am tired of playing the whole doctor game and i guess being cut off could be a good thing in the end for me possibly.  also the big head honcho pain doc doesn't even adhere to MRI's  he told me you take 10 normal people, MRI them and 9/10 will come back with some kind of damage.  This guy was a complete piece of fucking work. 




 dude not a problem at all. it takes a lot to offend me and trust me you didn't haha.  I have a tolerance now, obviously so when I take my meds I don't feel "high" just about normal.  I am i think about in the same boat as you where its a fine line between using them for what they are intended for or just strictly for recreation.  also I am not trying to scare you but i was in your exact doctor situation and it happened to me so I guess always have a back up plan if you plan on staying on opiates for a while. 




 I am going to try and get on MediCal. only problem is that I can't until the end of the year I think, January at the earliest. 




 Yes I do.  I have some pretty severe sports injuries to both of my ankles that do require surgery. at least that is what a podiatrist in my town told me when I visited him.  You can physically see how gnarled and distorted my feet are. I had an MRI done about 5 years ago and you could see the internal damage and I am sure that my ankles have just gotten worse since then.  I will admit though I love opiates and the way they make me feel, I am addicted. So maybe this is the wake up call I need to get off of them even though I have legit pain. 




 ok sounds like you are set up good!! that is nice. but just remember i had my same doc for 5 years. trusted her like family she would even hug me at the end of every appointment and tell me how i'm on of her favorites. I have sent her flowers, etc.  not trying to be a buzzkill whatsoever, just telling you to stay on your toes cause I really never thought it would happen to me in my situation.  I guess always have a back up plan?? haha i dunno.  I was trying to go about obtaining opiates the straight way and got stung in the end. 




 ok the only problem is that I have Kaiser insurance right now.  I can't just switch docs under my Kaiser insurance because any doctor working under Kaiser will see that it was recommended that I be cut off of my monthly script (120 norcos) so I don't think I could even stay with Kaiser.  I could try to change insurances and completely get out of Kaiser (which I plan on doing sooner or later) but in the time being paying out of pocket with no insurance is not going to be fun.  So I am just kind of stuck in a rough place because even if I tried to get new medical insurance today it still would take probably months for it to kick in. I live in California if that makes any difference.   




 so what are you doing about your situation now? 




 like i said they did mention the DEA too but yep its pretty shitty. I'm sure i'm not the first victim of this bullshit and definately not the last!! i am just warning everyone out there that this did happen to me and this is factual information that was relayed to me from the doctors I dealt with recently after going from 120 10/325 norcos a month to nothing.......  I wish it wasnt the truth but sadly it is.   




 Cannot agree with you more  brother!!! 




 I fully agree.  I feel like it was a way out or an excuse to cut me off 




 Thanks man!! I am just so fucking upset still though.  I trusted my doctor like family  




 Yeah its Kaiser  Northern California they are extremely nazish about opiates.  Look em up if you feel like it 




 I pretty much did and that is essentially what she said DEA. So yeah im over her and needed advice on a new doctor  




 jei do have mris. Ligaments and tendons wrecked to hell.  She specifically cut me off for the reasons i stated before.   She referred me to pain mgmt and their head doc said right off the bat no more narcotics.  My prescribing doctor is in love with this guy so the second he put in the recommendation she adhered.  All i really heard was a lot of talk about the DEA and obamacare. These are simply facts, shitty ones at that but that is what transpired that day. 




 "A real doctor writing prescriptions for legitimate reasons/patients has nothing to fear." 

you would think, right!?!?!  especially a pain mgmt doctor right!??!?! not in my case sir, not in my case.   




 its all good. but the fact is that I got cut the fuck off and obamacare/dea was the chief excuse.   hopefully it's not as bad as we think it will be but you have been warned. 




 I guess we'll just have to wait.  these are facts and exactly what I was told by real doctors so it's just a head's up.  Even if the doctors I have been dealing with are using it as an excuse to cut me off even though I have never showed signs of drug seeking. I know I am not the first victim of this shit and it's probably gonna get worse. 




 yes I do.  at least persistant enough to have supposedly been prescribed what I was receiving for several years. funny thing is that I really never even pushed or asked for norcos- she just kind of kept upping it. i started on 5/500 vics.    




 and also. for people with legit opiate scripts like myself:  what do you plan on doing since the DEA and the whole ObamaCare thing is going to REALLY REALLY start fucking us over very soon???  I bring this up because that is what every doctor I have dealt with in the last 2 weeks has told me.  This shit is about to get fucking real I think.
 




 Oh yeah. FUCK KAISER PERMANENTE!!! they are nazis.  if anyone here has them, do not take your chances if you are trying to get any kind of opiate!!! 




 In my last post I told everyone how i was cut off by my doctor.  I have been scripted 120 10/325s for about 2 years now. I am under Kaiser Permanente northern california. She has been wanting me to do the Kaiser pain program for about 8 months telling me how good the head doctor is and how much she respects him.  I thought ok if she is referring me to a pain program I should be set right?!?!  Big mistake.  It took me about 2 months just be seen but when I went to my appointment he walks in and immediately says you need to stop taking norco.  he then berates me for about 20 mins about how much pain he has had for the last 30 years and he only takes about 4 percocet a month.  anyways i knew that i was fucked when he said he wanted me cut off since my regular doc that prescribes me the norcos looks up to this guy.  After that i have my app with her and she is like yep, you are done.  Most fucked up thing is she told me verbally more than once that when I got into this pain program that they would "at least start me on some low dose oxycontin"  I cannot believe what dirty shit was pulled on me.  I have had the same primary doctor for over 5 years and she was basically family to me.  She would always hug me and tell me I was one of her favorites.  Anyways my question is, I am thinking of ditching Kaiser all together and trying to get onto something like Medical.  I have proof I have been scribed the norcos for several years.  How hard would it be to get a new doctor to carry over that script?  Is it worth trying?  It's not like i'm coming out of the blue asking for them so I would think I have a bit of an advantage but just want to know everyone's thoughts. THANKS!!!!!
 




 thanks man. the reason why i brought up subs is that I aknowledge that i am physically and mentally addicted to opiates.The small amount of research that I have done leads me to believe that it helps with your mental cravings for opiate which I need to address. Even if i was to taper off the norcos that would work but would probably not do shit to stop me from craving them mentally.  I dunno though...... 




 i just found it right after i submitted this post!! haha thanks. i need to pay more attention.  




 i have had withdrawls before when I had to stop taking a smaller dose in the past. it sucked but wasn't the end of the world.  Obamacare is what he is blaming this on.  I get 120 a month but I usually take up to 8 a day ( i know i know haha)  i went to suboxone.com and found several docs in my area.  i guess i will just call around tomorrow and tell them my situation and if its even logical to do?  i couldn't really find anything on the site that was specific about how much you take or what you take pertaining to if suboxone would help that.  I will admit that I am physically and mentally addicted though so I thought this could work. thanks for the input.
 




 so I just found out today that my doctor who has had me on norco for the last 4 years wants to to quit cold turkey and is cutting me off. this really sucks but it's something I guess I have to deal with.  How do I go about obtaining a suboxone script and is this the best option to help me? I mentioned it to her and she kinda wrote me off, i don't think she was in a good mood.  I am on about 6-8 10mg Norcos.  thanks guys.   




 Anyone in the 530 area?  I have no connections here  




 how is the interaction with soma and hydrocodone?  yay or nay?   
























 I am just starting to watch the episode.  I find it weird that girl is addicted to gabapentin. 




 I have hardware and other gnarly looking mri's. Pm? 




 are they giving out free opiate based drugs at this super bowl??  if so, yes, yes I am very fucking interested in this bowl that is super. 




 stop taking them immediately and send the rest to me for further evaluation
 




 I must purchase one of these. 




 yeah you're right about the driving around part haha just did that today with a pound of weed. 




 never used SR or any of them. Probably never will. Seems way too sketchy. 




 ok thanks for the info. and i have been in the same boat as you more or less with anxiety/depression issues my whole life most likely so I know that any pill is no cure all to anything. i am still waiting for them to approve fucking opiates for depression!! not gonna happen but still can wish. 




 haha i'll accept that as a viable answer! 




 oh ok.  I was prescribed it in hope of getting something more like xanax.  I have been on Paxil for 12 years now and have a history of depression anxiety. 




 yep exactly what happened for a bit. not too long tho and it was when i was dozing off sleeping so i thought maybe it was happening naturally since that is when people tend to jerk around.
 









 so it's like Jesus is putting his arm in place of dude's?   




 holy shit!! 50 is supposed to knock most people on their ass.   




 ok that kinda started to happen to me when i was falling asleep now that you mentoin it. 




 I have taken 100mg on top of several norcos. Nothing. 




 I have taken 100mg on top of several norcos. Nothing.  




 Happy birthday.  nod it out! 




 So I've seen a few posts here and there about seroquel and taking it with opiates but never really got much from those threads.  I guess basically the seroquel intensifies the nodding effects.  Curious because today i was prescribed seroquel and took 100mg and so far not much!!  




 This has been discussed many times but i'll chirp in again haha.  I don't know, have a job i guess??  When I have no cash flow i do recycling and coinstair.   




 yeah i'm curious about those grainy looking pills too haha 




 yep it sucks. next time around on subs (I have access to real opiates at the moment) i am going to probably quarter what i was started on.  I don't know why bupe doctors heavily overprescribe the stuff. 




 actually my story is just an example of how this shit can backfire in your face.  i thought that since my doc was referring me to a pain specialist i'd be taken care of right??  well the exact opposite happened. Yes they will or at least should pee test you but if you are on narcotics already you should pee positive for them and that is completely fine.  They want to make sure you are actually taking the medicine that they prescribe to you.  but yeah hopefully what happened to me doesnt to you-just a cautionary tale of when everything should be set in stone it gets all fucked up.  Murphy's law at it's finest.   




 i have to say I was on about the exact same dosage as you and put on 8mg twice a day.  It worked yes but in the end jacked up my tolerance immensly so that when i went back to use i had to take way more to feel the same effect. 




 If you feel up to reading my post from a few months ago here is my 1st (and worst) experience with a pain management program.  This is how it should not go!!  http://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1pzawa/doctor_question/ 




 about? 




 ok. i've never done any drugs other than weed so the freebase part i don't follow but its all good.  so the other day my homie got a small amount of tar for $50. i looked at it. seemed a bit bigger than say a nickel. i thought it was just so small but now that you told me only a match head size you can smoke to get 3 hits off of it makes more sense now.
thanks for the info!! 




 ok also i want to ask you some questions. I have only ever done pharms: norco, oxy, etc.  I just usually pop them but I have foiled some roxi blues. How does the tar compare to smoking a roxi? do you do it off foil?   




 lol how many norcos and kpins you working with?!?!
 




 i am in almost the same exact thing as you. norcos then started buying roxy to supplement.  i have to agree with everyone saying tolerance.  thats really all it is.  oxy is a bit stronger than hydro in comparison but not enough for me to notice.  tolerance sucks!! i hate it. 




 lol the ninja opiate. didn't know that about fent. 




 tramadol is so weak I am surprised you get anything from it. but that's actually good for you if you can still catch a buzz from it.  Why don't you tell your doctor you at least need something to replace the tramadol with.  If you get lucky he might give you something better but i'd stay away from saying names of meds like "I want Norco" or etc.  its not fair that he cut you off completely he should at least taper you.  I have been in very similar situations too.
 




 $1 per milligram sounds about right!?!?  I am not positive though. 




 nevermind sorry for asking a dumb question you already answered!
 




 how many 
 




 ah ok haha
 




 mmmk 




 let's party
 




 I am just using trams for being able to sleep thru the night right now.  that and gabapentin help a lot.  I don't have a huge habit/tolerance.  I'd say about 120 mg hydro daily. but lately like the last month i can't sleep up until 8am without jerking all around and crawling outta my skin.  That sucks and I am now realizing shit is getting serious.  So anyways I got tramadol and gaba scripted to me and take them around 2am and they really do help me just sleep.  I am trying to keep my tolerance in check so yeah in that respect if you have em for maintenince and don't want to go crazy with your tolerance they do help. 




 FUCK YEAH!! and don't they suck when you wake up???!?!!! but this one was different. it wasnt completely lucid like i knew it was kinda a dream to begin with so when i woke up i was like wtf but not totally bummed haha.
 




 LOL ok. i just never seen any asians dabbling in opiates like  I have never seen an IV user strung out on the streets. to me that's a picture of a white guy/girl.
 




 lol it was basically like how they sell "legal weed" synthetic stuff now. but this was claiming it was a certain % pure heroin. 




 I had a pretty cool dream last night.  Basically I was looking through a magazine and they were advertising selling heroin.  Thing is somehow it was legal to sell because it was only 7.xx real heroin so they were able to find a loophole I guess haha. I think i remember it was sold and shipped from some little tiny country as well. Woke up like damn!! not real.  Anyways thought I would share that with everyone. 




 OK I have been using this lately for withdrawls in between my doses.  I am taking pills-oxy or hydro.  In the early morning I had been getting the classic symptoms-jerky body, restless legs, basically couldn't sleep and I did NOT want to waste my precious limited suppy of real opiates so I was able to procure a script from my doc. Took 2-3 around 2am and voila no more symptoms whatsoever. I can now get a great mornings sleep.  Other than that, the times I did take Trams they made me a bit nauseous but I was riding in a car and hadn't had much to eat.  As far as recreational value, if you have little to no opiate tolerance I bet they would be kinda cool. 




 lol probably. opiates, at least to me seem like a white mans burden haha. 




 So are you looking for pills? if you now graduated to H would pills still do anything for you? I guess it depends on your habit and ROA?? I haven't gone the H route yet so I am not sure.  Anyways I live near a big college town and pills are pretty hit and miss but then again I am 10 years above your average freshman college goer so I don't really run with that crowd.   




 Reading the last paragraph oh this really sums it up for a lot of people on this sub i bet.  It at least hit home with me 




 the op 80s i have now i put in coke overnight so my tolerance is 1 a day of the op 80s and the buzz lasts me a while. 




 so i just had op 80s for the first time the other week. i like them.  paid $20 a piece for them.  i have a chance to get blue i think 30mg roxis for the same price.  is this a fair price and what is the difference between the 2 as far as the high is. i am bit confused as to why they are both the same price when one is an 80mg pill and the other is only 30.   




 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oh8zcbC_Dcw 




 it was actually an oral surgeon!! haha you'd think he would know. 




 lol i got darvocet for my wisdom teeth and they were impacted meaning they had to cut out my gums to get to them. 




 dying of cancer and last leg of life shit basically.  doctors are getting to be assholes about scripting anything anymore. 




 ok i just drank the whole concotion yesterday and it seemed to work fine. 




 ok last night i threw a whole 80 in a a shot glass of coke. this morning it's looking all gelly and i can still see the actual pill or carcasss of the pill. its all blown up like 3 times bigger than original.  just sip the mixture or what? haha i hope i didn't mess up.  




 i did haha it worked. 




  ok i just checked on it. its all gelled up but seems to be broken down. i am just scooping some out and eating it haha is that ok?

 




 ok i just checked on it. its all gelled up but seems to be broken down. i am just scooping some out and eating it haha is that ok? 




 lol it's all good. thanks. lots of good info in there. 




 will do. thanks everyone! 




 Exactly what im doing.  How long do you wait?  




 I know i'm probably beating a dead horse her but i've never had them before. my tolerance is up to 10 norcos in 24 hours. usually a bit less though.  i currently broke one in 1/2 and have it sitting in a shot glass of coke and they are floating around haha.  any other ideas? they are the op 80s incase it's hard to tell in the pic.  http://i43.tinypic.com/2s6mu50.jpg 




 Damn that s a ton of pills but i recently go cut off as well. My script pales in comparison to yours but i can still understand the betrayment and downright fear you  feel 




 Chico 530 help a n*gga out
 




 you been at the local dog park picking up the turds?!?! hahaha jk have fun!! 




 ah ok 




 anyone around chico? 




 are you yelling at me?? I don't understand I was just asking a question. 




 what are in you in the hospital for?  you got a do it your self pump in your bed?   




 I've never heard of this ever in the states. 




 i was in a similiar situation before.  I thought it over then i decided not to do it since i'd be totally up shits creek with nothing if I got caught and i hear that pharmacies call the doctor back sometimes a lot nowadays. depends on on the pharmacy maybe.  you can do it but just weigh the pros/cons i guess of the situation haha 




 haha it didnt really do anything!! Gonna go with 100 mg today and see. 




 Ite. Just popped one 50mg tram a few minutes ago.  would try more but it's my 1st time so i'm being safe hah. 




 Ok cool. Im not on subs right now but i might try a couple trams tonight when i get home.  Got the script yesterday and haven't touched it yet 




 yeah i usually do that with norco the empty stomach routine and never have had a problem with that. i also have a pill crusher and use that.  i started on subs recently as well but have a decent amount of norcos left so i was wondering what will work best haha.  Yeah the buzz from subs, not really a buzz but i'd call it like a dirtier version of a norco buzz.  It's not bad it gets me thru the day but i'd take norcos any day over subs.   




 also do you think that if i took these with norco it would help or hinder the norco buzz?   




 Alright thanks.  i have little round white pills that say an 527 i believe on them. 




 lol dude!! exactly............ 




 aight. i will look into it though. since i am going to use anything before I have to go back onto subs which I assume will be the rest of my life.
 




 yeah i'd like to know too after being in my current situation. 




 ok this is probably a no but is it possible to take this with suboxone?  I am doubting it..... 




 and also I am under Kaiser insurance.  if you haven't heard of Kaiser its like a network of hospitals and doctors all intertwined (is that a word?) haha but anyways i cannot simply just switch doctors under kaiser to get back on my meds cause any doctor under kaiser will see that fucking recommendation from the head of pain managment saying something like no more norco. so i'm fucked unless I change insurance and start all the way fucking over again. 




 She reffered me to pain mgmt. Head guy there is anti meds and put a recommendation to my doc that my norco should be pulled.  funny thing is i thought i was moving up the ladder when being reffered.  I am now on suboxone which i did with my own money and no insurance since they fucked me over. 




 isnt that essentially a speedball?
 




 ok. i am on paxil as well. heard of any interactions? 
























 Ok awesome thanks for the good info and quick response! Would you see any interaction between the 'done and this?  Based on what I told you, you would recommend the Bali?  Also how many mg's should I dose at first time I try?  Sorry for all the questions- i've known of kratom for about a year but I am still a bit hesitant to try it mainly because I read to many things on the net comparing it to bath salts and the like so I kinda scared myself haha. thanks again bud!!
 




 Where can you get kratom in the states? At a headshop type place or  you think they would just call me a junkie and say F off haha. What kinds/brands are good? I have heard that the capsules are crappy.  How much should I try for never having tried it before?  Also I am on Methadone so I don't even know if I should try it since I am on it. 




 That would be called a trigger 




 picture? 




 Not at all. For some reason it makes me super upset that most of these people never use gloves!!! 




 well for what it's worth, the past few years in the states its been harder and harder to get a legit script for any kinda narcotic pain reliever.  I even had my own script for 120 Norco a month for about 2 years then I was cut off because my doctor was all worried and scared about DEA, me getting addicted to them, etc.  Now I am on methadone thanks to that situation.   




 damn won't ship to the U.S.  I heard that the laws against opiates in the UK were a lot stricter in general than in the U.S.  Is that true?  Pertaining to prescription opiates. 




 dude i've dealt with several people that read the big number on the pill (500, 325,etc) and use that as the amount of good stuff in the pill.  I am not positive if these people were trying to get over on me but I would lean towards them just being dumbass stoners who never sold pills and therefore know really nothing about them. 




 yeah dude it's over. sorry to break it to ya. haha i don't know just go and pee. i would say use fake pee but the methadone clinic i go to tests the fucking temperature of it so you have to get the pee right within the correct range it should be when leaving your body. 




 I don't think she tried to jack you I think she was honestly that stupid.  




 ahh the good ole motrin 800 deal. most doctors go to when they won't give you opiates.  been down that road many times-that shit sucks.
 




 so what did they give you?  i actually had down on my file for about 7 years I was allergic to codiene but recently had them change that. 




 ha i was asking myself wtf pubrenorphin is too.  some kinda drug i'm not hip too? haha
 




 probably because pharms require a script and heroin doesn't. 




 how'd you find this site?!?! no script!?! 




 oh ok yeah i've seen pics of them. 




 pink? were they shaped liked norcos? never seen those. 




 I have been down both of those paths.  I never really thought of it though.  I can tell you though that i enjoy opiates way much more than alcohol any day.  I used to not be able to go 1 day without booze and likewise for opiates.  I just got sick of drinking so I gave it up cold turkey and luckily felt a lot better with out any kind of withdrawls.  I drank everyday for about 4 years straight.  Now with opiates I was doing some form of them for about 5 years straight too.  I was scripted norcos for a long time but thanks to doctor's getting scared now about scripting anything I got cut off. I now am on methadone.  To answer your question is a bit hard actually now that i think of it.  I don't think I could give you a solid answer other than repeating that opiates are always #1 to me over any other substance.
 




 lol i've been in that situation before where they read the amount of tylenol in it and believe that the more apap in the pill the better!! fucking idiots.  just play stupid too and try to get the best deal if they don't know what they have. 




 I am on both methadone and paxil 




 75 is a good ass deal but depends on the potency of it.  If its been cut to all hell then its not that great of a price although i have been paying 60 for .5 g lately.  I've been getting really good stuff lately tho.  




 depends. that is actually what made me move to bth is because of the sparse pill scene and the cost of pills.  I'm sure places like SF where I used to live its easy to score either pills or H.  When I lived near SF I didn't really do opiates so I never bothered.  Now that i live kind of middle of nowhere so not many pills and i have to drive almost an hour for bth. 




 i believe its bth mixed with a powdered cut.  put both in an empty plastic bottle and shake away. 




 I haven't done anything to sleazy or immoral at least in my eyes haha.  I've done a bit of pawning which I kind of regret since pawn shops always give you the lowest lowball shit price for whatever you are pawning.  Scrapping metal.  I have a small truck- Ford Ranger so I can only put so much in but I usually am able to get around $40 each haul.  I have a couple older neighbors that have a bunch of stuff and they just tell me what to take and I get the whole profit since I am getting it off their property.  




 i actually had less of an appetite on most opiatesi used recreationally but now that I am on methadone I crave sweets. 




 Could be. I really don't know that much about how the cartels operate as far as where the dope ends up.  I do know that you should never get involved with any Mexican cartels.  After seeing numerous photos and videos of what they do to people who cross them even in the slightest way makes me believe that they are probably the most ruthless organized crime association ever. 




 i'd say 98% or more of the dope in California is coming from Mexico. 




 agreed 




 I seriously contemplated this especially after seeing the pic of the foil and straw!!  




 in california i've only encountered bth and gunpowder but I haven't been messing with H that long.  just maybe 6 months after making the jump from pharms.   




 I have to disagree at least partially because 95% of the people that I see everyday at the methadone clinic look fucking haggard. 




 lucky man seems like everyone including myself these days is getting cut off.
 




 ok i was just wondering if there was any other advantage to shooting it.  so you are shooting your liquid take homes? 




 I'm not surprised since that's what most of us here would love to be able to master/attain.  It's tough, at least for me to balance it out.  Well not really anymore since I have been on mmt for about 3 weeks. 




 how come you shot methadone?   




 ok seems to make sense.   




 i smoked some bth once since being on mmt and it wasn't as much of a rush or high as usual but it was there for sure- the high but it was weaker than normal.  also could be a bit of placebo effect know that methadone is supposed to block other opiates.  I am on 50mg currently only on mmt for 3 weeks.  I slipped up because it's just the ritual of smoking bth that I love.  I have norcos at my house and I haven't touched them since starting mmt. 




 so you are saying that if one 1 day of the week you double your dosage and it gets you pretty high?  How is that been working for you i'm not at the point of take homes yet and i'm only taking 50mg right now but I have a feeling the dr is going to up it. 




 why does everyone say that? is it because cravings for food- sugary types specifically are a lot higher when on mmt?  I have been on only 3 weeks and I am doing good with it but getting large cravings for sweets is what I have noticed. 




 yeah see that's where I am kind of not knowing what I should really do since I do have actual pain and xrays and my in my medical file it lists that I have "chronic pain syndrome".  Has said that for the last 5 years.  At the same time though my body is physically addicted to opiates and probably a bit mentally too.   




 i have been on opiates legally prescribed to me for about 5 years.  I recently moved so i have a new pain doc who was giving me norcos.  in the recent last few months my using was getting a bit out of control- buying on the street, even smoking a bit of tar and I thought to myself i should do something about this.  I have done suboxone in the past but they just didn't work for me.  I researched methadone for a couple weeks then I went down and started on the program.  I made an appoinment with my pain doc about a week in and told him what I was doing (in my state the law states that if you are in a clinic you do not have to tell your doctor.  But i went ahead an was honest to him and he was actually really proud of me and encouraging.  I was pretty nervous and the appoinment went by so fast that I forgot to even ask him if he would prescribe me it.  Probably not now that he know's I was in a clinic but I am trying to really be "clean"  now instead of spending all my money on pills or H since my script was not making it even close to the end of the month.   




 Ok thanks i'll maybe look in my area for doc's that prescribe methodone.  my pain mgmt doc I have now might even be able to do it for me. 




 yeah I agree with docs not wanting to write a script for opiates as I have been playing that game with docs for about 8 years.   




 I've been on done for about 2 weeks now.  It's a clinic deal and I have to drive there 7 days a week to get my stuff and I live about 30 mins away.  I was wondering if it would be possible to get a doctor to script me done instead of doing what I have to do everyday.  It's a bit expensive on gas with the drive everyday.  I did some research and I think that it is possible to get it from a doctor instead of going to a clinic everday and dosing.  Just wanting any feedback if anyone has tried to get scripted thru a doc.  I have a history of chronic pain that is documented and have a current pain mgmt doctor.   




 I just started it last week but i'm doing it to get "clean" so I am in a program and go everyday to get my dose.  I am on a fairly low dose (50mg)  and i have yet to really feel a high from it. more just like it keeps most of my withdrawls and cravings at bay so I can get on with my life and not worry about how i'm gonna hustle up $100 a day for H.  If you were to have no tolerance to opiates I could see it as being ok but never understood why people would ever do it recreationally. 




 same exact thing happened to me basically last fall.  we are living in an era now that we will be seeing a huge decline in prescribing pain meds and it's going to fuck shit up worse because people who would never had before will now be trying heroin.  my doctor just gave me the go to answers: DEA cracking down, Obama Care and the fact that a small amount of dumbasses had to go and OD and fuck it up for the rest of us responsible people.  As for advice, fuck it just go to the street and find some H, that is what I did when I got cut off my pills. 




 what i would do is at least quarter the op 80- the more pieces the better and put it in a shot glass of cola. the longer the better. i would usually do it overnight.   




 i'd say it depends on who you are talking to but yes alcohol seems to be a lot more tolerated than heroin or any opiate in general.   




 are you talking about putting oc's in it overnight??  if so yes I have done it.  I think basically anything with carbonation and citric acid help but I always do prefer coke. 




 i just found these for instance.  good deal?!?!   http://www.webstaurantstore.com/regal-bulk-poppy-seeds-25-lbs-case/102708404.html?utm_source=Google utm_medium=cpc utm_campaign=GoogleShopping gclid=CNjqv5qNib0CFa5DMgodoUsAag 




 ok i'll check it out.  i have tried to make PST in the past and have failed but I think mainly because i got regular poppy seeds.  Any more input on this!?!?   Just wondering why more people don't do this. 




 i just checked looks like they won't ship to the US though hah. is there any morphine still in the plant? i am a noob when it comes to poppys. 




 wait so you can just order these and they are legal?   




 Well then i'd like to see that!! haha. but yeah maybe if you at least stopped shooting it?  did you build up to that from smoking/snorting? 




 This is the 1st time i have commented on a girls pics on this sub so you caught my attention.  Amazing you have been able to keep it up that long and still look that good! 




 you look too healthy to be a shooter. how often do you indulge? 




 seriously man F that!!  




 i think that is all of our major concerns lol.  I mean i'd rather get burned or beat up by someone than have any law issues.   




 How is a rainbow made?? how exacty does a posi traction on the rear end of a plymouth work?? It just does!!!  




 yeah i did and it feels good like a smoked a blue.   




 i'm in california where powder is hard to come by
 




 ok i broke down and just did.  feel a little light headed and high but good. 




 it's black tar. you would smoke it off foil. that's at least what i would do first.
 




 Looks like it's time for a lot of us to move to the UK!
 




 OK this was on wiki:   Under the chemical names diamorphine and diacetylmorphine, heroin is a legally prescribed controlled drug in the United Kingdom, and is supplied in tablet or injectable form for the same indications as morphine is, often being preferred over morphine due to its lower side-effect profile.[citation needed] It is also available for prescription to long-term users as a form of opioid replacement therapy in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany, and Denmark, alongside psycho-social carein the same manner that methadone or Suboxone (buprenorphine) are used in the United States and Canada[10][11]and a similar programme is being campaigned for by liberal political parties in Norway. 




 It smells like vinegar.  My friend gave it to me and I really want to try it.  I have had it since last night and havent touched it since I have not broken my H cherry yet.  should be no big deal?!?!  He smoked some last night and said its really good stuff.  its a tiny amount, smaller than a dime. 









 yeah i was thinking they would mainly be used for maintaining/not being sick more so than recreation.
 




 ah ok 8 mg codeine? what amounts can you buy them in like is there a limit? 




 i have heard that it is sold in certain counties in prescription dose supposedly.  This is not from my experience. 




 This has been discussed some I think before but does anyone know exactly what is legal and where?   For instance I have heard that codeine for the most part be it cough syrup or T3's I hear is legal in Canada.  I have also talked to people that tell me pharmacutical opiates such as norco and oxy and more or less legal in Mexico at most pharmacies.  I have even heard as far as some counties in the US will sell products with codeine OTC!?!?  




 norco. but i do oxy when available. 




 OK cool.  do you know how that would relate to a 120mg hydrohabit?  mine is not quite that but has been upwards of.  i am just trying to figure that out. i will start small of course.
 




 lol almost did that swallowing technique
 




 that seems like a good price. how long would that last you.  250 would get me like 9 blues. smh. 




 so you were shooting it then? i am trying to see how it would convert as well but its hard since heroin is cut with god nows what whereas pills are always a sure thing. 




 and i think it costs about 4cents a piece to make them or less. 




 true! 




 i think you would loose way too much smoke that way.  i'm not sure though as I have only smoked blues a handful of times and it was thru a pen tube. 




 yeah i would think so as well but i dunno. 




 OK thanks. i've been around the stuff i can get ahold of and I hear that it's pretty decent stuff i have just not tried yet cause I was still wasting $$ on pills.   




 yeah i'm in california so i can only get tar i believe. i think there is powder but harder to come by
 




 OK i was thinking a large tooter like a pen.  i know at the beginning i might loose a bit.  I never did get down smoking blues that well either haha.   




 This is the epitome of pill porn.  Finally a good example!
 




 I've been doing pills for about 5 years now.  Everything from 5's to OP 80s.  I'm getting sick of paying out the ass for pills. $200 for like 8 blues is not my piece of cake.  I know where I can get tar heroin.  I assume that the H would go a lot farther than buying pills financially speaking?  I also would plan on smoking it and I assume you would foil it?  I have never done H before and want to know how much to try at first.  I would think like a pin head size?   Getting on subs and getting clean is my long term goal but before I am done with opiates I would like to just try this once.  Please don't criticize me, I just want some honest advice here!!! thanks guys. and oh my tolerance is decent.  lets say 120mg oxy daily but could handle more without completely nodding. 
























 Ite thanks I'm out looking for seeds right now but I can't find the right kind 




 I dunno I'm not sure if I have read any of your earlier posts but this post had me thinking it was a guy  




 it's nice to at least sorta know what you are going to ingest. 




 I have been researching how to grow poppies for the last couple weeks.  I have a really large backyard that is almost forest like.  I think that would be a good place to grow?  Any input?  how much sun do the seeds need?  that might be the only issue.  thanks! 




 ha i was reading this assuming you were a guy until i got to the parking lot part. 




 I have been in for about 3 months just about to come up on my take homes and as I today (i just talked with the head of the clinic), I haven't missed a day and have had all clean UA's.  Have I relapsed since I have been in? Yes I have used H several times but been lucky enough to have it out of my system by the time they UA and it is always random which makes it a bit more scary.  I want to stop using once I start getting take home since if I do get caught I gotta start over again but it's more tempting now because I'm thinking exactly what you are thinking haha.  I don't really have any advice, maybe just try not to use?  Thats the only foolproof way but is a bit hard when you are still at the beginning of maintenence. Also if you gotta use, try to use the day you get UA afterwards or the next day very soon after you were UA'd so less of a chance to get UA'd again. 




 LOL too easy 




 Fuck dude I know soooooo many people that would fall for this 




 looks like you made out pretty good just remember its 325mg pure vikaden 




 OK at least you have a plan if shit hits the fan haha.  What do you mean by wait a few years for a new script? Is there only a certain amount of time that you can be blacklisted at a clinic? 




 oh okay yeah of course it is but if you have a high tolerance they really aren't worth much but I don't know go ahead and try hah 




 okay I don't know any better but I would just think it would be a bit safer to ask for a higher dosage.  I mean I started with just vicodin and ended up eventually smoking bth and that is something I regret but it is just way cheaper than pH arms. Plus same as you my tolerance was building. I dunno I just got cut off from a 3 year steady script of norcos for no reason so I'd assume if doctor found track marks on you it'd be no more scripts for you. I guess just be careful. 




 also if you are shooting, any pharm they give you probably won't touch your pain because of your high tolerance. 




 so why do you need a script!?!?! haha the dope you shoot should cover your pain just as well as any pharm. 




 how come you are iv'ing them? 




 ah you remind me of myself at 21-just starting to jump thru the hoops of trying to attain that first script. I am assuming you have little to no tolerance.  Most likely your gonna get 5/500s if any narcotic is scripted.  Once those don't do the trick anymore its time for more fun- trying to obtain norcos or oxy from your doc.  After a fair amount of time and a lot of work put in convincing and buttering up your doctor(s) you will hopefully have an ongoing script for a halfway decent opiate.  haha sorry I kinda went off on a tangent I don't even know if you are trying to go the route of getting an ongoing script but  yeah your gonna have to start slow and small, this shit doesn't happen overnight. 




 do you get opiates for your crohns? my friend was just diagnosed with it and they never spoke of giving him opiates. 




 ha i've had 2 doctors tell me this actually.  




 Some stories are good.  I just don't always like how they write the stories with a lot of bias sometimes. 




 yeah thats good no APAP. that is one of the worser things I think when it comes to pharms. 









 Yeah heroin is fairly harmless if you know how strong and how much you are using also knowing exactly whats in it. I was more talking about pharms with Tylenol and other fillers 




 Damn thats crazy you  have been on pain pills that long!  Have you ever just tried to somehow get off them? I can't imagine living til a somewhat good age with all the problems narcotic meds can present to your kidneys, liver, stomach and other parts of your body. Also your libido. They did that for me at least and I was starting to get worried when I was on a high dose. 




 Yeah I've heard several things about getting off paxil. Some say its really hard but the last psychologist I had said it is fine to just stop taking.  I kept asking her are you sure since I had never heard that. 




 Thanks. I would be going to a new doctor a psychiatrist.   




 OK well I hope you don't mind wasting money.  I couldn't feel anything after 60 .
 




 Hi I have been taking Paxil for about 12 years now.  I think it's working out ok but the past couple years I have felt more and more anxious and have had probably 10 or so panic attacks in the last couple years.  Would I benefit from a benzo? If so what kind?  Would a doctor be more willing to prescribe me a benzo seeing that I've been on Paxil for so long?  Thanks guys! 




 OK cool. I never knew this- actually just heard of etizolam this week.  So if it is "basically xanax" how come you don't need an rx?  Has the FDA not found out about it yet? 




 LOL!!! I've seen that movie and could see someone thinking its real if they never heard of it. 




 You use H on that much methadone? 




 Oh I just saw the link. Thanks man! 




 Without a script? Should I pm you. 




 Chico? 




 Because I always thought they seemed a bit more relaxed about that kinda stuff and I think Tennessee is #1 in number of opiate meds prescribed in U.S.  I'm near chico. 




 OK I was gonna guess the South. 




 you can tell its a penis and a nut sack that got smashed like a pancake. tell me you see it because i do 




 Yeah sometimes it happens that way. What state are you in? 




 Yeah you gotta think in  a Murphys law type way when your in that situation but when I was I thought naw not gonna happen to me why would it?!??!  Then boom carpet pulled out under me haha. Oh and fuck tolerance too!! I tried so hard when I first got scripted norcos to keep it low.  In about 2 years I was up to like 10 a day compared to 2.   




 Yessir 




 OK well you seem to be in a good position right now.  I have had to sign those contracs too.  I also think it's a bit harder to get a script if you are younger and a male which I assume you are younger person?  also I wasn't trying to be harsh but I noticed I really didn't need my pain medicine as much as I thought after not having them.  I still have the records of being on a narcotic for several years since then I have changed insurance and my doctor and probably could find a new doctor to start prescribing me again but I am over spending all the energy and time going to do doctors and hoping they will give me my medicine back so for now I am just on methadone and actually the done has made my life a lot better since I am NOT worrying when I'm going to run out of my script and have to go to the street and buy some H or pills. the last few months were pretty expensive since I had you end up doing that a bit but now on methadone I never need to worry about running out of meds and it's free. 




 Oh I just saw he's giving you fucking xanax on top of a narcotic painkiller!??!! Maybe you really did get lucky and find a crooked doctor haha cause that is quite a  bit there.. 




 Going and once a month should be a law pretty soon at least that's what my doctor told me.  We also had a great relationship for several years as I thought until she for some random reason got scared to keep prescribing what she said was the maximum amount of norcos a month .  She mentioned obamacare and the DEA getting stricter on pain meds.  all I know is about six or seven years ago it was a ton easier to get these meds.  I think most doctors are going to try and wean their patients off the narcotic drugs in the next few years.  Now I'm stuck on methadone.  Do you really need these pills? I know you will tell me that you do but you probably deep down know you could probably make it without em.
  I'm not trying to call you out but I will warn you that you got to be like a cancer patient nowadays or really old and in really bad shape to get anything it really sucks.  I am in California and this seems to be how its been working now.  Good luck I never thought this would happen me. 




 120 10mg hydrocodones?  just a guess.  that was all me every month for 2 years straight til i got cut off!! 




 Oh whaaa?? 




 OK I looked it up I think you need a script.  How are these compared to other benzos?? 




 So I could go to a store and purchase this?? 




 Are those etizolam an RX medicine? I have only heard of them recently. 




 i got darvocet so good luck 




 cut em up with a toenail clipper. put in coke for at least a few hours, the longer the better. 




 smoked some bth saturday.  I had to urine test today at methadone clinic. I should be fine right!?!?! 




 Of course it's in Philly. 




 150 a piece!?!?!. I pay 20 that's crazy. 




 I have only been on it for barely three months so I am honestly not sure. 




 I tried suboxone first before methadone and it didn't work for me.  I went back to using for a while and when things started to get out of hand I started to research methadone because like you, I was apprehensive of it.  after weeding out all the myths and rumors about methadone I decided to give it a try.  I am really glad I did because if I did not try it I would still be addicted and in a very worst place than I was before methadoneso for me it has worked out to be a better situation right now in my life then how I was living it before 




 Subs usually at least partially block my high for up to 3 days!!! I don't know why but thats how it is for me.  Some people can get away with like 10 hours in between though.  If I were you i'd try to wait as close to 24 hours as you can. 




 ha this has been posted a couple times in 1 week!!  I am not complaining tho it's a badass song.  It was in that movie Snatch I think.
 




 Thank you!!  I really haven't had anyone personally say anything to me about it but its kind of general notion people have that aren't educated about methadone to say that it's for low lifes and junkies,etc.  I don't care either way, I never was one to care what peoples opinions were about me-especially complete strangers fuck that who cares haha 




 Yes I agree with you. Before I trieed methadone I tried suboxone and it didn't hold me enough so I went back to using for a bit.  I was getting worse with using more by the week so I decided to do a bit of research on methadone to get the facts about it-not the myths or rumors because beforehand I was a bit apprehensive to try methadone- I thought that it was left for hardcore junkies.  Well since I started on it it has really helped i'm really happy because I was thinking to myself if methadone doesn't work I have nothing else to fall back on so I was getting a bit scared.  luckily it worked! 




 Me to for the first time ever about 3 weeks ago.  I know a lot of people talk down on methadone but if it wasn't for methadone I would be saying yes. 




 God I really would hope not! 




 yeah I know!! i guess that is with no priors even. 




 http://www.vice.com/read/america-is-really-freaking-out-about-heroin-use-now?utm_source=vicefbus 









 are you driving a buick GS or skylark from the late 60s-early 70s?   




 I was actually going to post this over there but this sub seems to get a lot more action than other one 




 I will always remember this!! You will NEVER be forgiven!!!  ha I actually never saw the post you made. 




 Lol!! That's a way to handle it. 




 Before I got a methadone I used any opiate I could my hands on. The first time I tried to stop I used suboxone.  I didn't like it it didn't take the edge off enough so I went back to using again. Towards the end before I got on done I was smoking both up to a gram a day. Since being on methadone for 3 months I've only relapsed once. For me methadone is really great and does the trick.  If you ever seriously consider stopping I think methadone can really help you. 




 hahaha oh my god!!!   Was this in SF?? Did you test the urines temp? They do at my clinic making it even harder to give them fakes. 




 wow you have had way more action than me so far. also you are lucky that they give you a take home right away!!  I just want 1 freaking take home i live about 30 mins away and drive there everyday.
 




 so I have been going to a methadone clinic everyday for about 3 months.  the worst thing about it for me is having to drive there every single day 7 days a week.  pretty soon though I will be getting take homes.  anyways I started this thread to ask you guys that have been to a clinic what is the craziest thing you have seen or heard happen at your clinic.  somebody got stabbed at mine about 2 months before I had started going to it.  also what does most of the clientele look like at your clinic?  I would say 90 percent look like they have been living a pretty hard life so far at my clinic 




 I also forgot to ask you if you are on any medications and what they are for.  do you plan on being on them the rest of your life? 




 I am using it also do you get off of are there opiate drugs but it also works fairly well for the pain that I have had and since I was cut off from my prescription and still mentally and physically addicted to opiates I needed to try methadonesince in the past I had tried suboxone and it didn't work for me 




 why :( haha its not that bad. i figure I am going to need to be on some kinda opiate the rest of my life for the legitimate pain that I have and methadone although not that great if you are looking for recreational value, works great for pain and lasts forever.   




 I'll honestly probably be on it the rest of my life. 




 Yep. and now i am on methadone thanks to all that. 




 well it looks like OP is getting them for crohns.
 




 All I know is that day by day doctors and hospitals are tightening up on giving out opiates like they did say 8 or so years ago.  I live in California so I don't know where that state lies on being liberal about dispensing narcotics but I was told to my face by my doc of 5 years whom I had trusted that DEA is really cracking down, blah blah blah.  What really pissed me off is that I was like family with her, she was the one who got me started on pain meds in the first place too.  Vicodin 5s then slowly moved up to Norco.  All I am saying I guess is that I thought for sure I was sitting pretty and had no worries about getting my script pulled out from under me but it did happen.  Sucks because this is going to be happening more and more now as doctors become increasingly hesistant to give out opiates. 




 lol ok i didn't even know there was a subreddit for kratom! 




 ok cool. i have only been on methadone 3 months and I have really only relapsed once smoking some tar. I plan on being on it for a while but maybe when i choose to taper I will look into kratom for sure. thanks! 




 Hopefully. Lately they have been trying to ween people off opiates.  I'm just bitter because it happened to me right when my regular doctor turned me over to PM. 




 When that happened to me I got cut off from my 120 a month norco script.  I was so excited at first but in the end got jacked. Now I'm on methadone. 




 yeah i didn't believe it to be like bath salts but certain people who write articles seem to lump it in with bath salts and other designer type shit.  now that i'm on methadone and doing good with it now I think I'll hold off but possibly later on down the road its good to know that it is there if i'm in a pinch. 




 ok I'd rather not waste any money on it then.  i'm doing good in my methadone program anways. 




 Ah OK. So it sort of works the same as 'done does for wd's?  You think its kind of a waste possibly since I am already on da 'done?? 
























 OK I had a feeling that was why. 




 I am just more upset that they had to wait till the eve of my appointment to tell me that!  they can't even give me a date yet the receptionist said they would call me back tomorrow with a date.  Oh well cheap/free American healthcare for ya. 




 OK thanks for the info. Only problem now is they called to postpone my appointment because my doctor is out of town :/  




 So I have been on Paxil for quite a long time now- 12 years and I feel like it really isn't working anymore.  I also was able to get a few small scripts for Ativan.  Problem is my regular doctor doesn't think i should be taking any benzos for a long period- no more than like a week at a time because its addictive blah blah.  I ran out of my last script of 20 1mg pills and she won't refill it for me so I am kind of in a withdrawl right now.  Sucks because I feel a lot better when I take just one 1mg of Ativan and I don't feel any better when taking my Paxil.  Here is my question: It seems like a lot of people on this forum have a decent ongoing script for benzos.  How did you go about getting it? I'm not asking for a ton of pills, just something that is more longterm that 1 or 2 scripts of 30 pills a year.  My doctor has referred me to a psychiatrist who I see tomorrow and she will be managing my psych meds from now on not my medical doctor.  I wasn't even going to post this but I might have a better shot at getting something that actually works for me on more of an ongoing basis because I feel pretty crappy now!! Thanks for any advice. 




 holy shit 90 month! I know that's something you worked up to but yeah.  I've suffered from anxiety and depression my whole life and been on anti depressants most of my life which has been documented.  I have a feeling the one I am taking now isn't doing much but when I took the ativan I was scripted I felt a lot better. I was only taking 1 pill a day, 1 mg. 




 are you getting your lorazepam prescribed on an ongoing basis? I have been able to get about 3 scripts within a year for 20 pills but I cannot get an ongoing thing.  Doctor says that it's not a med that can be taken more than a couple weeks at a time.  it's really frustrating!! 




 100 mg methadone daily for several months after maybe 5 years of any opiate I could find.  




 about 7 more of what you have in your hand 




 guess not 




 ha i'm on the same exact dose and have gained some weight as well so i'd like to know the same question! 




 smoke it off aluminum
 




 It has to do with street racing. 




 ok cuz I mean I know several people that have been on drugs like xanax valium and other benzos for years so when the doctor told me that people don't take this for long periods of time kind of got me a bit mixed up 




 is your roommate's dad a toddler? 




 yes this is what I am doing. I was just a bit surprised when i heard my doctor say that benzos are only for short term use?   




 i do take them when needed like if i am more anxious than normal that day or if i feel like a panic attack is coming.  I don't just pop them like when i wake up like a lot of people do with certain pills that you need to do everyday.   




 That's how I'm taking it on an emergency basis not everyday 




 Well I don't take it everyday. Usually if I am about to have a panic attack or if I'm really anxious 




 I just got a new primary care doctor. I am currently on paxil (12 years) and ativan probably a few months. My new doctor has no problem keeping me on the paxil but hesitantly scripted me some ativan and said that is not a medicine to be taken long times. She is referring me to a psychiatrist to go over my meds and possibly change them. I have a feeling its to get me off ativan.  I never heard anywhere about it being used only short periods of time.  I feel like um being tricked into giving up my meds. Anyone have any advice!?!? Thanks! 




 Lol wow that's crazy I was a huge drinker during my early 20s then I quit cold turkey. It was stupid. Soon after that I got into opiates more than I did when drinking a ton I guess to fill a void.  Point of my story is when drinking I was an embarrassing sloppy obvious mess. On opiates nobody could tell a thing. 




 and have a great job and no money ever.......... so fucking depressing!! 




 yeah i would think that its a tight rope to walk!!  a lot of these folks work in offices so long sleeves :) plus it depends how far you are into your addiction- if your so far gone you can't play it off and maintain 9-5 seeming sober than you probably won't last to long ha. 




 it looks different all the time but that doesn't constitute weather its going to be bad or good.  smelling like vinegar is a good thing but not a sure thing
 




 I think the DEA is trying to make people use heroin by tightening up the regulations and restrictions when it comes to controlled substances (mainly opiates).  As someone who used to personally have a decent script for opiate painkillers I was eventually cut off for no reason other than being told that the DEA is watching very closely now and bye bye.  No mention of my body and what I will do now to combat my pain.  So what'd I do?  Go to the street and get heroin  I am just 1 person so I am positive this has happened to many many people already and its just the start.  I am on methadone now because I don't like the junky lifestyle and hustling every single day, waiting on you dealer, getting bad cut drugs, legal risk, robbed, beat up, dying, etc.  I feel that being on methadone right now is the best option right now but it will never touch how well I had it before. I never expected to have my script pulled out from under my feet like it was. 




 I know "normal" people that use and sell heroin.  If you didn't know that they did, you'd have no clue based on their appearance and lifestyle.
 




 jump out in front of a car (preferably a bus).  success. 




 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bEobVhqaCk 




 have em shipped!! 




 its in california 




 food maxx 




 dude i found it at target less than 6 months ago!! 




 they're out there. ohh yeah they are out there!! you just gotta search. 




 LOLLLLLLL  UAF!?!?!?!?!  i am gonna have to accomodate that one into my vocab 




 yes. i was just at the pharmacy lookin in and thought that. 




 Yeah makes sense they should of bounced but possibly just were in shock as to what was going on and just went into the fetal position and didn't move kind of like a fight or flight thing lol 




 yeah the r.i.c.e. thing works but if you are like me and your ligaments are all strecthed out and shot there is really not much to do about it hah.  I even will wear the the braces if I go on like a hike where I know i'll be walking over a lot of rocks or potential shit that I would roll my ankle on. 




 saw it last night. kinda weird watching it since I am from only 20 mins away from where they shot it and skate at that skatepark all the time.  I never go to oakland at night tho. 




 i'm in a similiar situation. been skating since i was a little kid and my bad spots (every skater has at least one) are my ankles.  I used to blow them out all the time so damn badly that I bruised up to my sock line and down to my toes.  I went to a podiatrist and he recommended surgery but I don't really want to do that now since I am still relatively young.  I still skate but I always wear these good ankle braces I found at Walgreens. They have hard plastic around the brace and they lace up.  Really good support.  You should check em out if you still have wobbly ankles. 




 and it's only going to get worse with the doctors being scared of the DEA. That was the main excuse to me from my doctor when she cut me off my meds. 




 Being a young male puts you in the toughest situation to legitamitely obtain pain meds from a doctor.  I know this from my own personal experience.
 




 lol i had those. circas. 




 she is a high end hooker?!?! 




 dude just go to the TL 




 fo sho indeed! 




 OK cool I think its a good idea because most movies keep getting repeated. 




 Wow so damn weird I was just literally watching this with my mom. Ended about 20mins ago 




 Someone(we) shouldmake a list of movies by now since this thread seems to pop up almost every week it could be a list that we keep adding on to periodically as well 




 Not too much of a difference but it did make me just a bit calmer and made the done last linger.  I don't plan on taking .more than 1 at a time. 




 He does look pretty ass now that mention it 




 Yay budlight lime 




 Yeah I just tried 1 mg ativan with my dose 




 ok yeah i'm not thinking that I'm in for a great trip haha 




 I have some Ativan lying around and I have tried that.  I am just hella scared because literally everyone I talk to says they had a friend die from that combo. 




 Yeah the only nausea I've gotten from opiates was just regular vicodin and I was in a car. I feel that im on way too much for  being able to feel the kratom 




 I'm registered over there.! 




 OK well yes I am familiar with opiates but never tried kratom . Just wondering almost if the methadone will make the kratoms effect lessen. 




 I am on methadone.  Just wondering if its even worth doing since I don't drink yet would liketo be able to have something with friends or at a party. 




 My NP was giving me 120/10 everyweek 




 I was eventually able to work upto 120 Norcos a month just thru my regular doctor  




 Yeah its weird like that but everybodys block off point is different.  I still do it like once a month just because of loving the ritual of doing it.  But weird you brough up take home cause i'm finally going to get me first soon just signed out all the paperwork. 




 Never 




 Hah I've done that on several movies where I go to watch it and I am already part way through the movie and didn't even realize that I started watching it before 




 Haha 




 Zero. Oxy or bth but can have em since I'm on methadone. 




 Man fuck this war on drugs bullshit 




 yeah im talking about the pills/crooked docs that i thought were fairly well erradicated from Florida. 




 did you get this on the westcoast?  the stuff i've been getting lately is pretty good. 




 M3s are badass 




 so I guess there still is hope in Florida?? Haha 




 I thought Florida cool down on all that stuff in the last couple years since the doctors got busted at least most of the pain clinics were shut down right? 




 it was a 1987 BMW 325 i with a stick shift. I think it had an inline 6 cylinder which is pretty big for that small of a car. Super fun to drive. 




 Haha sorry sir I am not on top of my internet game today. I read some of that guide but honestly just skimmed over it. I've been super distracted/ busy today so nothing I read stuck with me. 




 I got in the same exact accident you did but I was in the position of the other driver.  I was the one who came out on top so my insurance covered it.  They totalled my car and that was the thing that upset me the most.  Car wasn't worth a whole lot but was fun as hell to drive . 




 what do i do. huh? 




 that's what I meant as in drug tests.  it might, might not. google! 




 go to the bb forum
 




 I can't agree more!!  When things started to get rough with money and as my tolerance was building I was in straight up hustle mode for I'd say a bit longer than a month, but looking back at it, that time felt like six months.  It was the same thing everyday: wake up and hopefully have something left in the house to get me going then it was off to try and make as close to $100 because I'd usually like to get as much as I could at a time. I'd makey money mainly scrapping metal or recycling but where I live those methods aren't extremely efficient due to people recycling there own shit to make money themselves and just lack of finding .material to scrap.  I cannot see how people can do that shit for like 10+ years but I see them at the clinic I go to. 




 Sure that they aren't sterilized? 




 Yeah there is: more cough syrup. Go buy some or check around the house. 




 I can't say I've never used it.  




 Either of those won't show up as a benzo if you were wanting to know that. Hydroxyzine is like benydryl. Ironic since I just got prescribed these a couple days ago
 




 When I tried to quit, the first time I tried suboxone and it just didn't hold me over enough.   After giving up and going back to using again I wanted out for good so I tried methadone. I was worried at first since I thought that if this doesn't work I have no other options.  Well I am in MMT for about 3 months and I and pretty happy with the results that methadone has given me.  I could write a ton more about it and answer more technical questions if you or anyone starting or about to start cares to pm me. 




 Ah OK thanks! 




 Ok well the ones I was finding at the nursery weren't even of the papaver somniferum strain.  I found some in the store for cooking but all they said were ingredients: poppy seeds.  lol now more info. 




 Well its really random how they do it so there isn't much a way around it ha.  Just use right after you have been tested is the best way.  Hey i'm not even a subscriber here!  Never knew you had to subscribe or anything but I just tend to post in opiates more than any other subreddits. Is it recommended to subscribe?   





























 Me!?!!?  A week and a half voluntarily 




 I am on about this amount. I have stopped (voluntarily) for a day or 2 and actually didn't feel too bad other than just wanting to them because I had them at home I didn't run out I was just seeing if it would be shitty like everyone says and it really wasn't 




 yah  i agree with BuiltToSpil1 (amazing band too)  but i get 60 1 mg ativan a month and they used to hit me but know they make me feel normal.  I have used/abused everyother benzo and xanax is the best imo for recreation but I am not using for that anymore . I only use when I really have to and find some extras by the end of the month.  i would saw ativan is a coors light compared to a mickeys or steel reserve (xanax) haha i dunno might not be the best comparision 




 I am currently getting 60 1mg ativans a month.  I have been with the same doctor for about 6 months. she started me at 30 .5 ativans so I am pretty happy she's jumped me up this fast. My question is I want to change my script to klonopin since from my experience they last longer.  So far pretty much any request I have asked to change my meds she easily has done for me. I have also been on SSRI anti depression meds for about 15 years now so I'm not just someone trying to get high. 




 sad but true, a lot of docs do not prescribe benzos often especially xanax dude thats like the holy grail of benzos. at least to me.  I had to work up for a long time and see so many people and waste so much time just to get where i am.
 




 For me, ativan is the shortest acting benzo. 




 fuck that sounds gnarly anyways!!! i can take ativan every other day and stop and i'm fine.  this caught me off gaurd. 




 I want to note***  This all happened once I ceased taking the 25 pills so this was my withdrawl from flubromazepam.  would I do it again!?!?!  Fuck no, even if I was prepared for the worst night terrors and head trips when I go to bed and telling people the most fucked up shit just happened yet it really didn't since it was all in my head.  People opening my door and walking into my room while i'm awake and talking about me in my room while i'm under the covers feeling awake.  I turn on the light right next to my bed.  Nothing. Nobody is there. 




 I will be truthfull with you. for 2 weeks at least I had sleep paralysis. Never had it before in in my life. had it everynight for close to a month.  night terrors/sleep paralysis,etc gnarliest stuff that ever happened to me in my life.  Most scared i've ever been in my life!!!  I have 25 more pills that I re ordered from the same company just chilling here in my room will sell them, they are worthless unless you want a bad acid trip everynight you sleep for about 3 weeks. 




 flub sucks. i bought 25 took em all within 20 days. the withdrawls are heavy man. be ready!! 




 Also people say "never take methadone, drink, and benzos."  Instant kill!!!  I'm not saying never to do that but I proven that method wrong a lot. 




 LOL!!! i've had the same exact thing happen to me!! (well not the sex part)  after eating a few ativans and dozing off its kinda like i'm in between a real lucid dream and real life.  I see things, but i am in control.  I hear people call my name yet nobodys home.  This only has happened when i take benzos. 




 yeah i've been on paxil for over 15 years and I always point that out so i think it does help when climbing up the pole to get to the good stuff hah 




 As I would always agree with your statement 100% because that is not the way I operate when trying to receive benzos from a doctor, I just told OP that asking for it straight up should be used as a last ditch effort. At that point what can you lose?  




 I have found out that if you actually want a benzo and not an SSRI or a beta blocker, you have to ask for a benzo.  They will try to set you up on anything first before benzos, hell i was on an ssri for 15 years and it was still hard for me to get anything.  they are very concerned about handing them out like candy anymore. 




 Welcome to the real world where doctors can cut/take your script whenever they please.  It's happened to me.  I guess if you really want your benzos, try finding another doctor. 




 I ordered a small amount of diclazepam and I wasn't too happy with it. Basically is great if you just want to sleep haha but not much recreational value. I want to make a larger purchase this time and was thinking of Flubromazepam. Has anyone done both and tell me the differences? Would the flub be more recreational/euphoric? Thanks.
 









 ok yeah it might be a bit harder getting it to the US since it has to go thru more checkpoints. 




 how would i import from Sweden?  Seems like it would be easy to get held up coming into the US since the package could look suspect. have you done this before? 




 ativan is ok in my book. kpins or xanax is better though. 




 yeah i think next time i'm getting flubromazolam. 




 ok I probably will do that but 10mg diazapem i've never taken before i'm used to like 2mg tops. 




 Etizolam was my first choice but every site I went to was sold out.  I ordered 10 pellets of diclazepam.  This will be my first RC I have tried. I got the 1mg pills and since they say it's 10x strong that diazepam, having not really any tolerance to benzos should I pop a whole pill or half it?  Will this feel simalar to diazepam or any other benzo?   




 I can't find etiz anywhere online, everyone is out!! 
 









 you should be fine. i have to ua once a month and have used within 4 days and always been fine. 




 i wouldn't say the worst, any benzo is good!! haha but i started with ativan and was always told by doctors it's milder than other benzos. 




 ativan used to be good and work for me but once i was prescribed klonopin and then ativan back to back, the ativan barely worked compared to the kpin.  i'd say that ativan is the mellowest of all benzos.
 




 I drink all the time off 2 kpins.  I don't notice any difference in getting drunker quicker/easier.  It just prolongs the kpins effects for me. 




 Hello I have been on an SSRI (Paxil) for about 12 years.  I got on it for depression and anxiety.  It's worked OK for the depression but I have in the last few years been suffering from pretty decent anxiety. I went to a counselor that works for the county and she was really nice.  She diagnosed me with anxiety and PTSD.  On friday I go in to the actual doctor to "get something for my anxiety" I used quotations because this is what the counselor said.  What would they give me to go along with the SSRI I am taking?  Thanks for looking. 




 Looks like full dental implants. I've had the same thing done to my teeth and I'm only 30. 




 It takes a while to find the right person that you can work with.  For me it has at least. I have recently been working with a mental health worker that has assessed my situation. She says I have anxiety/PTSD.  I'm going back on Friday for my actual medical visit with a doctor to give me/ alter meds.  I have been on Paxil (SSRI) for 15 years.  Hopefully I will get to finally have a med that works better than Paxil for 15 years. The lady that I have been working with is going to come in with me to the doctor and she said "at the very least we need to get you something for your panic attacks"  I was glad to at least hear that.   




 OK then you have started the road to getting what you want you just have to play their game.  Just be careful- I found out the hard way getting cut off my meds and now i'm on methadone. 




 If you are seriously in pain and can prove it, there should be no big problem obtaining medicine for the pain.  Depending on what it is they might only start you out on 800mg Ibuprofen or Tramadol.  I used to get 120 10/325 Norcos every month from my doctor til that ended badly. Your most likely going to have to work your way up to something decent.  It's getting hard now to get anything unless you are dying or have cancer.  Doctors are really getting nervous to script narcotic pain meds because of the DEA cracking down.  I have been told this from doctors themselves. 




 Tolerance break would help. Man I noticed on Ativan my tolerance for them was up so much after like 2 weeks-a lot faster than other medicines I have taken.
 




 OK i was just on smokeys site actually hah. I have personally never purchased anything online yet so I don't have any sources for you yet. 




 dammit he's already out of stock 




 I would also like to know if etiz will show up as a benzo on drug tests. 




 and i am surprised about the Rohypnol being sold?!?!  That was always a scripted med as far as I know in the US. 




 I have taken ativan, klonopin, and xanax.  When I used them I remember i could handle 2 xanax bars to feel good.  I really have no tolerance I guess now because I haven't been able to find a doctor to script me anything.  I looked last night a few hours online for etiz online to buy but I guess I was on the wrong sites because everyone was sold out. That is why I am now considering another RC.  I would like to pay with credit and I am very weary of getting ripped off. Do you know of anywhere that rates these sites?  I guess it would not be good if I asked you for any places online to buy?  sorry about these remedial questions but I want to know these things before I place and order and get ripped off. Thanks.
 




 ah ok maybe i should type in the other words you have up instead of just ezitolam cause the places I found online were sold out and not going to re up. 




 OK I am a noob with RC's and have never tried any yet. It seems though that the RC of choice is etizolam which seems to be about extinct to purchase online?  I am not asking where to buy just wanting to know if it is near impossible to get online anymore? also how does flubromazepam and diclazepam rate compared to etizolam? Is there any guide to RC's or any more info I can get?  Thanks and sorry if these questions have been asked already. 




 ah ok. well i've been on an SSRI for 15 years now and i feel its not working anymore. 




 yeah when i rarely get em they are free with medi cal. 




 damn man nice.  I guess I just have to keep searching.  Was that the first doctor you went to and you got the jackpot?  I definatly don't want it to seem like i'm doc shopping. 




 yep I have had to buy off street - i don't anymore but I have and it's not fun. Try to buy from people you know i guess?  I don't really have any great tips as to not getting caught. 




 Hey i'm in the same situation.  I have had clinically proven anxiety and depression and been on meds for it for 15 years (Paxil) this is documented yet I cannot get barely anything to help me through my bad days.  I don't know if it's the fact that I am youngish male and look like i'm seeking drugs but I know what to say and what not to say to the doctor so I am just really frustrated like you are. I also agree that people abusing the system suck because now I can barely get 15 ativan with no refills and that is it. 




 how did you get around to getting a script like that? just curious as I can't get any more than 20 ativan here and there. 




 OK it makes more sense now and if you are really having problems its good that you have some sympathetic docs 




 How did you go about getting a script for a whole year? I can only get little scripts here and there and nothing on going.   




 Fuck!! whats your secret!?!? That's the most i've seen on here legally prescribed. 




 OK i thought you were on them since you were 16.  I am using for medical reasons but at the same time realize this shit can be a slippery slope.  Damn it I just want ativan or anything!
 




 are you a daily user?  hows your tolerance like since you started taking benzos have you kept needing a higher dose?  I actually have an appoinment on tuesday with a psychiatrist. 




 I'm all ears if you have any advice trust me dude i'm sure you know whats up.  Possibly the people you know don't use/like benzo's?  or have they tried to get benzos and been denied? I agree its a lot about the doctor you get- some seem easier to work with some won't budge.    




 thanks! no man i wasn't trying to act like I know it all!! I really don't haha as you can see since I am benzoless. 




 Yep i am familiar with the "don't ask" tactic hah.   I have been on paxil for 15 years and i'm surprised I haven't had much luck in 1 1/2 years with getting a basic benzo even like ativan. 




 i have been to both. 




 i have had proof of on going severe anxiety and still no luck.  This is so damn frustrating. 




 whats the secret to getting an ongoing script for benzos?!?!
 




 So within the next couple of weeks I will most likely be put on ritalin or adderall.  I used to take dexedrine for ADD as a kid back in middle school.  Now as an adult (32) it was recommended I go back on something to try and help with my ADD.  I have done some research but would there be any reason to try and get adderall over ritalin or vice versa?  Do they still prescribe dexidrene?  I would just like some opinions from people that have taken both. thanks. 




 About what? Not taking benzos everyday?  If that's what you meant I agree with you but a lot of people still do take them on a daily basis which I'm not even looking to do and RC's kinda scare me. 




 i'm on methadone now. been at the clinic about 8 months haven't missed a day.  I can't say that methadone is a godsend but it's helping- i have relapsed twice very early on in my recovery.  At the dose i'm at now i wouldn't even feel any opiate so I don't bother.  I still am pissed when I think about that day at the doctors office though!!  I try not to dwell on it. 




 ok thanks! 




 etiz is an rc then correct?  I am a total noob on this and if this seems like sourcing just let me know or send me to a place that will explain to me better.   thanks! 




 yeah i would assume you would of been through several docs til you got to where you are right now.  I'm glad to hear that they are working for you as well.  Thanks for the info! 




 i used google and found out most of what I needed. what i said seems far from sourcing but it is what it is. 




 Im in america-california.  I agree with you on how its got to be shady on obtaining what we need for a valid reason.  So are DNMs and RC's only available on the darknets? 




 ok i figured it out. research chemicals.  where would i go about buying it?
 




 whats an RC benzo?  i know I sound stupid already.
 









 wtf 10mg a day diazepam??  i rarely can get scripted any benzo and whenever i do, the doctor says never take on a daily basis and I get 1 script no refills of 20 pills 1mg if lucky.  I seriously do have anxiety and depression that is documented.
  how do i achieve getting closer to where you are??   




 Yes this is very true 




 This is very true.my uncle was gardening and cut the head off a rattlesnake once the head a bit him and he had to go to the hospital so yes this is very true 




 I was able to get to 60 mg fine.  After that, nothing.  It's  a bit different for eeveryone but I bet everyone will agree its around 60-90.  Unless you're body is extremely lucky or weird. 




 I do not but my friend was in Barca a few years ago and told me he saw tons of people nodding in the streets. Wasn't too surprised since like any large city there's gonna be drugs.
 




 i'd say anything over 100mg oxy a day?  I dunno, it's all relative. 




 yeah i've been told that actually.  Thing is can't you go into a doctor that is certified to prescribe methadone for pain and tell him you want to be switched from your meds to methadone?  I guess he would just have to look at you and your history and see if you have dr shopped or been flagged at pharmacies before?  I was going to do this when I was on norco and wanted to stop taking it but I just ended up going to a methadone clinic. 




 they don't prescribe methadone for pain anymore? 




 i assume your a guy. how old are you?  seems like a situation like me when i was referred to PM from my regular doc.  she had meset up 120 yellow norcos a month for a couple years so i thought i'd be getting stepped up since I was being referred. She even told me I'd get something better.  First thing when I walk in the head dudes office.  He reads my papers and his eyes just buldge out  " you've been talking all this norco for how long?!?!?!"  "Why?!?!?"  So I immediately knew I was over with ever getting narcotics again.  It was the worst feeling of my life actually.  I tried to hold in not crying.  He sent a note to my regular doc no more narcotics and that is that.  fuck that fucking guy.  The reason why I shared my story is that I feel its very similar to yours where I was doing good, felt comfy at my prescription and didn't feel like it would ever be taken away since my doc I'd been with for 10 years and was almost family to me.  So when I went to see her after the meeting with top scumbag at PM she just basically told me she has to adhere to whatever he says since he's a higher up.  Just so pissed man, one minute I had my doctor telling me that once I'm on PM they will bump me up to something better that Norco the next minute I am prescriptionless.
 




 why cause they gave you more than you needed for pain meds? 




 Even my own doctor that cut me off last year told me it was crackin in the early 2000s then once about 2010 came around doctors are like WTF we are up shits creek here because we've been way over prescribing narcotics and people were popping them like candy.  That's exactly what my doctor told me as she yanked away my script that i had for 2 years for 120 norcos.  I believe her some but she also said the DEA are finally getting they're act togother after so many famous people died roughly in that decade due to narcotics prescribed by them from their doctors.  It sucks now because anyone with legitamite pain it's nearly impossible to get something past tramadol because doctors are scared they will lose their jobs.
 




 I'd just try em. I've taken some fairly old pills before but I also had some that crumbled in my hand when I grabbed them so I figured those most be pre WWII and i'm not fucking with it. 




 I was always scared of H because of the stigma that it has.  Since we were little kids I believe that the government, media, your parents, etc always would tell you never to do drugs but I felt that they put the most emphasis on H being that it was the strongest drug that could kill you the fastest.  Anyways I grew with that injected into my brain so that when I actually tried it for the first time I was kind of underwhelmed to be honest since I was already using norco and oxy, I was told its way cheaper to just go the H route and it is but If I had unlimited money i'd go withthe pharms over H just mainly cause its from a lab so you know what your exactly getting. 




 yeahhhh buuuddyyy 




 found an OP 80 inside of a church that i was working for at the time. 




 haha such a random # of pills.
 




 It could be worse- I had all of them impacted too and  I got fucking Darvocet!!!   




 I have owned cars before that adding simply an open element air filter gave it a noticeable horsepower increase.  But i have done the same to other vehicles and it felt like I did nothing.
