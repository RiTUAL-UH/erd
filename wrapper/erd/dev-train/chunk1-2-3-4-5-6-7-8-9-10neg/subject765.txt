 Vine: Me eating a do- 




 That is for soreness after you run. Fermentation is not an immediate process, it takes time. Lactic acid is a side product of fermentation. If you really want to rid yourself of being sore, stretch. It won't get rid of the pain but it will spread the lactic acid out throughout your body and you will feel it less.  




 GLaDOS: "There was even going to be a party for you. A big party that all your friends were invited to. I invited your best friend, the Companion Cube. Of course, he couldn't come because you murdered him. All your other friends couldn't come, either, because you don't have any other friends because of how unlikable you are. It says so right here in your personnel file: "Unlikable. Liked by no one. A bitter, unlikable loner, whose passing shall not be mourned. Shall NOT be mourned." That's exactly what it says. Very formal. Very official. It also says you were adopted, so that's funny, too."

 There are two white doors, one the door the heaven, one is the door to hell. Once you open you may never go back. Connected to each door is a machine. One tells nothing but truths, the other nothing but lies. You do not know which is which. You have one question to find out the answer. What do you ask?




ANSWER:
"What would the other machine say is the door to heaven?"
and do the opposite.

 The diet of a gay horse does not differ from that of a straight horse. That being said it is uncommon for two male or two female horse to be sexually attracted to each other, as it goes against their genetic drive to reproduce. The usual farm diet of a horse can be split into two parts: structural (fiber) and non structural (sugars and starches). Naturally the horse needs complete access to a fresh water source and an open plain. 

The following article should have sufficient information for those looking into the proper diet and nutrition for their horse:

 Now that PKA is taking a step in the more professional route I think it's time for an intro.

Just a suggestion, I thought would be nice for the show. Maybe it could be a Patreon milestone or be added to the current animator hiring one, or maybe some guys on the sub-Reddit want to post ideas or videos. I'm trying to take a page out of Woody's book and leave solutions to problems, not just problems. Just a thought, I want to know what you guys think.

 Thanks, the river turned out great, I'm glad you like it. I'm getting some more fish soon and I think your right with the white rocks. They stand out too much that it takes away from looking at the fish. All I need now is some more fish! 




 A wall paper I put as a background, thought it looked kinda fish themed. It's weird but it's better than seeing cables and wires. 




 Right now I just have fake plants in there but once the tank is established and I have more fish in there maybe I'll swap some props with real plants. I'll have to do more research on it though. 




 Thanks! I'm getting some more fish soon, I just need to get the chemicals right and let the bacteria build up to keep up with more ammonia from more fish. I'm still very new to fish keeping so I don't really know what kind I want but I have a great local store which will give me some great fish next time I'm there.

 I hear what your saying, I just don't think it's right to point out that wings progress may not be as good as everyone is making it out to be. He's still making a lot of progress and kicking ass while doing it. 









 His cheek bones look more prominent and he's much happier. We should stop focusing on how much weight he's loosing but rather that he is making an active effort to make a lifestyle change and needs our love and support. Who cares if Woody may have cherry picked a bad and good photo to use, they are giving their moral support and that's what matters. 




 He wrestled in high school and college, you can look it up pictures of him. You would think you were looking at a young Mike Tyson.

 A while back my Aunt got me and my father tickets to a baseball game for father's day. They were for both of us but she gave the tickets to me so they were my responsibility. The day of the game she texted me "How's the game?". The only problem was that...we forgot to go. We had been looking forward to it for a while but the day of we just both completely blanked. (She gave us the tickets a little over a month prior).
I was sitting with my dad when we got that text but it was already too late to make it in time. He told me to tell he we're having a great time and I agreed because we thought it would have been insulting to say that we forgot (We didn't want to look like the gift didn't mean anything to us because it did).
Around 20 minutes and a lot of cussing in frustration from both of us later he says that I should tell her the truth. *I* should tell her the truth. I take full responsibility for forgetting about the game (well, 96%. I was his present too!), but he told me to lie to her! My question: Is my dad the asshole? We ending up telling the truth which was the right thing to do (and she was understanding), but in this situation was my dad in the wrong to tell me to tell her the truth after he told me to lie? 




 It sounds like he could really use a brother right about now. 




 Think about if he wasn't your brother. Would you be putting up with his crap? Probably not. But, as his brother you still have a duty to do what you can to help him. That doesn't mean letting him sleep for free in your home, but take him to AA meetings if the drinking is a serious problem, help him find a home he can afford and at the very least talk to him, he sounds lonely. 




 Try your best not to lead her on. Opening the snapchats is telling her you're still interested (even in you're only interested in her body). I would suggest not opening the snapchats anymore. That being said I don't believe you are an asshole. 




 I agree with most of what you said until the end. I don't believe she is entitled or spoiled, or rather I don't think you have the ability to gather enough information from the text to make that assumption. What I do think is that she is a kid with maybe a little bit of a quick temper.  




 It sounds like this girl was trying to get a reaction out of you and has been for the past few weeks. Are you an asshole for letting her get under your skin? I don't think so. Should you have said that? Probably not. 




 It sounds like you made him really happy

 When the whistle blows for a foul on the floor, players stop playing; Unlike in football, when there is a flag in a play players keep playing. The only thing I could think of would be after a foul players could have like a 3 second time window where the play continues and they have a free shot of some sorts. If they make it, the foul is declined, if they miss it, they rewind the clock and he gets his shots, but that seems too complicated to be doing consistently throughout a game.
