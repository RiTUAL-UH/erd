 Not old enough yet? I'm raving about the knife set we got over a year ago 




 I thought the line was "who hurt you?" Referring to Lionel Richie 




 Being stuck in traffic isn't driving.  That is commuting. You don't like commuting. 




 Pse COULD have a deposit.  It could not, also.  Only on approved credit will they not take one 




 *on approved credit* 




 The thought is "I don't like driving so I'm not going to learn enough about it to do it well" 

Just because you have a license doesn't mean you know how to drive.  It just means you demonstrated understanding of the rules of the road and basic operation of a vehicle.  

Driving takes a lot more knowledge about what the car is doing at any given moment.  What is the contact patch of the tires during this turn?  When I apply the brakes, how does the transfer of weight affect the balance of the car? Etc... 




 They said there could be a deposit, gave them my ssn and said there wouldn't be one for me. 




 Read: she's a big one 




 Pse didn't have any deposit for me. But I've had no issues with credit anywhere for a while 




 Yeah...now. not before the popularity from marketing

 Bring it to me, I'll do it for 8% 




 All the ones I've used have. I bring them a bucket of change and say I want to deposit this.  I give them my account number and they say ok. Then they come back with a slip that shows how much is was and deposit it.  I usually have $50-$100 each time. 




 Coinstar takes your money, then gives you back only some of it only after it tells you how much there was.  If that's not a waste, I don't know what is.

Most banks will do it for you for free if you have an account with them. 




 This makes a lot of sense now.

My town had 3-4 of these back when we only had 1-2 subway chains.  I thought they were the best sandwich chain out there.  Carbonara and the prime rib were amazing.  I assumed they were the same owner because they suddenly all became Togo's...and they don't have any chicken on their menu :(

Now I know why.  Shame. 




 If that's true, then he makes more than 50% of the US.  Median income is around $23k/yr 




 They did that in my town in 2003-2005.  Tore down the whole thing (movie theater, KMart) save for the one JC Penny store.  Then it's a bunch of outdoor modern themes and a Best Buy went in there in 2005.  Turned it around quite nicely. 




 anytime fitness, Edmonds, Wa.  Might be another 5+ months before we open though. We've been "negotiating" the lease since september. 




 Oh yeah, I'm aware of what is needed to succeed. I'm the business person with lots of exp with small-medium size businesses. I can turn on the personality when I need to. My wife will be the main customer facing person.  She's the more fitness passionate and loves to help everyone.  Still up in the air about how to handle the personal training aspect, but the franchise has an in depth immersion on boarding to get you up to par to the successful clubs. 




 It was $500k for everything for a 5k sqft 24/hr gym, renting the building, and I will run it. (you don't need 24hr staffing)  




 Yeah, the one I'm looking at is $500k when all said and done 




 Industry average is 45% churn rate yoy. 




 $100-$150? I'll buy a dozen right now. Cash 




 Rent will be 50% of my overhead for the one I'm getting 




 Lease the equipment. Top name stuff has a 3 year warranty, swap it out for new stuff every three years to stay current and basically infinite warranty 




 Compared to other franchises, I'm buying an anytime fitness as we speak. It might be $500k for the whole deal, but I could be netting enough to pay that back in 3 years.  After that, mostly profit.  




 And crushed by pressure

 LISTEN HILLBILLY... NOT NOW...NOT EVER! 




 I like the subtle nature of it, instant power (compared to turbos spooling)  and it's tuned so that it won't hurt the reliability of the engine.  They give a 36k mile warranty with their kit. 




 I heard it long before the internet was around, but believe what ever you want to believe. 




 why can men sleep with lots of women and be praised for it, but women do the same thing and get shamed? 




 Never heard that one, but it doesn't have the same ring to it.  




 I never said I believed the idiom.  I just give it a reason for when anyone asks this silly question. 




 Nope. It's just something that nature has created.  Men want to spread their seed, but if they see that a woman has had too many other men, they become undesirable. Fast forward 100000 years and now we need to change in our current society.   




 Metaphor.  Master key = stud.  Terrible lock = slut.  When people ask this question, this is one of the better explanations. 




 Whoosh?
 




 If a key opens many locks, it is a master key.  If a lock is opened by many keys, it is a terrible lock.

 We were right down the right side of that pic. 









 So I ordered the kit on their black friday week specials for $1240 and it arrived today.

It came in 2 separate boxes weighing a total of about 100lbs. It comes in 6 pieces + the hardware.  Tools you need are a 14mm socket, 14mm wrench, 12mm socket, lots of penetrating spray lube, and that's it.  

The instructions are pretty basic and not TOO descriptive but it wasn't hard to figure out what they were talking about.

The most difficult part of the whole job is removing the factory exhaust.  I just jacked up the rear my car on jack stands and went to work.  The factory exhaust is 3 pieces.  The muffler, the resonators, and the y-pipe.  It's held on by 10 bolts and 5 rubber hangers.  

In my case, the bolts that attached the y-pipe to the resonators were frozen/jammed on there good, I was able to break one loose, but ended up stripping the nut of the 2nd.  Not that big of a deal as you can remove the cross member that is right there and the whole thing came out as one big piece (y-pipe+resonators).  Getting the hangers out of the rubber supports was a bear as well.  They have an arrow tip that makes it really hard for them to go back out after they have been installed. You have to pull on the rubber while at the same time push on the mufflers (and a lot of lube) to finally get them out.  This would have been massively easier if I had it on a lift and not awkwardly squirming on the ground trying to get leverage.

Installing the new parts was super simple.  First put the larger part of the y-pipe on, then the other and secure the bolts finger tight using the factory gasket and bolts.  Then hang the resonators in their spots and bolt it to the y-pipe with the gasket and supplied hardware, again finger tight.  After that, you hang the mufflers in their spots (kinda of a bitch by yourself working from the ground). Last bolt the tubes from the muffler to the resonators with the last 2 gaskets.   From the cats start tightening everything down working your way back checking for clearance of the sway bar and cross member (that you reinstalled if you took it off).  Once the exhaust tips are aligned properly (by sliding the hangers back or forward), you can make sure everything is bolted down tight.  Start the car, check for leaks.

For my car, it was about a 3.5/10 difficulty.  If I had a lift it would have been a 2/10....with a helper and a lift, 1/10.  From unboxing to taking the car off the stands and cleaning up was about 3 hours.  I spent too long on that one bolt and I kept getting work phone calls, so it could have been 2-2.5 hours.

The increase in performance seemed noticeable.  I'm sure I'll use the extra "19 rwhp" claimed by Stillen, but it's the sound that makes it worth all the while.

During initial startup and under load, it sounds mean...but not obnoxious, very similar to the stock sound (which I loved).  On the road, it's actually QUIETER than stock.  Anyone that complains of a "drone" is hallucinating.  I took a trip down the freshly paved freeway near my house last week with the stock exhaust and tonight with the Stillen exhaust.  I also took with me a dB meter.  Stock exhaust was around 67-75db at highway speeds.  Stillen was 63-70db.  I was really surprised.  Perhaps after a few hundred miles it might change as it gets broken in, but we'll just have to wait and see.

I'll post a vid of the exhaust under load compared to stock after it stops this wind/rain shit storm that Seattle has going right now.

**tl;dr  Stillen exhaust is super easy to install, more power, and a mature sound that wont piss off your whole neighborhood.**

 




 I have a GoPro with lots of mounts and will be doing some before/after video's.  

What would you like to see?

I'll probably just drive a 1-2 mile route around my neighborhood with the camera stuck just above the exhaust, then again in the cabin.  After the new exhaust is on, repeat it. 

I might also do a time lapse of the install process, it doesn't look all that difficult.

 My wife and I moved to Seattle recently and was looking forward to going to PAX Prime, but missed out getting any tickets.  

I thought the face value of these were like $35 each, so I'm not sure why all of them are advertised for $80+ ea.  If someone could explain that to me, that would help.  Unless it's just people taking advantage of others, then...well, people suck.

Anyway, I'd love to go just for a day to see it.  Any day would be ok, but if there are 2 Sat or Sun passes available at a reasonable price so that both my wife and I can go, I'd be forever grateful.  

If you are here in the Seattle area, that would be best, otherwise I guess shipping will have to do. 





























 Fun Fact. If the top 30% of Americans (anyone making ~$47k+ a year) donated just over 25% of their income, the minimum wage could be set at $30000 a year. Now that would be nearly 100% increase in $ for 40% of the people in the country (around 60 MILLION people). What would the economy look like if almost half the people had twice the money they had before?

If you make less that $20k/yr now, what would YOU do with $10K+ more money at the job you currently have? Buy more things than you would right now probably. Perhaps start investing in things? Start owning a home? Trade in that old inefficient unsafe car? Start eating better food and going to the gym? Stop going to the dollar store/Wal-Mart and start spending money at local shops and on things that were made in the USA because now you don't have to save every penny? I would think that far more business ventures would be more successful because more people would have more money to spend on things that aren't necessities.

I know that people will screen "socialism!" and "redistribution of wealth to the lazy!" and what not, but it's just a thought experiment. Since 1% of the people have 40% of the wealth in this country, what would happen if we DID take half of that money that the 1% has and gave it to the bottom 40% (The bottom 80% only have 7% of the wealth currently). Think about it. 

A CEO makes ~380x more than the average employee (not the least paid...the average). The average person has 1 car, if that. CEO's don't have 380 cars each, or even a few cars that combined are worth 380x the average. It gets to a point to where you can only buy so much stuff. Sure it can be lavish, expensive and superlative..but if you make 1000 times more that the average person, you wont spend 1000 times more money on things. In 2012, 3000 people made AT LEAST 1000 times more than 60,000,000 people did, with 1000 of those making over 5000 times more.

Forget about if it is "fair" or not. Just what if the rich suddenly decided to willingly give up a decent portion of their immense wealth for the good of the country.

 They might make a case if something that is directly connected to the mod if it goes wrong. Like the maf, or the o2 sensor goes out with a intake and exhaust mod.  




 Maybe add a little more fluid abd check the level of your pads.

 Well, they have individual dyno readings of 19hp from the exhaust and about 15hp from the intake.  I've not seen a unit that has a dyno of both (and only both) vs stock.

It's seems far fetched, but they have some data to back it up.

 Back when game distribution wasn't that good, you had to pre-order games in order to ensure that when it came out, you could actually get a copy.  Now you can get virtually every new release in a digital download format, therefore there is an unlimited supply of games.

So, with that being said there is actually 0 reason to pre order a game.  Games will go on sale after they are released.  all pre orders do now is just give game companies money for stuff they haven't done yet.  They know they can just rush games out, un polished, buggy, and patch it up later if need be.  But they don't need to do that, because they'll just work on the next half baked big IP game and shovel in more money from those pre orders. 




 I thought we were stopping the whole pre-order thing now? 




 Stillen Gen 3 will get you the most HP/$ for sure.

I like the sound of the [Stillen Exhaust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw41sSRZ4mU) as well. 

Both of those combined should give you a 30+hp boost for about $2k total.

If you go big, then you can go with a supercharger or Twin turbo kit, but those can be upwards of $10k and get you to 500+ hp at the crank 




 Which is why I don't own a XB1, and won't buy any racing games on the PS4 until GT7.

 I'm really disappointed in Sony that they have snubbed everyone but Thrustmaster.  That's the real issue.  I've spoken with people at Logitech directly (at E3 and PAX) and they say that it doesn't have the little chip inside it to make the unit be recognized as a legit device.

They say they are working on it, but damn, they've been out for a year and nothing.

I'm sure they've done all they can, but Sony isn't letting them have the rights to it for some reason.

 I get why they were against him, but they didn't see all the work, planning and shit he went through to set them up and their future family for life. 




 I don't think I ever hated him.  I was rooting for him the entire time.  I was pissed when his family found out and just flat out turned and rejected him after all he had done for them.  So much work, so much pain, so much death...all for the family.  And they want nothing to do with him.  Fuck that family. 




 he bounced up and down, but when he hit it the weight transfered up, the car had very little contact with the road. When he came back down, the tires griped again and jerked in a direction he wasn't prepared for and lost control. 




 If you can see a bump in the road 500 feet in front of you, you have not quite 2 seconds to react at 200mph.

at 200mph, the bumps in the road they hit you probably wouldn't even notice a 55mph.  It looked like it had a couple of little hills back to back which threw the car off balance and it would take one hell of a driver to keep it under control.  




 Tracks are bumpy too, you just get a feel for where they are and know how to negotiate them.

The bump that was in this vid probably wasn't even noticeable at 55mph.

 Pepsi points were the zenith of these.  I worked as a bottle returns person at a grocery store in 1996 when pepsi points were around.  No one really collected them with any regularity.  So when people brought their cans and bottles in to recycle, I would take them to the back, cut off all the points (they were on the outside labels plastic bottles and on the cardboard cases of cans) and keep them, then sort them where they needed to go.

I had THOUSANDS of points at the end of the summer and got SO much crap most of it was pretty decent.

 There is a difference between a Skyline, and a Skyline GT-R (R3x).  I don't think they make a Skyline GT-R since the new platform in 2003.  It's just Skyline 350GT (G35) or the GT-R (R35).

If the kid has GT-R badges, then that's stupid.  If he swapped Infiniti for Skyline...there's nothing wrong with that. 




 R35=USDM GT-R  Similar platform to the G series, but not that close.  the G35 and the Skyline 350GT are VERY close.

 Technically it IS a Skyline, but it's not an R35 by any means. Just because it was "imported" doesn't make it any better (even if it were true).  If I had a 280hp car in High school, i'd feel pretty damn proud of it too.

 Well, to be honest, it's exactly what we intend to do.  Use the capital we've saved, invest it and (hopefully) get a lot more back in the next few years.  Once we have that new return, invest that and accelerate the income generation even more.  In the next 20 years, retire on pure residual income.  




 If you have the know how to setup the production facility, the distribution network, the sales channels, the regulatory compliance, etc. Then go do it yourself.  Be the boss and reap all of the profits.

I feel you in your specific chemical scenario.  My wife is a biochemist.  The business of chemistry and biochemistry is way more lucrative for the business people than the chemists that create the actual content their selling.

As such, she's quitting and we're opening our own business (not chemistry related). 




 I did the same thing at Best Buy.  I was a hourly department manager (not a supervisor, only one in the store) and there were 4-5 Assistant store managers.  

I was making $21/hr + up to 40% bonuses.  They were flat 55-60k/yr + x% bonuses.

They weren't making their numbers to get bonuses, working 50hrs a week (60 for the holidays) and I was at 40 hrs/wk hitting max bonus numbers and had OT when I needed to work more.

After I left, one of the AM's "demoted" herself to my spot.  Same money, less work load.

I have the same thing. I can work 10 hours for weeks on end because I'm good at what I do.  Sometimes it's 70 hours though.  As long as the results are there, I get paid.

 If it does what it says it does, it's ok for the price.  However it's not telling you what grade of metal.  Just "not pure gold" or "not pure silver".  You get much more detail with XRF. 




 The infinite thickness for gold is 10 microns. Gold plating is usually thinner than that. So our unit can see the underlying metal and give you a warning.  Even reaching the limit, it looks at the ratio between the M and L shell kEV cps and can also give you a warning.

Super engineered counterfeits can fool XRF for sure, but those are rare and costly to make.  What people are doing is getting stainless steel (austenitic aka doesn't respond to magnets), stamping them 18k and then going place to place to see if someone will buy it as white gold.  Stainless steel will pass the 18k scratch acid test, but it instantly shown on XRF to have no gold.  Same with grandma's jewelry.  People will swear up and down that this is a pure 18k gold ring that has been passed down for generations, but the XRF will spot regular plating and costume jewelry in 5 seconds or less.

XRF also helps you pay for exactly what you get when it is authentic.  14k gold should be 58.5% gold.  However, most of the stuff made in recent years is 55% gold.  So if your item passes the 14k scratch test, and you are paying out on 58.5% by weight, then you are losing money when you go to sell it to the foundry who will do an fire assay and get the correct %.

Most big pawn/coin shops will have an XRF unit.  Hardcore Pawn has 2 of ours that they use on the show occasionally.  




 Acid tests aren't even that accurate, but they are cheap.  I sell xray units that give precise gold concentration and tell you if they could be fake.  They are $18000 though. 




 my step dad has a  08 g35xS sedan and I have a 08 g37s coupe.  The coupe handles more like a 370z while the sedan handles more like a maxima. So, yeah there is a noticeable difference. 




 You were so preoccupied with whether or not you could, you didn't stop to think if you should. 




 I'm right in the butter zone.   Couldn't keep my unlimited data, but I'm not on the ones that up your rate if you do a 2 year thing.  I COULD save $20 or so by going to an EDGE plan and then having the phone be $25/mo for 24 mo.  But it's cheaper to get it subsidized and keep the current plan.  There is just a new 2 year contract and a ETF if it's canceled. like I said, I'm not going anywhere, so why should I spend $600 when I can spend $250? 




 The newest plans are like that.  "0 down and $20/mo extra until it's paid off."  I have a slightly older plan.  No extra fees or any garbage like that. 




 I'll keep my same plan, not an edge plan.  Just $250, no extra anywhere outside of an ETF, which isn't an issue because I'm not jumping ship until someone has better LTE coverage (not likely).  Sell my current phone for ~$250 and it's a net 0 swap for me.

 construction, plumbing, welding...any blue collar field, etc

Women can certainly do those jobs, but they tend to be much more physically demanding.  The average man can do those jobs and get worn out pretty easily after a day of work in training.  The average woman will have a far tougher time accomplishing the same job.

Not sure what best describes this, "free market" maybe?  Of all the blue collar jobs, I would think electricians would be best for both sexes.  Lifting some wire bundles and running up and down ladders should be just as easy for both. Unlike normal construction/framing.  That's a lot of weight you are always moving around.

 Good racing game, but I prefer the racing sims more like Gran Turismo.  Can't wait to see what Project Cars comes out with. 




 They are forced induction.  So they force more air into the engine.  If you can get more air in there, you can get more fuel (air to fuel ratio, or stoichiometry, says when the mix will ignite) .  More fuel = bigger bang.  Bigger bang = more power pushing the cylinder down.

Now how they function it's different between sc and turbo.  Turbo's use the exhaust to spin a turbine on one half of it, when then sucks more air in on the other side.

Super chargers use the belts of the engine to drive the turbine (or other type).  Supercharged cars usually have no delay or lag between when you hit the has pedal, while turbo suffer from turbo lag from them taking some time to spool up to pressure.

You rarely see supercharged 4 cylinder cars, but 6+ cylinder can go either way. 
 




 Can't stand them.  It's the most idiotic thing on TV and I can't figure out how they keep getting renewed.

 Well, a lot of the uber rich pay much less in taxes as a percentage of their income.  Sure they might pay a million in taxes every year, but if they make 6.6 million a year on investments, then that's less than someone that makes a $40k salary and has to pay $8000 percentage wise.

 Which ever one you pick, have a franchise lawyer look over the FDD.  I was going to buy an anytime fitness franchise.  I had a great spot and decent lease pricing picked out.  Then I had a lawyer look at it and gave me some good questions to ask.  He also spelled out in plain terms how they will always get their fees even if the business goes under, even if it's through no fault of my own.  There was language in it that said they could put me out of business if certain things happened.  They had no obligation to do anything for me after the doors opened.

A big pitfall for food franchises is that they control who you buy your supplies from...because they own those distribution channels.   If they raise the price of food, then you can't go elsewhere to get a more competitive rate.

Anytime fitness is the same way.  They own the payment processor you use, the security and monitoring equipment companies, the back end software, everything but the actual fitness equipment. If they decide they want more money, there is nothing you can do about it.  And this is coming from the #1 franchise to own right now.

There are stats (I don't have right now) that say that there is only a 1% difference in being successful between a business that is independent and a franchise.

 My wife just wears the one engagement ring.  The other wedding band would actually take away from the custom design we had done. 




 I know in the FAQ there are some links to general answers to these questions, but I'm looking for a particular viewpoint.

My wife has made it to the 2nd round of candidates for an academy that is targeting technically minded women. They take women with little to no experience in web development, and giving them a intensive 7 month course + 5 month internship at local (Seattle) tech companies to be a full stack developer for free.

I'd like to hear more about the industry (local Seattle would be best) to know what she would be getting into? Things like, pay, workload, expected hours/week, ability to still have a personal life/vacations, what kind of corporate BS (I know it's in every industry) you have to wade through, industry specific challenges (outside of actual project challenges), etc. A womans perspective would be ideal.
Thanks in advance. 




 My wife submitted her application and has her interview with them next week. Can you give any more details on the program that aren't readily available and more importantly, what kind of results (job prospects) actually came of this? 




 Seattle Area code.  Not too surprising.

 I've been waiting for Verizon to release this phone to get it for $200 instead of $650.  I went to look at one at the AT T store.  
It had some nasty burn  in.  I know it's been there on full brightness for 12+ hours a day for months.  Anyone seen this in real world usage?

Also, What is missing from the this phone? The one thing I really like about my wife's Moto X (2013) is the Moto Assist app. The nexus is a Moto phone, so does have or can it get this app?

I'll be coming from a Note 3 (Galaxy Nexus before that) so I'm looking forward to the bigger size, Android 5.1, and similar battery life (I get 3-4 hours of SOT now).

I know people are raving about other kernels and ROMs but I'll look for just basic root and apps that utilize that well. 




 You can get vented rotors that help with brake fade.  That's the cheapest option. http://www.stillen.com/products/brake-rotors/

You can get "big brake kits" that up the rotor size and caliper piston #.  http://www.stillen.com/products/brake-kits/?varyear=2007 varmake=Infiniti varmodel=G35

Just depends on how big you want to go.  If you do track racing regularly, then you would see a real benefit with the big kits.  Otherwise just the rotors might help a little with "spirited" driving day to day. 




 Bigger brakes maybe?  Doesn't matter how fast you can go if you can't stop quickly.

If you don't want to go real big HP (supercharging/turbo), then consider an Uprev tune?  Should be able to squeeze more HP out of the current mods and give you a little better throttle response.  I'd only do this after you are done with engine/hp mods. 




 Unfortunately I'm not a mechanic, I just have a basic understanding of how the car works 




 Could be a throttle position sensor, or even the ignition switch if the fuel pump is working properly.  Lots of things need to work to keep the engine at idle 




 yeah, that 83 Bimmer must get you tons of looks....http://www.carpictures.com/pics/full/01G98440117472A/BMW-320i-black-1983-01G98440117472A.jpeg 




 AFAIK, the x models don't have a manual transmission option...for some stupid reason. 




 If the roads are plowed, and there aren't many hills...then snow tires + weight will do ok.  Add hills and/or not plowed, it'll be tough/sketchy for sure. 




 Yeah, I make a bit over 6 figures so what I owe is not a large % of my income. 




 one of them is an independant consulting gig where I get a 1099 instead of a traditional paycheck.  I should pay quarterly taxes on it, but I'd rather pay the $25 fine at the end of the year and keep all the money until it's time to pay in April.  That way the gov. isn't making interest on my money. 




 Lol, what's a refund? I owe like $7k every year 




 Not if the guy doing the trick is good enough at focusing his attention 




 A congress...Seriously 




 I don't know what I expected...

I even said to myself, it'll be dickbutt, watch. 




 i've heard that those pills all have a class action suit against them.  IUD is where it's at.  no periods, period.  Just swap it out every 5-10 years depending on the type.  Not sure why every woman doesn't have them (unless you want kids soon) 




 it's the psychological thing about one lane road vs 2 lane.  You feel safer on a 2 lane road and more comfortable going faster.  But when it's 1 lane again, 45 mph is the same safe feeling as 65 on 2 lane 




 Looks like he deals them all into his right hand, holding them with the last 2 fingers, then when he goes to sweep the table with that hand, he drops them below the table. 




 There is a big one on Maui too. Also in the north shore part. 




 Bottom part of the screen under the options to play, rate, save, etc 




 nothing has a hard date (that we know of) that is leaving.  Sometimes there are changes at the start of each month, sometimes its 6 months.

When nothing has a date, nothing will show up.  I promise you they will be there when it's announced that those titles will be leaving. 




 wow, people still use TiVo?  Had 2 of them from 2007 that I tossed when I moved last. 




 It only shows up on things that are going away soon.  Example, I watched Cool Runnings on Feb 26th and it said that it was going away on March 1 




 It's there on both of my playstations (3 and 4) 




 He who represents himself has a fool for a client.  Get a lawyer 




 There will be a date on the ticket. You need to plead guilty or not guilty on our before that day.  If you plead not guilty, you'll get a court date. 




 It all depends your jurisdiction. Some do this, some do traffic school.  Sometimes if the cop doesn't show up to court, the have to let you off. Other times the cops do not have to show and their testimony is filed when the ticket is filled 




 If you say you were speeding, in any form, you will be found guilty.  You admitted to it. The cop doesn't have to say a word.  




 Get a lawyer. If they are able to get you off, it'll cost the same as the ticket but won't be on your record to up your insurance for 3+ years. 




 Somewhere in Oregon for sure. 




 Last one I saw was July 2013

 weiner dogs are the meanest breed out there.  Nothing but a fur covered napoleon complex 




 it's a definite throwback to the old rated R action movies of the 80's and early 90's.  Lots of death, lots of blood and guts, lots of guns, lots of awesome. 




 If I remember right is a way of disposing oil that isn't useful or something like that.  




 won't improve it, that's for sure.  you might be able to up the price a few grand MAYBE. But mods have a terrible return on investment for resale. 




 Most of the V8's that you find in the competition's cars are more expensive by a good bit.  Their HP are in the 425-475 range.

if you want your G to be in that range, you can spend 7-10k on a supercharging kit with the oil cooler and be at 500 to the crank and still have lots of day to day driving ability.

 There's an advanced mode.  You can customize your own map and buildings.  There is lots to do beside gain population and solve the issues along the way. 




 YOU'RE THE GUY THAT DID THAT!!!! OMG (good for you) 




 I had one of these too.  I loved that my shirt could change color just like my hot wheels 




 The lighter thing was around in the early 90's.  I remember kids doing that 




 Up until recently I had a copy of that sealed with the "golden CD" possibly inside.  I thought it might be with something later.  




 I've never been able to get Google voicemail working on any Verizon phone for years now.  




 There is a G35 sedan around here that has nbeyond as their licence plate 




 Yup, I have access to 3 different companies fedex number. I've never gotten a 2nd look when I come in and just spit out a number and say bill to sender.  I don't know if I've ever mixed them up. 




 You account is 1Z[account number][generated tracking number]  So, yeah, if you know anything about UPS you could use someones account number. 




 That's why sand is where it's at. 




 or a bike? 




 My wife was at amgen. It's a really nice spot for sure.  The funny thing is, she got into a program that teaches women to become a full stack web developer. Then they give internships to sponsoring companies, one of which is Expedia.  She could end up working in the same building again 




 It's the wax of the candle and soot that is coating the egg.  THAT's the hydrophobic property you see.

 I'm 6'3" and dated a girl that was 4'10".  She barely came up to my sternum.  Opportunities were endless. 




 Your penance is the commute and ever worsening traffic.  I prefer to live up north a bit.  More spendy than Tacoma, but it's not Tacoma 




 The GTR can corner.

I'd love to see a pro driver take a Hellcat on Laguna Seca and then the GTR.  I bet there is more than 2 second lap times faster in the GTR.

EDIT [it's over 6 seconds a lap faster than the Hellcat at Willowsprings](http://fastestlaps.com/tracks/willow_springs_-_streets_of_willow.html) and it's only 2.5 seconds faster than a GTi that has almost 500hp less.

The Hellcat is a muscle car and a damn fine one, not a supercar. 




 At the current rate Seattle will be the next SF in the near future  




 Seattle is looking at SF as what things may come.  TONS of tech job openings that pay 60-100k/yr.  That's easily liveable money in Seattle.  People are coming in droves to work at Amazon, Google, HBO, ADT, Starbucks, Zillow, Redfin, Adobe, Expedia, M$, Nintendo, Pokemon, Nordstrom, and countless startups.  They are buying up/renting out all the apt's near downtown to minimize the shitty commutes forcing out all the artsy folks that are barely making money as is.

It's creating a pretty big divide between the people that have been there for decades and these new transplants.

Not sure how to stop it from following suit other than I'm happy I live where I live. 




 yeah, that's $1000 more than what I pay to own my house. 




 at least they have plenty of room to build and cheap property to do it.

SF really has no where to grow but up.  Until then, it's going to be more and more expensive. 

If I wanted to buy the same house I have have now in SF (brand new construction, 4bd 3.25 bath, 2500 sqft) it would cost 2-4 times more than what I paid, and it would have been built in the 1920s.  Thats 4-8 times more than the house I had before with similar specs.

Both me and my wife would need to both be making 6 figures to live the way we do now. 




 I know Strokin' is a real song, but then again, "Let me smell yo' dick" is also a song so I'm not sure if you were joking or not. 




 I have a performance car (~350hp).  This is a budget supercar (500hp+). 




 You have to go to a place that can read the sensors in each of the tires directly.  Any big tire store can do this.  It could be a dead battery in one of them since it's pushing 10 years old. 




 yeah the VZW box says it's "Black" when it means the Midnight Blue 




 What about Strokin' by Clarence Carter? 




 200k+ miles shouldn't be unheard of as long as it's taken care of. 

Just make sure to keep the fluids and filters changed.  Inspect the belts and change as needed.

 I've not been to the seatac international arrival one, but lax has an automated kiosk that takes your picture and you fill out more paperwork, then go to a human 




 I think it's faster because you have to go to a kiosk, then wait in line for one to open up, fill out your info, then head to the line to get to a person.  

This will save time as you can bypass the first section and go straight the the line waiting for the agent. 




 In '99 had a '97 Eclipse turbo.  I had some mods in (275 whp) it and not too flashy, but it stood out. 

That was the only time I ever had girls initiate conversations with me based on my car.  I found several notes on my car after I would leave work ask me to give them a call.

This was only after Fast and Furious was in theaters, so I had the same car that was at the beginning of the movie.

 LEGO Marvel killed mine :( 




 My ps3 lasted 7 years.  Best Blu-ray player ever.  Bought it day 1 and it just yellow lighted in November. 




 cool. good to know. 




 I can feel where it might happen to me as well.  I have the bumper case and it's a noticeable ridge where the port is  




 lol, instead of 1.8(temp in C)+32.  




 Technically, you could change the exhaust and intakes.  As long as you kept the factory parts and put them back on before you give it back.  

The dealer might bitch a little, but you'd have to read the fine print of your lease. 




 I'd argue that you have some [pretty fine roads](http://i1.trekearth.com/photos/61830/transfagarasan.jpg) I've been here. The way up looked a lot like OP's pic.  But this road once you reach the summit... OMG. 

According to a former BBC employee, this is the best road...IN THE WORLD. 




 That's weird, I used to be able to talk on my galaxy nexus and use 4g at the same time. What changed? 




 Oregon was 503, then it became Portland metro. 




 You can stack every planet side by side and it still doesn't span the distance from the earth to moon.   Space is...astronomically big. 




 Man, the commissions have really gone to crap since I was there. It was like $10-$15 per computer, ~$5 per monitor, $3-$5 per cable, and 15% of the extended warranty.  I know there is no margin in computers now, but only $6 for the warranty? Damn.

I was one of the top three sales guys in Oregon around 2002.  I would make $650-$800/wk in commissions plus minimum wage (which basically took care of taxes).  In today's dollars that would be $65-$70k/yr slinging electronics. I'd be interested to hear how much people are making today. 




 Amazon Drones = Skeet shooting with prizes. 




 My parents bought something similar to this back in the 80's.  It stacked the length and height of our garage, one box wide.  We lived about 7 miles from the nearest town of about 15000 at the time.  This was in Texas and tornados are common. 

We never touched the stuff and even when we moved to Oregon in the 90's, they moved it as well.  Still never touched it and gave it away in when it was pushing '99.  




 Nearest shipping center? Is there really a major metro in Maine? 




 They have like 50 warehouses strategically placed in major metros.  I would think that most of the population would live near one. 




 They approved an experimental drone, http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/19/8259881/amazon-prime-air-delivery-drone-faa-permission


 but it's not the one they are currently working on, so it was useless to them. http://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-says-its-approval-to-test-delivery-drones-already-obsolete-1427219327 




 They were playing with the idea of using Taxi's/Uber for 1 hr delivery in places near the warehouses. 




 still slower than driving to a retail store that has the same thing in stock. (assuming same price) 




 Maintenance = keep the oil and filters changed regularly, inspect belts and replace as needed. Other than that you should be good to go.

 /r/infiniti is your friend guys. 




 He got the job because he went off for several minutes without repeating a single line.  He was a consultant for the before that.  Kubrick swapped the actor for him after hearing that 




 This happens when the car's battery is disconnected and the window isn't all the way up.  On my Infiniti, you have to roll the window all the way down, then hold the up switch until is all the way up and then keep it there for 15-30 seconds. 




 What the hell am I looking at? 

NOW. You're looking at now, sir. Everything that happens now is

Just now!

When will then be now?

 Yeah that's what pre orders were for. It guaranteed you a copy at the place you wanted to buy it.  Now with infinite copies via digital, it's something that should be retired.

Now they bait you to buy a game that might not even be good with "exclusive" things that are not useful or cosmetic at best. 




 I was doing it from memory, I guess it was exposure, not focus.  My bad. 




 AH, never could figure out what it did. 




 FYI, under Advanced in the stock camera, there is a Manual focus mode toggle.

 Not saying people do, but it's usually the rules that no one follows 




 A car dealer did this back in 2000 to my step dad.  He had picked out and paid for a brand new 2001 jeep grand Cherokee, but he didn't want it delivered until Christmas morning.  

A few days before, the dealership calls and asks how she is liking her new car.  He was not pleased. 




 Even having lived in Portland, it's still meh most of the time 




 Most of the cars in my town have snow tires, AWD or otherwise. Huge ski town.  




 It still is that way in most of the US.  Pedestrians have the right of way, always.  However, it's not about who's right, it's who's left.

 Some do. Newer five guys places are where I see them most 




 You can try to contact Motorola and ask, but just setting the expectations realistically  




 Trendy downtown area, look in capitol hill.  Trendy just outside of downtown, look at Ballard, Fremont, Wallingford.  Queen Anne is kind of in between those. 




 It's a known thing since the day it was released.  US warranties won't cover it from international places.  If you got it back to the US you could get it replaced by Motorola

 I took my wife's '00 323ci out in the worst snow we had all year.  With snow tires and the DSC we were getting around just fine while SUV's and Subaru's were in the ditches 




 You mean 52 coupons... One for each week.  I won something similar at Hollywood video. Free rentals for a year.  52 new release coupons and 100 non new releases 




 Which was the same premise of a [duck tales episode](

 They were referring to San Francisco. 




 The place is packed on the weekends from the times I've been there. 




 You mean like Cafe Mox in Seattle?  That place is packed most weekend nights. 




 Wasn't there this morning.  I was playing with the smart lock stuff then, because the location based portion wasn't working. 

It's there now. 




 Not to mention he hasn't really been able to get a normal job since he's been out.  He's been doing odd jobs or self employment ventures 




 Go hometown! Haven't been there in 25 years though 




 Step brother was looking at close to 40 years for weed... Did 13. 




 So far, Smart lock doesn't seem to like my house, but connected to BT in the car works.

My Wifi had some issues on AC, I factory reset the router and it fixed it. It was definitely the router.  Nothing would connect to the AC band. 




 I don't think it's a girl's car per se.  I will say that IMHO only the RWD coupes look the most manly/sporty.  I can spot a X series and sedans (obviously) a mile away.  There's just something about the coupes that look amazing. 




 probably to get around YouTube's copyright algorithms.  It sees these and says it's definitely not Star Wars. 
























 i'm still worried about the coverage honestly.  Verizon has WAY better coverage than sprint and tmo...probably combined it's still not as good in rural areas.

Unless there are some giant WiFi towers out there that google has certified, it'll be interesting to see how it pans out. 




 link? I can't find it. 




 The thing that broke on my g27 was the plastic position sensor.  I ordered a brass one online and now it works like a champ again. 




 Yeah, that's why I bought PCars for PC 




 Too bad this doesn't work with the xb1 or ps4 .  I know there is a USB converter out there but the force feedback doesn't work as of now 




 I have the same color. Get looks and complements constantly 




 I just picked up a turbocharger for the car. Worked pretty well. 

went from 46% to 71% in about 45 min while using the screen, GPS, spotify, emails, etc. 




 don't think that is a jammer, just a really good detector 




 I've done this jump. It's pretty cold but neat to swim in. 




 Well, that's niche markets in general.  My uncle got a degree in geology but ended up manufacturing a upgraded part for ICP-MS machines (I think) that made the resolution better or something along those lines.

He's made millions off of this little process in this little corner of one market.

The point of the video is to get people to evaluate their situation and perhaps look around to see if there is something they can do to change it if they are unhappy.

The path to success looks like [this](http://wp.patheos.com.s3.amazonaws.com/blogs/exploringourmatrix/files/2014/02/Path-to-success.jpg)

I've done a whole lot of different things and I'm on my 2nd-3rd major career and I'm 35.  So, it's all about what you are willing to do and be willing to fail. 




 I rode my bike through that exact stretch of walkway on Saturday.  It was nice that day too, I wonder if he was filming that day.   Not sure of how long it takes to for him to edit and post these. 




 You're probably OK with just the one then. Just keep the two in the back the same tread depth. 




 Awd? Then replace them all if the new one is more than 3/32" difference than the rest.  If rwd, then you could be OK 




 I did that too.  After a 1000 it seems to get easier because you can clear the 3 cactus bunches easily 




 Unlimited money to political parties 




 I'm a few days behind, but the last one I watched went did this again. But they are changing it up a bit 




 He'll get local people that seem like fairly knowledgeable people there, but only local people in NYC.  They are usually news station contributors or advocate group spokesperson.  I'm sure they are having a hard time getting people on short notice, so that's why you see the shows staff and touring comedians on the show to fill one of the 4 spots.   




 It's three 7 min segments.  Monolog, panel, keep it 100.  6 min isn't really worth it 




 It seems like they're trying out a few things.  I don't mind the panel with opposing views, but they only have about 6 - 12 min to talk about anything so it's really hard to actually get a good conversation going and wrap it up in that time frame.  


Mahr does it better, but that's once a week for an hour.  Just like I'm sure The Daily Show won't stand up to Oliver after Jon leaves. 




 Only if you look at the exact same things all day everyday 




 Voice Over LTE  




 I sell portable industrial scientific equipment.  You want to know what that metal, gas, powder, or dirt has in it? I probably have something that will tell you and can hold it with one hand 




 I sell portable XRF units, you may have or may be getting a new unit from us soon.   




 My wife works at amgen, but she transitioning into web development.  Who knows, she could end up at that same site in a few years when it's ready.

Very cool spot.  I hear 2018 is the target? Seems long 




 I hear that you should be getting a portable  XRF and nir unit soon.  Not sure if you inspect the incoming metal grades or scrap, but I sell those 




 Obviously if verified, and it would help if they posted a fair bit too before they get the flair.

Are we going to separate employees of dealers and corp employees I'm not sure which employees we've had 




 What lawns? 




 Yup.  Under the main heading you could see the upvotes in orange, and downvotes in blue.  The sum would be the number we still have.

Remember reddit puts automatic downvotes on threads over time to allow new ones to come up.

So a thread that had 3000 net upvotes would show like 15000 upvotes and 12000 downvotes .  I'm sure in most cases there weren't actually that many real downvotes, just a small portion and the rest were added by the algorithm

EDIT:  Here's an example of what it was like http://i.imgur.com/7rcMyAO.jpg

 Neat, was that with the kinect as well? 




 Also, did you catch the price?

 I was looking into buying an ATF franchise.  The key fee is just what they mark up the $4 RFID chip so you can access the building whenever. 

To seal the deal to get new members they can waive "activation fees" or discount the "key fee".  Both of those have very little costs so it's easy to waive it to get someone to pay $45-$50/mo.

As long as they have 600+ members they are making money. (depending on rent costs) 




 That's for the smaller club access, it's like $460 for the larger ones. Still $15/mo for 2 years and no initiation fees. 




 This is the most accurate answer, however you need to have it rooted and a custom recovery installed to do it. (not too difficult to do) 




 With all the sensitivity around this subject in the US, I have NO CLUE how this song ever got on the radio unedited.

 Unless you cache the area you are in, yup. 




 With the right training, we have more distance running ability.  They will be faster in the short term, but they will get tired faster 




 I'm sure the massive guys in the main pic are stronger than this guy, but wouldn't be able to come close to being able to do this, even using a proper technique.  There's something different about him that normal people don't have. 




 Then how'd he do it? 




 oh yeah, for sure. The part where he "measures" the force of the bike with the crane gauge?  The rope had some slack in it and when he popped the clutch, the rope snapped to tension resulting in WAY more force than when he slowly got the rope taught for the guy then slowly applied the throttle.   I'm sure it takes a lot of strength to hold back a motocycle, but it wasn't 1300 lbs of force.

but their explanation for his ability to do the things he does makes the most plausible sense.  Especially since the supposedly do that for a living. 




 http://m.liveleak.com/view?i=4a6_1369884683  Motocycles can hurt you

 Good on you, detective Friends. 




 "Newton's Second Law asserts the direct proportionality of acceleration to force and the inverse proportionality of acceleration to mass. Accelerations can be defined through kinematic measurements."

Care to explain where I'm wrong? 




 I was stating that girls like this DO EXIST.  Attractive, smart, stable and like games/anime.  Might be 1 in 100,000,000, but they are out there.  As the gaming/geek culture gets more mainstream and girls are exposed to and not shamed for liking that culture the odds will get better and better.  

Stay vigilant young brothers! (older ones?...yeah, good luck) 




 Force = Mass * Acceleration.  They measured his muscle fiber output and apparently he can activate more fibers that a normal person.  So when he activates all of them at once, he can accelerate his hands at a faster rate, therefore producing a higher force.

He was on an episode of "Stan Lee's Superhumans" where they hooked him up to a computer to measure his output.  It was off the scale their first attempt. 

*EDIT*  It's on Netflix, the first episode, his section starts at 33 min.  They replicate the force to see how much weight it would take to bend a wrench like that and it's over 500 pounds of static force. 




 To tag on to this, 
Id probably buy a used G35 and run it until the engine needs replacing.

That will be FOREVER.  These engines don't really die as long as you take care of it.

I'd love to see a G35 sedan with an LS1, but that would cost at least 3x as much as you paid for the car. 




 Well, I think the adaptable cruise control and lane assist are pretty cool, but pretty useless for any 1/2 competent driver, so not really worth the money.  They wont help if someone is dumb and smashes in to you.

As far as advanced driving skills go, it's hard to explain in short order.  The main thing is to be smooth.  Smooth driving is fast driving.  I've been self studying these tactics 30+ years with no official training.  I did attend one of these schools that I mentioned back in 2006 and they said they couldn't teach me anything more than what I already knew.  I was passing corvette Z06's in a 350z, I out run most Porsches (non turbo) around tracks in my G37 (until the oil cooler can't handle it and gimps the RPMs).  Of course if they had drivers similar to me, they'd walk away no problem.  I am no pro, but I'm better than most people on the road.  I placed in the top 1% of people in [GT academy](http://www.gran-turismo.com/us/academy/about/)

No matter what road I'm on I'm always am looking for the proper [driving line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_line) and also figuring out where the optimal [braking zone](http://www.drivingfast.net/car-control/braking.htm) is.  If you are on a wet road and start to [oversteer](http://www.drivingfast.net/car-control/oversteer.htm) you need to know how to recover safely (RWD mostly, but they can [understeer](http://www.drivingfast.net/car-control/understeer.htm) too.)

If you understand these basics, you can drive any car fast once you get the feel how the car performs.  Then you can drive that same car at a normal speed, but have the skills to get you out of any mess you or someone else puts you in.

Check out that www.drivingfast.net  That seems to describe the basics pretty well.  If you can find a closed parking lot or private road(track) to practice on, that would be best.

Once you get into it, you might discover that you have a little of the [Dunning-Kruger effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) and realize you didn't know how much you really don't know about driving. 

A licence just proves you know the rules of the road and can operate the basics of a car.  It doesn't mean you can actually *drive*


  




 well, first off, do you want a manual or auto?  That'll eliminate a few options right there (no manual and AWD)

Also, if you've only been driving on public streets since January, this will be a lot of car for you (300+hp).  There are lots of electronic counter measures that will help keep you on the road, but that doesn't keep you 100% safe.

Am I reading right that you are in Mexico?  No idea what's available as far as driver training, but in the states we have advanced driving courses that teach you racing mechanics and skills that will translate well to emergency maneuvers when needed, but it requires practice to be able to feel what the car is doing or is going to do and adjust accordingly.  They can be pricey ($500/day) but if you love to drive it's worth every penny (peso?)

 You might be able to take a hair dryer, heat up the chocolate and blow it out at the same time.  You can also put a towel over the affected area and use the dryer again to heat up the towel and soak up the chocolate at the same time.  Just take your time and don't get the phone too hot.

This is a similar method on how to get wax out of carpet.

 Then you don't have a current plan.  All the current plans have hotspot enabled for free.

 It's less about the tech of the router and more about their little xfinity system that they sell.

They have one master box that is connected to the modem.  Then if you have slave boxes where other tv's are, those act as repeaters for the wifi.  So when they claim the fastest "in home wifi", it's due to having a very strong wifi signal that allows you to get the most speed that the modem is providing anywhere in the house (or outside).  

You can have a 10Gbps connection right to your house, and a 802.11AC router sitting right next to it.  But if it's like my house and in a closet in a corner of the house, it doesn't have a strong wifi connection in most areas of the house.  So you'll be lucky to get 5-10% of what the modem can do.  




 in 2010, ATT claimed largest 4G network because HSPA+ was considered "4G" at the time.  So they were right.  VZW said they had the most LTE coverage, so they were right as well.  T-Mobile claimed the fastest LTE, and they were also right because it was averaging like 30mbps, but only in like 4 cities at the time.

It's all about how you spin it.  So when you see all these claims that each one of them makes, it seems like they all make the same claim and it gets jumbled when you try to remember it later.

 My factory charging cable was DOA, so the VZW store gave me a 3rd party one.  This one has a little LED that lights up when you hold it and goes off when you are either charging or not touching it.  After a few days, the light will stay on all day every day, and then after a few more days, the connector got to 135 degrees.  I  swapped it out for another one and it is doing the same thing, but not getting too hot yet.  

I think the turbo charger is breaking this aftermarket cord.  I've ordered some longer non-lit ones and hopefully it's going to be ok. 




 I have a guy that only works on referrals.  I was able to get a shirt, coat (with custom lining and embroidered), pants, cuff links, 2 ties, done in 2 days or less for $500.

  Opensignal.com

Good site.  So here's my issue.  I travel for work, so I'm all over the states that I cover.  Sometimes these locations are out in the middle of nowhere and I need to be able to pull up their info from salesforce.com or call them to make sure we are still on or have to change the times we are scheduled to meet.

If I only lived and worked in the bigger city ( Seattle...Where T-Mobile's HQ is, Tri cities, Spokane)  Then it would be a non issue since they are mostly the same.

http://puu.sh/hWZa1/d288744fcf.jpg - Verizon 3g/4g coverage

http://puu.sh/hWZfE/4f575d052e.jpg - TMO 3g/4g

http://puu.sh/hWZhm/4bd0419c6f.jpg - Sprint. 

If you look at all the little pockets of places where VZW has decent 3G/4G coverage, it's clear that there is way better coverage in way more places in WA.  It's even more apparent in Oregon.

If you zoom out a bit more, it's laughable. 

http://puu.sh/hWZEn/181dd5fcbe.jpg --TMO
http://puu.sh/hWZGS/e7252bc5fe.jpg --VZW.

I would love to stop over paying VZW, but where I go, coverage is king. 




 I used to sell all the major carriers from 2008-2010.  So that's the last back end exp I have. 

We dealt with AOL's all the time and the new credit check was the only thing that stopped people from swapping owners.  The kid would have to have a $400 deposit in order to take the line over. 




 Hadn't heard of the selling of accounts.  I guess those bastards ruined it for the rest of them. 




 I'm in the same boat.  My business phone is Google voice.  So I can't lose that.  I also don't know if Fi will have the coverage I need.  I travel all over for work.  Vzw coverage is just too good in rural areas to leave as it is.  

I'd like someone to try it out before I do 




 I don't see how that is allowed.  That's the whole point of the AOL.  Same plans/phones...Just new person responsible for the bill.  I know it'll be pending a credit check, but that's no reason to force a plan change 




 pretty sure this was the deleted scene that wasn't allowed on TV. 




 I doubt it would hurt it.  Remember, everything is only worth what other people are willing to pay.

 I've heard that matte finishes are NOT for daily driver cars.  They really collect and hang on to every little bit of dust/dirt/grime out there.  That and it's hand wash only.

I remember going to the international auto show a few years back and both BMW and Hyundai had matte paint jobs on their display cars.  They were roped off and you weren't even allowed to touch them.

Looks cool, but I wouldn't want to deal with the day to day of matte.

 I was looking in to an Anytime Fitness Franchise. 

Everything in the contract stated that I had to pay no matter what happened.  Even if they do things to hurt my membership numbers.  Similar to Quizno's, they could have upped the rates of all the equipment used to run the place at anytime and there was nothing I could do about it.  They control the entire process.

They also wanted an unlimited personal guarantee. They wouldn't budge on this.  They wanted to be able to take EVERYTHING I HAD, unlimitedly, in order to get what the contract stated.  On top of that I had to sign another similar deal for the lease of the building.

In the end it would have cost over 1 million in startup and fees over 5 years, and I wouldn't have anything to show for it because I really didn't own anything. I was leasing everything.

I could see if you had the money to startup 6 of them in decent areas, you could make a pretty penny, but it wasn't right for where I was at at that time. 




 That's disheartening 




 That's the standard practice for those of us that want to keep our GV number.  You should be fine

 I came in to Seatac very late last night and I found a high end smartphone sitting on a bench while waiting for the shuttle to pick me up.

The battery was dead, so I charged it up and turned it on, but it had a lock pattern, no emergency contacts and the SIM card was already cancelled.  I went to a local store that matched the carrier and they said that the person was from Houston. I left it with them, so they can contact the owner.

**TL:DR  If you are/were visiting Seattle in the last day or so and lost your phone, it's at the carrier store at the mall in Lynnwood, Wa.**

Good luck.

 The most popular is uprev.  A tuning company installs the software on your cars computer over writing the factory parameters.  Then they adjust things to get the most HP out of the mods you have installed using a dyno. You also get better throttle response and you can have different modes for different used ( more fuel economy, race gas, etc) 




 The most bang for the buck performance wise is the same as any na car.  Intake/exhaust and CPU remapped.  

I like stillen parts personally.  Most power and best (not Rice like) sound 




 Call the ones that are currently running in different cities.

Ask if you can speak to the manager or owner.  Once you get them on the line, tell them what info you are after and if they don't have time right then to go into it, schedule a time where you can talk for longer.  

Make sure to have specific questions to ask and write everything down so you can recall it later

At Best Buy, that was the one thing people got fired for like 90% of the time.  Easiest way to get rid of problem workers, and an easy way for middle management to show upper management that they were actually doing something.

In a more serious note, there might be something to the "entitlement generation" but I see it more as a generation that was told "you need to go to college so you don't have to have a laborers job.  Those jobs are for losers"  

I'm in the 1978-1997 generation and that's all I was told by my parents, my friends were told the same thing.  Now we are the same people that have over $1 Trillion in college debt with blue collar workers aging and declining.  Someone with a masters degree in education might make $40k a year and have 6 years of school to pay for, while someone that was an apprentice electrician for the same time could make twice that after reaching journeyman with no debt.  But we sure as hell weren't given that as an option.

  THAT is the actual result of this "entitlement generation"

 Moved from bend area to Seattle area last year, they are both better than most places I've visited 




 The fact that someone now has to do such a thing because of shitty parenting is not a small matter, especially when this is compounded when more people do it 




 It's the principle of the matter.  Don't go around and deface shit that isn't yours, especially while visiting.  




 My (or the park rangers) time is worth way more that 2 cents.  

I really hope they don't get identified, but I do hope they see this and realize that this is not a small matter, and either change their ways or never come back to central Oregon.   




 I hope they see this, but don't actually get identified.  That'll be enough.  Either they change their ways or never come back to central Oregon, both outcomes are OK with me 




 This is in my hometown, so I'm more passionate about this than the Utah thing 




  A ticket wouldn't change the behavior of these people.  Now they might think twice before letting your kids be vandals, RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU. 




 They left evidence, have a witness, and a photo Id of the culprit.  That's enough to be charged with vandalism 




 Holy crap... The amount of people that think vandalism is OK and no big deal blows my mind.  

Sure it's a few scratches in some man made thing, but it's the principle of the deal.  How disrespectful is it to visit somewhere, and then deface it?  Kids will be kids, but when they do it IN FRONT OF YOU, you should do your fucking job as a parent and teach them to respect property that isn't yours.  

How is this a hard thing to grasp? 




 It was all over my friends that live in Bend Facebook last week 




 I'm blown away at all the "it's a tradition!" responses.  Who the fuck has a tradition to deface shit everywhere you visit?  How is that ever allowed to be OK?  Kids do stupid stuff, sure, but a parent being complicit in doing it, IN FRONT OF THEM, is just abhorrent parenting 




 "You come to my homeland and deface it? How'd you like it if I defaced your stuff? " 




 This is central Oregon, people take their nature pretty seriously 




 It's made of stone or wood if I remember right.  I used to live 10 miles from there 




 It's the principle of the matter.  Don't let your douche kids vandalize property, especially when you are visiting somewhere and that somewhere is featuring the natural beauty of the area. 




 Orthopedic surgeons are the construction works of the medical field. 




 Yeah, voice number from normal dialer is fine, I was heading out of the country and wanted to try the WiFi calling feature 




 I had thought about that but there wasn't any really good documentation I could find on how project Fi works software wise.  The FAQ says 
 If you're not using your Nexus 6 and you've opted-in to use your number to talk and text on other devices, you can make calls over Wi-Fi using your number through Google Hangouts.

So this might be an issue people run into that want Project Fi but don't have a Nexus 6.

I have the app, but no invite, so I can't test it out to see what that app actually does and how it's different from Hangouts or the regular dialer. 




 *footing the bill 




 Doesn't bode well for the project fi future then.  Hopefully it'll get worked out.  But there is a feedback button, so I suggest using that 




 In preparation for the Project Fi, I wanted to see what it'll be like using Google Hangouts as VoLTE or Wifi calling. 

Today I took the phone off the charger at 11am and had to take a 2+ hour conference call.  I called in to the number with the Hangouts app, then joined the meeting and had the screen on most of the time as I needed to mute/unmute when needed. 

I had expected the screen to suck down the battery pretty bad, but when I was done with the call, I looked and I had 50% battery left.  I go in to the battery stats and the screen and the hangouts app both had the same amount of battery useage at about 16% each.  Under the hangout app, it said it had 2+ hours of CPU usage time.

I'm pretty sure if I had used the normal dialer for this call, it wouldn't have used near what the hangouts app did.  I was on my home Wifi at the time, not LTE.  The phone is the Verizon branded version and the rom is stock, but rooted.

Is this something that anyone else has experienced?  I've tried searching around and nothing has specifically described this issue.

There is the CPU in the middle of all that, but that's the simplest thing to check.  It's the wiring somewhere (sensors or otherwise) or the starter is dead.

 "I graduated high school in xxxx."

I own a successful business and have a 6 figure income, but I never really attended school my senior year.  I did go to a community college for 1 year and did a technical school program (very little is used as the main part of my current job).

I don't need a piece of paper to tell me how smart I am.  School was boring and I only went to the classes I liked such as physics, math, etc.  




 Don't forget about the rare earth elements that are magnetic (Nd being the most prolific). 

Adamantium could share properties with the lanthanoid group.

Aluminum isn't normally magnetic, but when it passes over an eddy current, it can be pushed away when other things like plastic wouldn't be. This is used in recycling centers.  So your theory is sound where he could manipulate all kinds of fields to make any metal bow to his whim.

 Use good oil, and keep the filters changed.  It's not that much more than any other car.  Parts are specific to Infiniti, but there are aftermarket versions if you need to save a few bucks 




 my biggest gripe was that I would totally clear out a room, searching every inch of it making sure it's clear....but NOOOO, the monster behind the wall wouldn't come out until AFTER I go down the hall and it pops out behind me.   




 Main parts of the car are all but bulletproof if you keep up on the fluids and filter maintenance. 

Some have reported odd minor electrical stuff.  Apparently the 6MT's have an issue with the clutch slave cylinder, but that's all I know of.  Other than that, they are really good reliable cars.  I've had mine for 4 years and just the clutch thing has gone wrong. 




 Actually, it's called neural adaptation.  You nose doesn't smell anything.  Your brain does. 




 In hotels, the more you pay, the less you get.

$80-$110 is the sweet spot where you get a decent room, free hot breakfast and free WiFi 




 This happened to me recently.  What it was for me was an app that I installed that called for the location via GPS every so often.  The GPS call used the play services, so that is what was reported as using the battery instead of the app that made the call.


Find when this started, then find what app you installed around then and uninstall it 




 Wildstar? 




 Nothing here either. 




 And I thought move had low miles with 66k.  That's pretty good 




 Here's why I'm guessing.  Nationally, traffic is going to be heavier in the afternoons no matter what.  Not everyone goes to work at the same time.  However, more people do things in the afternoons than mornings.  You errands that you have to do, the activities you want to do, etc.  So that adds more cars.

Now think of how I-5S is laid out.  We'll address it in 2 sections.  North of Northgate and South of Northgate.  

South of Northgate you have 45th, 65th, 80th, Northgate streets are basically the only places you can get on I-5S if you want to go into the city.  Plus 522 feeds into I-5 in between 80th and 65th.  So these 5 spots serve all of NE Seattle, Lake City, Greenlake, Wallingford, UW, Northgate, etc.  So more people are going to travel to the city in the evening (sporting games, nightlife, etc) and I-5 before 45th is really the only option for those people to take to get across the water.  This means there is always more people getting on I-5 than getting off until after 45th.  So the 3 lanes possible fill up to capacity very fast, causing a chain slowdown from people merging from the on ramps.  This gets worse and worse on north. 

Now think about all the people that live north of Northgate that are also going to the city (or coming home from Boeing in Everett and other places).  North of Northgate I-5 is 4 lanes + HOV lane.  At Northgate, the HOV ends and becomes I-5 Express, but that's only in the morning, so you are losing one lane.  Then the far right lane turns into an Exit Only lane, so you go from 5 to 3 lanes just south of Northgate.  So that bottleneck starts the backup from there on north.  Most days this is where the traffic really starts to crawl.  However like today, there was both a really big demand on both sections of I-5 and that's why it was slow for 10+ miles.  Remember, this happened with NO ADVERSE WEATHER OR ACCIDENTS!.  Add a wreck into that mix and you have a 2h commute from Everett to Seattle...at 3pm.

Thursday I was headed to the financial district from Lynnwood at 5pm.  My gps told me to exit i-5 at shoreline, cross over to greenwood, take greenwood to holman then holman turns into 15th and take that all the way down to elliot and take that into downtown.  It said it was 15 min faster.  I'd love to see, just as an experiment, to keep the I-5 express open southbound only all day.  Would it alleviate the SB traffic more than hinder the NB?  Like, would it cut 20 min of SB traffic, but only add 10 min to the NB? 




 Better than rusting from the inside out. 




 Oregon uses the cinders from the volcanic areas around there.  Works really well for the cars, not so much for the roads.  But that's in combination with the studs and chains 




  G37 coupes have 330 horsepower, S or no S. IPL trim will have the 348 HP engine, but with negligible (.1) increase in 0-60 mph time at best, with most magazines quoting no increase in acceleration.

I said they are 333hp.  I'm sure being 3 off isn't that wrong.

 All the Infiniti G models are based on the FM platform. Maxima is based on the FWD platform, totally different cars. 

While I'm sure you are technically correct (the best kind).  There is definitely something similar between them.  If you look at the interior of a maxima, then the interior of the sedan, you can see why I say what it's based on.  I'm not saying it uses the same chassis, but when they designed it, they said, "that worked, lets go from there".  Same thing with the coupe and a Z.  The interiors are very similar, but with an added back seat.  I'll revise my statement to say they are "inspired" by them.

 he sedan is actually lighter than the coupe by 50? or so pounds, but sedan has a slightly softer suspension. Once tuned to the same suspension and using the same wheels as the coupe (for sedan, wheels are 17 or 18 inches, while for coupe, wheels are 18 or 19 inches), the sedan will be more sporty due to its lighter weight.

Just like the 330 vs 348 hp, 50lbs isn't going to make that much of a difference.  I have driven, in a track environment, a 350z and my G37s.  I have also put thousands of miles in a G35xS sedan and a few in a 370z.   I can tell you unequivocally that sport coupe is a FAR better drivers car, which is why I recommended it over the sedan.  The sedan is a decent performance car for sure, but I wouldn't call it a drivers car.  It has mainly to do with the transmission I'd bet.  I've not seen a sedan with the 6MT, let alone driven one.  I'd like to find one and go do some laps to see if I can tell the difference.

 As for the X looking off, here's a comparison of the post-refresh G37 coupes, journey and X. Tell me that you can tell a difference between them, other than the X on the back.

Yup, sure can.  It's the wheel well arches.  The way the X sits, it looks just ever so higher than the RWD because there is more gap in the wheel wells with the factory tires.  The stance of the RWD is just right, and the x looks like it has been lifted .5-1 in.   It might be more noticeable to me since I have seen my coupe every day for years. 




 The issue actually comes from the hospital's chargemaster.  It's an arbitrary list of all things that a hospital can do and how much that costs. 

THIS is where the insurance companies are starting the negotiations from.  Hospitals know this, and have been artificially inflating the prices of everything so that they get what they want from the insurance companies.  Kind of like a store marking up products a bunch just to then say, "EVERYTHING 30% OFF!!, WHAT A DEAL! FEEL FORTUNATE THAT YOU ARE GETTING SUCH A GOOD PRICE".  

This is where the hospitals claim that they are taking big losses from Medicare/Medicaid.  Because Medicare/Medicaid is paying what things SHOULD cost based on tons of research.  When the govt. is paying only 20% of what the chargemaster says, the hospital claims that they are losing money on it.  It should read that they are losing PROFIT from it.  There is still a profit margin built in to Medicare/Medicaid, but it's not what hospitals are used to. 

This is how uninsured people get double screwed.  If you don't have insurance, then you are billed what ever the chargemaster price is for that service.  A price that is by design, way too high and never intended for anyone to actually pay.

 I couldn't bargain hunt even when I had plenty of time. 

I tweaked my knee and need minor surgery to fix it.  I didn't have insurance at the time (end of 2013).  So I went in to get a diagnostic to tell me what was needed to get it fixed.  The doctor told me what he needed to do and how to schedule it.

When I went to the station to schedule it I wanted to know how much it was going to cost.  She couldn't tell me.  She said it's going to be these 3 billing codes, plus the doctor fee, plus the anesthesiologist fee, plus the facility charge.  She had no idea, even to ball park, how much those fees would be.

I called all around and never got a straight answer about how much it was going to be.

Unless you have menu-like prices that are are easily accessed and transparent, then it's not a free market. 

All medical bills should come in a form of a "not to exceed" quote BEFORE anything happens.  That would make it more open to a "free market"  




 Even those classified as non-profit, still make tons of profit.

You should read [The Bitter Pill](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t rct=j q= esrc=s source=web cd=1 ved=0CB8QFjAA url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.uta.edu%2Ffaculty%2Fstory%2F2311%2FMisc%2F2013%2C2%2C26%2CMedicalCostsDemandAndGreed.pdf ei=Kmp2Ve2RFIfqoAS01KHABA usg=AFQjCNFxCmH0gVmFVmQWkQNWZgcfsR1jYA sig2=d6dq0-ijHYCe1CbqzRdZEw) a 42 page article that really addresses the problems with Healthcare in its current state. 




 There's even a little distortion on cash's version too. Not a whole lot, but you can tell it's there. 




 It's all about what you want in a car.  Are you looking for a proper drivers car?  Get an 08+ G37S coupe 6MT.  It's 333 hp, handles like a 370Z and has options for all the luxury items (nav, backup camera, etc).

If you want a more family frendly practical car, you can get the sedan.  It's based more on the Maxima than the Z, so it doesn't handle as well, but it has a much larger trunk, 4 doors and more room in the cabin.  Same features are available on it as the coupe.

If you live where it snows, then you can get the X models of either, the only major issue for me is there is no manual transmission available with the AWD models.  On the coupes, the X looks....off.  Something about it just doesn't seem to look as good as the RWD ones.  I can spot an X a mile away. 




 I like the blue oyster cult cover via iPad a bit better.  Needs more cowbell.

 They are totally different songs even though it's the same lyrics and notes.

Trent was angst and despair.  Cash was sad and melancholy. 




 See my other response. I might have been a test store, but I interviewed people only after they had passed the test. 




 I went north to Lynnwood.  Brand new houses being built all over.  More shopping, more parking (free most of the time), all pretty close.  Down side is less trendy places (might be a good thing?), more commute times.  But it doesn't mean you can't go to Ballard, or Cap hill for a night out.  You won't do it as often, but it'll feel like a treat each time you do. 




 Barry/Jill = Top 10% earners, value time more than money.

Buzz = younger people that liked new tech (there were several variances)

Charlie/Helen = Empty nesters, not very techy, want a trusted source for help and advice.

Ray/Maria = Middle america, family time is most important, most likely to finance things.

This is still in my brain 10 years after I learned it.

 




 Yeah, well, it was a little different for the Mobile Managers. They were the only hourly "Manager"  We had similar responsibilities, except I didn't have keys to the store.  My $21/hr + (up to) 40% bonuses was $29.40/hr.  I was hitting bonuses most of the time, so I ended up around $55k/yr.  

The proper managers were salaried employees.  As such, they were scheduled for 11/hrs a day with 1 hour for lunch, so 50 hours a week.  When the holidays came around, they had to work 60 hours a week.  When you take their salary (around $60k) and divide it by the number of hours worked, it was around $22/hr.  These managers had bonusing potential, but in my particular store, it never happened.  It was based on the overall store numbers instead of just one department (like I did). 




 Everytime I've had a RAID 0 system on my computer, it has always ended in tears losing the array for one hardware/firmware issue after another. 

I just went with the WD Raptor line until SSD's were relatively affordable. 

FACE is a marvel of software design and was developed by primarily one guy.   I'm not sure how much he got paid, but it pales in comparison to how much he could have sold that on the open market. 




 Man, I HATED AJU when it was first rolled out.  My connection numbers were dismal.  I would fix it myself faster and better than they could.  90% of the time it was technology issues.  The AJU people were capable enough, but they would lose connections constantly and it would get stuck for a day/night and the next morning we'd have to fix it ourselves anyway.  AJU murdered my turn time. 




 It might have only been a short lived thing.  The DA's definitely had to take a test, but I hired a few people in my days as a supervisor (2006-2008).  All of them had to pass the test before I interviewed them for a CIA spot.  It was implemented a year or so after I was hired.  Maybe it never took, and I was a test store. 




 I was classified as a Barry-5 back in the day. I'm still a "My Best Buy Premier elite" member.

I knew the in's and outs of the PSP and presented to the management the situation and the solution, so they just approved it. 




 GS sup from 2005-2008.  Slowest computer?  I think it was a PII 450mhz.  I just sold him a new computer and transferred the little data he wanted. :

There were always hardware failures that we couldn't "Fix" because we couldn't/didn't have the parts to replace.  Most of the time if it got to that point, the labor was almost the cost of a new computer, so we just sold a new computer then.

I was lucky that at that time, there was me and one other guy with tons of experience with computers in our department.  This was before they had centralized computer repair facilities or internet based repairs.  If I couldn't figure out the issue, he could.  If he couldn't fix it, I could.  We taught the rest of the crew as best we could, but we couldn't teach things they never saw before until it was presented to them.  Not a lot of substitution for experience in the tech world.  Especially when you are dealing with the massive variability in customers computers.

Now-a-days, everything is just a google away.  But pre Vista, knowing DOS commands and how to mount OS' from CD to clean up system file hijacking processes weren't taught to GS, you had to know. 




 I'm sure it would make a good youtube "prank" vid. 




 right..that's why I said pseudo.  It wasn't any CompTIA thing at all, but since I took both, they were similar. 




 That's standard for any software developer.  It's a legal thing.  I've seen threads around here that explain it more than I'm willing to right now. 




 They do that for all employees now?  They used to only have that for BBYM staff.  




 I was the Geek Squad Supervisor going for the Assistant Manager spot when season 1 aired. It was oddly similar to my life at the time...minus the hot chick and spy email that downloads things to my brain. 




 If you expect that something is overpriced and you can wait and get a better deal elsewhere, do it.  No one is forcing you to buy it.  They are just presenting you with the option for instant gratification. 




 Yeah, I made an Ultimate Boot CD for us at our own precinct.  




 I was basically Chuck when Chuck first aired, minus the email.

I was the supervisor of Geek Squad, going for an Assistant Manager position. 

Oddly accurate at that time of my life.

So... question 1: no

q2: nope, I wanted to get to management and be the district services manager.

Q3: yes, they always have

Q4: what a geek would normally do.  Video games, movies, avoid social interactions, etc. 




 You don't need much as far as proper schooling goes.  You used to have to pass a pseudo A+ test to qualify.  




 man, I was SOOO bummed when the Caturday thread go autodeleted because no one posted there for 14 days. 

OT was the best section 




 Anyone that knows how to get a linux box up and running wouldn't have to bring it to Geek Squad.

The only time I worked on one in the 2.5 years I was in that department was when my step-brother bought a $100 laptop that had Red Hat installed and couldn't figure out how to work it. 




 You are basically paying a deductible, similar to any insurance sold anywhere else.  It's shitty, but if you didn't know what you are doing, $150 deductible + monthly  charge is usually better than a $500-$600 for a brand new phone. 




 I actually got my supervisor spot because of that very thing back in 2006.  Data privacy wasn't as strict as it is now.  The supervisor at the time was caught by a female returns employee going through a computer and had opened up some porn on the computer.  This lead to an investigation where he had transferred some files of a customer to a personal flash drive.

There were several other stories from other stores around the country that got to the media and that's when they started implementing all the super strict data protection policies.  




 Turn over is an issue with all retail employees.  They don't pay amazing when you are just a sales guy, but if you can get into middle management, then it's a decent living.  Getting there is tough though.  Most of the sales staff are kids going to school or didn't finish school so this is the best job they can get.  Once out of college, they go and get a real job.

As far as the sales staff, they have online based training that they have to go through.  However, it's mostly process based (how to clock in, how to order something for a customer, how to run the register) then they get a separate section of training that is specific to their department.  It's not updated as often as the technology changes, so keeping up with the new things that come in, why they are good, and who would benefit from them is learned day to day from other, more experienced people.  The really good sales people have a passion for the stuff they are selling and have done the research on their own time before it shows up and are excited to see it/play with it.

You must have talked with the former instead of the latter. 




 "Overpriced and unnecessary services" to you perhaps.

The price of the complete solution in one stop is worth more than scrounging around the internet looking for the best deal on whatever it is I want.  You don't sell out of your own pocket.  If I came in to buy an entire home theater, you best sell me everything I need so I don't have to come back or worry about the installation.

The services are even more valuable to those without the skill set to do it themselves.  I've purchased around $50000 worth of stuff from Best Buy in the last 10 years and I'll get the service plans on the big items, especially the damage (ADH) ones.  I've only not used it about 20% of the time.  80% of the time I've utilized the PSP/ADH and got my money's worth at least and came out ahead more often than not.  




 In 2005-2008 they had the "Advanced Diagnostic and Repair".  It was $199.  EVERY computer that wouldn't turn on or we couldn't figure out/fix in 5 min was sold this.  If it didn't make it past the initial diagnostics (like bad HDD), the $199 was refunded/applied to a new computer - the $59 diagnostic.  

They measured how many ADRs, diags, hardware installs along with your average turn around time.  You wanted high ADRs, low diags and low turn time.

PSP's weren't really measured at GS directly because if you were in the computer section, you were absolutely supposed to offer them, but it went to the computer dept numbers. 




 Yeah, MRI 5.0+ had FACE. 




 I was an agent right when Geek Squad was integrated with Best Buy in 2005.  It was silly how much freeware we used to remove viruses. 

When FACE (Facilitate Accuracy, Consistency, and Efficiency)  was rolled out, I was really impressed with the software. We called it Forget About Computer Expertise because it was designed for a monkey to pop in a cd, boot up and hit a few buttons and walk away.   




 The starting pay depends on your area.  Best Buy has pay grades assigned to every position and a national average range for each grade.  A Geek Squad counter agent was grade 5.  Then it factors to your location.  Bend, OR was +10% of average.  Lynnwood, Wa was +25% (the highest possible).  So if the grade 5 position was $11/hr average, then the WA store would start at $13.75.

I started at $13.50 because I asked for $15 back in 2005.  I got to $21 + bonuses (ended up ~$55k/yr) when I was a BBYM manager.  So it wasn't terrible money, but it didn't make me rich. 




 I started full-time at $13.50 and was up to $18 before moving departments. So it wasn't bad, but I wasn't rolling in dough. 




 ---former Geek Squad Supervisor (2006-2010).  You used to have to pass a pseudo-A+ exam to be an agent in the stores.  A harder one for the in home guy.  




 Got those two chronologically mixed up. 




 Wasn't that his big break out role? 




 I had a guy that was training me at Geek Squad.  We were opening a new store so the Senior tech from the closest city came in to train all of us.  There were like 6 of us.

For 2 days he had been showing us where the customer file folders were going for each stage of repair and record keeping.  Since Geek Squad takes a page out of NASA, the folders were called dossiers. 

For 2 days he kept saying, "You take the customer's paperwork, and you put it in the dozer."  Remember, he was the top guy at this other store, so I'm not sure how long he'd worked there, with who knows how many other people.  No one had corrected him.   I finally had to stop and correct him when I couldn't take it any more.

Dossier = DOS-e-a 




 So, he's just cosplaying himself since he was the voice of that character in the 2nd one? 




 It depends on how you wash them.  If you pour liquid detergent directly on them while in an older, non front loading unit, then you will see "stains" of glowing sections of where you poured it.  If you use liquid soap on a modern unit, all the jeans will glow just a little bit.  I don't think it works with powdered soap.

I remember going to a club after just washing my jeans in the old style washer and it looked like I had a massive cum stain all down the front of my pants under the black light.  Never poured the soap in last again.

Can't wait until all commuter traffic are these things and I can have my sports car to have fun in without being worried someone will plow into it. 









 Very similar to mine, but in a sedan. 




 There was some strategic driving.  I was going closer to 80 when I saw it. I was trying to avoid it all together, but there was a good deal of luck to contact how it did 




 I had 2 10" Boston G2 subs in a standard square box from my previous car, along with a 1000w @ 1 ohm mono block amp.

I paid them $800 for the enclosure + installation of sub and the installation of the amp. Since these are dual voice coil subs, they are wired @ 2 ohm so the amp is at 500w now (still plenty).

In my '08 coupe with the Bose system, I'm not sure 100% sure there even was a sub to remove.  It's not there now if it was.  




 I think it's illegal as well. 




 I hit a deer at 50mph in a 350z.  It was my step dads.  I thought I had tons of damage, but it seemed to drive fine, so I kept going.  Didn't stop to evaluate anything and I could see in the rear view that the deer was totally dead.

When I got to my friends house, I thought he was messing with me when he said, "I thought you said you hit something?".  I get out.  The only damage was a missing sideview mirror, a smashed corner of the windshield, and a scrape on the passenger window.  That's it.

I had managed to time it just so that he jumped, stuck his neck out and his head (it had small horns) hit the window and his neck hit the A pillar. That spun him around taking out the mirror and a hoof caught the window just barely.  It was only a few hundred is repairs. 




 Here's the post I did about it after I got it. http://www.reddit.com/r/infiniti/comments/2p272t/stillen_catback_exhaust_first_impressions/

Now after having it 5 months, it hasn't seemed to "break in" at all. Still sounds the same.  There is still no drone, however I've heard that the 7AT will have a drone to it at hwy speeds, so be ready for that since you can't get a manual and AWD in the same car (which is lame)
 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw41sSRZ4mU this is my comparison from stock to the Stillen exhaust that I got.  After literally years of going over exhaust choices, I'm glad I got this one. 




 OEM...like Original Equipment?  The one the car has?  I don't understand the question. 




 I took mine to a shop and they did [this](http://i.imgur.com/NU2dsRZ.jpg)

It still has the factory everything and the amp for this is under the spare panel on the opposite side of the sub.  This worked well because the optimum space for that 10" is .5 cu ft.  So they fiberglassed it to fit the little nook behind the wheel well arch which was just about that space.  

It looks like it came from the factory and still have use of my trunk.  It sounds really good. Not over bearing. 

Since you have the sedan, you have a lot more room to work with, but if you still want use of the trunk, this might be a good starting point.

I like what the Nest, etc. wifi cameras have to offer, but there are some big drawbacks that I don't want to deal with.

what I want is:

* Outdoor camera w/ 2 way audio ( it'll be placed under an overhang of a house, so only cold would be an issue.  I doubt it'll ever get directly wet.)
* Selective motion alerts
* **LOCAL** storage to my computer, no cloud or subscription fees
* remote access, view and control via mobile OS and web
* wifi setup and communication with my home network (to store the data on my computer).

From what I've seen, [this](http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-SmartCam-Outdoor-SNH-E6440BN-Camera/dp/B00P1NAPPQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics ie=UTF8 qid=1436402372 sr=1-1) is the closest thing I can find, but it only has a 32GB capacity (some say it can go to a 64GB) and I'm not sure how it works for accessing the data remotely or how you archive the data without removing the SD card.  The reviews are hit and miss as well.

Any suggestions? 




 it's all a matter of perspective.  Living in Bend for 25 years, it was always a small town.  The big city was Portland. 




 It's all frame of reference.  I lived in Central oregon from 1990-2001 and 2003-2014 with Portland in the middle, I just recently moved to the Seattle area. 




 From my point of view if takes you less than 10-15min to drive across town, it's a small town 




 Those little one building villages I don't consider a town.  Grass valley, Shaniko, Brothers etc...

Metropolis=  250k. City=  100k.  Town=  50k.  Village=  5k. 




 Coming from the next town over that is 4x larger, it's small.  Bend is the biggest town for 100 miles in any direction, and its just under 100k people.

However, living is Seattle, it's a tiny, tiny town 




 I'm shocked that there are so many people that get the S without the 6MT.  

Looks great though.  You'll enjoy it.  There isn't another car I would have for the money than the one I have 




 And into two others. http://www.ktvz.com/news/highway-97-in-redmond-reopens-after-injury-crash/33452188 




 This was in a small town in Central Oregon.  The person driving woke up from a coma the next day. The passenger survived as well.

The truck smashed into this and 2 other cars.  So while the meme has merit in its message, this particular case it's the trucks fault.

 I bought mine from vzw and I'm in this same issue.  I have 47e 




 Depends... When she was in True Lies? Or in Bring it on? 




 I had no idea the little girl in the shitty lost in space movie grew up to be that hot ass woman in not another teen movie.

Almost like Eliza Dushku in True Lies then in Bring it on 




 One got replaced in later seasons, so it's THREE other hot chicks.  Woo! Party 




 You can never go wrong with a Tennis player.  90% of the ones from 1990+ would be acceptable. 




 Mallrats.  Hell yeah. 




 well...after the 4th season of That 70's show anyway.  She was 14 when she was cast.  She lied and said she was 18. 




 She went to my high school for part of one year while she filmed a failed TV show called McKenna.  This was before Party of Five.  She acted like any other girl at the school except every boy at the school said they hooked up with her in one fashion or another.  None of them were telling the truth, but still. 




 It was based on a republican system, but it's hardly perfect.  Now that everyone can get insurance, we need to tackle the actual cost of health care 




 Yeah it just gave insurance companies more customers.  




 It's a start.  It gave the insurance companies way more customers.  But the real problem is the health care costs like you said.  

I'm self employed and my wife is going through a year long software boot camp.  We'll have to spend about $5000 a year or more on health care to make it work out to break even.  We won't even come close to that unless a major accident occurs. 




 The whole book is good 




 They are both great, we'll see how it plays out with the remaster coming out.  The iconic thing about 7 was the cut scenes 




 not sure about the W and Y being only for supercars...unless my Infiniti is a supercar.  I have a 98Y rating on mine. 




 looks like Z rated tires is all you'll need then. 




 They have an ODBII reader that you can get from the big companies.  I'm not sure what it tracks, but it COULD track speed, acceleration, deceleration, basically anything your car's CPU can track.

They would have a detailed picture of how you drive. 




 Well, you kinda contradicted yourself.  your tires are rated for 149+ mph.  160 mph is 149+. 




 you mentioned it in the last sentence.  The circuit is looking for the proper resistance (ohms) to check if the factory light is working properly, hence you have to add a RESISTOR.   




 Mine was DOA.  I just got spare out and it worked  fine. 




 But you won't know that until you talk to them 




 That's the initial D AE86.  

 




 While technically correct, it doesn't seem to accurately portray the source of where people are coming from.  Asia is a big place, but a person from Japan and a person from Pakistan are very different people.  




 Not a column for Indians (not native Americans)?  I thought it was Asian and Indian as the 2 largest minorities here.   




 You should be in the ball park price wise.  You might have to look around for one that has the right options that you want ( took me 2 years to find the perfect one).

Maintainence is very basic.  Change the fluids regularly and check the filters, replacing as needed.  You are good for 150k+ miles easily.

Sure, if something DOES go wrong it's spendier than an old Chevy to fix, but it would be few and far between when it happens.

Consumer reports said the g35 was one of the best cars you can buy overall.

Only the top end Lexus sedan and the Tesla Model S were rated higher 




 [OK, who brought the cougar?](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/ghostbusters/images/7/78/GB1film1999chapter18sc011.png/revision/latest?cb=20111218104117) 




 You won't wear out a transmission unless you are an idiot.  Look into rev matching and heel-toe to make it even easier on the drive train 




 Doesn't Verizon own AOL now? 




 I have 67000 miles on my car.  The brakes have never been replaced.  They are still in good shape as well.  It's how you drive that determines the life of your brakes. 

I don't drive slow.  I've even gone to a track day or two.  With proper use of the transmission, you don't need your brakes for much.   




 Unless you have a super charger, you should be in the mid teens at the worst.  You might want to have it looked at 




 I was on a race track for 8 hours and got 9 mpg.  Wtf are you doing? Flooring it everywhere until red line in each gear then brake hard for stop signs?  Do you live in the middle of nowhere so there is room to do that? 




 I don't think any substantial gains are going to be had that are worth doing.

Any standard hypermileing techniques will improve the mpg.  

These cars don't have the worst mpg out there, but they are pretty good for the hp that we have.  

Forbes did a list of the top 10 fast and frugal cars back in 2012.  Both the 370z and the g37 made the list.  The top 3 were the Porsche 911, boxer, and Cayman

 The music numbers are some of my favorite scenes over the years 




 Intrinsically nothing.  They created demand for something that was just a rock.  That's just good marketing.  Think the Pet Rock of the 70's.  Zero aftermarket value.

This person that found the diamond would still have to have it cut and polished to be set in commercial jewelry.  Until that time, it'll be worth next to nothing to most people.

 




 "Have you seen my bear, Tibbers?" 




 Nothing.

Diamonds have 0 intrinsic value.   There is no such thing as a used diamond.

The DeBeers company made a huge ad campaign a while back to make people think that they are rare and worth a lot of money.

They aren't rare, the supply (and therefore price) of them is controlled by one company.

Think of how many jewelry stores there are in the world.  When is the last time you saw one say, "sorry we're out of diamonds today because they are hard to come by and we didn't get any" 




 Anyone with an actual agreement with them is banned from discussing the details of it, so this thread will all be guessing 




 no clue. I just regurgitate stuff i hear.  

My wife is the biochemist. 




 I'm pretty sure Fluoroantimonic Acid is used in the Semi conductor industry  




 You aren't a majority shareholder, so you are only an expense that is negativity impacting their bottom line.  You are also a dime a dozen, so if you don't like it, they will find someone to replace you.

Going public is the worst thing a company can do.  As soon as that happens, it's all about how to make more today than you did 3 months ago so you keep the shareholders happy and your stock price goes up.  Employees and customers are a distant priority behind meeting sales expectations 




 That makes more sense 




 Nope.  Amazing forehand, pretty good backhand.  Excellent hands at the net.

My problem?  I wouldn't do more than 2 of these amazing shots in a row.

I was terribly inconsistent 




 "Andy Roddick has many 225km/h (140mph) or faster serves on his record but only his personal best of 249km/h (155mph) is included."

Like I said, there are a few that can do it consistently.  

This would mean that is one of the top 30 players ever, not top 30 serves ever 




 Three points? I don't think so.  3 games, maybe. 




 Pretty sure they've seen quite a few that are faster.  Roddick was in the 150's a more than a few occasions.  

I think there are several pros in the top 200 that can do 143 consistently. 




 I have a 100mph serve, but barely made varsity.   




 The silenced .50 cal sniper rifle does 1 shot kills to the head of the heavy troopers.  With the high powered scope, I could clear most of not all the camps without setting foot in them 




 Thank you Marla 




 I read on here that a guy got some burn in because he Reddited you much.  I don't think you'll have an issue unless you have the screen on for hours on end that's not a full screen video 




 They aren't falling, but it's less expensive.  There are a lot of good, high paying jobs available here, so it's a good place to live even in the suburbs 




 That's why I said suburbs.  




 Seattle is still building, especially in the suburbs 




 I was saying that if you go to spa, it might favor the higher hp P1.

I wasn't saying go to an oval 




 It was a good report.  However the conclusion was that the track was more suited to the awd setup.  I'm sure there would be a different result on a different track. 

They were so close it's splitting hairs 




 No idea on that.  I had the dealership do it all 




 You can get a back up camera and nav.  Mine has it.

I've only got 9 mpg on a race track. 




 I've heard it's systemic, so I'd have it checked to be safe.  It's plastic, so you could be proactive and have it replaced with a metal one before it fails 




 haven't tried to get the scratches out.  It's been detailed a few times, but that's a hard spot to get a buffer to.

there is no slave cylinder on an AT, so dont' worry about that.

Fuel milage is ok, not amazing but not horrific. It's a good hp/mpg ratio.

It's been the best car I've ever had. 




 I still call the stuff they sell "Hate Chicken" 

I've never been there, and they will never see a penny from me.

However, if someone bought an extra one and offered it too me, I'd eat it. 




 My car has the same scratches in the same spot.  Its from fingernails and other stuff that's on my hands.  

I bought [this](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B009OBCAW2?psc=1 redirect=true ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00) and took a DC - USB power port next to the RCA inputs and connected them with a 3.5mm - RCA cable (I think it might have come with some, but I already had it).   It's 2x as loud as just the cable direct to the ports from my phone.  I had to turn up the car volume and the phone volume to the max to get good driving levels.  Now it's too loud at 50% car. 

You can probably get the curbed wheel repaired for less than $300

The only problem I've ever had was the slave cylinder failed at about 55k miles.  Normally that isn't too big of a deal, but it took out the master cylinder, the clutch and the flywheel with it.  So it was like a $4k repair.

Get that checked if it's a MT because apparently it's a known issue, but they won't do a recall on it, and WILL NOT cover the failure out of warranty.  




 LiDAR and RADAR are both used by police and are picked up by good detectors.  Same principles apply.  If there is no signal to detect, it can't alert you.  If you are the only car in the lane, and a cop just powers in on briefly and only at you, the detector will go off, but it's too late. 

The false positives of detectors have gone down over the years, but it's not 100% fool proof. 




 meh, in the city, it's probably 6 of one 1/2 dozen of the other.  The detectors can pick up false signals, and if the cop doesn't hold the laser on, you can detect it until he pops you.  By then it's too late.

Same goes for the app.  Someone has to see the trap being setup and use the app enough to report it.  I get a lot of false positives on there.  I wonder if cops report themselves then move on just to slow down the people using Waze. 




 Yeah, they are CCD detectors which can read a 785 laser uncooled, but their sensitivity aren't as good. 




 Yeah, that's why I didn't mention the lasers themselves. the detectors and the batteries to power them need to catch up 




 I sell something that was invented in the late 90's that touted itself as a tricoder.  They got a cease and desist letter from CBS 




 532 is a really sensitive wavelength.  I deal with 1064 a lot, and it's 16x weaker. 




 When battery tech and cooled detector tech gets small enough.

Lasers suck up a good deal of power in most scientific applications.  Detectors in NIR and RAMAN spectroscopy usually need to be cooled to get the best sensitivity to get lower levels of detection.

 I thought those wraps are reserved for only stacks of ones.  Each denomination had a different color and they were x*100 in value. 




 I've seen 40% methanol in samples pulled from bottles.  It's lethal. 




 About 4-5 lbs.  www.rigakuraman.com  Yeah, they have distributors world wide. 




 Lynnwood just has the big blue bin 




 My guess is the metal substrate makes the first layer stick really well to the reflective surface, then it just piles on.  The plastic bumper is smoother so harder to start the first layer. 

That and the voids you see are the grill.  The radiator could be just as bad 




 Why are there so many bugs?  Big still lake right next to the highway that you drive on and it gets pretty warm in the summer.  Good breeding grounds for them.  I've driven this same road.  It's nasty 




 They might not spike it with anything, they just don't remove the methanol.  

I sell portable equipment that can tell the difference between legit and counterfeit alcohol (and lots of other things).  I've seen an application method explicitly for this purpose and location 




 It took months to find a used car for my wife.  We had the make and model picked out, but it couldn't be black, white, or grey/silver.  We'd have taken red, blue, orange, yellow, etc.  Finally found an orange one.  Looks great next to my bright blue car.   




 Rooting is very simple and you won't be able to edit the build.prop otherwise.  Might be worth looking into how to do it

Most of our cities are just terrible about implementing any kind of real permanent solution.

I was in Munich, but staying out at the airport,  for Oktoberfest.  Didn't set foot in a car the entire time I was there. 




 It's been awhile since I've gone in there, I knew it was up there.  I don't know if I've ever noticed a UHD stream even when I have a 100mb/s connection. 




 The lowest I've ever got was 15.5, but that was flooring it all over town.  

The best was 28, but it was 100% cruise control for 400+ miles.

I'm usually ~21 with mix of interstate and city. 




 Number 4 and #13 contradict each other.  




 Just finished sophomore year of high school.  So that meant biking to downtown to get some ice cream or sodas at the local sweet shop. 




 Normal business...maybe.  

Retail? nope.  

If people have more free time, then they will be wanting to go out and do things more, so that sector will need to be more available to the new times people have. 




 At the highest speeds, Netflix is 2gb / hr.  You can, however, go into your account settings and cap the Fidelity/throughput so that it doesn't go the best possible, saving some data.

 They write off the difference as a "loss".  Do their tax bill is lower 




 You call them when you arrive and only then do they bring your car around and warm it up.

I was supposed to get in at 10pm, but didn't get in until 4am, same service. 




 It's about $25 a day to park AT Sea-Tac now.  But there are park and ride places that are much cheaper and shuttle you to the airport.  When you get back, they have your car warmed up and waiting.  not a bad gig. 




 I thought the industrial area south of downtown was "South Downtown" or "SODO"?

Wallingford, Phinney ridge, Greenlake, Freemont are usually referred to as themselves, so I'm not sure why they would even try to group them together? 




 This is exactly how I ran into him too.  I was there in 2013 when they announced the PS4 and XB1, so it was a hell of a year to go. http://i.imgur.com/pDhUYw4.jpg 




 There is (or was) a contest where if you could prove a cable was better than the coat hanger, they would give a bunch of money.  AFAIK, no one has collected. 




 I'm too lazy to learn to not kill myself with one of those, plus I'll spend about $3.50/cart and each cart will last a month or more.  I don't shave daily. 




 leasing?  You always have a new car every three years and it's cheaper than new car payment.  Downside is you never own anything and can't really mod it.

 When the CEOs priority is making more money this 3 months than last 3 months, and they won't be there in 5 years, they won't care about no one being able to buy things then 




 sociopathic would be a better fit. "a person with a personality disorder manifesting itself in extreme antisocial attitudes and behavior and a lack of conscience." 




 That was the point.  He played a sociopath.  No conscience, just do what you want to do.  

If you look closely, every time you see his bed at his apartment, it looks as if it's never been touched, only there for decoration.

He never sleeps.  He looks up stuff all day on the internet for things he's interested in, and then out all night looking for things to film. 

I thought it was pretty subtle and clever way of showing how abnormal he was beyond the actual character.  




 Mine is about the same, except I run the Michelin Super Sports.

I'll get 30-40k miles on them and when I went to the track, I was able to get them so sticky that I was picking up chunks of rubber from other cars and they would be melted to the tire.  I was passing Porsche's, SRT8's, RX-8's and even a Z06.

Worth every penny. 




 I did that last year, but still paid near double for just one day.

 




 "injury or disease/disability" -- they wouldn't choose this. Nobody chooses to be disabled.

 "Is it so strange to then consider those agreements as decisions made by two people, not just one?"   You work, I stay home.  We both agree to this.  However, it's implied that if we get divorced, your mutual agreement with this arrangement means that I won't have much in the way of making money on my own, so as long as I'm are ok with that. Deal.

 




 I understand the argument when kids are involved, kids cost a retarded amount of money in child care otherwise.  

But I'm still talking strictly about divorces where you have to pay for your lay about spouse to do nothing. 




 I'll seconds this.   




 Give me three reasons that a person, without kids, would choose to stay home and "incur the risk of never being financially solvent again if I ever decide to leave you".

In today's world, there is no reason a person NEEDS to be a stay-at-home [whatever].  They choose to.  They can get a job like everyone else, or don't get divorced.

 




 I never mentioned kids were involved did I.  Just talking about the marriage in general.  I think someone might be projecting a little.   If you can't afford kids, don't have them.

 




 I'm sure replacing it with [this](http://www.zspeedperformance.com/ZSpeed-HD-Concentric-Replacement-Clutch-Slave-Cylinder-CSC-zsp2006.htm) will be way cheaper than what I had to go through. 

This part was recommended to me by the guys at stillen. 




 but then where would those people park? 




 I had my slave cylinder fail taking with it the master cylinder, clutch, and flywheel. 

So now that that's all replaced with upgraded parts, the only issue I seem to have is if I go from 4th to 6th, it'll grind 1/2 the time.  So I just have to shift to 5th then 6th quickly.

The business seems to be leaning towards contract employers such as Lancaster that is basically a express personnel but for scientists.  They pay 40% less than the company you physically work at and that place doesn't have to worry about payroll, hr, etc.

The business is also cyclical where it goes well for a few years then lay offs galore.

 Even if you got a newer version of the same car that would be probably 10k more.  

However, if you drove your car until it breaks irreparably and invest that same 10k over that same time frame (I'd guess 5-10 more years at minimum) you would have a lot more money than you do now. 

Cars are very bad investments.  So it's up to you how you spend your money

 While true, a head to head battle might lean toward Magneto.  

Think about the guiding aspect.  

Gandalf would know that he may face Magneto in some fashion in the future, as such, he could make it so that Magneto never existed in the first place by having the Nazi's kill him as a child before he even developed his powers.

 Gandalf isn't just a run of the mill Wizard, he's a low level angel.  Hence why he can stand up and win against the Balrog (another low level angel)

 I worked at a movie theater when these 2 were released.  We closed up on Thursday and then we screened both wild wild west THEN south park.  Left the theater around 6am still laughing our asses off and amazed at what we had just watched.

We went from a silly, almost stupid western (I enjoyed it, but it's just like...meh and this before steam punk was really even a thing) to the most brazen self parodied cartoon of all time.  We were fans of South Park, but we still weren't prepared for how over the top it was.

 1.5 MM (3/50^th of an inch) margin of error on that shot placement on the ball.  

That's some precision. 




 According to /u/ineedhelpoften 
If the rumors are true, I ACTUALLY respect Konami for shooting themselves in the foot.

Basically, Kojima violated workplace policy and fucked the model for The Quiet.

 




 Wow, all good pointers

* I've had people figure this out, but it's good to mention early
* I think I have a good handle on that
* This tends to happen naturally with this crowd (at least the ones I know.

* Yeah, this one I think will be the hardest part
* Might be good to do if it needs to be a shorter game.
* I think I'll start by having some of the more benign roles in there to get people aware of how this game works.

Does anyone know a list of premade roles for around that size of games outside the ones in the rule book?  I'd like some boiler plate setups and mod it from there. 




 I have a group of people that want me to come in and moderate a few games of Werewolf on Wednesday.

I needs some cool ideas for game setup/roles/etc, and also tricks for moderating such a large group of people 1/2 of which I don't know.  I've only done 10-15 people at most.

I would assume table/seating arrangements are key to keep an eye on who people are indicating at night so I don't get it wrong.  Also folded paper with their names written on them so I can write  their roles down if I randomly hand out the cards.

Let me know what role make ups would be good. I would assume that we would have 2-3 games total since we only have a 2 hour window set up for a surprise gaming/birthday lunch for one of the people.

I'm assuming 1/2 of them haven't played before so I'll need a not-to-complicated game to start, then add in more interesting cards/factions in the later games.

Looking forward to the suggestions (or where to find them) 




 Exactly right. Know what you want, know that you can get it, then JUST DO IT! 




 It's only superstitious if it doesn't work 




 Kinda.  As long as you know the pills will work, it usually will.

Attitude and perspective have healed people with seemingly terminal diagnosis and also killed those with survivable conditions.

Whether you think can or can't... You're right 




 Two things:

1. The richest person isn't the one who has the most, but needs the least.


2. It's only silly if it doesn't work.  I follow a modified version of this thinking and it has worked for me.  

The key is to **KNOW** that everything's going to work out.  It may not happen exactly as you planned, but everything works out.

I found the absolute perfect wife after the worst girlfriend.  I just pictured my perfect person for me, made a theoretical checklist in my head, and I KNEW she was out there.  My friends all chuckled and said "good luck with that".  6 months later we met and she added things to that list that I didn't think were possible, all in a small city.  Married 18 months later, 2 years since and this entire time we've never even had an argument.

We needed to move but wanted to buy a house in the new location.  Lots of hoops and paperwork later, we miraculously qualified for a loan and had the down payment all saved up in 3 months.  The bank wouldn't use my main income.  It's the perfect house with everything we wanted, because we KNEW that we would get it. 

The job she got that made us move and buy the house was getting shut down next year, a week after we got the keys to said house.  We KNEW that this wasn't a big deal.  We explored several options over the next 6 months.  None of those panned out.  Then a friend said to check out this free, women only, year long computer programming boot camp.  They only take 24 people, but it's worth a shot.  I read the qualification requirements and KNEW she would get in.  They had 900 people look at the program, 500 applied, 60 interviewed, and she was one of the 24 that got in. The jobs that this camp trains you for starts at 50% more that what she was getting with her biochemistry degree.

There are tons more examples that I could give that this kind of thinking works for me.  All these that I've mentioned have been in the last 3 years.

This could be a really long string of luck, but I've always seemed to get what I want.  I just know that I'll get it and it'll work out, eventually.  As such, I'm perfectly happy all the time.  What's to be mad about when you know everything will work out?  It's like a lite version of [ataraxia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataraxia)

I'm not say that nothing bad ever happens.  Shitty things happen all the time.  I've gotten sick, been hospitalized, needed surgery on a few occasions, but I knew I was going to be fine.  The difference is your perspective.  If you have a good outlook, even in the worst scenarios, things tend to work out eventually.

You also have to be proactive in doing the things you need to do to get what you want.  You can't just lie in bed and think about having buckets of money.  You do have to actually go out there and get it.  I could think about winning the lottery all day long, but I'll never win if I don't go out and buy a ticket.

In the end this can all be scientifically disproven and I've just been getting lucky over a long string of time, but this is the closest I'll ever come to any form of religion/theology.  Just like all religion, you shouldn't knock it if it's working for those that follow it and aren't hurting anyone else. 




 Until they make a proper dual clutch sequential transmission for these cars, it'll always feel that way to me 




 Nice, even lower miles than mine. Manual or AT? 




 It's my step brothers half brothers first app.  Not bad for not first app.  Thanks for checking it out though 




 If you want to brush up on what your fallacies are.

 If they have a 2nd line or alternate listed anyway 




 Just go to the carrier store and have them look up the esn.  They can call the owner and tell them which store it's at 




 This deal just keeps getting better all the time 




 Master blaster? 




 I never was into Pokemon...my brother in law recently took a high ranking finance job there, so I'm sure I can get all the poke things I would ever want, but still just...meh.  I was too old for it at the time.  But Final Fantasy 1, 5-15 are my jam

I got my brother one, and only one pack of booster cards back in the late 90's for his 10th birthday.  Apparently it had a "Charizard" in it...what ever that was. 




 http://puu.sh/iUXE4/d1b06a1338.jpg doesn't look like it. 

WHY WASN'T I NOTIFIED THAT THIS WAS HAPPENING!! 




 Depending on the places you are going, you can cache a section of the map in Google maps.   




 I think I found an amazon seller that sells the US versions for like $15-$20 more.  Still wont have a warranty, but it's better than double the price.

It's a real pain in the neck to sift through all the china dealers on Amazon and eBay.  




 one more thing on buying the cameras.

Everywhere I've looked, it's a bunch of asian stores selling on Amazon or eBay.

I've read that these guys sell "hacked" versions of the cameras with English menus.  You can tell by the instructions and packaging that it comes in.  There have been reports of these cameras having spyware or "phone home" abilities that compromises your network allowing people to get in that you don't want to.

Where do you get the official products in the US? 




 Ok, good info. Thanks.

Off to the internet to get parts and wiring in order. 




 Right on.

Thanks for all that.  One clarification though.

I have an older i7-920 that's overclocked that I don't really use much.  I'm sure that I can get this to be the dedicated NVR without issue.  What I'm wondering is can my main desktop that I use all day for work and gaming be used for the NVR without slowing it down.  It's a i7-4770k @4.4ghz with 16GB of ram, and 5+TB of storage available.

It'd be nice to just tab over to the security software and see the live feed when needed instead of going to the other computer. 




 You could say that Leeloo and the "darkness" were the hero and the villain.  They certainly never meet.

The rest of the characters are just helping one or the other. 




 Out on Blu-Ray finally if you haven't noticed 




 I think that is stronger yes.  Perhaps it's better for this application because it's shorter? 




 Could be Peter Dinklage incognito at sdcc 




 It's used in semiconductor industry.  There is all kinds of nasty stuff used there 




 Teflon is carbon and fluorine bonded together, which is the single strongest bond in organic chemistry 




 I'm with you on that.  Once autos (robot drivers) are commonplace, I hope getting a driver's licence is way harder and you have to demonstrate more than just basic vehicle operation and rules of the road.  That way the limits for humans would be raised or eliminated. 

Currently, just because you have a licence doesn't mean you know how to drive 




 I'm perfectly comfortable cruising at 100-110 or more in my car on a clear road.  I wish we had autobahn style interstates in the US.

 




 Sure thing.  What cameras do you have?  How much space do you use?  Is it a spare computer or just part of your main desktop?  How well does the motion tracking alert work?  Any trouble getting remote viewing/playback to work while away from the house?

I don't get good WiFi signal on the outside of the house where I would want to put the cameras, so I'd have to invest in another WiFi extender.  Or I could just get a poe switch and try to run cat5 to the locations as well.  

Trying to weigh the cost vs convenience of both options. 




 All but 10 years in the pnw.  To me, Redmond is a small town, but it's gotten a lot bigger in the 25 years of been around

There are seperated dual laned roads that go right through town with on ramps and off ramps that are are 45mph in my home town. It's ridiculous.  




 don't you mean /u/GiantBatFart 




 speed limits are far too low in far too many places,  both in UK and US
