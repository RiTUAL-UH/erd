 The piece seems choppy, a haiku and a collection or notes for a more serious piece. I can't tell whether it's lazy, both for the writer and short-attention span readers, or thoughtfully crafted and that may be a strength. The format forces you to tell the story and tell it quickly, and that may be a plus. Is it affecting and moving? Yes, so it works as a piece. It's an experimental art form that is unsatisfying but yet manages to hang around because of its short, descriptive images. But it is not the future of story telling. The writer has real talent; he took a distant memory and gave it real-time urgency.     




 Drivers will view this as D-Day in the War on Cars.  




 I wish there was a Italian section. I'm no expert, but my understanding was that one time there was a small Italian neighborhood in DC but it was displaced by highway construction. There were some Italian grocery stores, at least one was left, on Connecticut in Dupont, but gone now. Baltimore has an Italian section with great restaurants and bakeries, but I haven't been there for 10 years. ... being from Connecticut, it's one thing I miss. 

But the Vietnamese food in this area is exceptional. The Eden Center in Falls Church is great. (not Metro accessible and no help to your question)

 @kavorka2 
.. is right on the money. My unit doesn't have a front desk or elevator. My condo fee is $160. 

.. A place I once lived in that had a front desk, three elevators and a pool, had condo fees in the $400+ plus range.  




 Actually, that's a really great deal. I live in 356 SF condo studio, and this place is about 15 SF bigger. But it also has a backyard -- which is awesome. 

Considering the backyard, and the fact that you own your own place without condo fees, this strikes me as a very good price. 

A custom-designed murphy bed unit, will create the illusion of even more space and get rid of the kitchen-bed problem. 

Does it have a basement? Can you add to the rear of the house? Another 100 SF and you can almost claim one bedroom, and can you build another story?

This will sell quickly at $248.   




 In Connecticut, when I'm visiting relatives, there are many auctions that sell low-end stuff. I've picked up old photos, postcards, books, magazines, art prints for as little as $5-20. Furniture can range from $25 to $1,000 or more, but mostly lower. It's been a different story around here.  




 Iron Man isn't playing at the Smithsonian theaters, unfortunately. But once you do move here, keep an eye on its listings http://www.si.edu/Imax/Showtimes
Sometimes it shows first run movies on its Imax screens. Oblivion is playing, but it's at its theater in Chantilly.  




 It seems like the problem is the last-mile provision. If DC entered into a contract that prohibits it from competing with Verizon, cable and others, then this service is permanently crippled and under utilized. It's great that when I use Mount Pleasant Library or MLK, the wifi is running at 20 MBS plus, but it would be wonderful if DC created area-wide hotspots, especially in under served areas. Good piece by Washington City Paper. This issue needs a lot more light. 



 




 I don't know how hidden this is, but the courtyard in the Portrait Gallery is an incredible hangout spot. Lots of seats, free high-speed Net, and refreshments, quiet and peaceful and right in the middle of downtown.  Open till 7 p.m.  




 Related question: Does anyone know any good auctions that aren't high-end? (i.e., furniture costing $45K) The kind of auctions were you can find relatively inexpensive items? 









 I'm glad they are using Duct-tape gray. Let's keep the memories alive!

 This isn't just about Wal-Mart vs. small stores. It's about big stores, too. Safeway prices can be pretty high, and anything that puts pressure on that chain is really welcomed. 

There's a lot I don't like about Wal-Mart. It constantly shifts the hours of its employees (along with other retailers), and keeps them under the threshold for benefits. It doesn't want full-time workers. It wages and benefits are so awful some employees must turn to government assistance, so there's some cost-shifting going on here. 

But the savings on some its products are real. For fixed income people, being able to save a dollar on a loaf of bread is a tangible thing. They will shop there. 

 




 It's good to have a sense of humor as well  









 You're kidding me.  




 Reuters is reporting that some NGOs are blaming market demand for low priced clothing. Margins are so tight that manufacturers are cutting corners on safety: http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/25/bangladesh-building-idUSL6N0DC3N220130425

It's a fair point and something to think about, even if the source of this particular structural failure may be -- and I'm guessing here -- the fault of builders and/or inspectors.  




 I like the fact that the Vegas Lounge building has survived the apartment complex invasion on P at 14th, but the few interesting buildings remaining, it seems, are gradually being removed and replaced with higher density development. 

Separately, it's just astonishing to me the amount of development on 14th north and south of U. The entire street is gradually being turned into a glass wall of complexes.

I really miss the old antiques store on 14th. 

 




 I like the description, "yet another generic 8-floor development in DC." Generic is probably right. DC needs a Gaudi to infuse some dramatic into buildings that are just blending into one another.  




 Here's an approach that was recommended to us and it work for me: Go to a condo with a front desk and just ask if any of the units are available for rent. With luck, you may catch an availability before it is listed online or find someone who isn't trying all that hard to rent their place, or learn of someone who is about to have a vacancy. 

 




 But populating it with junk content will deter readers as well.

 This isn't a recommendation, just a report. I've been a member of Bally's now LA Fitness since 1998 at 20th and L. Pay about $20 a month, but new memberships are about $29.00. 

Plus: Plenty of weight machines, usually kept in good shape. Plenty of treadmills and there is almost never a wait to use them. Equipment seems well maintained.  

Lockers: Blah and ugly. Never quite as clean as you would like it. Most of the showers have limited water flow, but there's usually soap. They don't supply towels. 

If you don't mind the ambiance, it's not a bad value.
 




 It's like entering a jewelry store. You feel the hush. 

I didn't test the willingness of the clerks to let me play with the equipment. Some nice camera bags as well, although I didn't check them on price. 

The other day when I walked by it, I saw a customer standing just outside the door with someone who appeared to be a sales rep. He appeared to be testing out a telephoto lens. I saw that as a good sign for the store.  




 *Replacing* physical colleges? No. Augmenting? Yes.  




 Wow -- 

the programmer makes one direct and one indirect suggestion for combating this 

(1) have programmers from both parties review the source code 

(2) if election results vary significantly from exit polling data, that polling data may offer a clear reason to investigate election. 

Finally, these allegations deserve a major investigation by federal authorities and Congress.

 I live in Adams Morgan and parked off-street until I gave up the car. It wasn't easy and I could spend 20 minutes, routinely, driving around waiting for a space to open up. 

RPP fees would make no difference. Zero. Higher RPP fees is a nit in the calculation of whether you can live without a car. 

I gave up owning a car only because I didn't need it. Adams Morgan may be awful for parking, but it's well served by buses and the Metro lines aren't a bad walk. My job didn't require a commute mandating a car. 

But I know people who need a car to get to their place of work. If you need to jump on a bus, jump on the Metro, and then a bus again, that commute just won't work. A car is easier. 

For that matter, there are many neighborhoods in DC were bus service is not as regular as it is in close-in neighborhoods. I rarely have to wait more than 10 min for a bus. But some bus lines may not hit a stop for 30 min, 45 min or longer. 

All I can say about parking minimums is that ship has sailed. Many of the apartment complexes in Adams Morgan were built in a time when cars weren't an issue. My building only has a handful of spaces. I see no gain in demanding that newer buildings add more parking because my building was built with very little parking. 



 




 I lived in the Jefferson House for about 10 years. Only moved because owner was selling unit. I was on the top floor. Very quite. Never heard neighbors. Solid cement/brick building. Front desk was great for getting packages and the like. The building doesn't allow washer/driers in units but has laundry room. The pool is nice. Elevators are relatively new. Combination long-term residents and grad students, mostly. Never been inside the President. 

One thing regarding noise: If you have a unit in the rear, to the right (if you are standing in front of the building), the GW students in the townhouses below and sometimes in the student housing (former hotel building) at K, sometimes hold very loud and noisy parties until 2-3 a.m. Generally, this noise never bothered me, but it could be more of an issue on lower floors. 




 You can contribute to the museum by taking out a membership. It comes with a great magazine and 10% off purchases. They also have donation boxes near entrances.  




 I'll endorse that. The NPG is a gem -- and it's open to until 7 p.m. 

It's courtyard is awesome. Here, in the middle of a very busy area, is a wonderful place to sit. Free WiFi, too. I think the speeds are around 20 mps. 

 




 DC is top tourist attraction. It would not surprise me if some people cross DC off the their list of vacation possibilities because they'll read this stuff and say "the Smithsonian is closed!" -- 

If this leads to lost tourist dollars, that will really hurt.  









 It's obviously not spam. I live in DC. I read local blogs. I don't contribute to Reddit but thought I'd give it a try. But look at her blog. It's real and authentic and its about DC. If you are moderator and you have access to email from members, then look at mine and it will tell you who I am.  




 I submitted the link; who are you and why does it matter? It's not my blog -- I just thought the parking photos were interesting.  














 Excellent point  




 It can do basic editing. The native tool on the machine doesn't offer much, but the apps store is loaded with some very good photo editing tools. It adds a step to upload, but generally it's a minor issue.  
























 The young woman's car is hit on the bridge in an accident that involves tractor trailers. Horrifying enough. But the force of the crash is enough to send her car either though or over whatever bridge railing is there to keep vehicles on the bridge. Her vehicle plunges 40 feet into the bay -- three to four stories of free fall. She experiences hitting the bay in an explosion of water. Injured and shocked, she is in a vehicle that's sinking and starting to drift. Her options for saving herself are narrowing quickly. Fighting current and probably disorientation, she escapes the vehicle and swims to a bridge pylon. Imagine. Just imagine. 

This is one tough woman. 

 




 Have they said that?  




 Since 2008, I'm just not sure, but this story from 2005 is part of the lore: http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all address=104x4154435 




 This is a Cinderella privilege with an expiration date. People should be allowed to drink water on Metro 365 days a year. There's no sound reason for prohibiting people from drinking water. I can understand a ban on French Fries, but water? It's time to decriminalize water.  




 @beer_OMG_beer  is absolutely correct. Comparing a Walmart worker to a government worker is a major fail. Walmart workers are often restricted to part-time hours without benefits and have a work schedule that constantly changes (if they make themselves available for anytime work, their hours may improve but ability to attend college or meet family needs declines).

 There's a web site, bedbugger.com that's a great resource for questions like this.  




  Are you renting in a condo complex or apt? Is it a separate facility or just a bike rack? Does the space used for bikes have the potential to generate revenue in other ways?

A condo association may have the option of taking empty space and renting it out as storage. Instead, they make it available to bikers. I could see the argument on the condo board: Why should people who don't bike subsidize the loss of income the empty space might generate as storage space?  But then, there has to be enough bikers interested space to cover the cost. If there weren't, you probably wouldn't have the rental space option. Consider yourself lucky. Otherwise, you're stuck like me with the bike in the apt.  




 I bought in DC in early 2008 when the market was softening and the worst was still to come. I did not have a big down payment and it was risky from that point of view. Not the best decision, but what was done was done. After I bought it, the price of my unit fell about 5%-10 to perhaps as much as 20% from what I paid. It has since recovered. With a new assessment, I recently re-financed and lowered my mortgage cost by nearly a third. Previous rate was 6.5%. Now at about 3.5%. Lost PMI, too. 

My monthly mortgage, plus taxes, including condo fee (non-elevator building so its on the low side), is well below market rents. 

Rents are ridiculous now. But the mortgage costs remain low, even at 4%. 

So what should you be worried about the most? That mortgage rates will rise to 6-9% or that housing prices won't fall? 

My view: If you truly planning on staying in DC for a period of years and are set on that, then I would try to buy when the interest rates are low. If prices fall now, I suspect it will due to rising interest rates. One way or another, you'll be paying more. 

More directly to your question: I don't think we will see a repeat of 2008-09. That was a historic crash. I do believe the market can soften if interest rates rise, and I think with the rates now checking in at about 4% demand for housing may rise some as some people try to lock in better rates before they go much higher.  




 I don't blame them. This risk is readers, who may already be up to their necks in monthly subscription charges for other content, NYT, Netflix, etc.,  Hulu, Rhapsody, whatever, may resist. Subscription costs are really becoming a burden, but what choice does WaPo have?  

I dumped cable long ago to save money (use DSL) and watch TV via antenna (which is actually pretty good in DC proper) and Internet content. That has helped to offset some the subscription charges. 
 




 Good suggestion - thanks
 




 Good feedback everyone - Thanks 




  Don't see many people using them. But they are appealing.  




 I don't own a car, hence no insurance. I've wondered about the credit card provisions and whether they really do protect you. 




 I have a 20-year old scratched-up, tear-in-the-seat, bike that's beat-up ugly. But it rides and I keep the components in good shape. When parking on the street, I use two U-locks to lock in both tires and thread a cable cord through the seat.  Not that anyone would steal it, I imagine. I've been thinking about buying a new bike. But wonder: Even with two U-locks, what are the odds that it will get stolen or damaged in D.C.? Is it even worth owning a good bike if you lock it from time to time on the street? (I'm not talking overnight, but about running errands, stopping to eat, etc.) I'm considering something like a Tern folding bike. (Something easy to take on travel and store) 




 What do you do for car insurance? I can get a good car rental rate, but end up adding $$ in coverage that can easily double the rental charge. Have a personal umbrella.  




 I don't have a car and absolutely do not miss owning one. DC is an easy city to bike and is getting better. The bus system is good once you figure it out and in many cases faster than dealing with Metro. 

But owning a bike isn't easy. Good bikes are at risk of getting stolen. For around town, and have plans to lock your bike on a street for some hours, recommend a beater, nothing too attractive, and lock both wheels. 

Personally, I think folding bikes are a great option for commuting if you can stash them inside.

 It's more than just spending money. The chips may be U.S. but the interconnects are Chinese tech. The front end system that runs this new system is using a Chinese-made chip, 16 core SPARC. China is planning to build a system with its own chips. It also has its own software 

China is learning and quickly. This isn't just about buying a system, it's about learning to build a very fast system that is also energy efficient and reliable.  




 Facial recognition is the killer app. I could really benefit from something that could remind just who is at the meeting ... 




 This piece by Ross Douthat was short on history. Ten-15 years ago you could buy condos with credits cards, and houses next to Metro at affordable prices. But people began to realize, even before the big defense build-up post 9/11, that DC was way undervalued compared to NY and Boston, and an attractive place to live. Yes, there's a lot of building going on now but much of it is catch-up. DC is becoming the city it should have always been considering the quality of life.  




 No, do what I did and suggest it's about money and getting rid of cars. that will get you down voted to oblivion.  




 The only thing the park snakes sequester are rats. They are virtuous creatures compared to what goes on in the rest of DC.  




 This is about money and the 'war on cars,' nothing more.  




 I don't know how many Vietnam vets still ride in Rolling Thunder. I imagine a good number remain. I have enormous respect for them. Vietnam was a horrible mistake. More than 58,000 U.S. military personnel lost their lives in that war, and many of the survivors weren't treated well upon return. There was no "thank you for your service" stuff that you hear today for the vets. So I don't mind at all Rolling Thunder. Let them turn up their engines and roar into the city, and if that bothers you, you can shove it.  




 I rented a place in Foggy Bottom in 1998 and you could buy a townhouse nearby  anywhere from $160 to $250. I remember seeing one sign in a condo that was almost directly across from the Metro on 24th that said "lease to own." I was actually surprised.  I had just come form the New England, a depressed city up north, and housing there was selling for the same price without access to a Metro, world-class museums, and a great jobs market. DC was incredibly under priced.

 If they are a certain age, then getting them close to a Metro stop is best. I'd recommend a downtown hotel, such as JW Marriott, Hyatt or something like that. Sometimes you can get good rates. The Metro escalators aren't that long, the areas are safe and well patrolled, and there's plenty nearby. Anything near the Portrait Gallery is super.  




 Great reporting by WAMU. 




 I guess my broader point is this: I wish the Washington Times would actually do some reporting on this issue and discover whether standard liability policies provide some protection. That may satisfy this requirement. It would be nice if they did a little work in finding out just where this idea of $250K gun-specific liability policy comes from. Did it arrive out of thin air? If that's the case, then it seems really hard for the council to impose a requirement that can't be satisfied.  




 I worry for Tumblr. Making an intelligent acquisition is not the same thing as doing something intelligent with it.  




 I love how the Washington Times puts this as "prohibitively expensive" and then launches into a rant. It makes no effort to look into the issue. Wouldn't personal umbrella policies protect from the jerks who accidentally blow holes through their condo walls? If you have auto insurance, it's already a really good idea to spend an extra $200-$300 a year on an $1 million umbrella policy, considering the cost of medical care.    
























 I wish they wouldn't try to super-charge this information with overblown words i.e., "astonishing." It's meaningless and I think trivializes the report. 

Saying, Rate of glacier melt accelerating, is scary enough.  




 I stayed earlier this year at a Trump hotel in Vegas for work conference. The price was on par, and maybe even less, than some of the on-strip hotels. The Trump hotel is slightly off Strip, located on right side of the Fashion Mall. (You can cut through the Fashion Mall to get to the Venetian or Mirage.) The hotel was actually pretty good. The rooms had sinks, fridges, and coffee maker. There may have been a stove top/microwave there (but can't recall.) Very solid place, and the convenience store had things like cereal and milk and other breakfast foods. Prices were reasonable. Staff was very nice and professional. In total, the room amenities were heads above most of the Vegas hotel rooms I've been stuck in (for conferences) that don't even have coffee makers. The Trump hotel didn't have a casino and I actually enjoyed the sanity. The only issue was on check-in. They try to upsell you slightly more expensive room, pulling out a book to look at. I had no interest, but the fellow in line before me spent what seemed like 10 minutes considering an upgrade. I waited patiently.... 




 I think that's great. They allow folding bikes on Marc and Baltimore has some outstanding places, including a Italian section with some good food.  




 This is super. It's a real washboard for considerable lengths.  




 There aren't many areas in DC where they can build tall apartment buildings. Established neighborhoods will oppose them because of concerns that the taller buildings will block views and light. Exceeding current height limits will be a pitched battle in many neighborhoods.  




 There's always Eye/I street 




 The piece now has (as of 11:15 a.m. ET) a new lede that matches the on-air video report (although there were still errors in the text. The fix was probably rushed). The video report is fine. The online text version is, as the OP notes, a mess. 

This original text report the OP cited is so messed up that it was obviously a mistake. It almost seems as if someone accidentally published some notes.   
 




 Here's my question: 

What's your stance on gambling, either online gambling or a casino? 

(Reason for question: Once Maryland builds a major casino at National Harbor, people may complain that D.C. is losing tax revenue. Similar arguments were raised in Massachusetts as a rationale for approving casino gambling in that state. Many Mass residents drove to Connecticut to gamble there. So before this becomes an issue in D.C.,  I think it is important to know how candidates feel about it today.)   









 - Maryland is building a casino in National Harbor. Do you think D.C. should respond by allowing a casino within the District?

- How do you feel about bicycle lanes? Should the city expand them and how aggressively - would you pick up the pace? How important is bicycle safety and what would you do to maximize it?

- Considering the recent scandal in campaign financing, what changes do you think are needed to campaign finance laws in the District?

- How do you feel about FOIA and online access to city documents? 

- Do you support a bid to get the Olympics in the District? 

You know, if anything, maybe we can at least crowdsource questions. 

 




 I'm actually surprised that we still need to state the case about human complicity.  




 Good point. I'm a little put off by the "terrifying" click-candy usage. There's nothing especially new here; the report refines some predictions, narrows time frames, but generally affirms consensus. Anyone who is familiar with the science and ponders feedbacks at all, considers the possibility of a methane releases in the arctic, and acidification on the food chain, is already, in a sense probably terrified or at least worried sick for future generations. Trying to scare people with yet another alarmist headline doesn't work. What we need is for elected officials to come around to the reality of the problem.  




 You can live in dull-as-crap Berlin or an equally charming suburb. You can spend your weekends mowing your expansive lawn, and devote a major portion of your household budget to maintaining two cars. You can also sit around with your neighbors and work yourself up into a froth about Connecticut's "dangerous" cities. And, as we all know, nothing bad ever happens in Connecticut's suburban towns. They are islands of sanity. 

Or you can seriously take a look at New Britain, Hartford, New Haven, or some other city and imagine being part of a diverse community. You can consider how being close to the arts, shopping and entertainment might enrich your life. The concept of "walkability" might enter your life. You can downsize to one car. Ride your bike. Live a healthier lifestyle or rot away in a suburban town.   




 What if they say three weeks processing for returned cashiers check? (This sounds like a horrible rule and completely, totally unnecessary, especially since they are doing a credit check.)  




 Ok, so what happens if they don't rent to you. Do they return the check, uncashed? How long can they hold these funds up? And what if you have a sudden change of mind about the place, or find something else?  









 How do you measure productivity in DC? Half the people in this town have jobs where they are paid to drink: lobbyist, journalists, elected officials.  




 I love Connecticut and lived there all my life until 1998 and now live in DC. I'm in my late 50s, but have many friends and family in the state and visit often. When I visit, I often hear people talk about leaving the state. The property taxes, for instance, on my sister's house are $4,600 a year and she can barely afford the bill. It won't be affordable in retirement, and that's the truth of it. It's a simple ranch in Northern Connecticut. I hear my friends complain as well. They think about leaving. Since moving, I've gotten much more familiar with the mid-Atlantic states and how they run themselves. They do some things better than Connecticut. I don't mean to be  negative. There's a lot to like about the state. It is beautiful. But there are bunch of things the state can do to reduce its tax burdens and run more efficiently. Here are my recommendations:   

1. Move to county/regional services. It's an incredible waste of money for towns and cities to pay for their own administrations, finance, information technology, police, fire, etc., for small geographic areas. This duplication contributes to high local property taxes. 

2. The taxing system and economic development effort should be regional. Take New Britain. When the factories closed, it lost its downtown to West Farms Mall. That's a simplification, but there's truth to it. Farmington gets New Britain shoppers and most of the property tax benefit. To compensate for this lack of a regional tax system, the state waste money on economic development projects in the urban areas that actually end up accomplishing little. Hartford has been an economic development sinkhole since Constitution Plaza.  

3. Get rid of property taxes on cars. It's absolutely the most horrible tax. 

4. Adopt a homestead tax provision. If you live in your home, DC reduces your assessed value by $38,000. It's a significant savings. The trade off may be higher income and sales taxes.  

5. Adopt alternative means of transportation. Connecticut's bus system is a total joke. Many communities lack sidewalks, and forget about bike lanes. The state is overly car dependent, and that makes it very expensive.  


  




 40 and you call yourself a geezer?  




 I do this. But I pass as gently as possible, sometimes say 'excuse me' and exercise caution, especially since I assume the person doesn't know the custom and may behave in an unpredictable manner.    




 I was unimpressed with this piece. Explain please: What is accomplished by heaping everything on the Republicans? The Democrats have been quietly complicit. They have not pushed as hard as they might on this issue because the policy decisions are extraordinarily difficult. Frankly, I think a lot of Democrats are taking cover on Republican denial. It's too easy to blame the Republicans for everything.  I'm disappointed in the full spectrum of political leadership, including the White House's actions to date. Even if the Democrats owned both chambers, I question whether they would be much better than the Republicans in addressing climate change.  




 Well, eat, shoots, and leaves me: Whatever on the headline. 

The report itself is very clear that young voters are an election threat to the stupid, ignorant and bribe-soaked elected officials among us. 

Now, if only my we're-to-busy-watching-tv generation of baby boomers would rally to action ... 

 An overwhelming majority of voters under 35 understand the threat of climate 
change and already see the harmful effects of it, or expect to in their lifetime. 

 66% of young voters say climate change is a problem to address, while just 27% say 
climate change is a natural event that humans cant affect, and only 3% dont believe 
climate change is really happening.

 Similarly, 65% say climate change is already affecting us or will in their lifetimes. 

 This recognition of the threat, coupled with the age groups strong favorability towards the 
President, leads to intense support for action.

 80% support the President taking action to address climate change.

 Among those favorable to the President, nearly all support him taking action.

 But even among the minority who are unfavorable to him, 56% support action and just 
38% oppose.

 This widespread and intense support translates into a willingness to punish 
legislators who stand in the way of the Presidents plan... and to support those who 
back it.

 79% say they are more likely to vote for someone who supported these steps 

 73% say they are less likely to vote for someone who opposed these steps

But it hasn't published in about a month.

Anyone know why?

 I bough at Dahon Mariner for $200 on craigs list from a fellow who was relocating. It was about 10 years old. I brought it to a bike shop and had them make a few adjustments and parts upgrade. I've been super happy with the decision. That bike sells new for about $600. You can find new folding bikes for around $200 from some makers, but not sure about the quality of some of the bikes.  




 I'm not suggesting that the ice on Greenland or Antarctica will melt in 25 years, but I do believe the trend and patterns will be pronounced by that point.  




 People are so clueless about how to lock their bikes. They may lock the frame to rack, but the thief will take both wheels.  




 Not to complicate this too much: But consider a folding bike. You can bike from GW to Metro Center in about 10 min and it's flat. (I once lived on 24th near hospital and made this same trip) Folding bikes are allowed during rush hour. And once you get to Brookland, you won't have to worry about the shuttle. They may even allow you to take a folding bike on shuttle.  




 You will love it even more once they shut the government down! 




 There are striking similarities between Climate Change denial and what happened during the early years of the AIDS epidemic. One in particular. In the early years of AIDS it was becoming increasingly clear that it was being spread via blood (this was before the virus was discovered). Babies were getting ill as were drug users. But there was resistance from the blood bank industry, which attacked the science and epidemiological work  making these connections. That didn't last long because the accelerating rate of infections made it impossible to ignore the problem. 

However, here's another way to look at how the AIDS epidemic unfolded. Imagine that each year of the initial outbreak was actually 10 years. Something akin to dog's life math. And all of a sudden it begins to look like what's going on with climate change. If you use the decade of the 1990s as year one, (Hansen's testimony in 1988 as the starting point) then we are in year 2.5 of real climate change awareness and action. 

The first Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on what would eventually became known as AIDS appeared on June 5, 1981. It received little attention. The national news media only gave AIDS attention when it began to expand beyond the gay population, and even then attention was minimal. Policy makers, with few exceptions, ignored it. It wasn't until the problems cascaded and the number of cases grew that AIDS became a true national issue. 

This past June marked the 25th anniversary of Hansen's testimony, and I would say that the awareness and level of action about climate change is about on par with AIDS at its 2.5 year point. It took about five years for AIDS to get truly recognize for what it was. Although the deniers (and that includes people who considered it a gay disease alone) were still at work five years into the AIDS epidemic, they were being marginalized. But it took about five years for the U.S. to begin to turn real attention and money toward combating AIDS.

It will take another 25 years before the world is truly ready to deal with climate change. By then, the polar cap should be just about gone if not gone. The evidence from Greenland, Antarctica, and temperature records, will be inescapable. Similar to the number of AIDS cases at the five year point, the evidence will be beyond rational dispute.  Today, the people who deny climate change, the policy makers who refuse to deal it, and a public that refuses to understand it, still hold sway. Such as it was with AIDS when you adjust the time scales. We have a long way to go before real action is possible.  




 Update Monday Aug. 5: The entire wall was was being painted over white at 9 a.m.   









 I have a counterview: I really do think most people recognize that something is amiss. They know the growing seasons have changed, and patterns have shifted. That's my experience in talking with folks, especially older relatives. But they aren't asked the right questions in surveys that attempt to assess knowledge about climate change. 

Ask people about what they experience and see. Ask them whether they have noticed changes in growing season of plants in their backyards, different patterns in the arrival of some bugs. Ask them if they are noticing slightly earlier springs. Ask them about their memory of the weather. 

I think the answers will be a lot different than just asking them about "climate change."

It takes a sophisticated level to have the basics of climate change denial. People don't think like that. People who say they don't accept "climate change" may not even really know what "climate change" is, and aren't connecting the concept with what they observe in their world. I find, especially when talking with older people, that the best approach is to ask them what they observe. 
  




 This is just another way of saying that everybody does it (selectively ignores the law), so it's ok. Personal responsibility demands that you respect the rules, even if you think it's unfair because others ignore them. 

 




 The steel security bars appear to be very nice. And the matching beige cubicle wall and curtains, well, it just simply took my breath away! I'm impressed by your harsh and lean aesthetic. I mean, there's nothing on the cubicle walls! Imagine looking all day at bare beige cubicle walls. What discipline. What wonder. That must intensify your focus on the task at hand, as you work under the shadow of the steel bar caged windows.

 Maybe redditors can crowdsource photos and pick a few people as likely suspects. Start with anyone wearing green.  




 This story isn't spam.  




 Obviously you are rejecting the science that links the increases in extreme weather to climate change. People who take positions that can't be defended very well have to turn to insult, which you are now doing. I'm done with you.  




 If you *combine* all the records in the DC area that have been set in the past decade or so, a pattern presents itself: A lot more weather records are being broken now than before. My point, and forgive me for not being clear, is that the sum total of accelerating record breaking is strongly indicative of climate change.  




 The headline on the story is about how the latest heatwave set a irecord/i. 




 They've been able to drill into ice cores going back many years and have run analysis on C02 concentrations and temperatures. C02 is rising, global temperatures are rising, and if you haven't noticed lately, the glaciers, ice caps and Greenland are all melting. Exactly what sample size are you waiting for?  




 The post is about another record being broken. It's not about the weather.  




 It can stay at 80+ plus for the next six months and The House GOP will still be in denial about climate change.

 You probably already tried this, but the Russians have been developing an offshore IT services industry in the U.S. You can find a listing of companies here: http://www.software-russia.com/ Search global. 

I'm not going to vouch for this company because I've never used it, but I know a little about it: https://www.workmarket.com/ provides contract labor. Unlike services such as oDesk (which might also be worth checking out if you haven't), Work Market is mostly an on-site provider. It skews toward technology companies, or firms with technology needs.

 Is the "climate coverage soars" story offering a meaningful statistic?  

Using Google Trends, I compare three search terms: "Climate Change", "Global Warming", "Lindsay Lohan".

Which do you think got the most attention in 2013?

 This isn't about the models anymore. What this is about is risk. If there's even a 10% percent chance that this model is correct, is it worth ignoring and taking comfort in other models that show less of a temperature rise?

 The coop fee seems high. My experience with condo fees is if it's elevator building with 24 hour front desk and any type of common amenities, swimming pool/gym, $500 plus will be the rule. At $900+, even counting for taxes, I'd be wondering whether they added in the cost of an elevator upgrade, or some other really costly repair. And, if that's the case, I'd be wondering whether the building has adequate reserve. If the common areas appear a little rundown (rugs as past their prime, painting hasn't been done, wall paper looks old) think twice about a property. There may be bigger issues lurking, such as roof replacement, HVAC upgrades, etc. 

Another issue to note: See if the unit owners are putting off repairs as well. For instance, if the windows are long past their prime, that's a building issue even if the owners are assessed the cost.  It tells you that owners aren't willing to eat the cost of the upgrade. Buildings will usually upgrade windows all at once to keep everything uniform.

After serving on a condo board for a few years, my view is any building that lets common area repair and upgrades slip may be badly run and possibly working with an under-funded reserve. An inadequate reserve can also explain the high cost.

 Yep about the pizza. If you talk up Connecticut pies out-of-state you risk of being called a "pizza snob." But even the worse pizza in Connecticut* is better than the best pizza in most other places. (There are decent pies to be had in NYC and Mass.) 

And you're right about the beauty. It wasn't until I lived in other places that I could really appreciate the landscape of Connecticut, but New England generally. 














 I got rid of my car several years ago. Immediately saved $1,200 in car insurance. Use a bike a lot.

Offsetting cost is Amtrak, mostly. I spend about $200 a month on train travel. But the same trip by car took a tank of gas, and the tolls up up 95 to NYC are about $30? It's up there. 

Even though the car, for a NYC trip, is about half the cost of the train*, driving 95 is crazy, and have had multiple close calls. Now, I just sit back and get work done, read or watch of movie. 

I don't think I'll ever own a car again. 

*Cost of train to NYC: You can get Amtrak tickets as low as $50 to NYC if you order well in advance. I realize the bus is cheaper but can't stand it.  




 The tapes have no news value. They don't advance story. All they do is offer color. They didn't need the tapes to know this. They were well aware that the tapes would say absolutely nothing new about the events of that day. 

I can understand why AP and others went to court to seek their release. Government, especially on the federal level, is taking an anti-press turn. But Connecticut has had good FOIA protections. I've brought some cases myself when I worked as a journalist in this state.  

But in seeking release of the tapes, the news orgs weren't defending any principle. They were just pulling a lever available to them and the judge knew it. He had no way to block the release of the tapes. 

This all goes back to the original decision by AP to seek release of the tapes. Was this a mechanical reaction on its part? i.e., 911 tapes are public information as a matter course and should be released? Or were they defending a principle?

I find it hard to believe that AP was defending a principle, since it's been well established that 911 tapes are public. 

If AP had not pursued the FOIA, there would have no been harm to FOIA and its underlying principles. There was nothing to protect. Seeking the release of the tapes was a news judgment decision. The news value of the tapes was marginal, and the ill-effects of publishing them are potentially considerable. News organizations make decisions all the time to withhold certain content from their readers because it's disturbing, privacy-invading, so I don't buy the arguments that there was an absolute need to either pursue or publish these tapes. 

Without any free press issues to defend, and there clearly was not one in this case, the release of the tapes is more about how the basic decencies in our country are falling away. 

All this said, I fully understand that even if AP and mainstream news organizations decided not to seek the tapes, others would have so their release was assured. But we all have to make decisions for ourselves about what we're willing to live with.  









 $300 million divided by the city's population of 600,000 equals $500 for every man, woman and child in DC. 

No problem. I'm sure people will be happy to pay.

 I'm not surprised by this. You ask anyone over 50, regardless of party, if things are different and they'll tell you yes. 

 









 Why the word "horrific?" and then an all-is-lost quote? 

I gather from this data that the methane emissions have increased in the last year. The colors have moved from yellow to red. That's disturbing, alarming, troubling, certainly interesting, but it is not horrific. 

Horrific is a sudden methane release that scrambles the climate and create new peril. (What will we say if there is a sudden methane release: Super-horrible-horrific?)

This must sound like nitpicking, and I'm guilty of being too focused on the language stuff, but I see this all the time in the headlines here and I think it undermines the scientific message. For anyone reading this board, the data alone is scary enough.  




 You're the winner here.  




 Great comment, OP. Truly. So, so much of the car vs. bike vs. pedestrian is pure rant, with everyone firm in their position and grievance. 

I take it from your comment, as well, that it may not have mattered that the person was on a bike. It could have been a pedestrian, such was the glare.  




 The new high-rise construction near the beach is a sign of a big disconnect. 

These high rises will be temporary housing. I wonder if the pricing will reflect it: Nice place to live for 10, 20 years and that's that.  









 I'll respectfully disagree with your premise that that china is incapable of genuine innovation. For sure, they aren't building next generation 3-D printers or some new technology, and they haven't yet shaken the IT market. But they are doing everything they need to do to learn, and are building solid foundations. An analysis that discounts their potential may be more Western bias than anything else.  




 China's innovation push is impressive. In computing alone, they have been building the world's fastest supercomputers. Those systems are using a mix of China-origin parts and U.S. tech, notably the chips. But China is making its own chips and is on path to build high performance systems that are made entirely from Chinese produced tech. This is very impressive, and China may be spending more right now to build the next generation of supercomputers than the US. 

I've been very impressed with China and the OP's story, and the comments in it, is very consistent with a policy China outlined years ago. China is going to deliver some impressive tech in due time.  









 I have so much respect for those Sisters. They are wonderful, loving people.

 We are going to get creamed this winter. 

Dodged bullet #1: In August, NOAA updated Atlantic hurricane season outlook predicted that the season "is shaping up to be above normal with the possibility that it could be very active."

Dodged bullet #2: We had a nice summer. According to Capital Weather Gang: "Weve had just five days at 95 or higher  all of those in July. Consider last summer we had a record-tying 28 95+ days. Weve had zero days at 100 or higher. Last summer we had 8."

You don't get to dodge bullet #3. 

 



















 The headline on Guardian's piece is a little weird. I mean, "found guilty?" It's officious. How about, Conservative media outlets are full of dishonest, intellectually lazy, reporting worms who will sell their souls to keep their masters happy.  




 You want scary? How about touring Congress?  




 The L-2 bus, from Adams Morgan to L Street, was light this morning @8:30 a.m. 

There were two reporters interviewing people down by the Smithsonian Metro exit. There were hardly any people around. 

The national mall is empty. 

A double decker tour bus that passed by had few people on it. 

Things seems less busy overall, except Connecticut Avenue/K/L streets. Many going to work.  

 




 Good for him. Hopefully, the folks at OMB live in DC and want their trash picked up, libraries open, and DMV running.  




 They have no choice but to defy the government. They need to make clear that DC will protect its citizens. It will collect the trash. It will open its libraries. It will run basic government services that it citizens need and pay for with their own tax dollars. Gray should be willing to go to jail to defend that.  









 I worked as a daily news reporter for nearly 20 years, and contacting families after a particular death was the worst part of the job. It feels like a horrible invasion, but Washington Post reporter was being accurate when he wrote that people "might be surprised to learn that many people caught in this mayhem actually want to talk to reporters." That's a true statement. People often want to talk about the people they lost, they want others to understand the value that this person brought into the world and the love they shared. It's a affirmation of life. It's the reporter's job to tell the story about what's going on in our shitty world. If the family doesn't want to talk, you respect it and move on. That said, these were the last stories you want to do because it affects you deeply. I've seen fellow writers break down in tears after undertaking these types of stories. It's the last damn story you want to write. When you work as a reporter covering a communnity, you care about that community, the people in it, and you want to chronicle their stories, and let others know what their neighbors are facing. In my mind, this is a noble and difficult pursuit and sometimes misunderstood, but the Post reporter here, I think, handled it well.     
























 If Georgetown is dead, it's dying by growing. The Georgetown Metropolitan reported that the number businesses in its downtown is now at 508, which compares to 496 from last year.

 This ought to be required reading by every police officer in Connecticut.  




 They are promising to run the bus 3 to 7 minutes during peak, and 12-15 minutes off-peak. 

This project has gotten and will obviously continue to get a lot of skepticism. With the exception of Metro North, Connecticut has never been a mass transit state. It hasn't done as much as it should be doing for bicycles, either. 

So, I agree with the idea that you have to sell this. Not just the idea of using this system, but the entire idea of using mass transit. 

If it succeeds, it might help refocus economic development back to urban cores, particularly in New Britain and Hartford. It might spur housing and entertainment districts along key parts of the route. It wouldn't surprise me at all if it reshapes New Park Ave. in a positive way. 

The Hartford/New Britain region once had mass transit: A great trolley system. It replaced it with buses which suffered in the   two-car per household era. But Connecticut residents are smart, adaptive and responsible, and in this era of climate change, expensive fuel, more interest in bicycle commuting and mass transit, this project may work. 

I get the concern that ridership will fall short. But city after city is putting in some kind of mass transit option. Trolleys are making a comeback, dedicated bus and bicycle lanes are arriving as people fight the idea of using streets for "car storage" i.e. parking. There's always push back, but you need to ask: Why won't something like this work? 

This CTfastrak is a done deal at this point. The investment has been made. Here's hoping for a good outcome.  




 what are the property taxes?  




 thanks for links but still have no idea what this is about. is there a link to the blog? or a backgrounder story on the suit?  









 I couldn't believe it. TBS gets to broadcast a final four game and decides to tell the game from one perspective: the Gators. It wasn't just the announcers. The camera was fixed on the Florida bench and its coach. Terrible.  




 If you're in NB at all, Jimmy's Smoke Shop in downtown is the HQ for bus transport.  




 I think it's something that could work well with something else. Take a look at http://www.everyblock.com/ It aggregates in news, public records, anything it can find by location. But interest in it is so-so. Everyblock's approach, when all is said and done, doesn't offer much. People want original content, discussion, and something they can't find elsewhere. Pure aggregation tools, unattached from anything else, just haven't caught on all that well. They don't inspire a lot of loyalty or repeat traffic. 

Redditt, Slashdot aggregate but users pick the content, not software. There's a difference. 

But I think the fact that you have created this platform is a significant accomplishment and it has potential, but not necessarily as a stand-alone platform.

 Is it criminally negligent to choose to be willfully ignorant of the truth?  




 For starters, let's build a Manhattan Project around batteries, Renewable energy needs cheaper, cost effective, high capacity storage, and so do electric cars. 

Here's another: Great strides are being made to improve solar photoelectric cells. Would adding $26B in federal support speed up their development?

Removing C02. I have no faith that mankind will react in time to reduce CO2 levels. Can we develop technologies that can do this and make it as ubiquitous as trees? 

Federal research is increasing only incrementally. It may not be beating inflation at this point, and is declining in some areas, so I wouldn't hold out on a Manhattan Project anytime soon. Of course, Europe and China may see it differently and discover ways to improve energy storage. That will be good for mankind, but bad for U.S. industries. 

 




 You are assuming that I tried to time the market in the past. Never have. I haven't touched by investment spread is 15 years. This is not about timing the market.  I'm just trying to make a decision about whether it's time to bail from the market, lock-in what I saved, and move on. Very hard decision. I wanted to see what people think. 

Oh, and regarding mother earth. They were right then, and they are most definitely right now.

 I'm in my late 50s, and I'm wondering if I should park my 401K funds in a stability of principal fund. 

Market Watch recently had a piece warning that "Stock caution urged as margin debt levels hit new highs" http://www.marketwatch.com/story/stock-caution-urged-as-margin-debt-levels-hit-new-highs-2014-03-09

And the Financial Times has a piece today that Seth Klarman is warning of a "significant market correction." He is citing nosebleed valuations in tech shares, in particular. http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/6dd806e2-a627-11e3-9818-00144feab7de.html#axzz2vYeDNzjM

The Bull Market is five years old, and while some argue that it will go on for a while, there is someone arguing that things will remain good for a while. People were saying the housing market would stay good right up until the time it crashed in 2008. This time, I'm inclined to agree with the bears. 

I'm not 401K rich by a long shot, so not much room to play. Should I park?  




 I really like the Guardian. The climate change reporting and analysis is really good. They are aggressive and right on top the story. They take issue seriously, and they don't give harbor to the skeptics (unlike so many major U.S. newspapers). Most importantly, they devote resources to the issues.

What can U.S. news organizations learn from the Guardian?

Quite a lot I suspect. People want in-depth coverage of climate change without the BS from the skeptics.  




 I had posted a direct link to Krauthammer's post earlier on reddit climate and it was down voted to oblivion. It was worth taking note, IMHO, because it was in the Washington Post, and it will be read by the large denial contingent in Congress. The real issue is whether the Washington Post should have published Krauthammer's shallow thinking.  



















 I think I know what you mean. If you ask people with only a passing knowledge of climate change whether they notice changes in the weather, you will often hear how "weird" it is. But this awareness that something is amiss has not yet boiled over to the point where they are concluding that we're in deep trouble. So, yes, is the weird weather keeps up, the boiling point will be reached ....  









 This belongs here. The story is solid. The OP's write-up is based on something in the piece i.e. "crack squad of fairies," that's a little over-the-top sarcasm. 

The Guardian piece is about the poor reading comprehension and lack of scientific understanding in journalism. The idea that there was a hiatus or pause in global warming was never an accurate description of what's going on. That seems to be the major point.   




 Brad Field. But in truth, all the local weather folks are good. They all work hard at it.  




 Seriously, is that what its come down to? Admiring some run-of-the mill windows? 

 




 It humanizes Barry Farms and the issue generally, and it's a great example of local reporting. That's why it's being voted down, and, of course, to support gentrification.  




 I thought this quote in the story was particularly interesting.

"Technological superiority is not assured," Kendall told the Armed Services Committee in the House of Representatives. "This is not a future problem. This is a here-now problem."

Can imagine that a similar warning was raised during the Soviet era. What was the response then, versus the response now?  














 It's probably important to point out those connected to political power and money who deny climate change. But the only reason these people and organizations flourish is because most Americans are in denial (as opposed to deniers) about climate change.  




 It's clever. It's different and it's true.  




 Totally support everything Mann is saying. But it applies to everyone who understands this issue.  




 It's a good thing Reddit doesn't apply the is he/she "an actual person" standard to redditors.  




 Yes, but at least you aren't living in Honolulu. Be thankful! 




 Its been just a few months since I came to Los Angeles from the District of Columbia, and already it is Crystal City clear: L.A. is a downer.

Look no further then Skidrow at 7 a.m. for a pure view into the citys heart and soul. You will pass a dozens and dozens of slumped homeless veterans holding out a McDonalds cup for money. 

After committing to pay a senseless amount of money for gas for the day's trip just to dump ever increasing amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere; it's easy going from here, except for the climate-changed induced drought emergency just declared by the governor. 

Every morning its the same on the Freeway: people, sitting in their cars, with blank stares and the saddest-looking faces imaginable. Do they wonder about the environment? They are like cattle in a climate denial storm, too self-centered to take mass transit, gazing into space, waiting for their ride to the climate change slaughter house.

A rat creeps across a sidwalk. The dusty cars make a miserable sound as they screech to a stop.  I don't see E.T. anywhere. I am miserable, disappointed. Where are the starlets? Everywhere in Los Angeles you see people in T-Shirts and jeans. I miss D.C.'s civilizing dress code.

The irony runs deep. The capital of American media culture  is in fact, ugly and uninspiring. The imagine of L.A. as a colorful mecca of entertainment is a lie. The citizens who work in the movie and television industry appear to be enduring unspeakable oppression and Oscar snubs.

Please, California people, keep your mouths shut when you visit D.C. Don't write trite op-eds. Instead, keep your eyes fixed on whatever little video screen you can find. And when you return to California, preach the merits of mass transit and car-less living.

 There is evidently an effort to ban ecigarettes on the Metro and other public places.

There was a hearing in November. Smoke Free DC testified. The testimony: http://www.smokefreedc.org/e-cigarette-testimony-dc-council/

From what I can tell, this bill has not been adopted. Here is the legislative status page:  http://dcclims1.dccouncil.us/lims/legislation.aspx?LegNo=B20-0233

Here is the bill, the oddly named, Electronic Cigarette Parity Amendment Act of 2013

http://www.dccouncil.us/files/user_uploads/related_materials/Bill_-_E-Cigarette_Parity_Amendment_Act_of_2013.pdf

I am totally in support of a ban and any effort to deter smoking. Electronic cigarettes are nothing more than a nicotine delivery system.  
























 I wish I could remember what it cost to build the stadium in New Britain. Hopefully, it's been paid off. 

This will likely revive the debate in NB whether bringing the Rock Cats was a good idea in the first place. The stadium, near the Berlin border, offered no help to NB's downtown, the focus of its economic development.  I recall the idea of building a stadium downtown coming up, but not the reasons for its rejection. The right downtown parcel probably wasn't available. 

Hartford wants the stadium in walk-able distance to its downtown stores and shops, so they must be expecting some indirect economic benefit. Wonder if they're right.  

I just find this entire thing disgusting. It's one city against another, and the only true winner are the Rock Cats. 

So now New Britain is stuck with a useless stadium facility and Hartford residents may be taking on some debt they can't afford. 

I'm sure there will be talk about turning NB stadium over to NBHS or CCSU to use, but those teams won't drive attendance so it's going to be a big waste of space. 

I also don't get why NB officials -- apparently -- didn't see this coming. One explanation is that the Rock Cats were out to leave NB and weren't interested in any local drama. It may be that their business model is to bolt for a better deal when any lease is up. But still, the Rock Cats had an obligation to disclose their plan and see if there wasn't something NB could do to fix whatever it was they wanted addressed. Maybe they did earlier. Maybe there was some bad blood. I don't know, but the newly elected mayor seemed clueless. I'm not blaming her; this thing had to be simmering before she took office. I won't blame NB for feeling a little used by the Rock Cats, and Hartford officials would be wise to soak in some of that feeling.  

I do think the NB location was family-friendly, however. Easy to get to. Safe. Where will people park to see the Rock Cats in downtown Hartford? Will they have to walk to garages? Will it lead to an overall more expensive outing? 

Two pieces of advice to Hartford: Make sure the Rock Cats can't leave until the bonds are paid off. And remember the Whalers. Once their brand-new Hartford lease up, the Rock Cats will probably head out of state to the embracing arms of a new group of dumb bunny politicians. 
 




 Freelancing is ideal, but another path is to try blogging. Hopefully, you can carve out a few hours a week to do this. I don't know how successful people have been to use their self-published work as a means to a news (not opinion/blogging) job. But I believe it's possible, and it's certainly one way of getting on the radar of local news organizations, especially if you scoop them on something interesting. If you do, send a respectful note to a local editor with the link/clip and ask them if you could write this up for them. 

This is what I have in mind:

There's a fellow in DC who covers local meetings in his neighborhood and writes up reports: http://shortarticlesaboutlongmeetings.blogspot.com/

His coverage is straight news, and little different from a local news reporter's work. His effort is getting local recognition because fact-based stories free of rant and opinion are still appreciated. He could, I suspect, turn this blog into a source of part-time income via advertising. 

As far as age goes, you are a youngster. I'm in late 50s. I didn't get my first full-time job until about 25/26. I freelanced initially, but I would have been blogging as well ... had there been an Internet ....  

If you go the blog route, keep polishing and fixing your stories even if they are week old. You want your published work to be as sharp and clean as possible. Get an up-to-date an AP style guide, and practice writing with economy and precision. (I love this work: How to Write Short, Roy Peter Clark). Even Hunter Thompson started straight. 

   









 I have some serious problems with this opinion piece.  

It's author writes, "see how few women hold the programmer-journalist roles that have become so prized" and "When I do find women in these spots, theyre often doing front-end work, designing the interactives rather than doing the programming thats so highly prized."

Tech reporter here. First, only about 26% of the people in computer occupations are women, and women only constitute about 15% of a typical computer science graduating class.

Now, I'll guess that a large number of  "programmer-journalist" do not have CS degrees, but they probably have some technical training and their courses were mostly male. 

This point rang absolutely true: that women are "doing front-end work, designing the interactives" -- yes. You are more likely to find women doing Web design and user interface work because it combines art, in this case graphic arts, design and some code work.

The problem is more general and involves increasing the percentage of women who seek some technical training. At its root, this is a national problem and is not specific to journalism. That's an essential perspective and it's missing from the piece.  




 Technically, you're right. It's in Agawam. But under a special act approved by the Connecticut Legislature the property was annexed by Connecticut. 

Connecticut residents loved that place, and so lawmakers felt they had to do something to take it away from our northern neighbors. It was justified as payback for the bad driving they inflict on our state.  

Alas, the special act was approved Aug. 17, 1969 at 2 a.m. There weren't any news reporters there to witness it, because, coincidentally, it was approved during Woodstock. To keep Massachusetts from finding out that we had just annexed part of their state, an employee from the Secretary of State's office took the freshly printed law and coded it and put the document in one place and the cipher for decoding it in another. Lawmakers pledged themselves to secrecy. It was a different era back then.   

In 1998, when Six Flags was considering acquiring Riverside, a secret council of lawmakers who knew about the then 30-year-old Riverside Park Annexation Law gathered in panic. They felt it was time to make the law public and asset the state's right over the property and thwart the sale to Six Flags. 

But, alas, there was only one clue to the location of the cipher. The secretary of state employee who hid the cipher, in keeping with the great tradition of the Charter Oak, sealed the cipher with bee's wax in a great oak tree in Farmington. This employee then retired and left for Florida and was never heard from again. Unfortunately, the tree was removed in 1973. It was located on the site of Westfarms Mall, which opened in 1974. 

This is a true story.  




 I like the Clairefontaine wirebound book. It's a French based company, and the paper is excellent quality and designed for fountain pens, but any semi-liquid pen looks great. It's hard to find. In the DC area, the pen store across the press club has them; otherwise, online. 

I wish someone made a reporter's style notebook with good quality paper. 




 On a purely technical level, I would suggest this: Sony recorders, which I use, have something called a T mark. It is essentially a bookmark. Press the T Mark button when you hear something you may want to quote.  

You can manually jump ahead to T marks for playback. From the stop position, hit the fast forward on the voice recorder and it will jump from T Mark to T Mark. 

It's easier if you hook the recorder up to a PC.  The Sony voice editing software will show where the T mark is; just click on the spot. (There's no Mac version of the Sony editing software, and I really don't know if a Mac will recognize the Sony recorder as a separate drive.)

To keep track of T Mark numbers, the easiest way for me is to just keep track of how many times I pressed it. From experience, I've found it best to use the T Marks sparingly. If it's a quote I'm sure I will want to double check, I hit it. 

Using a T Mark is super fast way to zero in an quote without having to look away from a speaker in a face-to-face interview. (Or shift gaze from notepad to recorder, which I find is distracting to the person you are interviewing.) 

Almost all the Sony recorders, especially the ones with the USB port, have the T Mark function. Starting price is around $50 an up. 

Another thing I really like about Sony is the ability to customize the keyboard commands for voice editing. I can speed through a recording very quickly. 

In buying a voice recorder, you may want to look at where the T-Mark is located and consider the button layout. I don't want to accidentally press the wrong button. I have two Sony units currently: The ICD-UX533 has the T Mark button adjacent to the folder and menu buttons, and while it's a good recorder, I'm not super-pleased with this layout. I also own a ICD-SX712. The T Mark button is the lower right, separate from everything else, and easy to find by touch. 
 




 I worked at a time when many newspapers augment FT reporters with small armies of stringers. It was a foundation for good local coverage. The stringers were axed as time went on, and I agree that local bloggers, with exceptions, didn't replace them. 

On the issue of bad hiring I wonder if newsrooms aren't suffering from the same thing that afflicts a lot of industries. Many candidates do not make it pass computer screenings of resumes because they are missing certain certifications or skill sets. I'm not suggesting that editors use algorithms to screen out candidates, but I will argue that newsroom hiring may be too focused on credentials and has lost the ability to recognize raw talent. They may be on unwilling to take a risk on someone. I do not know. 


 




 Your analysis is correct and isn't yet. Yes, "too few people start blogs to cover local meetings and such." But relative to what? There are plenty of local bloggers who do the work, but in the vast blog-o-sphere, they will be always be the minority. You can't use the volume of poor bloggers to hang the rest. That's one of the problems local bloggers face; they are dismissed, under-appreciated and unnoticed, because of the sins of the many. 

I wasn't suggesting j-school was a "soviet re-education camp" -- I actually think j-school has some value today, especially since journalists will have have to know far more than than the basics. Technology and databases are too big a part of it. But I do believe that the j-school dominated newsroom management is self-reinforcing about hiring. They look for people with j-school and may be blind to great potential. Journalism doesn't require a j-school degree. In an event, the degree is low down on the list once you get past entry level. At that point, you either have the work to show or you don't.  




  So excuse me if I don't think your average citizen journalist has the skills and judgement of someone with a master's degree in journalism. There is a reason that citizen journalism is, as you said, "an excuse for uninformed opinion pieces." It's because citizen journalists are untrained, unskilled hacks.

Where is all this anger coming from? Our business is laying off people, not hiring. Starting a blog, covering local meetings, is the new entry level "job" for a lot people. Their material may not be up your standards, and they operate with benefit of skilled editors who have seen every mistake imaginable, but bless them for trying.  

We should be encouraging citizen journalism, especially for people who want to break into the business. I really don't know any other way to do so today. Sure, you could blow a ton of money on a grad degree, but it's still about clips.

And is it smart to only hire people with a J-degree, a master's at that. How terribly sad. Editors use to value drive, curiosity, and evidence of intelligence in whatever form it took. I remember discussions in my first newsroom, 30 years ago, about whether the then increasing interest in j-school would radically change hiring practices and we wondered. 

My first newsroom, with about a dozen reporters, had two Ivy league grads with various liberal arts degrees, one with a law degree, and the balance from universities and state colleges that didn't appear on college rankings. No one had a j-degree.  One of the editors didn't even have a college degree. They were all hired because they had some good clips, could think on their feet, tell a joke, weren't easily intimidated, write a clear sentence and were relentless in pursuit of a story. I felt honored to be in their company and my hiring an anomaly. 

I get that there are fewer editors in newsrooms today, and can see the logic of hiring interns with their rookie errors squeezed out of them. But that still doesn't prepare them for what they may really need. 

Back in the day, we all knew the J-school people would take over in the end, because it's self-perpetuating. Specialization always wins out. Once someone with a masters in journalism becomes ME or EE, that sets the tone. I don't think that's a great outcome for a business that requires a lot of intellectual diversity. J-school can help turn out competent reporters, I suppose, but a great reporter is a force of nature. 



 




 I think it depends what type of blog you're talking about. I agree that there are a lot of national blogs that siphon ad dollars and do little for journalism. And let's not forget the impact Craigslist had on classifieds, or Zillow/Trulia etc. on real estate advertising etc. 

But local blogs, with one or a few people writing for nothing or pocket change, are getting ads from local businesses and returning real content to the community.  They aren't parasitic. If anything, the daily journos gain story ideas from their work.  




 Blogger and Word Press are great, and Typepad has been around for a  long time.  If you sign up for any of the newer operations listed here, find out what your options are for moving all your content to Word Press. Have a back-up/bail out plan. If any of these platforms are running on VC money, they may still be shy of making a profit. Also, think long term. Do you want advertising and how friendly are some of these other platforms to ads?  




 You're talking about citizen journalism? Not about paid journalists who also blog? 

Anyone who is hostile toward citizen journalists is, IMHO, a complete shithead and who, despite this horrid condition, doesn't know crap. 

Here are some great examples of citizen journalism by people who do this in DC.

The coverage speaks for itself.  




 It's a news judgment issue. The collapse of the  West Antarctic sheets means that sea levels will rise to catastrophic levels. It's now officially unavoidable. So, yes, as a longtime reporter, I'm very interested in discovering whether news organizations can really assess the implications of this finding, and, if so how do you treat it? 

Future generations will assess how this generation reported this issue; they'll see how much importance was assigned to the story, and they ask whether the journalists of this period really understood the findings.

As the saying goes, journalism is the first draft of history. Will we get it right? 

(Regarding the Bloomberg link, I used only because it seemed competent and isn't behind a paywall. There are a lot of good explanatory reports out there.)

 Skews very young, which is evident from a lot of the postings.  Thanks for doing the survey. Interesting results.  




 Well, I will disagree. I am an older journo and stories that tend to read are fact based. Unemployment is higher for this generation; college debt is high, and that is worrisome and a lot of the reporting seems to reflect that. As far as work culture, some of the business reporting that I've seen about millennial work habits isn't negative; it's about how businesses can adapt and retain the younger generation that is likely to be very well educated, less loyal (and for good reason), and insisting on more flexibility in work/life arrangements. 

The BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) to work, something many IT department are adapting to, is being driven in large part by the younger generation that doesn't want to be constrained by out-of-date tech. 

And as far as destruction of humanity goes ... the polls seem to indicate that millennials may be the most concerned about climate change. Millennials aren't very well represented in Congress yet, so I won't fault them for causing the destruction of humanity. As far as who screwed up the economy: every earlier generation blames the older generation for this or that. It's a waste of energy, because as the saying goes, nobody is perfect. 

And regarding the journalism business: Most of the web news start-ups, I would suppose, that are roiling this business are the efforts of millennial generation, not the baby boomers. The younger generation is carving out a new paths for making journalism thrive. I hope they succeed. 

If you read something that blames the millennial generation for the national woe, just keep in mind that it was written by a dull, ignorant, full-of-crap, dense and misinformed person who probably has no idea where his/her local library is, and likely has the IQ of a hen. 


 




 Nothing converted me. This isn't a belief. The science is simply overwhelming. The impact of rising C02 levels on the oceans, land and atmosphere arrives daily. Reading about climate change, studying it, and trying to act proactively to bring about change is important for me. 

Right now I'm reading The Sixth Extinction by Elizabeth Kolbert, which documents to accelerating decline of species. Many species aren't adapting well to warmer climate and the increasing acidification of the oceans as they absorb more C02. Really recommend it. It's not polemic. She's a top notch reporter who had access to scientists in the field, and she reports on their findings. 

The worry, the concern and the fear is authentic for many people. There is no doubt. 


 
  




 Taxes on a suburban ranch house can run 4K in the 860. Car taxes can add another 1K easily. Energy cost are high. It's a beautiful state, but if you're getting close to retirement the overhead is really tough. 

The winters may be getting tougher, too. More snow it seems.  









 This Huff post screed is more than 1,100 words over a problem that could have been explained in 25. 

 




 Kudos to the farmer for writing this piece. But reading between the lines of his essay, you can sense that he's being cautious. He calls for "common sense" solutions twice, without really explaining what he means beyond increasing reliance on alternative energy. But in Iowa, as I understand, landowners are doing ok by making land available for wind generation. Is he arguing for expanded use of land for alternative energy? Is there a subtext here? Not really sure.

 How everyone is preternaturally young. In DC, I feel like I'm living in the movie Twilight.  




 We're describing different things. Facebook didn't close the door to content. But it did close the door to searchable content independent of Facebook's own engine. And I wasn't describing full-time content creators, but people with day jobs who write as a hobby.  




 

Before there was Facebook, there were a lot of blogs, personal blogs, where people shared stories about their communities and reaction to things. They were open and accessible and uniquely valuable; they tended to humanize a community, and enliven. 

Over the years, many of these writers, understandably, migrated to Facebook because they're real interest was to use the blog for social networking. (And they weren't that much interested in maintaining a blog.)

But this shift to Facebook also closed the door to a lot of content. The local blogging universe gradually became mostly specialized: food, clothing, mom blogs, real estate, neighborhood, etc.  

Many of the story tellers, who had a talent for making a community alive, were posting on Facebook. They're content, for the most part, was no longer discoverable via a general search engine. 

If FB Newswire has a plan to take some of this content and allow it to find its way to the broad public domain, (something I think these writers, when asked would embrace), then it might be very useful. This content doesn't even have to be connected to any news event. 

If Facebook could find, discover and promote writing that tells us something about the world we live in and add that to your news feed, then it might be doing something important and powerful. 





 




 Ignorance in the world? Film at 11.  




 In science, research is first peer reviewed, and, second, the validity of a finding is only established after others duplicate the research.

In data journalism, there's no easy way to know whether the data has been interpreted correctly, or manipulated to support a news hook. Other news organizations, bloggers etc., are more likely to amplify the findings instead of critically asking whether the data is accurate, complete, or represents reality.  

I've used data to support stories for decades, but in extremely targeted ways. The data was the icing, not the story. Now we have news orgs downloading every spreadsheet they can find. Danger ahead, IMHO. 
 

 




 The ownership model is a lot different for the affiliates. In Hartford, the major state newspaper, the Courant, is owned by the Tribune Co. The local Fox affiliate in Hartford is also owned by the Tribune, and the reporting is very good.   

The Courant, like the state, is a fairly liberal paper, editorial-wise. The Courant and the Fox affiliate also work in concert on some things, especially weather reporting. 

If anything, the local Fox affiliates that I've seen work to rise above the national reputation of Fox News. 
 




 It's not that. In Connecticut it's about the view. These things can be as high as 400 feet and have a wingspan that's massive. They are landscape altering, and having one here, one there, isn't going to make a one bit of a difference to global climate or to big oil. This will never be a windfarm state like Iowa or Texas. More likely than not, some business will put one up as an advertising gimmick to claim that that they are green. 

As it is, most towns try to shrink business signs, just to keep the landscape view pristine.  

Frankly, I think the state should do more to encourage solar. Or keep builders from constructing 2,500 square-feet plus houses, or putting in more mass transit in the Hartford region, in particular, as well as allowing higher density housing near potential mass transit centers. More bike paths on roads would be great as well.

 Blame for the low turnout rest completely on DC's leaders. 

April primary: Bad idea. It should be in Sept. 

Field was too busy. 

There were no issues. Everyone was running against Gray. 

I'm hoping November is better. It's basically a face off between David Catania and Muriel Bowser. With Mayor Gray out, that means these two will actually have to campaign on issues.

 I was the editor of my college paper, 30 years ago. Same deal, and no explanation for it. But my college paper work gave me clips and contacts, and my first reporting job. 

The people I met, some whom became lifelong friends, was the best part of it.  




 Your query prompted me to think about the writers of Wall Street Journal's All Things Digital worked under contract. They split from the WSJ and formed http://recode.net/ (Another who started with a personal brand, moved to large outfit and then returned to a personal brand, is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Romenesko) 

There's a whole emerging issue about whether journalists will actually become "brands," and operate as independent contractors with the freedom to move name and brand from pub to pub. I don't know enough about this issue as I would like. But if you have a blog with a following and good brand and you see it as a potential revenue source, then you want to protect yourself. Linking up with a newspaper may accelerate your brand and profile, and help theirs as well, since food bloggers can be very popular and great source of ad revenue. 

Personally, I'd want the ability to return my blog and brand if I parted company. I might think differently if they bought out my food blog and coupled that with a contract to write for it. But right now it sounds like you would be migrating without an offer, so you are the one in the stronger position in a sense. If they aren't offering you anything to bring your blog to their platform, it seems entirely reasonably that you should keep the brand. (Will you be giving up ad revenue that you now make on your personal blog?) 

The All Things Digital writers, and they left in one big group, weren't able to keep that brand. The WSJ retains it. I don't know how ReCode is doing; maybe it's a rousing success, I just don't know. But having to re-brand seems like a risk. 

Congratulations, I must say, for putting yourself in this position to begin with. It's an interesting issue, and the editors must think well of your work to offer.  




 I don't think there is a source on that. And I don't think it's something that the TSA wants to advertise. But I have heard of people who didn't have a driver's license, lost it, forgot it, or whatever, who were still able to get on planes.  




 Was the military trying to enhance security, somehow, with these arrests? You can tour U.S. military bases via Google Earth. Surprising amount of detail in the satellite images.  




 First, I think it's just super that you are working on a neighborhood blog. That's outstanding.

Layout wise, dunno. The "free and affordable fun," video teaser is wordy, takes up too much white space, and doesn't really compel you to click on link. It needs art. 

The side-by-side Knoxville Opera/Spring football heds seems a little too busy. 

Most neighborhood blogs use a blog-type format, and, honestly, I feel readers get confused by formats that stray away from that model. 

 I think these layouts are a little more action-packed:

 I'm fine with this posting. Extreme weather anomalies are part of the climate story. And frankly, my guess is that the vast majority of users on this particular subreddit have no questions at all about the science in support human-induced climate change. Most of what's posted here is about the latest science and about how rapidly it is occuring. Extreme weather -- the continual blow-out of records, whether drought, floods or heat, over a relatively short period -- is certainly interesting and relevant.  




 You can contest it, but you may have to attend an administrative hearing.  They may cut fine in half, and you will lose a half day at least in the process. Been there, done that. Not worth it. 

The emergency parking signs ticket complaint is a common issue. The city feels it's your responsibility to check on your vehicle periodically. 

 
 














 I wouldn't include social media prowess as a tech skill. It's more of a multi-tasking skill, IMHO.  




 Bravo for carrying a double major. If by art, you mean art history, I think that's great for all it brings with it: analytic skills, research, problem solving and critical thinking. Being able to draw on art and history may enrich your writing. If it's art as in visual design, graphic arts, or anything else, that's great as well, since much of journalism is visual presentation. 









 I always assumed it was at the discretion of the conductor because there's no logic to it. I've seen some metro cars close their doors while people were still lined up and boarding, prompting actions by passengers to attempt to hold the doors open. I've seen this happen on the green line more than any other line.  














 It is, but what is interesting is that this no-advertising blog -- which is very popular in DC -- has thought hard about this issue, sets standards and even has its own style guide. Aside from presenting often compelling topics, most of the pieces are readable. That may be the more important takeaway.  




 Maybe she was just trying to strike up a conversation. You know meet you, and didn't realize you are just another crazed biker with a 24x7 camera looking for drama. 

Here is what she said (from your transcript) "Her: (Shouting from behind me) "We're going to a red light. What's the point man."

This is what you said: NOTHING. 

She speaks up again: "Why pass me to a red light?"

You give the most dorky possible response: "Why not?" (Why not -- WHY NOT a disarming smile and some kind words in response?) 

What you should have tried, perhaps, was a little self-depreciation: "Sorry, I was just trying to impress you." And you smile warmly, don't give her a maximum dork look with your stupid camera, and ask instead  "How come I haven't passed you before" ... 

And she called you a jerk, how sad.  
 














 It is odd that a state which has much to loose is resisting taking a leadership role on this issue. You have to believe that as the shoreline damage mounts, mitigation cost increase, and the realization that large parts of Florida will be uninhabitable, that Florida's residents will elect leaders who become advocates for national action on climate change.   




 I clicked on the above link several times and keep getting a dead link. The NYT may have changed the link, because I've never seen this syntax before: http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/15/when-climate-change-floods-your-heart/ 




 It's a real plus that you have a job freelancing with a local pub. The pay versus time/effort probably is hard to deal with, but having clips and working is great. Some of this is newspaper work, but some of it is the economy. The unemployment/underemployment rate for new college grads is not good. 

http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/05/08/unemployment_and_the_class_of_2014_how_bad_is_the_job_market_for_new_college.html

Be persistent. When I was stringing, I would gather clips every now and then and just show up at the daily and drop them off in person. I would bug the TV station as well. Friendly persistence can pay-off, especially if they begin to recognize you. This isn't much help, I'm sure, but good luck.  
 









 The place was packed, wall to wall. Two photos here: http://dcblogs.com/?p=10278 














 I bang my head on my desk. I imagine life unemployed, desperate, and sleeping under a bridge. That can work. But more often chit-chatting with sources sparks, more often than not, ideas. I also scour newspapers far and wide using search terms of various topic areas.  




 You can write for the college paper, take some journalism courses, and major in what you have heart set on. Majoring in journalism is like taking on apprenticeship; it won't challenge you the way philosophy, history, economics, science, etc. The secret of success in journalism is passion and creativity.   









 You can bring folding bikes aboard Amtrak. You can't put them in the overheads, but there luggage racks in some of the cars large enough to handle them. And there's plenty of storage room at the ends of cars.  




 there are no legitimate opposing opinions.  









 This isn't reflecting the state of journalism; it's reflecting the state of the nation, and the conservative embrace of anti-intellectualism.   














 In the 1970s, Enfield centralized all its retail development. The idea, one supposes, was to keep the residential areas residential, quiet, and free of stores. The end result is a community that was designed for cars and not for people. It is not friendly to cyclists and walkers. The problem is apparent in the mall area. There are major intersections with no walk lights or crosswalks. It is difficult to cross in some spots and hazardous. The concept of bike lanes hasn't even registered. This needs to change. I see more adults cycling, or at least trying to. Some may not have cars. Others just want the alternative, but Enfield is utterly blind to the needs of pedestrians and cyclists in the retail areas. I think this would be a good campaign issue, because discussion is needed.  Enfield's approach to planning hasn't changed since the 1970s. (EHS grad 1972), It's time for the town to change.  




 This list makes sense, actually. Journalists are clumped around professions and occupations that can make people uncomfortable and suspicious about motives: lawyers, charity collectors, clergy, taxi drivers, ceos, real estate agents. Based on how the occupations are ranked, it would be just about impossible for journalist to be ranked among the top 20.   









 Let's see what happens with Keystone. Stopping fracking strikes me as a lost cause, but the pipeline is another issue.  




 Metro is great. It's far cheaper to use than a car. But the never-ending weekend track work is grinding. The single tracking, long waits, really discourage you from using the system on the weekends.  




 You can submit a query to http://www.prnewswire.com/profnet/ which will send it to members. Make your query specific. You are looking for someone in the tape, adhesive industry; then add that you interested in hearing from manufacturers, distributors, re-sellers, and academics who may be researching adhesives. 

You can also try ssrn.com and do a search on academic papers to see if anyone has published researched. Email/phone contact is usually included with the papers. 

If your deadline is in a few hours profnet won't help, unless you are trying to get help on a high-profile topic, such as legal help on a SCOTUS decision.  But if you get a query -in before 9 a.m.., generally you'll may get what you need for an afternoon filing. The quality of the responses vary, but over the years I've gathered some gems for contacts.  









 There is nothing that prevents a company from replacing U.S. workers. 

There is no requirement that a qualified U.S. worker be hired first.

See: http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/FactSheet62/whdfs62O.pdf

Now, if an H-1B employer is classified as dependent it has to make an effort to first try to fill the job with a U.S. worker. But it can bypass that requirement by paying a salary to the H-1B worker that's 60K and above, or filling the job with somone with an advanced degree.

  The company is required to post an advertisement for the skill, to make sure there aren't any natives available.

 I'm a big fan of the NYTimes, and they got this story right and many others about climate change. Politicians who embrace denial are on the wrong side of history. Unfortunately, it will probably take another generation before the leadership changes with members in Congress -- in both parties -- with the conviction to take this issue on.  




 I think Hartford hit a home-run with the UConn expansion. That's bringing in 2,000 plus people in Hartford daily, and it may do more to encourage supporting economic development -- restaurants, cafes and the like -- than a stadium. It may also work as a catalyst for more housing. People want to live in downtown areas; close to amenities, mass transportation, and entertainment. Hartford is heading in that direction. 

There's also the real possibility that UConn students may use Hartford as an incubator site for new business start-ups, jobs that have real potential unlike hot dog vending. 

The stadium is weak by comparison. There's no guarantee it's going to hit attendance levels (attendance projections have yet to be made public from what I can tell), or generate significant economic development. But it will be a drag on Hartford's budget. 

The public turnout at this council meeting was an early indication that the stadium project is a very hard sell, something I don't think Hartford officials (or the Courant) realized initially. 

I'm glad the public hearing on this project isn't happening until July 21. That gives the news media (assuming they care) enough time to FOIA out all the documents that need to be delivered. 

By the way, I'm really impressed with Real Hartford's report on the public comments. It gives a full airing of what was said. Hartford needs alternatives to the Courant.

 unsuck dc metro has had a great second life on facebook and twitter: https://twitter.com/unsuckdcmetro  Big following and people use it as a kind of universal hashtag.  




 Screw all the keyboard tough guys who are trying to shame publications into publishing stuff they wouldn't have published anyway. 

It seems like a lot of reporters around the world have been killed or have put themselves in gravel peril trying to get the truth out. They and their publications don't have to prove a damn thing. 



 




 As others have already pointed out: Georgetown Running Co. and Fleet Feet in Adams Morgan. I've bought shoes at both. Staff were very helpful. 

I don't get knotted up about prices. Once I started buying good, well fitting shoes, and not the $60 specials, my experience with injuries declined. .  




 You have a great plan. Mandarin is impressive and it should open doors. 

A college newspaper can open doors. It's amazing how many alumni will filter into newsrooms. They will become your first professional network. 

A college paper is a great way to get a taste for working in a collaborative atmosphere. Some of the people I met through my college newspaper have been friends for life, so there is that, too. 
 




 Curious: Do you use a keyboard?  




 have your packages delivered to a third party service, like basecampdc.com 




 This sub has been good at bringing together the major headlines and studies, and I check it fairly regularly. 

Yeah, the conversation is a little lacking. But I suspect if the conversation does pick up, the deniers will be the most aggressive and will be challenging everyone with "show me the studies," crap, just to troll away, and then when that happens, discussion will die down to where it now is.  




 This blog http://homicidewatch.org/  is a good example. The person who founded it won a Neiman http://nieman.harvard.edu/news/2014/09/laura-amico-nf-13-joins-boston-globe/

the point being is this blogger turned out something useful, targeted and focus, but most importantly, it seemed to me, it had a very clear mission. 

Newspapers don't cover local stuff very much anymore. This fellow http://shortarticlesaboutlongmeetings.blogspot.com/ covers local Neighborhood Advisory Commission meetings (ANC) in DC. Don't know him or his plans, but he turns out solid news reports on these meetings, and his work has been gaining readers. 

Arlington Now was nothing but one guy. The blog is not very old, but he has replicated it in four other towns and his blog is loaded with advertising. http://www.arlnow.com/ 

He created his own foothold. 

There's a real hunger out there for people who actually have local news. 

This was a tiny blog five years ago. Now it's a business: http://www.popville.com/

In my view: blogs that get readers do work. they go out and find out stuff that their readers don't know about. Basically, they function likes news orgs. 





 




 They are probably handy with cameras, so some well-made, perhaps silver, photo frames might be useful.  









 You will be hired in a heartbeat. At a newspaper I once worked at, we hired someone with a law degree who came to a similar conclusion about his career path. He had scant news experience but could write clearly and cleanly (editors love that) His great strength was his analytical ability, attention to detail and fact, which gave his work a lot of precision and intelligence. We loved having him on the staff, and he eventually went off to a job with a big league newspaper. 

That aside, legal training will be a wonderful background for statehouse/congressional reporting. 

Contact a local newspaper, ask to speak to an editor, tell him/her what it is you want to accomplish and ask for some freelance assignments -- just to get three or four clips. Also, don't rule out the plethora of websites that cover speciality news, they may be a way to begin to get traction. With so many layoffs, it's a tough world but there are still jobs and writers who have a solid edge (a law degree qualifies) can find work.

 I knew a fellow who was from Ohio. He went to a local college and studied Mandarin. He moved to Taiwan and got a job at an English-language paper thanks to his language skills. That was his dream. 

A foreign correspondent may be one way, but if you can handle the languages your job options may really expand.

 I'm from Connecticut. Moved her in 1998. Love it. Weather is a vast improvement. Glad I gave up the car because they don't know how to plow streets down here.  




 For their appalling disregard of the truth and ethics in order to get pageviews .. 

i don't know if that's the case here. rolling stone has delivered some outstanding work over the years, It's piece,  for instance, a few years back on the Afghanistan general was solid, gutsy work.

RS should invite poytner or some independent journalism professor to do a post-mortem. It would be instructive, to know how this break-down in fact checking happened. 

The root cause of it has certainly not been revealed, so jumping to a conclusion that the motive was a page view grab doesn't make sense, especially considering RS's history in turning out quality work.   
 




 stay out of it. totally. tell the coach to bring up his concerns directly with the reporter. it's pretty weird that the coach felt the needed to go through a third party to reach you. i suspect a private conversation between the coach and reporter will put things back on track. if you become involved, you become involved, and your motives will be suspect.  









 I eat pizza once a week and live knowing that other regions of this great nation will never know what good pizza taste like.  




 Even if you take four majors, you'll still come up short. Climate change, for instance, wasn't really on radar in a big way when I graduated (80s), but now weaves into almost every subject area that you're likely to cover. The best thing to leave college with is a habit for lifelong learning.  




 Great story. It's well researched. It's probing. The reporter is doing her job and asking hard questions. If the story makes some people uncomfortable, that's just great.   




 
I covered a long federal trial about 15 years ago that got international attention. During breaks, reporters would sometimes check their quotes against one another. I noticed that many of the EU/UK reporters knew shorthand, but the U.S. reporters did not.  

There are many instances outside the court where shorthand will help, especially for on the spot interviews. Recorders can also wig-out the people you are interviewing. 

I couldn't find a place that taught it.  




 A guy from Seattle shares impressions of condition of Metro and its stations and he's obviously a troll. Right. That's why conditions at the Metro stations he describes aren't good; it's because people here are blind to them.

 It's not fine. The Financial Times, an economic and business journal, carried the story on its front page, but with a global angle.  

The WSJ opinion pages are anti-climate change. The lack of coverage in the WSJ print edition may be a consequence of its strident editorial page policy. I think it's affecting and clouding news judgment. 

The protest could have been a jumping off point for a more introspective piece targeted to WSJ readers, such as: How much will climate matter in the mid-terms? 

  




 This Huffington Post piece is right on target. On the day of the march, NBC nightly news led its broadcast with the football domestic violence issue. The march -- which attracted over 300,000 people -- was given short coverage a little further down.  









 First we nuked, repeatedly, the Marshall Islands (Bikini Atoll), spread radiation far and wide, and now climate change will finish the islands off.  




 You are representing readers and, by virtue of your job, have a responsibility to ask questions. You can't let your readers down. 

Take this to heart, embrace it, and keep your readers in the forefront of your mind. 

And don't worry about asking dumb questions. In fact, get them to explain every little thing. Be firm about that. It takes a while to get up to speed on a new beat/job.

 I am a few months away from 60 and here is my 401K asset allocation:

Small/mid/specialty: 34%
Large cap growth: 27%
Global International: 22%
Bonds: 15%
Balanced: 1%
Large Cap Value: 1%

I've had this asset allocation for about 10 years. Didn't touch it during the crash.  

But I was planning to get conservative, and was thinking about moving about 50% into bonds, 30% into index and large cap; 10% international and 10% small cap. 

However, with interest rate rise seemingly expected, I'm reading now that bonds may be a bad move, so not sure what do to. But with 5 years left to a theoretical retirement, I want to protect myself. Should I stick with my balance/asset allocation plan or try something else? Thanks for any insights.

 You're making too much out of what's being posted here. This subreddit doesn't focus on acedotes, and I think most of the people here are sophisticated enough to understand that one weather event is just that, one weather event. That doesn't mean it isn't part of a trend. 

But you're raising an argument that extreme weather events aren't rising in frequency, than have at it. When you find an interesting paper supporting this view, please post the link.  
























 If you are set on that area, live closer to 17th. There's more restaurants. It's a closer walk to Adams Morgan, U and P 14, etc., and feels far more like a neighborhood with all the basic shops you need, plus some decent hang-out places. There's a Soviet Safeway nearby and Whole Foods. 

There's a lot of really high-end housing west of Connecticut., and some decent restaurants, but not much else, other than what's on that part of P and Connecticut. If you move there, seriously, you'll spend most of your time crossing Connecticut to get to the East Side.  

Being closer to Georgtown is nice, but that part of town grows old fast. It's more of an out door, higher-end shopping mall surrounded by lovely townhouses. But it does have a good movie theater, an Apple outlet, some good bicycle shops and a decent running store. 

And as far as safety goes? All these areas are safe. But this is a city.  




 Carly Fiorina is the irritating, clueless kid in the classroom wildly waving her hand to get the teacher's attention.  




 Really surprised about Louisiana. Considering its experience with Katrina, and its profound vulnerability, it's seems solidly in the blue camp. It's interesting that Texas is as split as it is.  

Not one community is over 75%, which seems striking.

The alignment seems anchored among along energy producing states and conservative ones. But I do wonder about the rust belt.

Smoking is a reckless, selfish activity that causes real harm to the people who are exposed to it. 

And the entire reason why kids smoke is because adults are too damn stupid to quit.

  No hubris among a lot of low to medium paid scribes doing their best, who had little, if anything good to say about their counterparts doing the same thing, often for less money, in radio and television?

Huh? Not in my universe. There was very little interaction with TV/radio people with 90% of the things we wrote about it. Sure, they were there for the big stories but that was it. I don't know why TV/radio felt put upon; perhaps there was something different about your market. There was almost a complete separation in social spheres because there was little cross-over in working environments. The state house guys, print and electronic, might share a beer, but us city scribes never really interacted all that much. 

for less money

You might want to check that. 

What killed the great American newsroom was the inability of it's business model to adapt to changing circumstances.

Agree, but I don't think they could have changed successfully.  There was no way our newspaper could have survived after our city  in lost roughly 90% of its manufacturing employment and most of the retail shifted to a mall outside the city limit. 

way print journalists were eager to brand themselves as the only "real" journalists doing any work. 

If you don't like print journalists, okay. 

belief that one medium possessed an inherent superiority over another had more to contribute to the decline of newspapers than anyone connected to them is going to be willing to admit.

Again, I don't get this. The best reporters never moved with a "inherent sense of superiority," they worked with a sense of humility, an understanding of how little they really knew, and a deep sense of responsibility, because they understood (in these pre-Internet days) that they had been given a great deal of responsibility to report the news accurately, fairly and fearlessly. I don't recall people sitting around nursing grudges, real or imagined, over things that hardly mattered.  


 




 Back in the day, our news operation had 80% penetration in some of communities. Perhaps news organizations didn't "stitch people together," but they clearly connected them to information. The daily newspaper I started my career at in 1981 didn't keep its readers because of hubris, but because of reporters and editors who produced quality content day after day. 

It wasn't hubris that ended this. There was nothing wrong with the business newspaper model because it was perfectly tuned for economic environment that began vanishing in the 1960s, and before. 

There was no hubris, just a lot low to medium paid scribes doing their best. 

What killed the great American newsrooms was the loss of an ad base as manufacturing declined and retail shifted away from the urban core; it was the advent of corporate journalism, that swept in and acquired vulnerable independent operations. They promised modernization and improvements, but most of what they did was lay off people. And finally it was shift in advertising to multiple models, the arrival of the Web browser in the 1990s that dispersed content and advertising. 

Hubris. Not for a minute, at least among the reporters and editors. Just sadness as careers and lives were swept away with the changing times. 

Yes, the journalism has been separated from the newsrooms of old, and has created many new opportunities. But the newsrooms of their day were great places, full of life, energy. I feel sorry for the folks today who will never experience the great thrill of a newsroom responding to a big story, and barroom banter that followed. 
 









 Good for AP. The word is clearly offensive, and the short version of the, "skins" makes me puke.   




 That's impressive, bold, and I love this line in it: "Governor, Indiana is in a state of crisis. It is worse than you seem to understand."

Indiana is at real risk of becoming an economic backwater. The corporate protest is amazing. I don't recall anything quite like it. They understand something about today's high-skilled, mobile workforce that the lawmakers who back this bill just don't get. The last thing the Indiana newspaper needs is another economic hit, the loss of major sports tournaments, convention business (7 major sponsors pulled out the Indy Big Data Conference schedule in May over the past couple of days), and an always-on-the-defensive state.  

But this front page, screaming editorial, also hints at the desperation in this business.

 This is complete Onion fiction. The quotes aren't real, and for some reason they decided to single out CCSU.  




 The connections you make at any college will help your journalism career. (1) Because I worked at my college paper, I developed a connection with a stringer for a local paper. He graduated before me and we knew each other previously as students. He recommended me as his replacement for vacation and days-off. This gave me my first professional clips. (2) After I graduated, the head of the college's PR department, a former newspaper editor whose pub closed, put me in touch with a former colleague of his who was still in the news business. I got my first full-time job this way.   




 Amazing that its author decided to attack the NYT rather than "its cross-town rival" the WSJ, which runs an opinion page dedicated to the denial of science. This piece is more about RCS pumping itself up.

 Anyone who thinks there is too much opinion in the world is spending too much time on Reddit. 

Providing a platform for a discourse of ideas (how many newspapers run op-eds on a semi-regular basis on philosophical issues?) is one of the NYT's great strengths. From this list, it appears as if the Times has assembled some interesting people.  









 SOP, especially in regard to the White House. It happens on their phone briefings as well. 

Nonetheless, there were a few good question and they elicited non answers. 

One very pointed question was about security of the server. It was nicely framed, dead on target. 

This was one of the best questions. (Transcript: http://time.com/3739541/transcript-hillary-clinton-email-press-conference/)

*QUESTION: Madam Secretary, two quick follow ups. You mentioned the server. Thats one of the distinctions here.

This wasnt Gmail or Yahoo or something. This was a server that you owned. Is that appropriate? Is it  was there any precedent for it? Did you clear it with any State Department security officials? And do they have  did they have full access to it when you were secretary?

And then separately, will any of this have any bearing or effect on your timing or decision about whether or not you run for president? Thank you.

CLINTON: Well, the system we used was set up for President Clintons office. And it had numerous safeguards. It was on property guarded by the Secret Service. And there were no security breaches.

So, I think that the  the use of that server, which started with my husband, certainly proved to be effective and secure. Now, with respect to any sort of future  future issues, look, I trust the American people to make their decisions about political and public matters. And I feel that Ive taken unprecedented steps to provide these work-related emails. Theyre going to be in the public domain. And I think that Americans will find that you know, interesting, and I look forward to having a discussion about that.*


The first part of the reporter's question was dead-on and very professional. "This was a server that you owned. Is that appropriate? Is it  was there any precedent for it? Did you clear it with any State Department security officials? And do they have  did they have full access to it when you were secretary?"

All the short, rapid fire questions were a nice way to target one overarching query:  Did the State Dept. approve this system and monitor it for security? 

The reporter should have stopped right there. Instead, she bundled in a second question, a completely separate question, which gave Clinton a fast exit to a less thorny topic. 

I've learned as a reporter it's best just to ask one question at these dog and pony shows. The best question. If you bundle two separate topics in two separate questions -- or three questions which was also done at the Clinton presser -- your odds of getting anything answered fall dramatically. 

And if you just ask one question, and it gets a non-response, there's a chance another reporter may pick-up the thread and give it a try. If your one question isn't  answered, yell "follow-up," because the need for the follow-up will be obvious if the question isn't answered.   




 new would be old. someone who can't stand social media, and who still believes the best way to get information is to knock on doors and make phone calls, and who still understands that the world can't be defined in a collection of top 10 list. 




  human extinction is on the table?

I don't think so and hopefully it's not false optimism. Well before irreversible calamity we will react. We will put all our science, resources, vast intelligence, and powers of empathy and cooperation, to reverse course and undo the damage. But for this to happen, we need to get closer to the edge so the temps will rise at least two degrees before that happens.  
 




 Well, maybe it's true then that the media attracts narcissistic people who are insecure, need constant affirmation and tend to pump up accomplishments to win approval.  




 What's the difference between curator and gatekeeper? 

The real issue is credit. MSM organizations seem to give credit, when they must, to the local blog that is first to report something significant. 

Giving credit is the best that can be done here. MSM should treat the citizen journalists in their communities the same way they treat any pub they are referencing. It helps with credibility and improves, one hopes, mutual respect.  

Curated lists arguably serve as gatekeepers because they source narrowly.   

In my city, DC, centralized journalism works something like this: A local blog, for instance, reports on planning for a new condo in the neighborhood; real estate blogs do likewise, but carry their reporting further by writing about city-wide trends and mapping it to data. The centralized pubs, The Post, Washington Times, City Paper, and neighborhood print weekly newspapers, broaden the story into an assessment of District's changing landscape, affordability issues, and demographic shifts, and, most importantly, can get top officials to pick up the phone and explain what's going on, something the neighborhood blogs, and citizen journalists, can't do.  




 it's anon. it's unverified. the motivations of the writers are unknown. its dangerous and it won't give your story the authority it needs.  









 This is just depressing  




 I don't doubt that medical students might benefit from media training. But the idea of increasing the knowledge of journalists who report on these matters, is a good thing as well, and probably necessary.  




 Plainville as well. Loved that place. Popcorn, decent food. Nice atmosphere.  




 A fellow I worked with did just that. I believe the state even had a program to fast track professionals to a teaching certificate. I never had the chance to ask him how it worked out for him. But kind of believe that journalism and teaching are similar in a way, in as much as the people doing this work believe they are helping others.  









 I've used Sony IC recorders for years because of the transcription software: Sound Organizer and the earlier Digital Voice Editor. They have customize keyboard controls, so you can set up the Stop, Play, etc., to the key combination works best. I believe you can use this software for any mp3 file from any device, and probably other formats as well, But you are using a non-Sony recorder, you will probably have to make a number of clicks to bring up the file. Not that hard to do. 

I'm very interested in Sony's field recorders, but don't believe they have native support for Sound Organizer. They are more targeted, it appears, for people recording live music, not journalists transcribing notes. 

But very interested in hearing from anyone who prefers field recorders on the job over the more standard voice recorders. 
 




 Oh, right, climate change is real - 'let's build the pipeline.'
 
What they should have done is attached James Hansen's "game over" piece to the legislation: http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/10/opinion/game-over-for-the-climate.html?_r=0

It's the height of irony that the Senate is approving a project that may send the earth's climate over the edge, while at the same time agreeing that climate change is real. 

To say that this is totally f**** up is an understatement.  




 This is why I miss covering local news. The riches.  





























 Thanks! 














 Every single thing this author publishes, it seems, is posted on this sub.  




 Good for Petula.  




 It's not that they published them, it's how they got them that will be the issue. All ESPN has to do is defend the right to protect its sources if this turns ugly and it may. The hospital may have a responsibility to discover how or if the law was broken here. 

As an aside, it's weird that ESPN even felt compelled to publish them. I mean, a missing finger is not something anyone in sports can easily hide. Why would the team's organization deny it? They'd have to address it. It's not like the medical records are disclosing some mysterious illness. 




 outside of Bernie Sanders, who sees a need for an urgent response, climate change hardly registers among the presidential candidates. It is depressing. 




 A discussion about the 'ethics' of taking photos of topless women at a beach? You're kidding right?  It doesn't rise to that level. Complete jerk is more like it. 

Just to be clear: If someone at the beach were to smack this photo happy 'journalist,' take his camera and fling it in the direction of the resident shark, the gofundme to handle the legal cost for this citizen avenger will soar.



The hed: Man who punched topless beach news photographer raises $100K 

The kicker: News photographer who says he was acting 'ethically'  is suspended by newspaper




 




 A separate point: Ask CCSU where most of its graduates end up. They will tell you that many stay in the state and locate in Central Connecticut. There are many people who will rent off campus housing and then stay in that housing once they graduate and start working. These are exactly the people you want in New Britain. Adopting housing regulations that deliberately attempt to force them out of town, is a non-starter for NB's future.  




 I'm fundamentally optimistic about NB. 

I do think that NB has much potential, especially as a magnet for young people. The housing, parks, access to education and good transportation links weigh in its favor. 

Personally, I'd like to see the city capitalize on the new bus system and focus on building housing in its downtown, especially condos that are affordable and appealing to young people. I do think Central Connecticut is moving in the mass transit direction, gradually, and to a point where people may choose to live without a car and rely more on mass transit, and I think NB should capitalize on it.  

My point is that the tendency to point fingers at the most recent mayor(s) overlooks the historical trends that many good people who served in elected office have been unable to overcome. 

 




 New Britain has been in a deep hole for decades. It completely lost its manufacturing base in the 1970s and 1980s. Most of the retail relocated outside its borders. It lost a huge portion of its downtown land to two massive intersecting highways.

There is no mayor who can fix these problems. Any candidate who says they can is delusional. There is no one mayor responsible. Where do you start? With the redevelopment decisions in the 1950s and 60s that destroyed many of the city's most architecturally unique buildings? Remember the Strand? Probably not. Or the decision on the highway? Or the shift in retail away from downtown to West Farms? What mayor do you blame for the massive lost of jobs and tax revenue? Almost every effort by the city to bring in new developers comes up short in some key aspect. Who is the major developer of downtown? Over the last three decades NB is. First, it renovated City Hall. Then it renovated the Gates building to create a new home for the school department, and it built a new police station. The state is responsible for the other new downtown development. CCSU and the court house complex and now the bus system. There's almost no private sector interest. New Britain's economic strategy has been on life support since the 1980s. 

Although you may want to blame this mayor or that mayor or whatever, New Britain's core problem is it has no tax base other than a residential taxbase. It can't tax what it doesn't have. It's increasingly dependent on the redistribution of wealth via the state. 

There's no demand for what New Britain offers: Empty industrial lots. 

I'm not writing this as an apologists or defender of any mayor. The fact of the matter is New Britain -- all tiny 13 sq miles of it -- has completely lost its economic tax base to its neighbors and China. There's almost no room to build anything in the city anymore, and other towns have reaped the benefits from the spending power of New Britain residents who buy almost everything, other than groceries, outside of the city. 

The longstanding efforts to revitalize downtown have lurched along because there's no population growth in NB or in Connecticut. There's no real job growth, and if the insurance industry keeps consolidating ... 
 









 Lived outside of Belvedere on Lawlor and Miller for more than 20 years. There was no climate of fear.  




  "Lock your doors and don't make eye contact."

That's harsh and most definitely not true.  




 Is it legal to define "students" as a separate group, and then set up a rule to discriminate against them? 

And restricting by parking? The drafters of this legislation know that the vast majority of multi-family houses do not have enough offstreet parking. This legislation appears to limit -- "three (3) bedrooms -- (3) three spaces" -- so does this mean you can have a three bedroom unit (common enough in a three-family house) and not be able to rent to students because you don't have corresponding three off-street parking spaces?

This is a totally BS piece of legislation. 

New Britain can't treat students as a separate class of people and apply special rules against them. It can't. It can't say these rules only apply to students, and not to people who are not students? You can't do that. 

(Here's something else: A lot of CCSU students are vets. They don't want to live in dorms. I was one. Putting in a requirement that a family contact be available is offensive to the extreme.) 

New Britain needs to grow up. If the corporation counsel gives this ordinance a green light, I would strongly suggest that opponents counter with a resolution for a second opinion from a lawfirm with real expertise in these matters. 

 I hope NB is sued over it. 
 




 Wow -- that video is something else. It would be a great beginning to an end-of-world film.  




 Norm Matloff, a computer science professor at the University of California at Davis, provides some commentary/background on the Primer, which was penned by John Miano, a programmer who later earned a law degree.

 If you are writing up a layoff that involves tech workers, there's a very good chance they were replaced with lower cost foreign workers in the U.S. on a temporary H-1B visa. Their severance may have been contingent on training their visa holding replacement. 

Here's a example of a local report in the Dallas Morning News: http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20150516-schnurman-fossil-sells-out-its-tech-workers.ece 














 Only $180 billion? That's a rounding error in the federal budget.  




 As president, Jeb Bush will cut as many federal workers as possible. This is from his 2003 Florida governor Inaugural address at the Florida state capitol building. 

"There would be no greater tribute to our maturity as a society than if we can make these buildings around us empty of workers, silent monuments to the time when government played a larger role than it deserved."

 Fine idea. But would rather see a support infrastructure for local bloggers who are committed to local reporting: help with design, legal issues, and most importantly, a clearinghouse or network that can funnel ads to local blogs. 

There are many local bloggers trying to do some reporting. But they make zip from things like google ads, and don't have the experience, time or technical know-how to sell local ads. 

Instead of creating a jobs program, this $3 million would be better spent incubating and helping local bloggers establish a base. 

Another reason I'd have problems with a jobs program, I'm also mistrustful of any program that selects people for the job. Based on what criteria? I'd run, instead, with self-selected people who have already demonstrated some commitment to local reporting.   




 This pope is wonderful. He's taking on the world in an entirely new way. 









 the headline is clickbait, the piece is kinda meandering and doesn't really move the ball forward. but it's harmless, a little brassy, and entertaining.  




 great piece; very informative about Dr. Oreskes.  




 did the source contact you via your new work email? If so, then your source is interested in working with you.  




 Reporters, in my experience, are mostly introverts and loathe "personal branding."    









 The negative folks are always there; like crickets in the background. But when you nail a good story that brings some real change, the cricket noise will be drowned out -- at least for a little bit of time.  

It's always been this way (pre-Internet guy here.) People were always down about something ('Why don't you cover more local news?'). It never ends. 

It's only when they stop commenting/complaining that you have to worry. 
 




 I think the weather is doing all the talking. How many "extreme" events does it take to get people to at least think that there might be a problem?  




 Well, that's a plus for news orgs that are covering Sanders, because there is clear reader interest (traffic) on pieces about Sanders.   














 And so it starts; the path to entitlement, favors.  









 Hed should be *some* of the media reaction ... As the CJR notes, NYT's Carlotta Gall, and some others, suggest Hersh is on to something. 

But the CJR is right to call out the hit pieces. 

Anonymous sourcing is unavoidable in some things, but Hersh has proven his metal. 

 




 Check out his page views.  




 What's interesting about Drudge is that in terms of design and format he is anti-change. 

In a time where news orgs are changing designs every two or three years, Drudge keeps his format simple, consistent, so 1990s. And it works. 

There's a case to made for consistency. People like it. It's like the Citgo sign at Fenway. It started as a sign; now its an iconic landmark. It's part of the landscape. People love it. It's part of what they identify with, and that's what Drudge is now -- an iconic site that people now read what they want into it: It's conservative, its influential, its .... whatever. You can look at the links and debate those things. But the one indisputable thing about Drudge is its consistency, and it works with readers. That's what news orgs should be thinking about. 
 
  




 I would bring a couple of notebooks and tell the kids to write down their names before they break ranks. Take your own photos. They'll cooperate. It's in everyone's interest to make their parents proud. 
 









 What happens if they don't get 2,500 entries?  




 Great work! 




 it neglects argument that climate change is already a moral imperative. 

where's the issue? that climate change inaction is somehow morally neutral? There's no pathway to neutrality unless you are severely delusional.  



 



 




 If the holes existed for a decade, does it mean that anyone who used these facilities over this period can make a similar claim? Are you making this a class action? 

 









  
-- Q. What's your news angle? A. I'm not sure. At this point I'm just trying to connect with authoritative sources who can help explain the issue. (An iteration of SurlyDave's response) 

-- Q. Will our company be the focus of your story? A. Not sure. It might. It really depends on the strength of the interview. (This one often works best for me, because the PR folks do get the fact that their source has to be interesting and quotable.) 

 









 That link is to Heartland. 




 Stephen Moore is a Fox News contributor. Moore is the Distinguished Visiting Fellow, Project for Economic Growth, at The Heritage Foundation.

Heritage, if not an outright denial organization, minimizes the impact of climate change and is skeptical of the global scientific consensus. It works to shoot down just about any economic and global plan for dealing with it.

We talk about [tripling] in terms of revenue for the company, but there is a direct correlation with between revenue and personnel, said VandeHei. If we are going to realise our ambitions we need a lot more reporters and a lot more people on the business side. 




 This is a very apocalyptic piece and it's great that CNN ran it.
