 I am out of shape and not buff like Ken. If i had him flattened out with both arms around his neck I would have finished him no doubt. I don't care if Ken is over the hill. There is no way he shouldn't have finished that in that position. I don't buy it. 




 what about old man strength? and the massive  of cycle of steroids Ken just did?  




 The ease with which Kimbo got up should be convincing enough if Ken's inability to finish was not.  




 worse! it was fixed 




 because ken wasn't actually trying to submit him 




 because it was 




 I think so. 




 Ken lost that on purpose! **FIX**

 Ken is the most fake person in MMA. Kimbo can't even walk, but I am rooting for him to KO Ken.  









 I honestly think Jimmy might take the job and never give it back, just like Tom did.

you're right, we do have to incentivize it, both monetarily and with shine 




 Could crossfit maybe make an impact?  




 that sounds about right 




 For the masses, yes it kind of does.  




 I think you have identified the cause of the problem.

we can't all be andrew luck fans, can we? 




 Other countries have lifters who are in the olympics at 19 or 20, and our lifters aren't lifting anywhere in the same universe as them. Why are these tiny nobody countries, no offense  I just mean in terms of population and work presence, putting elite lifters up there and we're not? Even North Korea is kicking our butts. North Korea! The country we make fun of all the time and is starving to death.

 I got to see Moon towards the end of his career. He was special. 









 We have our three major sports and hockey as a 4th major regional sport. Soccer isn't on the radar. We did just beat Germany though, so the future is bright.  




 thanks, he's been right about so much! 




 ah, thanks 




 It bothers me that the Chinese dominate. I respect their athletes, but I wish we'd value weight lifting.

 You're rihgt, there could have been many different motives, but cccam's razor = hate crime 




 how is it unethical? it was a hate crime, it is relevant  




 Because America is run by corporations and special interests like the NRA (national rifle assocation). They own about 95% of all politicians. They don't serve the interests of the citizenry. Also, our values are defunct. We have mass shootings all the time, but people value extreme gun rights more than they do people's lives. This is why it's a lot easier to purchase a gun than it is to vote. 




 right now 




 about what? like which particular bit of his are you referring to? i'm genuinely curious  




 i'm not caught up on the american lifting scene, hence my question 




 Not sarcasm. We do though if you consider all the sports.  




 u want sugar coating?  




 How is it disgusting? Isn't that exactly what happened?

 Thanks. So, we have pretty much nothing? :(

 Mayweather has already defeated Cotto, Alvarez, and Pacquiao. Amir Khan appears beneath his level. 

Why not put Golovkin in front of Mayweather and watch what he can do? Beating an undefeated, soon to be 20 knockouts in a row, and larger fighter would be the most difficult challenge of his apparent options, and if he wins, it would solidify his position as TBE. 

**Money** vs **GGG** 
























 HBO does with boxing. It gives more information to the viewer and improves the viewing experience.  The UFC added vegas odds, so why not make this change?  














 My school offered an unsubsidized loan that covers only half of my tuition. I think I have reached the 57.5k total limit. I have to find the rest of the tuition, a few thousand in nursing school fees, books, etc. I'm male. I have a previous bachelors degree in a social science. 90% of the 57.5k is from nursing school. A $10-15/hr job probably won't cut it.  I could use some realistic ideas. Nothing illegal.

 Great engines, horrible name. I get it, they are economical and they give a boost, but could Ford not come up with a more attractive name for their turbocharged engines? "Eco" sounds weak and un-American.  

















































 The Lakers 2015 first round pick of course.  Top 5 protected in 2015, top 3 protected in 2016/7, unprotected in 2018.

Would the sixers be interested in Goran Dragic and or Gerald Green?  














 Assuming Jose is still the Champ at the time. Would this date be perfect?

 They'll recycle it, I'm sure of it. And Hillary's army hasn't even got started yet.  




 what are you doing to Silva's thumb? 




 is there a comprehensive list of where Sanders will be? I'd like to go if he comes to my hometown 




 They lost their coach and many players. Their QB isn't playing up to expectations. The three teams in their division are better.  




 did someone play my mix tape?  




 a lot can happen from now and next november  




 while it's reaching to take something out of context that he wrote before most of us were even born, I'm sure it won't stop Hillary's Pac's from using it 




 If he wins Iowa and New Hampshire his chances become real. 




 He doesn't have the same mechanics bruh! It's apples and oranges.

Just look at their footwork and releases.  




 He's pure. The only thing I have heard negative about him so far is he wrote some erotica like 40 something years ago. When they try to catch him by calling him a socialist or wanting to raise taxes etc, he doubles down on it and wins. 














 For a a short QB they won't pay more than Cam Newton? you're overpaying 




 The best I can do is WR Jaron Brown and a second round pick.  




 it's not the colbert report, it's stephen colbert 




 it's not the colbert report, it's stephen colbert 














 It's a typo. They listed him at [6'7](http://search.draftexpress.com/profile/Anthony-Brown-6222/), which means they rounded up from 6'6 1/2. If he was 6'8 1/2 with shoes they would have listed him at 6'9.

 The Lakers signing somebody, be it Gasol or Aldridge or somebody else.

 I actually think he'll be an all-star in a few years.

 There's substantive issues to take with Clinton, but they focus on nonsense.  



















 Please let him be the Republican nominee!  




 What if my religion is against straight marriage? I want to impose my values on everyone! No more straight marriages!  









 You're right. She could have grown. She should embrace that angle and tell how republicans they can do the same.  




 Totally. You can't use your religion to impose your morality on other people. What if my religion is for gay marriage? Your religion can't impose its  values on laws of the land over mine.  




 Hillary used to say marriage is between a man and a woman. But now apparently she's LGBT supporter #1. 

She's an opportunist.  



















 We are unfortunately the minority.  




 Why not strip Aldo? Make it so only Conor can become the champ if he wins.  


































 Stop subjecting yourself to fox news and stop with the CAPS.

 I'd rather have him Congress than as a VP that Hillary will shove off to the side while she's taking her husband's advice.

 I'll be voting for him 100% and I'm talking to many people I know and trying to get their vote too.

 Love Makwan, but he isn't ready. He should try beating someone with a wikipedia page first.  




 Maybe he missed every ethics meeting ever?  




 If the ACA unravels million of people would stand to lose health insurance. Many of them would be in red states. I think if Republicans get their way on defeating the ACA, it will assure Democrats take the Presidency and both the House and Senate.  




 Sanders is the only moral candidate.  




 You realize the Bush administration set us on a death spiral and the Obama administration brought us back, right? Sanders would bring up the middle class. You know what people in the bottom 50% do with money? They spend it. His rebuilding infrastructure alone would do wonders for the economy. Millions of new jobs and many positive externalities.  




 Paul wants a flat tax. Neither will happen, unless congress goes pure red or pure blue. Does this take away from the fact that Sanders would be the best President possible for 99% of Americans?  









 Len is garbage. Pick 13 is likely garbage. The two other picks are likely not worth much either. Bledsoe is all we'd really be giving up. 




 Bledsoe, Len, pick 13, 2016 first round pick, 2017 Heat pick.

 It says gymnasium, not oven. 




 His brother is a politician in England :) 




 You should reconsider your views on socialism. Learn more about it. 




 What if I told you Sanders's positions are aligned with the public more than Paul's was? And even more than all the so called mainstream aka corporately owned candidates?  




 I was wondering where the photonic cannon was in the finale against the borg.

 he wrote that think like 40 years ago, he's old, he too far left, etc etc BS 
























 So you get the far superior player and a pick? Good lucking signing Aldridge and Love.  




 Other Suns fans will have different opinions, but I agree with you and I think the front office is fickle.  














 It appears he's on the block and Phoenix will take a half decent offer because they're eager to unload him. What are possible trades and what is the best Phoenix could do?  




 Because I don't have to buy food from the one grocery store you go to. I don't have to chicken with broccoli to live. I can substitute ramen and cans of tuna and live off of that. But if I need a particular procedure, what choice do I have? I think you should reconsider.

We really don't have to reinvent the wheel. We have medicare and we can use that as our base. Just look at every other developed country. There's not that much mystery. Single payer would be better.  




 These are great questions!!! Let's hope we hear them in the debates.  









 oh, this is making me remember stats 




 why? 









 The markets of supermarkets and heatlhcare are very different! If I don't buy Safeway's overpriced  produce, I'm not going to die. I have many other options to buy groceries. I can even grow some food myself. Now, what happens if I need medical care? The inelastic demand curve says I have buy the product no matter how much everyone is going to rip me off. If there was medicare for everyone the government can bring down prices drastically just like every other country does. That is the power of a single provider.  




 [God wills it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ez6wfJWVCeI), Sanders will win! 



















 this is a win for democracy and Americans  




 It never is to get progress. It can be done though. 




 which website is giving those odds? 




 it makes sense 




 exactly 














 Let's not confuse the 2% who are part of organization with those that support it. [42%](http://pnhp.org/blog/2009/04/03/how-many-doctors-support-single-payer/) support it according to one source. With the implementation of the ACA and it's success, those numbers could be even higher if a survey was conducted now. 




 This is a great ruling! It gives power to the people rather than politicians.  



















 Just when we think we're becoming more progressive and humane as  a country, we're reminded that we still execute people. We have a long way to go. 









 Great observations, it definitely would be a huge plus for business. 

[Many doctors](http://www.pnhp.org/) are for single payer FYI. 

Fuck insurance companies. 

Fuck politicians.  




 the merc s class assure me they aren't 




 That's called true love. 




 no, that's not for us, we prefer paying a lot more than you and getting less care and paying a lot more for procedure sand medications cause 'Murica  




 GGG should start talking up Floyd as much as possible like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGIIleYLpRY)

 Sanders has a 11/1 hance according to vegas. I think you're very optimistic if you think you have a 1 in 11 chance of dating her. 




 Free agents don't want to play for Sarver.

 A little bit, but not like for profit medicine.  




 He's not repealing the law. He's trying to add something better. 




 Why doesn't he sit out until they pay him? If he's only making 1.5m it seems like it's worth it. 




 Yes for the rich it's the best. For your average American it is not. 




 He **did not** fight for the public option. He gave it up faster than girl on prom night.  




 He is. Let go of conventional thinking. 



















 government actually is more efficient FYI 




 Jesus? Who's that? Never heard of him.  




 Yes, I can see it now. Can we put you out of business? No, you wouldn't like that? You'd prefer to keep charging twice as much as you need to? Ok.  




 I'm sorry. 




 you could maybe get a new job?  









 I think it could show confidence and leadership if one of the republicans declared it. Somebody has to set themselves apart. 




 republicans? lol 




 You  have to at least try even if it's going to fail at first. Obama could have set a bridge for it if he delivered the public option that he promised. 




 Wait, what? doctors can barely make a middle class living? do you know doctors? because all the doctors I have come across and know are making a ton of money

I'm totally for abolishing for profit healthcare and pharm though 




 Jewish carpenter who works for the poor and those in greatest need? Where have I heard that before? 




 Some doctors are greedy pigs. Some doctors actually know how to use medicare to make a lot of money. If everyone was insured they would get care from their PCP instead of waiting to get seriously kill and go to the ER.  




 When there is one giant insurer they set the price. They tell companies what they will pay and they make them compete. It lowers the prices significantly! We have so many other countries that prove this. It's why things costs so much more in America. 

Single payer will reduce costs.  




 If anyone is peacocking, it's Trump or maybe Jindal. Sanders is realizing his goals. 




 You know that medicare currently sets the prices, right?
 




 And the high prices due to inelastic demand is immoral.  




 Did they say it though? 




 Obviously private insurance companies would be **-**, but the money saved from their profits and administrative costs would be a **net gain** for the economy.  




 that's another monster 




 Yes, govt is the insurance company just like they are for medicare and for vets. It doesn't stop you from purchasing anything though. 




 [like this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Health_Care_Act) 









 I can count. You can't be more than 100% sure. If you say anything more it means you're lying.  




 Fisher was a role player. Curry lead his team.  




 he has mad cardio too bruh 




 but the other candidates don't

hillary doesn't 




 considering we pay double to triple what other european countries pay while providing inferior care to those european countries, I think we could use a change 




 that's not nice 




 Whenever someone says they're over 100% sure they're wrong.

 Curry. Better shooter and better teammate.  




 She won't directly answer the question to not seem like she's taking anything for granted. She'll say something about her supporters and her mission etc etc. 




 Luck you! 




 Yes we do. It shows that his momentum and support is large everywhere he goes.  




 I think they have more empathy but more in touch? That's definitely arguable. Clintons make more in one month than Bernie's net worth. 




 You're  right. For profit is immoral and inefficient.  




 You haven't heard others saying it now, have you? 




 What kind of odds are you giving me? 




 You are not as you are born. You are as you make yourself and as you live your life. Just look at Jindal. 

Same here, I'll support the Democratic nominee. I won't be excited about it though. Hillary is a corporate democrat. 




 Not quite a solid argument there bud. 














 I'll be excited when I see Bernie leading Hillary in a poll. 




 I'm sure he knows this. He's pretty busy. I think you have to be strategic where you go and in what order.  














 You're right, his supporters currently are almost exclusively white. That will change. There is no other candidate that matches up to Bernie in terms of record or policies that support minorities.

 legally though?  




 I think a lot of the west coast and other parts of the country would love to see him in person. 




 It is Hillary's to lose. And there is a lot of time to lose it. 









 I think we need to get [Lenne Hardt to introduce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-wCXgS_dYE) Bernie. Some pyrotechnics wouldn't hurt either.  




 It's still early. We'll see how things start shaping up towards the end of the year. 




 Bernie cares about the environment and he won't sacrifice it to corporate overlords because he's not a puppet like all the republicans and Clinton.  




 His plugs are even worse than Trump's elaborate comb over, but at least he's super tall. It would definitely be a different dynamic if it were a three way race, but I think being the only alternative to Hildawg is working out for Bernie. 




 You're right. He and his campaign realize this though and they're working on it. Plus, early states create momentum.  














 if only i could bet legally on sports and whatnot in my state :/ 

but I can't, not even draftkings 




 People love Bernie too. 




 I saw him 11/1 at another site.  




 You got a time machine bruh? Because if you do, he's 11-1 right now and we can become very rich! 




 McCain had lapses and said questionable things. Sanders is sharp. 




 He's running as a Democrat. If he loses the primary, he's not running as a third party candidate. 




 No he's not :) 

About the same age as John McCain when he ran. And Sanders is healthy and sharp.  




 As an Atheist, no Yoel. I'm not going to go for Jesus. This is a secular country. Keep your religion to yourself.  




 I bet they pull a Jon Jones and delete that tweet.  




 You can thank God and such, but keep the proselytizing to yourself, especially when it is bigoted and not PC. And you can be sure this will blow up beyond MMA. When that happens, you can be sure he's suspended or cut. Whatever action the UFC decides to take, Romero brought that upon his self.  




 Without being political or talking about religion, let's just the Abrahamic religions are not tolerant of homosexuality. This is what happens when proselytizing goes wrong. 




 Will he get suspended or outright cut?  




 what did he say exactly? go for jesus not gay jesus? i couldn't understand him 




 all they need are headlines and soundbites

facts don't matter to the media 
























 This is the nature of the game and sports. Some of the best players of the 90's made less in their entire careers compared to average players of the 2000s. 




 If Romney decided to come back in, would he be a big favorite? 




 Good for her! Women will vote for Hillary for the same reason Barack Obama got almost all of the black vote. She's one of them. I'm not saying it's logical, but it's how people think. 




 Does it seem like teams are overpaying players just so they can lock them up and not pay them when the new CBA takes effect? 




 because certain people were raised to be prejudiced and not like brown or black people 




 People like to vote for people who look and sound like them.  














 Not that bad? Just the wars and disastrous tax cuts that lead to a near depression economy make him horrible to me. And there is so much more too.  




 Why doesn't he tell ownership if you don't pay me now I refuse to sign with you ever again? I'm only playing to keep my stock up and sign with another team when the time comes. 




 will Aaron Rodgers be there? 




 What did you expect signing all those AARP expendables?  




 if biden announced though he'd be second :/  




 LeBron won't like this 




 I'm sure fox execs are yelling, get those damn interns to find something! read them again!  




 Bush is known for his endless wars, tax cut for the rich, and destroying the economy. Obama got a lot accomplished and has a strong resume in the history books! 









 That's kinda cool! will you be like matt damon in elysium or borg in star trek now?  









 Interim title fight over regular title fight? really?  



















 Steroids will now be allowed as long as you don't inject during the match. Half time is ok.  




 I think it's more of the banks and corporate puppeteers than Hillary per se 














 who is the main event now??? 









 This should be obvious to everyone. I don't even think he's that racist. I think he's pandering to the voters in the party. 




 she's supporting hillary now and doing her dirty work 




 We just need enough of them not to, but I know you're right. 




 Until she starts up again. Give it time. There is a lot of time between now and the primary election. She deserves criticism. She came out of nowhere to attack Sanders. Not his positions, not his policies, but the man. Why did she do this? Who is she working for? 



















 So, what about the issues? what about substance? Oh right, it's easier to just attack a source and not talk about those things like claire mccaskill. 




 oh yeah? people in western europe struggling to escape? like germans want to run away from their universal healthcare and free university education?  




 why don't you worry more about content than sources? there is no desperation, it's a hail marry to begin with  



















 Why are you making an ad hominem attack? Why don't you just address the content? Some politicians are more in touch with people than others. Reliability is a fair issue. 




 Voting record bruh. I'm good.  




 She's not that liberal. She is a corporate democrat. She is a warhawk. She has a voting record. Are you familiar with it? Her backers are banks. She voted  for the war. And they are not lies or smears. They simply asked people who they thought the mansions belonged to.  




 We can and we should. We don't because Wall Street owns all of the republicans and half of the democrats, those like Hillary Clinton, Claire McCaskill, everyone who voted for the trade deal, and the President himself.  




 You mean Hillary Clinton's campaign donors? 




 To me Hillary is no different than republicans. She's a corporately owned and a warhawk. Sometimes conservatives are right about issues and in their criticisms.  




 I think it's important to consider material based on the content rather than making an ad hominem judgment. Wall Street is paying for her campaign.  




 No, of course not, just like I would not vote for someone only based on their sex. But it raises important questions. Can she relate to me? Where did she get all that money? IMO no she can't and she got that money from her Wall Street friends who pay her millions of dollars every year for speeches and are paying for her campaign.  




 Because they concentrate their wealth at the cost of everyone else. Us "wingers", what does that mean again? Well, anyway, we believe in equality, social mobility and the [American Dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acLW1vFO-2Q).  



















 All the revenue streams you listed will not be realized by a majority of fighters.  




 We need to catch and surpass Hillary Clinton's 990k. 




 exactly! i wish someone with skills would do some Sanders Dragon Ball Z animations  




 they obviously spent the minimum money on this project and don't care at all about the fighters

they're robbing them and insulting them 




 It's indicative of Reebok's leadership. Any competent company would have oversight and checks.

 He talks about it more in the actual 60miutes story, but I can't seem to find it. He basically said they have horrible leadership, a bunch of clowns working for them. I think UFC's kits are further evidence of that. 




 They're a horrible corporation on the decline. Listen to what the [Crossfit owner said about Reebok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKnMQKU_-b8).  




 are we doing a betting pool? i'm going to say 12,000

 crossfit is ditching reebok once their contract is up

the owner hates reebok 




 that sounds about right 
























 This is telling of the quality of Reebok. Crossfit will leave them when their contract is up. Reebok is a garbage brand and they have some of the worst higher ups in the clothing business.  




 I wish. I can't afford that either. If only there was a free event.  




 I can buy 4 of the pride shirts or one ugly Reebok shirt? It's not really a choice. 




 it is possible they'd have to pay WWE if they used CM Punk? 




 i was trying to be funny 




 they own his likeness, i'm sure they knows they'll be using his name long after he's dead  




 ;) 




 female presenter gets [roasted](https://twitter.com/theMMAcommunity/status/615897111754768384) 




 this guy [sums it up](https://twitter.com/acmalin927/status/615898673658986496), the uniforms take away individuality  




 there is a [Georges](https://twitter.com/fishisoff/status/615898902256947200/photo/1) top too 









 very lol 




 was there even one fighter who looked genuinely happy?  




 That design could have been thrown together in under an hour. I would never wear Reebok's ugly clothes.  




 this kit was disappointing  




 that smacking noise he's making with his mouth is very annoying 




 happens sometimes 




 typical UFC

the problematic start is symbolic of their fight kit and the reebok deal 




 You're right. He doesn't have to reach all of them. Just enough of them at the right times. 









 The USA is not the UK. And Labour is much further to the left than Sanders. 




 fox news will spin this and say we have to begin bombing Iran ASAP 




 they got citizens united and still get to execute people, you can't win em all bad guys!  




 If only there was protection. We need to protect American jobs. We can have a strong economy if people make livable wages, like in all of those well paying manufacturing jobs that have been shipped overseas   Americans should not have to compete with slave labor.  





























 let's see if he can it up with the new testing policy, his cycling windows might have to get larger, but jacksons is good at what they do 




 This isn't new. This is what she does. People know what she is before training with her. And her fighters never break down mentally in a fight. 




 are these kits like a big chunk of the supposed pay ufc fighters are getting? do they get some coupons or vouchers for meals at the soup kitchens too? 




 beer goggles bruh

and that voice! omg, I want to be Matt Hamill 




 as it should be, champs can't miss weight, none of this Paulo Filho BS 




 If the Dems can win the next two presidential elections there is a very good chance the court could be drastically reshaped to be progressive 6-3. 




 Say the Rebels win. What are the chances they turn on Irael in a decade or two? 




 How do NATO allies feel about this?  




 great video! 














 If the average American can what? 

Get rid of the cap on social security taxes. This does not affect the average American at all. If you expand medicare it will bring costs down. Those are the primary social costs. 

And take it easy on defense spending, corporate welfare, and tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires. And stop the banks for gouging everyone.  




 That's dishonest, so republican style for sure. 

But it wasn't socialism that ruined Greece. It was Greece that ruined Greece. A country can function only so long when people retire young, nobody pays taxes, and everyone wants services. 

Western Europe shows us what democatic socialism is.  




 **Boxing**. Heavyweight champion of the world! **Klitschko vs James**

He has great footwork, balance, height, and reach.  




 or vice versa?  




 i bet he  could practice for a few months and play on any team 




 what particularly? granted, he's very fast, but he's too big to be running sub 10second 100's or sub 20 second 200's 




 Imagine Megatron but even bigger. LeBron is crazy fast too! 

 




 there are many people whose parents lose it 




 you want the 2nd pick for a first rounder next year?  




 he's 11 to 1 so you're wrong :) 




 Barack campaigned as a progressive. He ended up governing as a center of right moderate. He didn't even try to get the public option. Somehow he's called a socialist by the right who more insane every day with the tea party. The Jewish guy who is a socialist democrat is the only honest candidate. He puts American workers first. He doesn't have corporations and the banking industry backing him like Hillary Clinton. 

I think you're making a good choice.  




 there's like a 2% chance of that happening
 




 thank you, you were right 




 He should not take VP if offered. Why would anyone want to be her VP? We all know Bill will have more power than the VP. Also, Bernie does great work in the senate.  




 Muslim? Since when? And gay? Did you see some polling somewhere that you would care to share with me? 

Personally, I'd like to see an atheist become president but i'm not holding my breath. 




 he panders to racists and is now #2 for the GOP 




 and free speech is something the government can't hinder, as far as the company you work for? oh yeah 




 It's not rehosted. Rings of fire does the program.  




 and he has decent feet! dirk 2.0 









 Kristaps Porzingis 




 The answer is not that simple. The race is dynamic and there are many factors we have to consider. I'm sure it will depend on each particular state. 




 can't reach more catholics if people are drowning and dying off 














 [no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31g0YE61PLQ) 
























 your goals are mediocrity  




 lol 




 I think they are. They're playing at a high level. 

He's old but not "old". 




 because i asked this question? 




 their two best players, guards, are in their prime 

they got an experienced center

 




 never heard it before

to us a kit is something that you have to assemble 

or the real name of Jon Snow  




 we'll see 




 In my mind Steve Nash never left.  




 So your rommate is a woman transitioning into a man?  




 he's listed as PF  









 timmy will list himself as PF no matter what

that's how he do 




 I have so many stories. If there are Lakers jerseys when I got to my seats, I always sigh.  




 why would he want to play for the spurs? they're old, he has to play center, and what kind of numbers is he going to get there? 

he should come to phoenix, light it up! we run and get buckets, none of this "defense" mess 




 The obnoxious Lakers fans at Suns games. Seriously drunk lady, stop screaming for a minute.  




 I hope Love will be able to feed his kids with only $110,000,000. After paying his agent and taxes, that might only be like $70,000,000, smh.  




 done 




 and 720 

much better! 




 oh ok, maybe they can fix it? 




 did you forget him selling picks for cash? we could have had deng and rondo 




 i don't think it works like that, i think someone recorded the event with a cell phone from 2003 




 144p? really?  




 you're  gonna be crushed when he signs with the spurs

just forget about it, if we get him then you can celebrate, but otherwise you're just setting yourself up for heartbreak  




 don't forget to put "no homo" after your response everyone

*not that there is anyone wrong with being homo, just saying* 




 any chance cheapskate Robert Sarver would be ok going a little over the cap? 




 that's wild 




 that's a lot of money to clap 




 how does the tax work? is it double each dollar your'e over the cap? or another way? 




 after James left, yes 




 i'll have to check them out, thanks 




 but see, LeBron is hurt early in the season so they have time to develop without him rather than depending on him

it would be different 




 thx 




 what? how does that even work? are the numbers listed somewhere? 




 You mean kind of like how it already is?  




 If Kyrie and Kevin stay healthy, I say they make the finals and lose.  




 so how much are the cavs going over the cap and how much luxury tax are they going to pay? 




 transracial? lol jk 

what's it like having a trans roommate? i'm thinking maybe less worse than non trans people? 




 I hear you! people give so much hate when you're relaying facts and they confuse it as normative positions  




 lol 




 i like leaders like bernie, not people catching up like hillary 




 Why not do a short deal with an option and then he can get upgraded soon enough? 




 First round pick and any player that didn't have a big money commitment.  




 does bledose get traded for him or does phoenix keep bledose? maybe we unload the morris twins trash? 




 Must be Portland Degeneration-X! 




 We have been here many times before. We get close a lot and are let down.  




 what are the chances he's traded to the one or two teams he blows off?  




 it will free him up big on offense for sure 




 solid analysis  




 dirk is the exception, not the rule 

you should have brought up robert parish 

been like he has 3 more contracts left 




 what about NY? 




 i think you're reaching just a bit lol 




 they said this? lol 




 good points 




 Thanks.  




 agenda: break the story or guess correctly so they become big 




 This is supporting your earlier prediction. 




 This is enough for me to get my hopes up so I can later be disappointed. 




 As unlikely as it may be, James leaving is still in the realm of possibility.  




 good answer, thanks

 




 He's about to turn 30 and signing probably his last contract of his career. 




 f*ck em 




 "reload this page"  




 interesting move!  




 damn 




 could he decide to sign and scrap those meetings?  




 seriously!  




 with whom? 




 are you in europe?  




 why not?  




 i almost feel bad for knicks fans, almost 




 thanks bro 




 why do you think this? because i think we're at best his 3rd choice 




 that doesn't mean he can't take his sweet time though 




 it's exhausting  




 Because I can't think much more of this.  




 my head and fingers hurt 




 yes, thanks 




 ok, thanks 




 so it could be higher?  




 That's not soon enough. 




 Lakers should keep Russell, and unload everything else of value to get as many picks as possible and then try to get Ben Simmons.  




 Until Ben Simmons comes along.  




 i'd take him over our politicians who regularly sell us out to corporations and banks 




 this is true, she's still a lot better than anyone with the bad guys

but she can very far to the left and I think she will Obama us

i only believe Sanders will put americans first instead of the banks and corporations 




 are you really? lol

because it would be funny that I asked a tax accountant this question 




 Can't he still get the high contract from Portland and get traded with that contract to Phoenix?  




 Robert Sarver trading player for cash, like with Deng or Rondo. 




 [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iTrqHvTk_0) 




 that's true 




 this is only impressive if you're 100% straight  




 and what's your tax rate?  




 he's trying to pull a kevin costner in draft day 




 why not? as long as someone doesn't have a no trade clause
 




 please based god! 




 this is wild! he'd get his rep back up if he pulled this off 




 We'd finally upgrade from just competing for the 8th seed every year.  




 Goodwin is better than booker.  




 what if they dealt him to someone else?  




 like what?
 




 I'd go for this!  




 One man one woman.  




 because it's a reality we have to acknowledge and I am not delusional in thinking what I post or don't post will change the results of the primary election  




 at committing felonies  




 Amare? But he doesn't rebound. Only jump shots.  




 The two largest markets can't get any quality free agents. NBA needs to back to the rigging business.  




 Bernie Sanders stood for gay rights before it became popular.  









 Kobe.  




 fantasy value is taking a hit with him being the 3rd option and not putting up his old numbers  




 Iowa? do you guys have early voting? I'm hoping you lead the way 




 What can we expect from Love next season? will he be a 20/10 player again?  




 so maybe 5'10 or 5'11? 




 Glad to hear you think for yourself, but you're the exception unfortunately

  




 there is? what is the hard cap? where is that info? 




 Historically, height has been a factor in presidential elections.  




 they're using a team based model on an individual based sport

also, their product is shit 




 you don't have to  like it but it's how many people vote

don't shoot the messenger  














 Get boards and pass him the ball.  









 I thought there was not a hard cap in the NBA like there is in the NFL? Is this wrong? Why don't top players like James have their teams spend well over the cap since they're selling out every night and getting them more TV money just for being with the team??? 









 She got money from regular people, but you know Wall Street is eager to have her at the helm. The banks can't give her money fast enough. It would be so sweet to see Sanders wreck the banks!  




 There's always some chance.  




 when is the **next** TV deal go into effect? or rather, when does the one about to start expire? 




 more like 1000% 









 You can't leave earlier? While it is a gamble, if I were you I would go because it could be an opportunity to be part of something historical that you could look back on. What's the worst that can happen? You waste a tank of gas and an evening?  




 there is a convergence in Wisconsin  









 that was not just MSNBC, that was everyone 




 years of gay rumors apparently  














 He couldn't see the tax cuts would hurt the economy? really?

you felt safer because he started a war with Iraq? you know the Bush administration taking out Hussein and dismantling their military led to the destabilization of the region and the formation of ISIS, right? 




 is Te'o bringing his girlfriend? 




 I want to go!  




 You're the majority. Most democrats and republicans vote this way. The race is about the people in the middle. 
























 Haha.  














 Yeah, you got them. It's too bad the Browns 1.0 won it in Baltimore. 

 




 I couldn't agree more. Jason Kidd was a big one too.  




 Respect for the honesty. We all know the warriors fanbase doubled up recently.  




 Are you too young to have seen Charles sink that jumper in David Robinson's face?  




 I hope you're not also a Browns fan?  




 Me too! Stopped having the knicks be my east team after Larry Johnson left though.  




 Nash and Finley, you'r welcome.  




 you see him play before the knee injuries?  




 No Peja? Maybe a little Hedu? 

#whitechocolate  




 i'd still put  my money on the spurs

his suns source is probably optimistic more than anything substantial  




 Marcus Morris. Then he and Markieff would jump me and stomp me out cause that's how they do. 




 a great man with great news apparently  




 breath into a bag! 




 *then 

then it's the suns, not than 




 How are the Suns getting closer to signing LA?  




 chad's number was tweeted and he was going to get a new one in the episode but chad showed all the numbers of people who contacted him

so that's gotta be it 









 It has some business. Name one country where the government doesn't tell people how to live or what to do with their money. 




 More like Oliver Miller. 

And who is this 10 foot guy?  




 lol thx 




 thx 




 ur joke didn't go over so well lol 




 OHP? 




 Of course she's not, she's swimming in her big bank and big cable company money like Scrooge McDuck. 




 How good will the Spurs be with Duncan, Parker, and Manu retired?  




 For one year only, not franchise. Does the answer at all depend on the makeup of your team? Who are you taking? 




 It should have been dwight at 25 vs dirk at 35. 




 waiting for embedded episode 3.... 




 I want to see this version and the new one they put up later to find out exactly what they don't want us seeing.  




 Trump warned us.  




 It gets the 85 IQ Fox viewer voting. 




 Republicans won't get rid of it because it's worked. If they did get rid of it, millions of people would lose their health insurance, prices would climb drastically, and they'd get killed politically for it. They just want to complain about it. They don't actually have any ideas themselves.  




 actually they do! before the govt started telling people what to do they would die up in burning buildings 




 If by kook you mean in line with the majority of Americans more than any other candidate, then yeah he is.

Oh no, he wants more well paying jobs, a livable wage, healthcare for everyone, a little equality, and a strong middle class....how could we live with all of this? **How do we allow ourselves to live without it?** 




 Reebok: fuck you that's why 









 Diego would end up a bloody mess.  




 why don't you? 









 I can see that. Just put up a ton of shots. But how long can he stay healthy? I'm not optimistic. It's sad seeing him like this.  




 **Ben Simmons** 

You bet your ass they're tank! They won't be the only one either.  




 I hope they trade him away period.  




 If Kobe is healthy next year, what kind of numbers can we expect from him? 15/5/5?  




 nothing for miami or LA or portland? 









 so what about the other 35%? is that portland?  




 people are killing me with the 100% joke responses 

you're being sarcastic, right?  









 I didn't believe she wasn't  going to run for the longest time, but I have come to accept that reality the pat few months. I came over to the Sanders Bandwagon earlier this year and I'm glad to see him picking up so much momentum and I hope he can keep it going.  




 not in practice

rarely ever does the VP have anything to do with the senate  




 I hear that. Best wishes. Kick it's butt!  




 it's got what plants crave 




 treasury secretary would be dope!  




 Agreed. I love her as a senator though. 




 let's not be delusional lol 




 I told him to listen to my **mix tape** in a well ventilated area!  














 Bo and Deion did it. 









 are there any other resources you would recommend? I'd like to find something that groups medications by class (maybe with tables) rather than just a big list 




 oh, you're going to asu law school (sandra day O)? it is a great law school! congrats! 

can i ask what your gpa/lsat score was? curious what students are getting nowadays who  go there 




 tell that to republicans who vote down vets benefits  




 this is by far the most realistic list 




 I'm not doing it for the money lol. If I wanted money, I'd go MBA. 

That's good to hear about the connection just in case. Best wishes man! 

What attracts you to AZ?  




 got it, thx

So, if I'm an NBA player could I have a tiny little condo in the state of Washington to pay 0% state income tax? And then just live in other place? 




 That's good to hear. The money isn't what it used to be. You thinking of working for the govt / private? or going out on your own? 

Nursing. If I had to do it all over again I would have done med school, but I'm not trying to be in school another decade.  




 He'd be the centerpiece and #1 option on the Suns.  




 Bernie Sanders doesn't vote to go to war and then neglect our veterans like so many politicians. Bernie Sanders is the leader America needs.  














 double taxes or split up depending on where they play? 




 When it happened. 




 hahaha 




 besides just more, what's the  difference in toronto?  




 I think the Lakers got too much help from the refs for it to be coincidence. Statistically, the calls they got were outrageous. I think the game was fixed.  




 they're so incompetent Lopez will probably just elect to retire than play for either one  




 is Robin Lopez the Lakers Tyson Chandler?  




 lol 




 has he gotten better since he left the suns? because he was not good in phoenix  




 Refs stole game 7 from you! that wasn't right  




 92-93 Suns have to be up there 




 at least wait for LA to be signed 




 how can the republicans not be tire of this?  




 you gotta bring the heat!  




 i think hillary is more component than that

is there a top like a 10 somewhere of the funny/good stuff?  




 alright lol, we're gonna have to agree to disagree, but respect, you do you 




 F5 for Aldridge's selection.  














 [um...](https://hellostatusquo.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/101687-i-dont-know-girl-meme-husband-pcnl.jpeg) 




 Name me 3 good songs of hers  off the top of your head besides rehab?  




 there's no room for the "truth" in mainstream media  




 copy paste the text on top of the story on google and then go to the result and you get the entire story!!! very quick way around that paywall 




 I have. I still only like this one song.  














 PoliSci, plan was law school. Worked at a law firm, then later at the court. Dragged my feet for years, and since the legal field is dying somethin' fierce, I decided to go into healthcare which I'm pursuing right now. What are you thinking of doing? Criminal Justice field? Legal field? If the latter, I would advice you to be practical and look into it and be 100% it's what you want, because law school is not a good investment anymore. Back in the day (say before 2006ish) there were many well paying jobs out of school. Now, even people out of Ivy league schools in the top 10% of their classes are struggling. Partnerships in law firms are diminished. Plus, keep in mind something 90% of lawyers don't see a courtroom. They're in the office 12/hours a day doing paperwork. 

I think choosing something that will get you a well paying job out of school is the best route to go, regardless of what you want to do after your undergrad, be it law or something else. So if you did engineering, accounting, nursing, computer science, etc something practical like that, you'd still have  something to fall back on. 

 




 +1 

And there is already enough hype. It would be a waste and it might actually take away from what they currently have.  




 ASU grad here, what are you studying?  




 Choose your fighter: 

select player 

it should say select fighter 




 Rehab was her only good song. She's very overrated. If she hadn't died, everyone would have forgotten about her by now. 









 most likely [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUmZp8pR1uc) 














 **select player**

they give so little fucks about the fighters they can't even change the word player to fighter  




 I hope he plays a bad guy. It's way more fun and a better part.  




 usually something comes up automatically that allows me to translate, it doesn't here, i don't know how to translate it  














 for what? they can't double team stomp people out? this is the NBA, teams are not obliged to keep you together, it's a luxury/privilege and they don't deserve it 




 why only one year? why not 3 or 4? 




 which one? i don't speak Portuguese  




 my f5 key is more worn out than Kim  




 The early Amare was the best, but after he busted up his knees he was never the same player. As a person, he's overly materialistic. I couldn't be a fan of a person like him since I can't relate to him.  




 Based on the median age of MVPs it seems unlikely. If he does it will most likely be in the next season or two. 




 I feel bad for Mark that he has a snitch in his family. The shame. 




 This can be arranged.  




 no idea what you're talking about 




 tldr 




 i always wonder what the curve is for players, some of them are as good as they're ever going to be after one year, but some of them take a few years to start ballin'  




 someone will get hurt, someone will start playing bad, it happens every year 




 29, lol 

seriously though, when is he making up his mind? tonight?  




 why does everyone assume all the teams are staying the same? some will get better and some will get worse. You never know, you could have like seeds 2-6 all be within a game or two of each other and phoenix gets hot and end up getting the 2nd seed. You never know bro. 




 You're kind for saying 4-6 instead of 6, thank you. I'm sorry about Amare.  




 is warren ready?  




 Lakers should trade Kobe to a contender and get something for him, and rebuild.  




 Oh, I see. And I respect that, I was just curious because I have known people who are trans, but never anyone personally.  




 Lakers are back in the race! 

For the 8th seed. 




 LA   NY must be really toxic organizations  




 can someone measure traffic this way? I think we'd have the highest posts on avg that way 




 surprised we're so low, i am guessing we just talk the most?  




 and you're now on a list 




 This would kill the NBA.  




 you guys are getting screwed by the back room draft lottery too

usually by that many years of sucking you'd have a few studs 
























 Funny coming from him considering what he did to Louisiana. 









 They will continue coming. We have to learn how to address them. 





























 If by week you mean for months now and unto the primary and possibly general election, yes you're right.  




 Warriors and Heat. 

Spurs and Cavs can watch from home like the rest of us.  




 Then add All-Star game MVP to that list for Porzingis. 














 there have been a lot of positive tests over the years and if they got caught, imagine who many didn't

i'm curious about the georges line though 




 where in the blue hell did all of those threes come from? 




 ROTY no doubt. He wont' get MVP simply because the Knicks will still sink. He will surely be a 25-10 double double machine.  




 Can a rookie play on the all-star team? Is that within the rules?  




 You're right. He's not nearly as athletic as Thompson.  




 good link 




 You know any good places to train UFC in Dublin?  




 Who's Mauricio Rua anyway? Only in there because of his brother Shogun.

He's too much.  




 Ronda is looking out for herself, not fellow fighters.  




 Forget him. He's always hating on the Suns. 




 Nothing a cycle of steroids and hard work can't do.  














 He played. He's not a rookie.  




 He's very athletic but he could improve his shooting.  




 Conor looks like he has not eaten in a week. 




 Jewish check. Carpenter check. Looks to help the poor and disadvantaged check.  









 Think of T like an energy/turbo bar in a video game. Throughout the day you use it up and it gets lower. Or it could be from masking agents.  




 Isn't his Andro on the high side of normal with his T/E ratio too small? Could that be a sign of a masking agent? 









 He isnt going to win his partys nomination, but his popularity still matters. 

I hope the author Jamelle Bouie is willing to share his time machine with me.  




 He isnt going to win his partys nomination, but his popularity still matters. 

I hope the author Jamelle Bouie is willing to share his time machine with me.  
























 I believe you that he is a great guy. He comes off as a class guy. Nice guys dope too though. I understand/respect your loyalty.  




 Cain Velasquez. Nick or Nate Diaz (not including marijuana). Benson Henderson. Roy Nelson unless we're counting whoppers. Khabib Nurmagomedov. Rose Namajunas. 

Wouldn't surprise me: anyone at jackson's like Jon Jones or Holly Holm or Andrei Arlovski. Also Jacare Souza or RDA.  




 hahaha 




 Ok. But what's up with his response? Why doesn't he just admit it instead of half assing it?  









 yeah 




 Yes. 




 He was juicing then though so not really.  




 Haha! I think he's ever worse than Jon. But Jon could still end up there if the prosecutor isn't a total loser.  




 I've been a Vitor fan from his first UFC fight on and I am to this day. But I'm also honest.  




 Weed stays in your system a long time especially if you use a lot. It really depends on how sensitive a test is. I read they are making less sensitive? Yeah, it's not professional but I guess they just  had to light up. 




 Weed is not a PED so I don't think it's fair to group those fighters with the cheaters.  









 There's sloppy, and there's Thiago Silva. The guy is scum. He's lucky to not be in prison.  




 You don't think UFC fighters can be? lol 




 As he should  be. Gilbert robbed him of his paycheck. Any chance the UFC still gives him his show money if they can't find a replacement opponent?  




 It was known back in SF Gilbert was using.  




 Vitor is a mental midget. You can't fix cowardice. That's why he's been a chronic steroids user his entire career. It helps him physically, but it also makes him confident mentally. I'm also a huge Vitor fan. 




 He's talking about the story in the link he provided and also the pictures of of a broken rib that have been everywhere.  




 It will lower prices. More users = more buying power. Look at every other country. When a country has more buying power, they say what the price will be and make companies compete.  




 I think more will get caught. A lot of them will just be more careful by taking larger windows when they cycle. And the fighters who can afford the good stuff will use freely because tests are years behind new synthetic testosterone they come up with every year. What they should do is store their blood for testing in 5/10 years.  




 You realize that a majority of  UFC fighters use PEDs, right?  




 It's his fault for being sloppy with his cycling. You don't see fighters at Jackson's or Blackzilians pissing hot.  




 medicare for everyone would cut prices significantly  




 yeah that counts 




 there are other forms of resistance training than just lifting weighs bruh 




 face is a wreck but that booty  




 she can't fight cris cyborg though 




 It has historically been a wedge issue but Sanders is trying to make it something we can come together. 




 It is obvious, but it is still important because it shows you that he is different. Everyone else on the left doesn't say this because they are afraid of losing votes. Sanders tells it like it is. For that reason, it is something we can appreciate.  




 Why do you want him to get destroyed in the primaries? Do you love the establishment? Do  you hate Sanders's ideas of every American having a livable wage and health insurance? 














 Let's get a couple of more goals!  




 I'm right on point.  




 Prison lobby gives money to politicians, mostly republicans, they in turn create laws to put more people in prison. They also privatize the prisons system. In my home state, Arizona, the newly elected Republican governor gave 500 million dollars to build a new private prison that has a contract to stay at 100% full capacity while cutting education across the board.  




 If we spent money on mental health and drug rehab instead of prisons, we'd save billions every year and be better off as a society.  




 I just want to remind you all that we had a player hurt his hand picking up the phone.  




 do they have a plaxico stupidity clause in his contract? they should 




 it's CNN, what do you expect? 

it's why I rephrased it, because CNN's title his dishonest and they're scrum 




 If you don't speed you're probably holding up traffic and creating more danger than anything. I don't see why having background checks and keeping guns away from criminals and other dangerous people should be controversial. 




 it could 




 It's not just rhetoric. These would be policies he would attempt to implement. He's not delusional. He knows he can't do everything he's saying without the help of the establishment down the line, but he's going to work to do as much as he can. He's going to fight for the middle class. America needs him. 




 What you have to understand about Bernie is he doesn't speak that way. He doesn't do damage control. He tells it like it is. Bernie Sanders has been consistent on guns. I don't  expect either extreme to side with Sanders on gun rights, but I do think a vast majority of Americans is in line with Bernie on guns, including gun owners.  




 Obviously the UFC wants to have their cake and eat it too.

They are a monopoly with a tapped out market. Now that they have squeezed out every single penny of their fanbase with every possible revenue stream, its' their fighters who are the target of their greed.  







































 That is your evaluation. He's put in the work and beat top fighters. You didn't make a valid argument to why he should't get a shot. 




 Prices always climb. That is not relevant. The question you should be asking is, what would prices have been without the ACA? The answer is without a doubt higher than without the ACA.  




 Haters gonna hate and ainters gonna aint. 

People said the same thing about a black junior senator too. 

I believe in Bernie. He represents me. I'm going to vote for him and do what else I can to help him get every last vote possible no matter what the detractors or anyone else says.  




 Green would be considered a big? lol 














 how u know?
 




 We need catchy lines for him like we had riggin for wiggins.  




 yup 




 Dana hates Ryan for some reason. Only people who beat him can get title shots. Ryan Bader isn't allowed.  




 You simplify it. You don't need that many combinations. Or computerize it and do as many combinations as you want.  




 that's true, but I bet at least one or two more players will have their stocks rise a lot from now until then 




 1 on 5 though bruh 




 Ben Simmons is Anthony Davis level though!  




 I mean, what other options do they have?  




 you need to read a political ideologies book lol 




 they make it complicated to not televise it 

they can make it a lot more simple if they want  




 it happens a lot! lol 




 .500 basketball forever 









 the NBA has had fixed games before, this is fact

it's not that outrageous for me to suspect they are fixing the draft lottery by doing it in secrecy  




 Elections have many checks. Sometimes, they're even recounted by people counting ballots. As far as oscars or nickelodean, what? Who cares about that BS.  




 "in a way"

what way is that? 

it has 0 proof it's legit 

I'm still waiting for anyone to tell me what is a good reason to do it in secret and not live. 




 auditors? lol, horse and pony show man 

why not do it live in public and get crazy ratings for it? WHY?  




 We are if we play all of our young guys a lot. I'm sick and tired of 500 ball. We have to get bad to get good.  




 np 




 you'd rather have another great season of competing for the 8th seed and a first and done?  




 let's throw the season! trade Bledose for the sixers first round picks, go all in on getting Ben Simmons!  




 [every suns fan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31g0YE61PLQ) right now 




 Occam's Razor bruh. What is a legitimate reason for them to have the draft lottery in secret instead of broadcasting it live for everyone to witness? They hate the ratings?  




 Tucker is solid but he is already at his ceiling. I'm hoping Warren realizes his potential.  




 The Knicks got hooked up. The Cavs  got hooked up. Many teams have gotten hooked up. 




 I think it's realistic to expect things like universal healthcare and free university education. Western European countries does it. Why can't we? Are they better than we are?  




 So everyone doesn't contact the people who contacted Chad.  




 In the episode Chad goes to get a new number and in the process shows the people who contacted him on his phone...displaying their  numbers. This is why the episode was taken down. 




 NBA always does stuff like this. There is a reason why the draft lottery is done in secret. It's for fixin'. 




 has he ever predicted anything correctly before?  




 I think the NBA will make amends for screwing LA with the CP3 trade by having them win the lottery next year and getting **Ben Simmons**. 




 100% biased but TJ Warren 




 Love has a better chance. 




 they should call him dj ilek 




 [Vince Carter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNy8dQNcf2w). 




 NBA Street yo 




 [mirror](https://vid.me/9397)

It's private because Chad showed the numbers of many people who contacted him after his phone number was leaked.  




 A lot of fighters do/will probably have CTE. I love fighting and american football, but you have to be incredibly stupid to go taking concussions for a living, regardless of how many millions you make. And for many, pennies.  




 the only thing worse than michael was his bandwagon fans in every city across the country

 That's odd he can't do that. I'm fat and out of shape and I can execute that jump. 









 what would happen to the current hillary....bernie....nobody else really dynamic if he entered?  









 I wouldn't say there are a "top" five, but there certainly are **T Sizzle** and **Vontaze Burfict**. You have **Brock Osweiler** waiting to get the nod to see what he can do. 

 




 why are punters so big? 




 the rich young should have the same burden as the non rich young 

if everyone had access to medicare then it would be fair 

why doesn't the GOP try to win younger voters? if I was voting for my own personal interest, I'd be happy to opt out of social security, so why doesn't the GOP call for that?  




 I don't understand how the cap still stands today. Get rid of it!

 Bernie Sanders will never be president. 

If he wins the democratic primary, I bet you he will be. 




 I love KFC, original recipe.  




 Agents are for suckers. Just hire a lawer and pay them per hour rather than a percentage cut. Hire firms to get you outside deals for a lot less.

 Yes. 









 Will he walk out with Conor since [he's  Irish too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQsoFWABtEI)?  




 sorry for what? I can't get enough conor 

i love conor as much as it's heterosexually possible  




 I wish they made a few more of these. 




 shhhh 




 coupled with what? free education, ok 

but all things being equal? that could be problematic  




 she reminds me of a long lost friend who i could spend all night with just talking 




 I think so too!  




 she's nutty, michael is more insecure  




 Jenna is more fake/acting imo. 









 Agreed.  




 If you ain't got the dime, she ain't got the time.

This is unfortunately not unique among most politicians. 









 And if pigs fly... 




 Bernie knows he'll need a lot of help in congress to get things done.  




 If he fought on CBS, his next fight on PPV could break his own PPV record.  




 they can't comprehend that someone won't sell out 




 could be worse 




 Look at her top campaign contributors. That's why I don't trust her. Yes, she's better than any republican, but that's not enough.
 




 Great video! I would love to see more of these made! 





























 that's what they want 




 A time traveling Hilldawg didn't do that?  


































 How: Sanders has had a long career where he has maintained the same positions. Obama had a short political career before ascending to the White House.  




 exactly 




 the haters are growing so Sanders must be doing something right 




 could be 
























 Hillary will continue the corporate takeover that Bill and George and Barack pushed. Bernie would step on the brakes and things would get very interesting.  




 copy paste the top paragraph into google and go to the result 




 what liberal media? besides msnbc 




 I think they would say that no matter what. They don't want to give the Sanders campaign the respect it deserves. If you acknowledge them you give them legs.  









 That's like an average NBA player nowadays. 














 you mean fox's 24/7 coverage of benghazi and her emails have some effect? 









 all things being equal, money talks in political elections  




 seriously!  









 her hundreds of millions of dollars and yes  men probably make her feel pretty safe 




 In Hillary world they do. 




 I have heard others say this before so not first. 




 That's what it seems like. 




 We know Sanders. We didn't know Obama. If anyone is going to remain loyal to his campaign, it's  Bernie Sanders. 





























 [CNN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSW85seZ2M4) doesn't think she's very honest.  
























 he can get 35% of the cap, right? 
wouldn't that be something like 5 years 175 million? 




 it's a nice luxury to have when you can volunteer  




 sexual? can't  see it even i were to try  




 No. Conor isn't fake.  














 They will both make weight.

If one of them did not make weight, then only the one who did make weight could win the title if he won the fight. 




 they need to rethink their values 




 They are the people who vote against their own economic interests thinking they too will be rich one day when in reality they won't be.  
























 The NEA is the nation's largest teachers union, with 3 million members.

That's a lot of votes up for grabs.  














 I bet there is a goldmine somewhere, but if the movies work for you then you're good. 




 Thank you. I would be very curious to see what he does end up making, if we ever find out. 




 Michael Jordan didn't need to front.  




 Do you not live in a major city? Yeah, it can be pricey.  




 I believe you. All the hooters and buffalo wild wings where I live have a lot of bad clientele too. It's all about finding the right place for you. 




 where did he say that?  




 the ironing is strong? lol 




 If Conor is making anything below $5,000,000 for this fight he's being had.   




 pardon me, i meant utility companies

 not a big bone 




 why does his fedor impression sound like his andrei impression? 

fedor is soft spoken, a very easy impression to do, so why does he sound nothing like fedor? **worst fedor impression ever**

 she couldn't finish that choke https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKUnr3y9lZo 




 not in it for karma lol, i only posted it because it was better quality 














 Just think, for each person who has been caught, there have been many numerous people who have used and not been caught.  




 Solid point. The media is already starting on Bernie. However, we have more of a voice as citizens today than did people back then. We can set talking points and decide what is important.  









 Will South Park create any presidential politics episodes? There will likely be some good material once things start getting heated. 














 when you have no girls texting you #lincolnchafee

when you get no call backs for job interviews #lincolnchafee 



















 Bernie has maintained a consistent position being against big money. He can ask the person to stop and say he doesn't support it, but in the end under the law the person can continue. 









 They almost certainly do coordinate but just not enough to be called out on it. But even when they do, nobody polices it. I think the Sanders campaign would be the only one who doesn't directly coordinate. **Usually the PACs are run by the candidates lawyers or staff members. This person is not affiliated with Sanders. Big distinction.** 




 Are there any other people big in music, tv/movies, sports, etc who would want to continue this trend of endorsing Sanders?  




 It wouldn't be donated. They'd be voicing their views with their money. 




 It was only a matter of time until one formed. But the name of the PAC is pretty hilarious I will concede. 




 Demand? This is America. Money talks and people can spend it how they want.  




 There are actually a few billionaires out there who think they have enough and want everyone else to have. I know it sounds like a unicorn, but there are a few of them out there.  




 Some people like to disparage Lil B but  he's a generational leader.  




 exactly 




 It's not Sanders' doing. People will spend how they please in this system. 


































 4,000

he's a bigger liar about crowds than he is his hair 




 30k? that is impressive! 




 what is the maximum occupancy of hall 4? 




 all my mexican friends who are going are american citizens 

the large majority of latinos in metropolitan phoenix are legal  




 I have multiple mexican-american friends going. I think we may get a pleasant surprise to the diverse makeup of  this upcoming crowd. 




 I can't wait to go! I am hoping we crush the current record for presidential crowds.  




 it said .8? then it f*cked up, it's .08 




 .8? lol

you'd likely die at half that

legal limit is .08 bruh, not 0.8 




 give peace a chance  









 A fight against Mark Hunt would make sense! Mark has better ground defense now. Let's see that rematch. Better than some third tier fighter in M1. 



















 [Hayabusa](http://www.hayabusafight.com/ca-en/products/performance-apparel/fight-shorts/) is so much better looking that Reebok. It will be sad to see Georges downgrade if he comes back. I will never purchase anything made by Reebok unless they start making good products. The UFC "kits" are hideous.  






















































 Real fans can be honest. He's eating up a lot of the cap for little production.  




 should have recorded it, smh sorry man

ufc product is  









 what? larry has been done for years now and is our 3rd best WR on the team

even his discounted rate is robbery  




 He plays the 5. 




 I was disappointed in the Suns picking him. Then I watched Amare in the summer league and was blow away and couldn't wait for him to crush the big boys. 




 you can't trust a man who lies about his hair  




 Just look at the cities who have increased it in the last couple of years. Their unemployment has gone down.  









 I assume he has his flights, hotels, food, nose candy, and other perks covered by the UFC?  




 Conor said he was making more than the gate. The gate was 7.1 million. 




 I'm not sure if it's a wig made from his own hair or the world's most elaborate comb over.  




 Dear sir or madam, in reality increasing a minimum wage [creates more jobs](http://www.raisetheminimumwage.com/pages/job-loss). The lowest earners spend their money unlike the wealthy. When they spend their money this creates more economic growth and more jobs. The economic data is out there and it concludes increases in minimum wages increase the number of jobs in the free market. If we can supplement that with additional government created employment, it would create even more jobs and give us a strong economy.  














 People are naive and vote for the wrong reasons. 

The right reason: voting for your own economic interest and for the greater good. 














 i hear that 














 Bernie Sanders represents me as a Democrat more than anyone else in the Democratic Party. He is the ideal Democrat. He's what every "one of you" should be. He's hope to restore the American Dream. 




 1st round Lakers in 4 

2nd round Warriors in 4 

3rd round Spurs in 4

finals Knicks in 7  




 It depends on your specific anatomy and what kind of damage you are taking and for how long. If you're not going to become a millionaire from fighting, you're better off never taking shots to the head.

 she's done steroids for more years than chyna did them 




 career steroid abuse has really done a number on her voice, face, and body 

she looks like the quintessential example of female steroids use 




 why wouldn't one of them take him out?  




 The Floyd Mayweather strategy.  









 i had to mute, it's just that bad 




 he's fighting the system that everyone else has embraced, so yeah 




 anyone else annoyed by that woman's voice? she won't stop talking 









 are you frank trigg or travis browne? 




 Good point, but I meant Ronda.  














 never enough, much more conor material needed to reach ideal saturation levels 




 Brett Favre.  




 Yeah, I guess she's comfortable crushing those cans. 




 [Chris Broussard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ5Yy71gP1c) is a bigot. 

Not saying Mark should say this. I'm just saying. 




 Mark is worth 3 billion. ESPN is worth 50 billion. Maybe if he invests in something big on shark tank... 




 i doubt that 




 I'd love to see side by side video of young dirk and porzingis.

even if Aldo was fighting

conor is last 




 there really need to be more conor gifs 




 is this a serious question? this is the Conor show

 




 she definitely needs money

that's why she's fighting

 but ronda stands to make triple what she normally makes in a fight by fighting her

 If Cyborg loses one of these fights it could mean the end of a very big pay day for Ronda Rousey. 

Rousey should take that fight ASAP while it still has big selling power. 




 More NHL for you. I didn't say it's not amazing. Don't be upset at me because hockey is a regional sport and that the NHL is a B tier league. I love track and field but I realize almost nobody really cares about it except for a month every four years.

 roids 









 during fights would be better!  




 they're yes men  




 yeah, some bad press would probably be the end game here

but it doesn't seem like the ufc cares at all

plus, they prescreen all their journalists to be yes men or they don't get credentials  




 source? are you serious? you don't think they were directly involved in how much fighters are being paid? they are the ones paying them

come on now 




 They know and don't care. They have shown how little they care about the fighters over and over again.  




 Reebok is complicit. They in fact did decide how much money the fighters would get. They came up with the ugly designs. They are the ones profiting from the fighters and not compensating them. They are the ones who have shown no effort in their product or the concerns of the fighters. They are just as guilty as the UFC. 




 They have a contract. What good what a petition do even if it gets a million signature? Not buying Reebok is the most effective way to send them a message imo. 




 he definitely needs it

but who is in his life that can convince him to get help?  




 there's a good person behind that mental illness  




 Why doesn't anyone get him help? He clearly has a mental illness and needs help. I am terrified he will kill someone and then himself.  




 lol 




 they are one in the same on this deal 




 Miami Vice was good.  




 The UFC was smart for eliminating all serious competition before making these greedy moves. 

When there is no real competition the monopoly can get away with a lot.  




 if he was a lesser fighter yes 




 maybe another way of saying chewed out?  




 [Chris Rock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj0mtxXEGE8) already educated us on this situation.  




 get the word out! kentucky too!  




 us liberals make up a large part of their audience lol

 i can smell and taste them in my mind 









 [Mirror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ARAmfe7qtQ)  









 Frank Mir is light years better than Stann or Florian. Florian's high pitched voice is annoying. Stann doesn't understand fighting and regurgitates random facts and his broscience (like lactic acid build up in the muscles which is pure fiction). 

If the UFC spends money on focus groups to determine who is the best, I have no doubt Frank Mir will beat out everyone on the B team.  




 If I'm at a ball game I can't get it. If I'm at the movies I can't get it. I don't really drink much soda at home. I feel that the American market is being had and we don't even acknowledge it.  




 I have access to it too, but it's made in Mexico. It's a specialty product. It's not mass produced. What I am saying is it should be as available as corn syrup coke.

 Nobody else running for president is trying to help out the African American youth 1/10th as much as Bernie Sanders. Just look at his work over the 40 years.  




 lo siento 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtkGLk7M7zs feature=youtu.be 




 he has more than anyone else 

http://www.sanders.senate.gov/agenda/ 




 if you look at their records nobody comes closet so Sanders on supporting black people  




 considering everyone already knows about her, she doesn't have to work as hard 









 [no doubt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YwTuKIPXO0) 









 *arena 

but I don't see why he can't in large cities like that if he's pulling already filling 10K venues  




 staples center does 18k 














 just  how  big a venue could he fill in places like LA or SF? 




 roll tide! 




 There are definitely are extreme people but they are the small minority. The largest most self defeating voting block as to be the white christian middle class family that is staunch republican. They identify with the party that governs to make their lives difficult. We have always had a pretty rotten education system, but it's gotten worse with the new governor slashing primary/secondary/higher education.  




 arizona is the opposite of this 

the big city is a bastion of conservatism and the outlying rural areas are liberal as is the smaller big city down south 




 Arizona is very diverse in terms of politics. A large majority of people are not racist. The state is independent heavy. In Maricipa County (location of metropolitan phoenix), the most populated county, the Republicans do win out. Down south in Tucson they're far more democrat. I know Arizona seems like a solid red state but that might not always be the case. With changing demographics we will certainly eventually go purple and very well could turn blue in a decade or two.  




 Sanders isn't attacking her so she'll have to play a little more nice at least for the time being. Plus, Hildog definitely wants Sanders's progressive voters turning out to vote for her. 




 and? he's sharper than most 54 year olds in congress both in his intellect and judgement 

haters are going to have to do better than ageism  




 what?  




 Carson Palmer will play the entire 2015 season without getting hurt.  




 if he's feelin' european I think he'll step back and take the three  









 I'll totally concede that you don't know running what you find out when you take the oval office. New information will change your policies. However, it seems that President Obama didn't even try with many things, like the public option. He simply got big pharma and the other interests to cut the best deal.  




 Obama got elected, except he sold out 95% and didn't keep his campaign promises.  




 He's literally taking kids out of school and putting them in prisons. Those prisons have guarantees to stay full.  












































 I saw plenty of latinos and black people, but yeah it was mostly white 




 yup, little blonde boy I think 




 arenas and stadiums hopefully if he hits really big cities like LA or SF 




 that bothered me lol 




 no they don't 




 I'm talking about 12 pack of cans and made in the USA. 




 pepsi used real sugar for a limited time but took it back 




 Vote 




 because it's a buzz word 

sanders does not propose having socialism 

he proposes have more socialist policies, but not a socialist economic system  




 I get the economics behind it, but I still wish we had a choice. I buy the overpriced bottled coke from Mexico sometimes. In Arizona they sell it at Costco even.  




 I demand Coke sell cane sugar Coke in the US market. No more of this corn syrup garbage!  




 It tastes a lot better than corn syrup. Why does the US market get the inferior product when there is the good stuff around the world including down south in Mexico? 

Step your game up Coca Cola!  




 he's not a "socialist"  









 people confuse the NBA with the Olympics 

the NBA is about making money, not being fair or pure to the game 




 what if i told you the NBA wants players to get away with traveling  




 We won't know if he is what he used to be until he plays regardless of how great he looks. 




 I really want to see Jimmy Garoppolo start some games.  














 that's just normal wear and tear dude 




 She could probably get more money by getting a lawyer and suing the school.  




  I think anyone running for that job ... should say loud and clear that they agree: We dont run this country for Wall Street and mega-corporations, she said. We run it for people.

We're waiting Hillary Clinton.  









 you the scum that back the gop? sanders is the least extreme candidate running for president  




 Sanders knows he'll need a lot of help to get things done. What bigger things?  














 No, he could not. He would not even win the primary. That's why he he's going to raise a billion dollars. 




 everyone except bernie sanders 

doesn't take bribes 




 the media will get bored 

they'll build him up so they can turn on him and knock him down when he inevitably says more stupid things
