 your transformation is one of the best i've seen. how long did that take? 




 damn that was dark and smart. i like 




 Love it. Thank you. this is the reason I posted. To see what other people know. For supplementation do you mean the non-natty athletes?  




 whoa this is super interesting. thanks for this 




 yoooo yeah you've told me before and you're absolutely right. i just wanted to add for the macros trend, even if you think you're eating right, remember to watch sugar intake too. no substitute for eating clean though 




 Swimming is great cardio. Something funny and kind of counter intuitive: the worse you are at a movement, the more calories you'll burn while doing it. So in a way, if you're bad at swimming or your technique isn't the best, it's actually better exercise because you'll be expending more energy to do your laps. 

And yeah, if you have the energy/ time, more than 3x a week is even better. Go for it! 




 That's cool. I'm sure you're right. Thai fighters that fight on a more international level aren't going to be able to win by standing right there and trading with someone that actually moves around to avoid the shots. I think Buakaw has pretty good movement too. Don't know if its dutch kickboxing, but yeah 




 Hey, it's great that you're trying to make a change. What "ShitLordStu" says is right. You definitely have to start by monitoring your food intake. If you're willing to track your meals, I'd suggest starting with http://iifym.com/iifym-calculator/ 

it definitely helped me a lot. If you don't have access to weights or machines, it's really not a problem. Start with cardio and body weight exercises. Sprints 3 days a week, and depending on your ability, start with pushups, situps, jump squats, pistol squats, pullups (if you have a bar). You can definitely use the heavy bag for cardio if you have gloves. Bike is a great form of cardio too. 30 minute high intensity bike rides would help a lot.  




 As someone who suffers from this, I started to look into the topic a bit more. I know the most truthful and basic answer is calories in vs. calories out, but I've been tracking my food for a while, and still been frustrated by my lack of results. I thought there must have been something I was missing. If you're pretty lean up top but seem to be storing fat down low, it could be a hormonal imbalance. 

Estrogen and testosterone are frequently deemed the "female" and "male" hormones, respectively, but both sexes have the two hormones. Males that tend to store fat on the back of the triceps, the hips, buttocks, and thighs are likely to have higher levels of estrogen. 

One of the biggest causes of estrogen/testosterone imbalances is blood sugar levels. A lot of males vary in their ability to metabolize estrogen, some bodybuilders and athletes can eat up to 6 donuts a day and still look absolutely ripped. But, other males can be very sensitive to sugar, and this can be one of the leading causes of weight gain. 

Hopefully I can post some progress pictures soon, but I'm definitely seeing some good results after regulating my sugar intake. I'm 23, 6'0, 175-180 lbs. I've been eating about 2200 kcal, (165C, 220P, 73F #iifym) and 60g of sugar, and it's definitely helped a lot. It was hard at first, I think there was some level of sugar dependency, but after about 2 weeks, it started to get a lot easier. For some people, every calorie may be the same, but I learned that it definitely isn't the case for me. Getting carbs from an apple vs. from a donut has very different effects on me. 

Obviously I'm no endocrinologist, and I'm still pretty new to this, but I noticed that there wasn't really a thread for this topic. I'd love to hear /r/fitness thoughts and experiences on it. Here are some pretty good links I read.

 correct me if im wrong. seems like there is significantly less use of angles in thailand muay thai. they stand and exchange directly in front of each other. other than stepping out at a 45 to throw the roundhouse 




 watched every game season and post season and have to say i agree. when cp lets blake lead the break, and blake picks it up early and gets to the rim, it's fine, but yeah. when he tries to dribble past the defenders.. no good 




 lol this was a sad fight. looked like a mismatch right away  




 college roommate. "bonerface" 




 i was at the game last night. AUSTIN RIVERS C L A P C L A P CLAPCLAPCLAP 




 "he's the best player in the playoffs"
"chicken fried steak"

BLAKE SHOW 




 blake is on another level... 
























 i really respect that. i'm definitely planning on knocking out far and reg first. starting work in august, so i'll have to finish bec and aud after i've started  




 2/4! you're almost done 




 yeah definitely. twice the first time through, then my review week again  




 Scheduled FAR for July 8. Doing Becker Self- Study. Thankfully haven't started full time yet, but I wake up stressed everyday. First thing I think about is, "I need to get this much done today." Sigh. Just venting. Good luck everyone else studying. Debits go on the left, credits go on the right.  




 crazy.. the things we can convince ourselves 




 are you saying you were knowingly pretending? or that you had actually convinced yourself? 




 have to say i agree. and LOL your username. guessing thats sarcasm 




 honestly this is what i think too. even when i was part of the faith i was skeptical about these people being "told" things 




 hey guys, so i grew up in church, and have only recently started thinking more critically. do you guys have any experiences with friends/pastors/churchmembers knowing things about you or telling you things like, "i felt called to tell you blah blah blah" or "i think god is telling me to tell you blah blah" or "i feel like you are going through this and this struggle" 

basically like they were being given information about you from a higher being? do you think these people are lying to themselves, tricking themselves by attributing their own subconscious knowledge/ perception to a higher being?

EDIT:

something else i just thought of, have you ever been prayed for in tongues? do you also think these people just fooled themselves into thinking they magically pray in another language? 




 some of my friends hug too much. like a hug should be over the top of the shoulders. some grab me by my waist, some touch my crotch or slap my ass. i just took it, but i eventually had to confront them and explain how uncomfortable i felt with excessive male-male touching.  




 cereal 




 LOL. i ended up watching the whole video 




 yo keep these coming. this is one of the coolest series on this sub 




 kind of interesting/scary. im a male, training fighter, so i usually feel pretty safe in terms of self defense. in my dream, i was sold into sex trafficking and forced to "service" other men. the traffickers were all pretty big and strong, so when i grabbed a knife and threatened them to make me stop, they just laughed and 3 of them jumped me before i could really pose a threat. they eventually got me to cooperate and forced me to go serve a client. he was a blonde boy, and when i walked in he said, "oh boy." and he was getting ready to rape me. then his dad called him on his cell phone, so he didn't actually do anything to me. he had a dog in the bedroom and i think it was a corgi. i remember feeling so utterly broken and powerless, and really ashamed. i looked at the dog and it looked at me back, and the craziest thing was, the only person who still treated me like i was a human was that corgi. 

maybe not scared shitless, but i can tell you i was disturbed. i'm 6'0, about 175 lbs, so i've really never felt that weak before. it also made me realize how scary it must be for girls. the fear of getting raped or kidnapped by a big scary man or group of men. shit 




 what a stud. props man 




 yeah if houston takes this one and harden gets some fire and confidence, game 7 away would be pretty scary 
























 trying to sneak a selfie. just be honest about it 




 yeaah... definitely ill 




 pizza hamburgers hot dogs ice cream cake cookies 




 that is so awesome. and respect. i was actually going to join the LAPD hahaha, but stuff happened...

 this is actually super interesting. if you added some fat this was kinda like brock lesnar vs. alistair overeem. lesnar naturally has a way bigger frame. overeem put on the muscle so they weighed the same.  




 run with a backpack on  




 hahahaha word 




 something else i wanted to add... im actually the drummer for my church and to be honest, i havent told the worship band where i stand in my (lack of) faith. but i still enjoy the experience of practicing and working together to create the best possible sound and experience for the church... i do plan to step down eventually 




 i see them as good works of art. music is a great experience and it can be explained by science honestly. there are 8 notes in a scale, which all vibrate at a certain frequency, and when they do it in certain combinations, they make major, minor, diminished, augmented,etc chords. i think music is just a good experience. and christian artists, despite what they are singing about, are conveying a meaningful emotional experience, with usually poetic and well written lyrics. so that combined with good musicianship and instrumentals would also make for a pleasant listening experience. no reason to feel guilty i dont think 




 first thing reading through that: you're a good writer and it was really cool reading your articulate thoughts. hell is scary, and the whole science vs. religion and how some christians think science is evidence of how detailed god is... idk it just seems like an easy way out. but yeah there are times when i think back to the christian teachings i was raised with. how there are passages like, the enemy will try to deceive you or there will be false gods and stuff like that. but when i try to really look at the world, god just doesnt make sense. every culture had a religion to explain how they came to being.  




 Anyone else have any experience with this? I grew up in the church so almost all of my friends were part of this church circle. It feels almost impossible to break out and meet new people that think like me. 

How did you guys find a new circle? The friends I grew closest with I still consider my friends, but there definitely is a divide now.  




 i'll never feel tall enough ripped enough smart enough rich enough. and to be honest im insecure and ive never really felt like an alpha male, but if i admit that and show it, i think i become even less "masculine" 




 if you want to compete in mma or get really good, it's going to be pretty hard. bodybuilding is definitely intense training but the conditioning, flexibility, and movement training would for a significantly different goal than being a good striker/grappler 




 CPA 




 i used to always make fun of my parents for napping during the day. i'd say things like, "what's so tiring about driving? all you do is sit in the car." now i understand the joy of a nap 
























 this is awesome 




 thank you so much for this... hopefully they dont catch on 




 genius 




 mood, self esteem, appearance. i have a naturally pretty large frame. 6'0. even when im not working out and eating pretty little, i drop down to 170 pounds which i think is pretty heavy for someone without much fat or muscle. i feel pretty ashamed if im out playing sports and im not strong or athletic. 

also in the working world. when guys wear their dress shirts and tuck. if you got belly or muffin top, or your ass is sticking out of your slacks or your legs arent firm, even the nicest people cant help but treat you a TINY bit different. if you look good, you perform good, you feel good 




 math 




 these videos used to piss me off, but now i find it satisfying to see him get beat 




 popcorn...

ice cream...

chips... 




 all my major muscle groups have gotten bigger. deltoids and back saw the most growth though. also my abs push out now, not as defined as i want yet, but the abdominal muscles have definitely gotten bigger. been 2 months of lifting for me too. "newbie gains" 




 ex machina 




 LOL 




 oh definitely. im sure in the heat of the game, once they lose their cool, they arent thinking straight and arent considering slowmo replays/ refs watching. 

also none of these plays are actually my favorite, if anything im poking fun at how stupid some of this is. i think any play that isn't a "basketball play" and can cause injury is really really stupid and could damage or even end another players career 




 oh was that last year? hahaha 




 darn missed that one
 




 everything works out in the end 




 burritos 




 hahaha i do that when im checking for acne or food stuck in my teeth. looks like im trying to get a good angle for a selfie...
