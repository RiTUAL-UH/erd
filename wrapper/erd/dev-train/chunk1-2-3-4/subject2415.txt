 Haha, no worries. We still enjoy your contribution!

 I'm sorry I didn't really make that clear. We basically never bring up religion with her. We pray before meals, but that's all.  We don't regularly go to mass, but she wouldn't have to go if she chose not to. We may mention that we feel blessed because something happened, but we wouldn't get into a deep discussion about how God granted us life and it's good, etc. etc.

When she brings it up, she goes into lengthy discussions of "with logic, the Christian God is easily disproven" or something along those lines. I have never said to her face that "God is an obvious fact of life" because no one really knows. Yet she has to shove down our throats that she doesn't believe in God, when we honestly are fine with that.

If we were making her uncomfortable and she spoke her mind, I would understand. But it's more like there is a break in the conversation and she'll say "so I saw this article" and go into a religious rant. I would never do that for her sake, yet she doesn't have the same courtesy for me.

I have friends who are atheist, and we get along fine. We either don't bring up religion, or when we do, we agree to disagree. Just conversation, not debate. My sister just thinks (and she's made this clear, I'm not just saying this) that as an ateist, she is discriminated against, which she most definitely is not. 




 My sister is an atheist and I am Christian. Being Christian, I know that I can't make a real point to my religion because it doesn't make sense; that's why it's called faith. I have no problem with my sister being atheist and think she can believe whatever she wants, yet she regularly brings up the beliefs of Catholics and why she is not one.  She not only does this around me, but around our Catholic family. Then we all get very uncomfortable because there is no way for us to back our beliefs because they are spiritual, not logical. I think she constantly brings it up because she is worried that people won't understand or are displeased with her for being atheist, yet we don't really have any opinion of it, we just don't want to have to explain to her why we believe what we believe because, well, we can't.

**TL;DR** People can believe whatever they like, just don't try to reason your beliefs because you'll just get in a heated discussion that makes everyone uncomfortable and angry.

you're welcome. 









 No, you definitely only want to give them one head shot. They're going to see a lot of people, they want as little from everyone as possible. Even if you will be wearing your glasses most of the time, auditioners want to see what you look like without them. It's just easier for them to know who and what they will be dealing with if you are hired. 




 I agree with TSpange. He/She is concerned that this person may be seeking fame, not a life as a performer. 




 I like it! The clothes and scenery are definitely great. I would definitely suggest taking off the glasses in the future. When you're in an audition, your auditioners want to see your face and your entire face. Also, I might try having the camera from a higher angle than you face. It makes the picture seem lighter and happier, but that's just a preference of mine. Nothing to look deep into.

You look great! 




 That's a really nice quote. I'll have to hang that up in my dressing room some day(; 




 Oh my God, you're right!! I just remembered something!!

My junior high had a little radio station (online, noone listened to it) and they wanted to interview me (because i'm just that awesome, haha). I sang two songs, both of which were very sad. Afterword, I had a friend tell me that someone thought I was actually crying, but my friend said it like it was an insult. Like, why would I be crying? It's just a song about growing up without a father and all the regrets you have... nbd. I was totally embarrassed.

Anyway, thank you so much for that!! This just made this all so clear to me. Thank you, thank you, a million times, thank you!! I'd give you gold if I had money, sorry that I don't): 




 I saw this last night on /new, but I decided not to post a comment... Oh the irony... 




 I think they were practicing on your comment. Sorry about that :/ 




 Totally agree. I try to do this as much as possible, but definitely good advice for me to remember. Thanks so much(: 




 Well, I think I'm pretty much good on your first and second tip, being a trained performer (though they are true and helpful nonetheless), but I think you're right one for tip three. I usually put on a brave face and say I'm not scared, but something is holding me back and I think it might just be me. I think I just have to let go and not be afraid of whatever I'm afraid of. Thanks Johnny Numbskull! 3 




 I am a high school student and a musical theatre actress hopeful. Being that I'm going into theatre, my voice teacher doesn't just have me sing songs, but act them as well (as all singers should). If I am singing a very emotional song, I find myself afraid to really get into character. I don't know why, but I can't just... get to where I should be. I hold myself back.

Does anyone have any tips on what I can do to fearlessly get into character, no matter how... extreme the emotion? 




 lazy ass title... 




 It's actually to the tune of an old drinking song, but I think it does the job as well(: 




 I don't know why so many people are ganging up on you, I'm behind your comment 100%. 




 OH MY GOD YES! This is why one of my goals as a musical theatre actress is to some day sing the nation anthem like I didn't just talk a few muscle relaxers. Personally, I think people screw up the national anthem so bad because they don't think their voice can deliver it well, so they have to fuck it up in order for it to be any good. 




 This may work for some people, but then eventually the reasons you reward yourself become smaller and smaller. Maybe at first, you smoke after cleaning the garage. Then it becomes after you did the dishes that were piling up. Then it's for making your bed in the morning.

Being an addict (not of smoking), I believe once you have an addiction, it never leaves you. You can tame it, but you can't get rid of it. Of course, each person is different, but I don't think it's worth risking. 




 I think it's horrible. The singing is okay, but definitely not up to par with the Broadway performance we all know and love. Also, the acting is just not there. Just lots of stone faces. Luckily, the music is so beautiful, it makes to movie slightly bearable, but the actors just don't do the job of telling such a beautiful story. 









 I love someone that knows a lot about stuff. Even if it seems random and uninteresting, I *love* it. Someone telling me about any topic and being able to listen and learn, I love. I have no idea why, but I think it's awesome. 




 You have to be careful, though. I have a friend who upon meeting someone will hug them and even begin to hang on them. Even though I am around this person a lot, I automatically feel uncomfortable around her when she gets close. Just be careful to hug when it counts. 




 I do this all the time because, as an actress, I naturally get nervous when looking someone in the eye. (It's like I'm looking my audience in the eye, just scares me instantly). I've only had one person realize it, and it because very awkward because they honestly thought there was something wrong with their nose when I would talk to them. 




 With in limits, I think. I know someone who in an instance of meeting them will hug them and ask them personal questions a friend would ask. It gets very uncomfortable, very fast. But of course, when I meet some one that will automatically be nice to me, talk to me, joke with me, and whatnot, then that's fine. I love that, in fact.(:

 I am so sorry hun. If you ask me, that is sexual assault. go to the doctor as soon as you can, and the the police. I am *so* sorry, no one deserves this treatment. And also, in my opinion, if you never wanted it to happen in the first place, you didn't lose your virginity. You have to freely choose to give that away, no one can take it from you. I hope you heal well. Please know that our hearts all go out to you. 




 I'm sure a lot of people here will think this is a very minor problem, but to me right now it's huge. Right now, I'm on my school's drill (dance) team, and it's every single day, so it's basically my life for the next four years. I plan on going into musical theatre, so I enjoy being involved in my school's show choir as well. The problem is that since my drill team takes up such a huge part of my life, by next year I'll have to chose between drill and choir. If I quit drill, then I can join more of the after school choirs [women's, jazz (which is basically more advanced), etc.] and open my schedule to more rest, homework time, and other activities that I wouldn't have even been able to consider before. But if I give up on drill team, I would also be giving up a huge part of my life: performing at football games, not being with my team which is like a family, competitions, an everyday activity, a great exercise, and a huge label (that I really like). One of my biggest issues is that I enjoy being a leader, and not just a member, so I couldn't be a leader of either if I'm in both, because, sadly, conflicts will force me to choose. (I'll be able to stay in choir no matter what, but a much lesser portion that I would prefer.) Also, just to note, I am a very skilled singer (as I've been told by professionals, I'm not just conceited) and not the greatest dancer, but I'm pretty good and much better than someone without any experience. Note, if I gave up drill, I could also start dance lessons. It amy seem small to a lot of you, but it's a huge part of my life right now and could determine how the rest of my life pans out. Of course this is a very personal decision, but does anyone have any opinions or points that may help me sway one way or the other? Thank you!

P.S. Sorry that my thoughts are kind of scattered!

 May I ask why? I found it very contradictory and the music kind of seemed half-hearted and kind of like a music box: easy to listen to, but isn't going to make you think or feel anything at all. 




 OH MY GOD YES!! I just saw an ad for this on facebook today and I seriously got up and started singing and dancing. 




 Thank you so much for sharing your story, it really means a lot.  Your motivation and sweet words will definitely get me through a ton throughout my life, I know.  Thanks, you are so kind for everything you've said to me (: 




 Good for you. I'm glad you have such strength(: We're all glad you're here. Thanks for staying with us. 




 Thank you. I truly appreciate your acceptance and support. Thank you for understanding, or at least trying to3 




 Thank you so much. This really and truly made me tear up because it made me so much happier. I've never had anyone tell me that I didn't have to be perfect, no joke. Thank you. You may have just drastically improve my life. (:

 Hi.  I'm a fourteen-year-old girl who just started high school and is pursuing a career in musical theatre.  I'm just going to say this right now, I'm not some sort of Rachel Barry (Berry?) wanna-be or some sort of YouTube singer that has no talent or real aspiration, just looking for fame and money, no.  I've been aspiring toward the theatres of Broadway since I can remember and I don't want any sort of fame or money. I just want to sing and be heard. And yes, I liked it before it was cool, and I'm fully aware that makes me sound like a hipster.

Anyway, like I said, I just started high school, but I have all the expectation piled on me. Honestly and truthfully, I'm good. Some might say great or amazing, but I'm not trying to brag, I'm just letting you know.  Because of this, I'm expected to be amazing and inspirational and all that, but I'm not. My mother expects me to get perfect grades, my sister expects me to get the lead in the musical as a freshman, my entire choir expects me to be perfect and on top of my game every day and never make a mistake and they think it's okay to put all the attention on me sometimes when it makes me uncomfortable (because come one, it's a choir), and it goes on and on and on.

I can't handle it.

I know my limits and my abilities, but noone else does. I'm supposed to be perfect. When I make an achievement, noone cares because it's expected. When I break down, it's just not okay, I'm supposed to handle all of this. When I make a bad grade, my mother tells me that I won't get into college. When I make a good one, it doesn't affect her. I, honest to God, got a 101% in French (granted, it's only the first half of the first quarter), but she was unimpressed because the rest of my grades weren't quite there.  They're all B's and A's, and again: I. Just. Started. High. School.

I'm breaking down.

When I was twelve, I was diagnosed with clinical depression. All of my friends had abandoned me for a dumb reason I'm not willing to get into and my parents thought I didn't need help. Every time I reached out to someone for help, they thought I was lying, or be overly-dramatic. I had three failed suicide attempts. (Note: I AM NOT CURRENTLY SUICIDAL. THIS WAS A YEAR AND A HALF AGO.) Finally, my principal caught wind of my situation somehow and decided to suspend me until I got medical help. (Just saying, she's a bitch. Never, ever force anyone with a mental problem to get help against their will.) I went to a therapist, I went to the hospital. My parents were in shock. They thought I could handle my own problems. They didn't realize my mom not being there and my dad's abusive, alcoholic, depressive behavior had rubbed off on me. They still don't. They blame everything all on my own inability to take care of myself. I got out three days before my thirteenth birthday.

Now here I am, going down a scary path again. The only friends I can get right now and mean to me, selfish, and expect me to be perfect, my parents are ignoring me, and I have all these.... expectations.

I'm not okay.

I want to self injure again, I'm inclined to take pain killers (I'm not doing these things, nor do I plan to. Just inclined. I have self-control.), I'm lonely, I'm sad...

I'm not perfect.


Well, I guess that's all I really have to say. Thanks for listening to me ramble about myself. I really appreciate it. 




 i was just thinking this today. so truee.

 Thank you aswell. As a Christian who is also quite liberal, I get nervous telling people about my religion because I'm worried that they will react like someone from /r/atheism . People like you make it less scary and remind me that I'm part of a wonderful community, even if we have a few nut jobs, like every other religion.

I know that this is all talk because you don't believe, but I do hope you find God someday. I hope this doesn't come off as pushing my faith on you, but I know that He loves you. I hope you have a wonderful life full of prosperity and happiness. 




 Oh, whoops. I thought I had a shitty theology teacher. Carry on.

 Drop your vowels a bit. When in choir, you make all you're vowels very "tall" or "proper" sounding. If you simply relax your tone, you should get more of a pop sound, or whatever you're looking for. If that doesn't work for you, practice saying one line by itself three times. Then say the same line three times in rhythm. Then sing it, trying to match how you said it, but to the correct tune. It should provide a more relaxed and spoken sound.

I hope this helps! 




 Right, but he was 61 at the time and didn't need any hospitalization (or at least didn't receive any), so it was definitely less. 




 I was twelve, and I tried to bleed out. I cut my wrist, but I didn't fully understand just how far I had to go. Eventually I got to weak from crying, etc. to keep trying, and I gave up waiting for another day.

I also tried ODing once, but again, was too young to know just how much one must consume to actually die. I only took six (maybe more, I don't really remeber) dayquils, but that's all I really had access to. Another time I took what was left of a bottle of Excedrin migraine (like 30 pills or so). I thought I would get high, pass out, etc., but I just got sick. I mean, really, really sick. No pain relief at all, just my stomach felt like absolute hell. I decided to throw up as much of it as I could. That time I think wasn't actually a suicide attempt, but really stupid that I could have possibly died from, since I was 12 or 13.

I'm one of those people that believes everything happens for a reason. I think I went through my suicidal phase so young, because I didn't have a full grasp on just how to take ones life. Now I just have to hope that I don't go threw another one.

Hope this answers your question(: 




 Nice repost. 




 They probably do. I know people that do this, and they think it's not obvious. It is. 




 Oops, sorry, I don't know what I was thinking there. I meant more like 1.5ish. Woah, I honestly don't know why I put that... 




 This isn't for advice animals. Go to a subreddit like /r/confessions or something. 




 Wow, that's amazing! I saw her in Les Mis in Fort Meyers, and I had heard so much about and of her. She is truly an amazing performer. It's great to hear that she's an awesome person as well.

Thanks so much! Hope unifieds went well(: 




 I have a very similar situation. My dad is a slight alcoholic, so whenever anyone I know / am around is drunk, I suddenly get scared and nervous. My dad has done very stupid things when he gets drunk, so naturally, I get scared. For example, my freshman year of high school, he actually picked my up raging drunk (like probably 1.5 or higher blood-alcohol level).

It is a naturally feeling to be nervous/uncomfortable with drinking, it just depends on the person. I personally feel like it's just stupid. Why drink something that's going to make your weird and out of control? You shouldn't need anything to have fun, you should just get high off life and enjoy it with a clear mind. It almost turns people into animals, in my mind. They can't actually make good decisions because they're not capable of reasoning. They just do.

And, to be honest, I have taken sips of alcohol from time to time, but only so that curiosity doesn't get the best of me and I get flat drunk. I just sip on it, realize it's gross, and move on. You don't want to risk the curiosity of why people do it getting the best of you.

I personally decide to set myself apart from people whilst intoxicated, and have learned that I can't stop them. It's a hard concept to deal with, and sometimes I get a lot of anxiety about it, but I know that I can't deal with being around that stuff, but I can't stop anyone. It's just one of those things that's completely out of my hands.

I'm sorry that you have to experience this, it's really hard. I honestly wish noone would drink; it's so stupid, and people die everyday from it. You just have to accept that it's a social norm and not much you can do about it, but decide that you're not going to.


Tl;dr   It sucks, and you're feelings are totally normal, but you can only control what you do.

EDIT:  Crazy typo on BAC, fix courtesy of nomopyt 




 What about with the couple? 




 I was at a presentation freshman year of high school with my entire class, and they showed a picture of a Uterus with cervical cancer. The speaker at one point said "Can we get a teacher over here?" We all seriously thought he was going to use female teachers to demonstrate something beyond embarrassing, but it had turned out a girl had passed out and needed to be carried out.

Tl;dr  A girl passed out a picture of cancerous uterus. 




 Can you tell me the story? 




 If you're going to use my single brew Keurig, throw the fucking pod away. It's not my responsibility to throw *your* shit away.

 I know, but that doesn't make it any less something he/she made up to whore in karma.

 You're somewhat correct. Users are supposed to take annoying, painful, etc. things they find in their daily life and, of course, blame Obama (all jokingly, of course). Redditors are not supposed the make things up, though. It's like if one were to take a picture of a flower, photoshop it to have two "heads," and then posted it to a subreddit like /r/mildlyinteresting. It would be interesting, if it were true.

And I knew all the things about the oily skin, but thank you still. My problem is just that I don't hydrate enough during the day. It's a horrible habit that I can't seem to break.

Thank you so, so much (again)!!3 




 Thanks so much for your reply! I have oily, acne prone skin, so I'm inclined to say full coverage, but I'm worried that it'll be too... fake looking I suppose. I normally go with medium coverage, but I probably would prefer a fuller coverage. And I definitely want a matter finish.

Thanks so much!! 




 I'm always buy my makeup at drug stores / target because I'm fifteen and don't really have enough money to invest in good quality makeup. Now I'm very excited because I received a large sum of money for my birthday, and can invest in some good quality makeup! My plan is to go to a Mac store and just get some foundation, powder, simple things that won't use up all the money I received, but I will be very happy with.
So I was wondering if you ladies and gents had some advice for me on what I should buy: favorite products, dos and don'ts, etc.

Thank you so much!

 These are fantastic! I prefer the third, glasses are usually not the best for headshots, in my opinion. Your auditioners want to see your entire face and what their working with. You also look beamingly happy, and it made me feel happier instantly. It was definitely a stand out.

Great photos!! I wish you the best of luck. 




 How stupid are people? 




 I love this one. 




 *applause* 




 If you go to the frontpage and click on "Submit a new text post," it'll let you. 














 Reynaud's is a bitch. That's why we moved to Texas. Invest in a good pair of mittens, they will save you from serious discomfort. 




 The photography isn't great, but as for your work, I think it's very nice. Facial expressions are good and the angles are flattering. Just, as most have said, invest in a better photographer.

Best of luck(: 




 The color white and grey in general (not necessarily together). I don't know what it is, but it will make a man stand out in a very sexy way. 




 Old Spice is fucking delicious. I am instantly more attracted to a guy who wears Old Spice. 




 Oh God yes. This is the sexiest thing a man can wear. 




 Yes. I already find you attractive. 




 I assume (s)he means tighter as in not sagging, but skinny jeans are not the most attractive thing on a guy (though it's usually not a turn off). 




 Damn, girl!! GORGEOUS3 




 I moved to Texas four years ago, things like this don't fase me any more. 




 I'm currently in high school and hoping to wait until marriage to have sex. I know that it is a difficult commitment, but I want to do that for my future husband because I know that he's worth it. I haven't entered a very large dating atmosphere, so I'm worried just in general how that will affect my dating life. Is anyone currently going down this path? Do you have any advice or stories to help me out. All entries are welcome and appreciated.

Thank you! 




 TIL Quakers are still around. 




 I've had a similar situation with "hearing" a voice. I was fourteen and upset about something stupid and I asked something, though I don't remember what, and I felt as if I heard the word "yes." I can't believe it was over something so stupid, but I've heard others say they've heard this voice. I when I found out about others, it helped me believe that I wasn't just a young, hormonal girl, so I thought you might like to know.

Amazing story, made me smile(: Thanks for sharing. 




 Gorgeous! 




 Some people actually believe that... 




 I cannot believe this real... Congrats, femmes franÃ§aises! 




 you've never made the front page...

EDIT: Spelling 




 Yeah, before you posted yours. 




 nice repost, asshole 




 nice repost. just saw this on the front page of this subreddit. do you even try? 




 Haha, well sorry I couldn't help you then. 
























 love this!! 




 I would have gone with a warmer shade of pink, but otherwise, GORGEOUS! I love this look so much, and you are beautiful(: 




 You look great! Happy birthday(: 




 I was expecting a "You've sure got her back" type joke somewhere on here... 




 Well, happy cake day then! 




 The eyes look very nice(: I would add some color to your face (blush) and lips, and bring out those eyebrows a little more. You look great! 




 No. 




 You might want to post this to /r/motorcycles 




 I'm confused... Today is your cake day. 




 That's exactly what college is for. People that complain about a college degree not getting them a job went to college for the wrong reason. It is meant to enrich your mind, and in turn make you more skilled at your craft and hopefully more valuable to a workforce. Good for you(: 




 Damn, girl, you're talented!! 




 This is gold! 




 I had been on this subreddit for just under a month, and then one day I just wasn't motivated anymore. I realize that masturbating wasn't affecting my confidence or anything, I just decided that I wanted to stop. Now I can't get motivated again, and I thought if I heard some of your reasons why, I would find motivation in that.

Thanks for sharing! 




 You're not alone... 




 Hey, my area code is 972 as well! I don't know why I found that so interesting... 




 WOOW!! You look gorgeous! I'm officially obsessed with this look! 




 Do you mean is? 




 [Just gonna put this here...](http://i.imgflip.com/1bh6.jpg) 




 May I just say, you are gorgeous!! 




 No joke. 




 My first musical in high school was Grease. Couldn't agree more. 




 Love Never Dies.

No way in Hell. 




 Haha, your welcome, I suppose. Honestly, the story is so amazing, I wouldn't normally care. The only reason I point it out is it was actually a vocabulary word of mine (being in high school and whatnot) and couldn't resist.

Thank you so much for your contribution to reddit. Your posts will never be forgotten. 




 Oh. My. Lord.

My heart just wept... 




 This is amazing, and I appreciate what you've done here. I am so sorry for this, but I couldn't help myself...

... you're trapped between the split in the ice *floes*. 




 Anyone else start suddenly playing the soundtrack of *West Side Story* in their head? 




 Did you have another job while performing this job? If so, what was it? and if you didn't, what would you do while on your period? 




 Anyone else find this incredibly sad? 




 Oh... Haha, I hummed this to myself and though, "well, I don't recognize this tune from anywhere..." 




 Wow, that is a very good look on you!! I'm usually not a fan of bangs, but your face was made for them(: 




 Maybe, but that's just not how I look at it. I don't think He *did* it for me, He just helped me feel confident and strong enough to push myself to my fullest ability. But I completely understand why one might look at it that way. I just believe that there have been so many people that have helped me get to where I am today, and He had a portion too. Thank you for your support. It gave me a smile. 




 Well, thank you, and I understand how you would think that. I think I wouldn't have had the strength to push myself so much if it had not been for His mental support.

But still, thank you very much(: 




 Thank you so much(: 




 fixed post... http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1cre0b/what_the_power_of_prayer_did_for_me_this_week/ 




 Hi /r/Christianity,

I am a fifteen year old girl who is on her high school's drill/dance team. This week, we had tryouts for next years team to see who would make varsity and who would make Starlettes (JV). I am just about to graduate from my freshman year (so in tryouts, I am considered a sophomore), and since the beginning of this year, I have been a Starlette. I knew I was a better dancer and deserved to be on varsity, but I waited patiently for my turn to move up. Once tryouts came along I knew it was my time to shine.

But still, I couldn't do it alone. I knew that even when I had put forward my best effort, I still hadn't moved up during the year like some other girls had. I was confused and scared and had no idea what I was doing wrong. So I prayed. I have been praying for about a month that I would make the varsity team, with the help of St. Vitus (the patron saint of dancers) and St. Genesius (the patron saint of performers). God gave me the strength to work my hardest in the upcoming weeks to tryouts.
Well, yesterday was tryouts, and I made varsity! Yay!! And not only that, but as a sophomore, I made the highest score out of the whole team, plus a $100 scholarship. WOAH! My director told me that the judges were wondering why I hadn't tried out for officer (the highest authority position), yet I hadn't even been on varsity yet.

**Yes, I do acknowledge that it was my hard work that paid off, but I got the moral support from God. It wasn't like He told me *Okay, now do 100 jackknives and then sit in you splits for a minute, each side.* That was me. But I think He helped guide my patience and my focus. He inspired me to work toward this goal that I ultimately received.**

This is surreal. I honestly cannot believe I am so extremely lucky that such a thing could happen to me. This is almost unheard of, and I am so unbelievably happy. To add on, just two years ago I was fighting an extreme depression and battling thoughts of suicide, but God saved me. If I had given up then, I wouldn't be here now. Thanks to His guidance, I have never been happier. My life is going amazing, and I am so thankful to Him. Just ask, and He will do anything for you. You are His son/daughter and He could not love you more.

**TL;DR:** Trust in God. He will give you the strength to carry on, even when it gets tough. 




 I'm sorry. I guess I did misunderstand. I just got very defensive when I thought you were undermining my mistake. My apologies for lashing out. 




 Excuse me?

Being a part of a drill team is an extreme dedication that is hard to explain. You spend every hour of every day trying to be perfect, a goal that can never be truly reached. It takes so much concentration and strength. I put everything I have into this, but I couldn't do it alone. I have no idea what this has to do with me being a young person. Sure, there are many other things that are much more severe that the Lord has helped people with, but this is what is important to me. I am extremely embarrassed that you would suggest that people would "rip it apart." I'm sorry, but you made me feel like my accomplishment amounts to nothing.

Think before you speak. 




 Dem lashes... aw my gawd. 




 Congratulations! You look beautiful!! 




 Wow, that's amazing! 




 Hello lovelies,

I normally don't do my waterline, but when I do (for my drill team), it is a hot mess. (FYI: I use the twistable pencils aka crayon eyeliners.) Every single time it smudges everywhere. No matter what I do, it ends up all over my lower lids and looks horrible. Can anyone advise me on what to do? I'm sick of wiping my eyes to get all the ugly blackness off of them):

Thank you! 




 Thank you! 




 Can someone tell me what he said? It was deleted. 




 Yup. 




 That poor girl... 




 Ah. Sorry about that. 




 Why is this on this subreddit? 




 Same here. I was writing the word "label" trying to spell it as "lable." I could *not* figure out what I had done wrong. I also have gotten stuck over "santa" vs. "satan" quite a few times. That one is a bit more concerning. 




 Thank you for this!! I am currently enrolled in a Catholic high school, and I have much respect for the Islam faith. I understand that we have our differences and my beliefs differ from that of yours, but we are very similar and just want to love God. I'm so sorry that you're beautiful faith has been associated with such horrible acts that you and the vast majority your fellow Muslims are not responsible for.

Go in peace and love. 




 That's definitely enough proof for me. Dammit reddit...

Thank you! 




 Maybe Kids Bop is the Canadian KidzBop? 




 Nope. Sexy zebras. When I was in eighth grade, I had a friend so used this phrase instead of "cool" or "interesting." Now it's my username. 




 What was it like when you saw yourself for the first time all doctored up? Was it a relief, or strange to see a new face? On that note, how similar do you look in comparison to before that son of a bitch decided to fuck with the wrong woman?

Thanks so much for answer *so. many. questions.* you truly are amazing and I wish you an amazing life here on out. 




 Yeah, I've heard that they can be perceived as gay, but honestly, I think they are amazingly attractive. They hug and show *just* enough. 




 Relevant username? 




 Boxer briefs are so goddamn sexy. 




 I also cleanse my face in the shower. It's so convenient and refreshing! 




 That's the hardest habit to break, and you're not alone. I believe that it's okay to break once in a very few time. Just remind let this be a release, not a relapse. 




 I'm currently selling that on eBay. Price went from under a dollar to over ten dollars. 




 If it makes you feel better, most women think men should have to ball sacks. We only pretend to know what's going on, and it's easier to pretend because the male anatomy is somewhat less complex than a woman's. 




 Yeah, I use the ultra thin liners for when I have a super in and have to wear a thong. (Note:  I'm on a dance team.) 




 Yeah, when it first kicks in, you know. It's easier to tell when you get it when you wake up, but when it's during the day, personally, my thighs get sweaty and my uterus feels like it's being used for a scratching post. 




 I definitely get turned on more easily. The right song can send me into a dizzy fit on sexual tension. 




 You could say cool, I would say annoying... Haha, Glad I could help!
 




 That's fairly accurate. 




 For me personally, I've only had mine for about four years, but I have adjusted to knowing how my period works and understand it better. I am more of an instinctual person and have paid very close attention to how my body works. 




 I'm not going to lie, I don't know / haven't study much about what exactly is going on down there. I do know that the first few days is a lot of what seems like tissue and blood. The rest of the time is still the tissue, but not so much blood. To get a more accurate description, you would have to ask a professional, but I know for me, I never have only blood, but I do sometimes have only uterine wall.

EDIT: (Currently on my period) You can have just blood. 




 Yeah, I hate waking up to a dirty pad. I usually wear a pad in addition, but alone, it grosses me out too much. I never use a tampon for more than twelve hours. I usually switch them three times a day (partially because I'm too lazy to do it more): when I wake up, in the afternoon, and before I go to sleep. 




 FenÃªtre. It means "window" in French, but I think it sounds beautiful. 




 Not at all. I actually find you quite beautiful. 




 I already posted this comment, but I'll just copy and paste it down here for you.

Too be honest, it can be hard to tell sometimes. For most women, you wake up in the morning and their tampon is still white, so they can move on. For other women like me, the bleeding stops, but the uterine wall still sheds for a few more days. In the end, a woman's uterus feels fresh and renewed, and your body kind of tells you when it's over.

To sum up, womanly instinct. 




 Damn you...

 The bloating going away. Every period I get, my belly puffs up like a bubble. When it's done, I realize I have a great figure. It is a *huge* confidence boost.

I also have to add that you feel a lot less gross and, well, *are* a lot less gross when your uterine wall isn't coming out in bloody patches. I would add the cramps finally going away, but mine usually only stick around for the first half.

**TL;DR** You don't feel disgusted by your own body once it's over. 




 Daaayum. 




 I would've posted something in French just to see if anyone noticed... 




 You know, there's a reason we have subreddits like /r/confession ... If this were real, it wouldn't be posted here. 




 I took it in today and decided to let then go ahead and replace the hard drive. It was in really bad condition, and none of the files could be read. Thanks again for all your help(: 




 Thank you so much!! It really helps to understand the situation. I tried to repair it, but the b-tree problem arose and claimed that the disk could not be repaired. When I pressed my ear to the bottom of my laptop, I heard ten clicks, followed by two, four second vibrating noises. I assume that's he clicking sounds you were referring to, so I shut it off for the night.

Thanks again!!!! 




 I was using my laptop last night to listen to music, and I realized the music had become slow and choppy, so I decided to turn it off. When I turned it back on, it took a very long time and it popped up with a screen I had never seen before. (I'm don't really have an adept knowledge in computers, so please bear with my somewhat vague explanations.) It allowed me to navigate to something that told me I have an "invalid B-tree node size." I cannot access my files or desktop now. What does this mean? Can I fix it, and if so, how? 




 I was going to question the date, but then I realized that I'm just an American... *facepalm* 




 Yes, but I have come across people that have thought less of me when I have told them I am Catholic. In Catholic high schools, there is a large group of people who are atheist and I tend to socialize with the people a lot, just by chance. When they found out that I was not an atheist, some avoided me or just appreciated my company less. I guess it's just a level I can't relate to, but I still worry that they think I'm a nut or something.

I'm not crazy, I just think I have a loving Father waiting for me on the other side. 




 When I saw the title, I was not expecting gore makeup... Nonetheless, she did an amazing job! 




 **DON'T PRETEND YOU DON'T KNOW THAT WE GAVE YOU THE EIFFEL TOWER!!** 




 Can I have this? This pack looks AMAZING! 




 Not at a time like then, when they take over our subreddit... 

**TO /R/FRANCE!!** 









 **NON!! C'EST PENIBLE!!**

**THAT'S THE ONLY FUCKING FRENCH I KNOW TO INSULT YOU WITH YA DAMN COMMIE!! DON'T MAKE US TAKE BACK THE EIFFEL TOWER!!** 




 **NOT TO MENTION THE EIFFEL FUCKING TOWER** 




 Moisturize, moisturize, moisturize!!

I know that it can sound contradictory, but moisture is an oily face's best friend! When your skin becomes dehydrated, it overcompensates for the lack of water with *oil*. Benzoyl peroxide can also have a drying effect on the skin, so you can use it, but with moderation. Drinking more water can also help.

As an oily girl too, I hope this helps!!

P.S. **MOISTURIZE!!** 3 
























 I know it depends on where you live, but that seems crazy! From what I've looked up I've seen somewhere around $10. 




 I definitely get that. Thanks! 




 I'm combo/oily myself, so that's perfect! Do you have a reason that you prefer it? Thanks(: 




 That sounds great, thanks! I'm an NC25, do you have any idea what shade I would want to pick up? I'm horrible at choosing the right shade. Thanks again(: 




 Hello lovelies,

I am absolutely in love with MAC foundation, but have finally admitted to myself that, as a highschool student, I cannot afford it. (Yes, it was a sad day.) Do you guys have suggestions for what I should switch to, being on a LOW budget?

Thanks! xx

EDIT: Powder suggestions are welcomed as well(: 




 LOVE THIS! Absolutely gorgeous(: 




 Same here! Doing this for the sanctity of my (future) marriage and to get closer to God. There are some more personal reasons as well, but that's what brought me here! 




 I feel you... Ten days can do amazing things to you(: 




 This is the story of my life. 




 Agreed. 




 I agree. His name is Peter Joback, and I don't find the appeal... 




 I love Samantha's Christine!! But Peter... I don't know... definitely not my favorite. 




 I knew it! Haha, that's hilarious!! 




 I don't know why I click on that... 




 I would've instantly freaked out before taking the picture... 




 Morpheus is currently down, so maybe! That would be awesome. 




 My bad. I thought it was a retort to the "No." 




 I see now. Thanks. 




 Ah... Thank you. 




 ...an apostrophe? 




 Stop. Reposting. This.

Please. 




 Woah. I had no idea that they were literally knots. Thanks! 




 Woow!! I wish I was that creative! This is amazing! 




 Thanks! I would have really freaked out not having heard that!! 




 Thanks(: 




 Thank you(: 




 Awesome and gross. Haha okay. I usually gets vitamins and what not from Walgreens because they're cheap, but I was just wondering because I couldn't just find B. They were mostly B-12 and B-Complex. Do you have a preference, or don't know?

Thanks for the quick reply(: 




 Which vitamin Bs do you take? 




 As you've seen, treatment is available, and you should be okay. Sorry for that scare. I hope you're doing okay. 




 STDs are not funny. Even when easily treatable, they are diseases and definitely not fun. Sometimes it's too late to treat anyway. I think he'll be okay, but it's definitely a cause for concern. 




 You did an amazing job!! I think it honestly looks better than the original... 




 Thank you for that(: 




 The thing is, I don't really have a reason. I read about all these people who suffer so much from it and it made me decide to try and quit. It's like I know it's good for me, but I haven't gone through much of anything making it bad in the first place. 




 Just getting turned on in general. My body says I want to, and even when my brains says I don't, I relapse. 




 Thank you for the support(: 




 Thank you(: 




 Hey fapstronauts. So I've been feeling really lost and alone on my journey lately. We're 60,000 strong and yet I feel really alone in my chalenge. Maybe it's because I don't post enough with you guys, but also because 1) there's noone I know personally to relate to with this and 2) I feel kind of like a minority here being a 15 y/o girl. My weakest temptations are the ones that make me fall, and then I sometimes don't even feel bad. Any words of advice or inspiration? Mostly, I just needed to vent a little. 

NoFap, thank you for existing. Someday my life will different. 




 I don't know if there's something wrong with me, but that speech at the end made me want to cry. Thanks for this. 




 I definitely think it's harder as a teen with hormones, our brains not being fully developed, and whatnot. 




 I'm fifteen as well. Good to hear from other teens(: If you scroll down the page you'll see nine buttons, one of which says reset badge. 




 As a singer, that would be my dream come true. 




 The overall quality isn't quite what you'd want on a headshot. I also avoid windows because they provide really uneven lighting, which is really bad for headshots. Accent your eyes, they're gorgeous! 




 The camera angle is too low, and the attention draws to your clothes as opposed to your eyes. Smile also looks a little fake and ... awkward. Overall, it's a good picture of you, but not a great headshot. 




 This is the repost of all reposts,... but I still think it's hilarious. Have an upvote. 




 Figured that out recently, and I have. Thanks, though. 




 That sounds awesome. In the past, my mildest urges have gotten me to relapse. Hope I have that kind of self control someday(: 




 Totally agreed. It was like her jaw was nailed together. Also, she needs to put her chin down. It was like she was drawing a picture with her head. 




 Well, she did a great job!! 




 Best of luck to you. It's not an easy journey, but it's an amazing one. Make sure you set up a badge so you can track your progress with us(: 




 I'm so happy for you(: Do you remember when your urges kind of died down? Just curious. Thanks! 




 Totally agreed. I don't post too often, but I check the page everyday and usually comment quite a bit. Even if I just look at the top post really quick, I feel like I have so much support around me. 




 I think that would make me cry, and fap anyway... But hey, it looks like it's worked for other people(: 




 So cute!! I love that look! I usually see it with blue, but the pink with blue eyes looks GORGEOUS! 




 "I Have a Dream" and "I Dreamed a Dream" are very different songs... 




 Thanks, I'll try that(: 




 I've tried that, and it didn't even kind of work... Thanks for the advice, though(: 




 It's not that we can't, it's just that if we don't notice, we're gonna get an ass full of toilet water. I know a lot of girls are way too bitchy about this. Most of the time I notice and put it down myself. Most women figure that men just have to aim closer, but women may fall in. 




 Congratulations! Good luck on your journey, it's a hard one. Be sure to set a counter so you can view your progress! Also, have an escape plan. Plan something very specific to do if you feel the urge to relapse. As someone whose relapsed a handful of times, this is *very* helpful. Again, good luck! 




 Sex. Sex. SEX. Yeah, my cure for a headache used to be to masturbate. I'm feeling pretty calm now, but if any more websites suggest sex (or masturbation for me), then I'm afraid I might do just that.

Has anyone else come across this problem? Any tips? Good way to get rid of a headache?

Thanks guys. I'm so happy I found this subreddit. I know I'm only on day 3 now, but I have a feeling it's gonna stick this time(: Love you all. 




 I found it. It's right by the small lake. Hope that helps! 




 Very true. Thank you. 




 Just spent a few hours playing around with this house. It's amazing! 




 You're not alone... 




 Yes, I agree. This is a little insine. 




 You look fantastic! Glad to see you happy with your appearance. You're gorgeous. Keep posting. 




 What a title. 




 She does say that she can't live up to me a lot, but I don't know what to do about it. I can't stop being myself to make her happy. 




 I agree, but she won't go to counseling. And I've been to enough to where if I can be in a good, calm environment, I would be fine. 




 No. It starts with an M. 




 I was diagnosed over two years ago. I don't talk about it anymore. 




 Today's my mom's birthday and she's sitting downstairs crying. My sister thinks her life is over because she isn't in honors classes and is sixteen years old. My dad is too old to be dealing with teenage drama (he's almost 62). My sister hates me because I am happy, confident, and know what I'm going to do with my life. If I want her to be happy, I can't. She throws these huge temper tantrums, and everyone hates each other because of her. Not to mention, I have clinical depression, but I'm afraid to talk about it since she's already so messed up.

I don't think any of us can be happy until she leaves. 




 That is one beautiful dog!! 




 Having a pause button. I'll be sitting in class thinking, *wouldn't it have been nice if this morning once the alarm went off, I could have just paused and gotten all the extra sleep I wanted?* Or pausing just to finish my homework. This seeps into my thoughts all the time. 




 Ohhh.... Thanks! 




 Still don't get it... Care to enlighten me? 




 Did anyone else read that as hashtag one? I'm ashamed of myself... 









 It didn't help that it said Texas in the title. 




 I was so hoping that this was a gif. 




 Very true, and I am feeling better now, thank you. Hope you are aswell(: 




 No, but I've been through treatment before. There is a history of substance abuse (alcoholism) in my family, and I'm too afraid that I'll get addicted. I stay away from that kind of stuff. It's just not right for me. 




 Exactly... Thank you so much for the support. 




 Huh, I never thought of it that way. Thank you so much(: 




 I don't know, really. It's more depression as the disease than depression as the effect of something. It's hard to explain, really, so that's a completely valid question. 




 Thank you. I know, there really isn't much to say, but it's comforting just knowing that someone is reading this. 




 Nothing went wrong... I don't know, I just feel bad. My heart is kind of sunk, and I don't know why. Depression just sucks. It's always looming in the distance, but it wasn't too far away today. I'm normally not to stuck in my depression, or at least haven't been too sick for the past few years, but today, I feel bad.

This is a lame post, I know. I just needed someone to talk to. Thanks. 




 I don't even... Wow. 




 You're amazing!! Keep it up, you really have a talent there! 




 You are my favorite person. 




 I totally understand. Either way it's a good look(:
