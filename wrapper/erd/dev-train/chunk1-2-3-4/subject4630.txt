the only thing that's changed is the qualifications of what is a "good grade." straight A's will always get you into college, even if it's not MIT. 




 How to duggy 




 I really wish I had an "I'll start," but sadly that's not the case. Do tell though. i think it makes people happier to know there's a reason to have faith in humanity! 




 well I guess that's okay. It can also be hard to see through the smoke sometimes :D !  




 Pineapple. Dead center. Ish. Don't be that blind. I'm too poor to get good "equipment." or anything besides a crappy camera. Like I said, you should send me a really awesome thousand dollar one and I'll re-do it.  




 I'm actually not able to enhance it, I tried downloading a couple programs but my computer's a little bit not high tech enough. If you wanted to send me a much better camera then then cheap one I can afford, I'll gladly take another one and PM it to you!  









 GIVE ALL THE UPVOTES 




 One of the few times I'm glad my computers slow and plays GIF's in slow motion. 




 It only goes up to Quad xp. And that's only if you have double xp from a coin or something like that. That's what they said when the game was released. Still not worth it for a coin, lol, but prettay cool. 




 Completely immune :/ to everything 




 Yeah I will admit that EVERY time I play that map there is SOMEONE there, I've started skipping it because it gets so bad. You're right, it does suck because it's one of the ONLY maps where you can actually have sniping battles, not quickscoping and smgs. 




 I saw a clan trying to do it. There's a wall, and you can just jump through the spot on the wall. I really doesn't take much effort, I can see a very rare chance of someone finding out about it on accident. very rare, but still there. I would doubt anyone would get banned "on accident." 




 Nice, thanks for that, but actually I saw a clan, of course, trying to get in it and I figured it out for myself. I was just expressing my opinion, you don't need to call me a liar. And I can honestly say I have no idea what cod 1337 is. I agree with what you said in the last part, though. I guess my opinions changed. Just be more cool, man. 




 That's true, and I forgot about that. They still need to stop making it so easy, though, lol. 




 I feel like it's really uncool of them to put something so exploitable in the game. I mean, I found it and now it's like, I didn't cheat to get it, you gave it to me. They need to patch it and stop doing this, like the prestige tokens. Why should people get banned? They didn't mess up or change the code or do ANYTHING that they were told they weren't allowed.  




 I thought it was funny 




 I upvoted for going through and thanking everyone that responded, lol 




 1st pic: not bad, not absolutely stunning like the second one :) I vote short hair 




 Three types: TDM, KC, and DOM is one lobby, Objectives is the second lobby, and Harcore mosh pit is the third lobby option. though you can get a dlc map randomly in the regular playlists if everyone in the lobby has them. 




 How did you first get involved with clans in general?
I googled CoD clans, picked one that sounded interesting to me
How did you get into the current clan you participate in?
Last one broke up, I migrated with some members
What are the benefits of being involved with your clan?
Mw3 is terrible to play by yourself, we're a strictly "for fun" clan so it lets you play with people you know.
Has it created a community/friendships for you?
Yeah, definitely. We communicate and help each other out, joke around, and practically spend every night shouting at each other (In a good way. ish, lol)
Do you know anyone from the clan outside of xbox live?
no
If so, how?
nope
What is the goal of playing with a clan?
fun and playing with people you know
 . What methods do you use to set up matches?
Just whoevers online joins a lobby/party
Do you see a competitive future for your group?
Not at all
How do you stay in touch with fellow clan members?
Just whoevers online, party chat.

Clan name's Rise Against Gaming, changed from Soldiers of Desolation (SoD). Good luck with your project 




 I probably won't answer. 




 This is like one of those signups at the mall, except I would gladly give my email and social security number for a free Skyrim. 









 A couple questions...
   - What is the chance that we actually can achieve H3 fusion?
   - How much H3 would we need to get from the moon to continue testing? Like, how much from the moon would we need?
   - Why haven't we done it already?? 









    So there's this girl I talk to once in a while, same friend group as me. However, according to some of her friends, and her obvious actions, she has a crush on me (Yay not foreveralone!) I'm not opposed to anything possibly happening between us, however, every time we have a conversation, she makes it super duper awkward. Like, if I say I like something, she'll make a big deal about liking it too... and then it dissipates into silence. Any advice on making the situation more comfortable?

P.S. if any of you spell awkward wrong, I will cry. 




 For the past several years, I've been a straight A student. I went to high school three years early by moving to a city that had a program that allowed me to do that. I've always had a pretty good work ethic. For the past couple months, though, I've been having difficulty maintaing my school work. I've done literally no work outside of class. I scrape by by making up lies and turing stuff in late. Is there any way to get back into a system where I can get motivated? It's gotten so bad I spent more time on reddit writting this post then I did on my eight page history paper due... 1st block tomorrow. Any help would be great.

EDIT: I was diagnosed with depression a year ago, and it's been downhill ever since. 














 lololol 




 I've shouted that exact same phrase at my friends, lol "This is game frustration, chill out" if they get mad in real life. I think it's a sign that you're getting into the game. Of course, it can evolve into real life frustration, but I think a healthy array of emotions is good for gaming. Getting "game frustrated" relieves anger in real life for me, and makes the game that much more captivating. 




 What works for me whenever this happens is to sleep. And a fair amount of tears :/ Anger is what makes it go away for me. Probably really weird. But getting mad at the sadness. Determination to make it go away. Pissed off at what it's doing to you, me, everyone. For some reason whenever I feel utterly terrible I drive really fast and tell the sadness to F off, I'm going faster then it can.  




 back at ya :) 




 Skyrim: Awesome. Waaaay to many bugs and glitches, but it's the best work of art I've ever seen. if you need proof of this, just look at the sky for ten seconds in the game. 

Worst...: This pains me to say, because mw3 is my favorite game (sue me) but it really is junk artistically. Same format for everything, copy of mw2 virtually, simple menu and texture packs. Done. 




 My type of game is cod :( I know, hate on me but it's what I enjoy. However, if I bought the game because I enjoyed the story, I would be incredibly stupid. I might play the first mission. But probably not. So far on mw3, I've got 20 minutes on the campaign, and 8 days on the multiplayer. Campaigns are just gone from those games, but I'm not really into single player so I'm okay with that. 




 originally posted on wrong subreddit, then switched.
 




 Nah, i'm not sure exactly what happened but I didn't remove or edit this post. I can see why the moderators might have removed it, cuz it wasn't a question, but then it was in relation to all you guys :/ 




 As i was reading this it shocked me because of how similar my life is to yours right now, i can relate so much. I just wanted to let you know that there are people out there who understand :/ 




 I apologize, because this wasn't really a question as much just sayiing thanks. :/ this subreddit is the best, though, so it seemed appropriate :)
 




 I enjoyed this
 
























 That's such a good way of putting it. I've just been searching for so long to find someone who really cares, and wants to know me for who i am. 




 You're not alone, man. I wish you good luck, and I know that there are people who care about you. Don't forget about them. I guess it's comforting to me to know that it's not a personal flaw that makes me like this tonight, it's something that the world just happens to do to a person at the worst time. I hope we both get through it, and I want you to know i care about you, i don't care what flaws you have, I guarantee there are happy people who have worse. So don't blame yourself. 




 shitty repost, nice
 



















 It's definitely a karma whore, just look at the username of the second post 




 zip lock bag. Done. 




 eighth grade, I had this old woman in her 70's who taught philosophy. The class consisted of her lecturing for an hour and a half (she used to be a college prof.) and everyone playing games and sleeping. I usually tried to pay attention, but it was on and off.
   One day she decided to have a "philosophical" discussion, I forget what it was about. Anyway, I had an opinion that differed from the rest of the class and her (mainly because it was the only one she had taught them) so I took my side and tried to explain it. After some back and forth, she looks to the class and says "I know not all of you are as stupid as him; does anyone know the right way to think about this?" 
   And of course nobody raised their hand because they had no idea what we were talking about, but it still made me feel pretty bad. 




 Force quit it... oh wait... 




 ... This question wasn't made for me... 




 I AM NOT TELLING YOU YOU ARE WRONG. I am simply telling you that you should not tell me or anyone else that they are wrong. God is a very complicated answer, in fact its the only one that's stuck around for several thousand years. 




 Nah, just in general when you're comment specified at the beginning. If you said a purple god that rides horsies in manhattan had been disproved, I would say cool. But saying god in general/religion is wrong, thats not the same. 




 Okay. Well then I'm not going to tell you you're wrong. But you said it would appear. If there are conditions such as "this only shows its existence if it makes sure it can't be proven to exist" (which is okay,) then WHO THE FUCK AM I TO TELL YOU YOU'RE WRONG? 




 I can walk up to you on tuesday, put my face in your ass for the entire day and see if I tasted the rainbow. If not, you'd be wrong. Prove god's not in my heart (soul, spirit, all that good stuff n stuff)
And why is the burden of proof on me? i'm not the one telling you I'm right. You're the one telling me I'm wrong.  




 :) Having a conversation and having someone listen is different. And i'm not saying god is the only one that can listen or change a heart. People can do that, i hope. But What I'm saying is you shouldn't trash my faith by calling it a lie when you can't even prove you're right. 




 How do you know they're not real? Who are you to tell me I'm wrong? I'm not trying to convince you you're wrong. I'm not telling you you're wrong. I believe you're wrong. But who the fuck am I to tell you that? You have no authority. Stop acting like you do. Prove to me he there's any shred of a sign that he doesn't exist. then you can tell me what to believe. 




 That's a cool way of looking at it. What gets me is /r/atheism. They post thousands of posts trashing my faith, but blame religion for being oppressive, corruptible. Of course it is. /r/catholics aren't calling atheists fucking stupid. Who are they to say they know I'm wrong?
 




 I think it's however someone wants to define it, it means so many different things. To me, it means that this universe did not just poof out of the butt of an atom during the big bang. Well, i mean that's certainly possible but that it wasn't just a coinkydink. And besides. My life is very fucked up. God is the only thing on this planet that has taken the time to listen to me. 




 I don't think it's a scientific fact that they don't exist. We just haven't proven their real. If someone had a reason to believe in it, who are you to tell them they're wrong?? 




 ORLY. 




 True. 




 tax breaks for the rich create a crappy economic system. agreed.

 True. I guess it's just personal preference. I know a lot of people that say it should be abolished, but there's not really a good way to do that. And I couldn't possible take notes in print, it'd take waaay to long

 Haha, like, what's the protocol for this? Do I take a picture in a week when spring breaks over?  




 Holy shit, this kid is in my fourth hour chemistry class. He gets bullied all the time, I talked to the teacher about it last week.... Shit.... The internet's real... 0.o like... I know that kid... I'm seeing in a week... Spring break for now... 




 He went to Kickapoo high school in Springfield, I'm currently in a gym class with his niece. Small world.

On this comment thread
 




 Halo 1, Bungie admitted that the pistol was only that powerful because of a glitch. Entirely changed the game, but not in a bad way 




 So today I've been working on a final paper, and I decided to work on leveling up. What I did was go into infection, and find the best hiding spot you can. Leave your guy there, because (I think) this is the only gametype where you WON'T be kicked for not moving! I've gained 200,000 xp in the past few hours just by looking up at the end of every game. 

NOTE: This is for gaining XP when you're doing something else, like working on a final! 









 But... but... I'm a loser :( 




  Sorry I totally forgot the [FIXED] in the title :( sorry!! 









 Sure 




 This defines religious persecution. I see no conflict, sorry 




 I think this will help everyone on this thread. Just the definition of the word everyone's debating. It does not mention having rights stripped or taken away.


per·se·cute (pûrs-kyt) tr.v. per·se·cut·ed, per·se·cut·ing, per·se·cutes 1. To oppress or harass with ill-treatment, especially because of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or beliefs. 2. To annoy persistently; bother. 




 per·se·cute  (pûrs-kyt)
tr.v. per·se·cut·ed, per·se·cut·ing, per·se·cutes
1. To oppress or harass with ill-treatment, especially because of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or beliefs.
2. To annoy persistently; bother.
 




 No it does not, actually. I think the word you mean is something along the lines of "physical persecution," or something like that. But I understand what you mean, Just, the word does not mean what it seems to be that most people think it means. 




 Nah, I was just kidding. It just is a hostile picture for me, to equate a prayer to someone's faith as nothing more then this. BUT. this is the internet. So please, please don't feel the need to tell me to get the fuck over it, because i know. *you have the right to your opinion!!!* so I am not saying that you need to change. But please read the top two lines of my original post, and then read reddit for a long time. You will see what I mean, I hope. But this is MY opinion. Feel free to voice yours! 




 Please google the definition of persecution. I seriously do not mean conflict over this, so I will agree, that no, I have never been physically bullied. But I don't think the point needs to  be explained that people can do more damage without physical violence then you think. 




 **YES** 




 I agree, I think you're right. 




 That's one of the most ignorant things I've ever heard. "Jeez, why'd that girl commit suicide from cyber bullying??? She wasnt REALLy persecuted, I mean, come on!"

If you are going to go down the list of what constitutes persecution, I find that over 3000 people getting together and making fun of my beliefs constitutes persecution. The def. of that word is to be subject to hostility. I don't think anyone can judge what someone feels, and if they are feel they are persecuted. To clarify, please don't take this hostilely. What I am trying to say is that it is in the eye of the beholder in terms of who decides if they're persecuted. If I go on r/atheism and see [this](http://i.imgur.com/hcBQP.jpg) , feel very persecuted. We should respect all and everyone's opinion, because if we don't, then who can respect ours? 




 Is it weird I only clicked on this link because I have a giftcard to there? 




 There were to men working out in the hot sun digging a ditch. Their boss is a little ways away sitting under a tree reading. One digger says to the other, "Why do we have to work while he relaxes?"

The other says, "I don't know. I'll go ask."

So he gets out of the ditch and goes and asks his boss, "Why do you relax while we work?"

The boss says, "Well, am farther up in this company."

To this, the digger replies, "Why do you get to be higher up?"

So, the boss says, "I have more common sense then you."

"what's that?"

The boss then proceeds to place his hand on the tree and say, "Hit my hand as hard as you can."

So the digger does, but the boss moves his hand and the digger hits the tree.

Walking back to the ditch, confused and rubbing his sore knuckles, he hops down and the other digger asks him why they have to work while the boss gets to relax.

The man says, "He has more common sense."

"What's that?"

So, to demonstrate, the man puts his hand on his face and says, "Hit me with that shovel as hard as you can." 




 agreed. 




 K, American here. The anthropocentrism of science has formulated an inability to process without quantification. This is a fundamental flaw, and leads to the lovely fagfarts statement of knowledge being subjective, nothing is certain as true.

 I used to spend hours on the Internet looking at photos
Trying to find ones that illustrated the feelings that I never could
I didn't really know what love was,
Because I hadn't really felt it yet
So everyday I just focused on me
My head
Me
But it wasn't me
And no matter how hard I tried
It's so hard, 
I couldn't be happy on my birthday
And I really
Really
Wanted to be happy on my moms
Birthday
But see, I'm not allowed to be happy when I should be
And definitely not allowed to cry when I'm sad
And when everything's going wrong
And I shouldn't continue
The hypo mania feels glorious
Every thought is an epiphany unto the source of pure joy
The most painful feeling I've ever felt has to be when I realize I should be crying and I can't

Not being in control of my emotions makes it really hard to interact with people
It was really hard to be friends with me
When you never know who I might be at the time
But you
You
I met you
And for the first time in a long time
As long as I can remember
I felt, deep inside, like I was me.
And any time I didn't show up for school
You called me
And as we got to know each other, I focused on your eyes
You were so beautiful
And as hard as my mind tried,
It wasn't able to fuck with me any more
Because for once, I was able to be happy when I should be
You have no idea how that felt
It was love
And it was outside the bounds of my head which I had been living in for so long
But you didn't know why it meant so much
So much more than it should have
Than I looked like
And when I came over to your house every day for weeks, even when you didn't want me to
You didn't know that it was me coming over
And not my mind
And that separation was glorious
And so you got scared
And told me I shouldn't come over so much
What you didn't know was that I couldn't be me without you
I couldn't be me without you
I couldn't be me without you
And so my friends told me to cut ties with you
That I shouldn't live off of you
That you couldn't breath life into me if you only did it when you felt like it
So I did
I left
And now
I spend a lot of time on the Internet
Searching for something that might allow me to feel me again
And now that every day is a day I should be crying
Every day is a painful day
Because I can't
And no one calls me
When I don't show up for school
  
 




 Haha, actually, it is, but that's not where i first saw it. There was a cooking forum a long, long time ago where an English gentleman described a pudding recipe as wanky. I took liberties and now it's a phrase I use a bunch :P 




 I appreciate that. Thank you. The noise is actually my fan, I record a lot of poems (just for myself, I dunno why I do it) but I've left it on in every one, so I think it just provides consistency for me. Oddly important to my process. 




 Lifesaver Gummies... Oh man... 




 I got a but scared reading this, because I felt like you must be the only other person on the planet who felt exactly like me. Oh well, I guess I just had to reply to let you know there are more of us out there. I know it usually doesn't seem like it. Bipolar type two, your description of emotion is... So unfortunately true. The meds make it impossible to feel. 




 Thanks man! 




 I loved my omega super soft, I putted two handed with it. Lost it three weeks ago :/ 




 I..is it okay?

This is me desperately trying to find someone to hug, maybe we'll get lucky and run into each other. 




 I would wake up tomorrow and have a best friend. 




  In other words, If you woke up tomorrow and one thing in your life was different, what would you want it to be? 




 She deleted her account, and I have no idea why  




 Solaris 




 I posted a few weeks ago on here, and a user named I-can-listen send me messages. We communicated almost daily, and she's one of the only things I have in my life. If you can make her see this, it would help so much. 




 God you really make sense, but I don't know if I have the strength to not fall for everyone I meet. I guess it's just a problem. Last night was really bad, I cut a bit but that's only the second time it's gotten that bad. I hope it doesn't get like that again. 

I want to buy you a pizza.  




 I fell in love. With a girl around Christmas. She left me for her abusive ex. My friends left me when I needed them to be there for me. I just met a girl who seemed like she was someone who wouldn't hurt me. We've been dating for a few weeks now, and were supposed to go out tonight but she asked if it was alright if she went on a girls night. I said of course. I went out with a friend of mine, not really a friend, but company, and guess what. She was there with a guy, alone. On a date. 




 Every time, I meet someone whom I trust completely, and I give myself to them. I cannot find a single person on this world who would do the same for me. They ALL have somebody. No one is truly alone. And if that's true than there's no one for me. I just can't do it anymore, my heart will never heal. It's been too long. I guess I'm just posting here to hear what you have to say, but I guarantee you're not alone. You have someone. If you don't, meet me, then someone who's not me, but more important than me, will show up. 
 




 I spent five months falling in love with a girl who said she loved me back, but was never there for me. I ignored the fact that I was never an important part of her life, and she stabbed me in the back more times than I can count. Three weeks ago I told her I was having an episode, she's helped me with depression, and she said we weren't good for each other as friends. (Not quite sure where the connection between the two comes from). Anyway, I've been miserable for three weeks, I deleted her number, but this morning I saw posts on Facebook that she's in a relationship with a guy I know and hate, and they were chatting back and forth and I've been crying ever since. I've dealt with depression long before I met her, but these three weeks and today are crushing me. I just need someone to tell me what to do so I feel better, because with depression, it's like every day makes me reach the limit of things I can handle. I can't handle this too :(
 









 Uh oh, it's been a week. I have the photo. Aw hell yeah.  




 It's my cake day, anything can happen
