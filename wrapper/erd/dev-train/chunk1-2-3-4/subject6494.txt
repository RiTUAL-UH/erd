 i love that one! i've read it so many times! Have you read NoEnd House? thats another one that i find equally well written 




 I'll look into it! 




 that sounds really creepy? The only two Stephen King books i have read are The Dome and The Stand. But this one sounds interesting! 




 that's a great question! i really think it depends on the crime, criminals age, current mental state, etc. 




 its a haunted video game pasta, its alright, not terrifying by any means 




 thank you! i look forward to reading it :D 




 about to read it right now! 




 what is it about? 




 i've read squidward suicide and i find it really disturbing. could you send me a link to Ted the Caver? i havent read that one 




 that makes sense. I dont like to pull out the "self harm" card because i dont want to come off as unstable or attention seeking. I like to focus more on why and what is causing my depression as i know it has led to my self harm and anxiety 














 i'm so sorry that happened to you, stay strong :) 




 pray? are you personally religious? 




 that's a great idea, how can we get them to see this? 




 care to elaborate? 




 that must have sucked, at least she was discreet? 




 fair explanation. Do you think there is a way to differentiate teens from adults in this subreddit? 




 This used to happen to me a lot when i was full-out addicted to self harm and was trying to stop. I felt like i wasnt me without cutting. I've been clean for about a month now and i still get random urges to cut "for old times sake" its truly something difficult that we have to deal with 




 I was in a summer production of "Chicago" and at rehearsal i was very overwhelmed. I went back into the dressing room and used a hanger to cut two thin lines on my wrist. Once I calmed down a bit and had paper towel wrapped around my wrist, a girl from the cast walked in. She gasped as she saw the blood-stained towel around my wrist. I tried to call out and stop her but she was gone. She ended up telling everyone in the cast and i was taken out of the show, as well as hospitalized for a week for "unstable behavior" what kinds of stories do you have? 




 fair enough, i only ask because its hard to explain where my depression came from and why i have it. People always assume i'm "exaggerating" 




 i can feel the same way, one moment i'm leveled and calm, and the next i feel like curling up on the ground and not talking to anyone. Its very hard for me to get out of these situations, if its possible to remove myself i always do. It's whats best in that situation 









 I completely understand how you feel  




 thank you! I unfortunately reside in high school, so when i have my attacks within school its very hard for people to know what is going on. My teachers handle it very well, but you can't expect every person in your school to be mature and respectful towards you, you know? 




 I always feel guilty about what i do when i'm in the middle of an attack. When people try to help i always flinch away  terrified, like a wounded animal. Days later i have this lingering guilt and paranoia about what that person thinks of me now that they've seen me act this way. This only brings on more anxiety. Anyone else? 




 it just interest me, this whole subreddit interest me a lot, somethings (like this) may be a little too much for me, but many other posts i thoroughly enjoy 




 I'm aware now, curiosity got the best of me, can you blame me? 




 I wish i had a cat or dog to help me, as i know they are proven to help people with depression, but its not something that is available to me 




 This is really well done, i spent an hour or two getting through it, ive ended up exactly where i am right now. It makes me feel a little better knowing that it's all "normal"

(P.S a little part of me got attached to the kitten in the story, i think ill have to get myself one) 




 i dont know what to feel, i stumbled across this and i am a mere 14 years old. im shaking....most things dont faze me either but this....i cant even think right now.. 




 BAD VIBES BAD VIBES 









 i personally loved Toy Story 3, it was a tear-jerker for me! 









 I like my coffee like i like my women,

without a dick 




 hide and seek with you friends someone abandoned  




 i was aloud to sleep over at boys houses all my life. As long as i said i wasn't "dating" said boy i had no restrictions on where i went and where i slept. You can see how my young immature self took advantage of that 




 awks 




 I thought that "God" was always watching so i showered with shorts and a tank top on until i was probably 10.  




 no matter where you are, who you are, or what you do, there is always someone who hates your guts. 




 I wanted to be a pirate princess warrior from space

im still working out the kinks but i def working on it
 




 it really grinds my gears when i fuck bitches and dont get money 




 i do! it is that of a mouse :) 




 lets spread self love and confidence. 

i love my eyes and my sneeze! 




 my ability to help others work through their problems. 









 There are tons of amazing stories on this thread, and it kind of makes me feel a little boring. I spent my last day on my roof listening to The Strokes.  I had taken enough pills to (what i thought) end me, and i just relaxed. though suicide is not a light subject, i do admit what was supposed to be my  last day was very peaceful.  




 you could menstruate with lipstick. 
























 It all depends on the day for me, some days i think they show that i am strong and how brave i am for living my life with them. other days i just find them repulsive. 




 drink. 




 Thank you! It's not really appreciated where I go to school, where uggs and northfaces prevail over everything  




 Thank you very much!  I'm flattered :D 




 No problem :) 




 you fool, just your style and your body type makes me smile. not to be creepy or anything, i just think youre attractive

 youre beautiful O___o 




 that's just terrible, kids are so mean. I wish more people understood what cutting means and how its just as bad as someone with a broken arm. you should care that theyre injured. not taunt them 




 i am on fluxotine as well! i only take 10mgs a day, and it has little to no effect on me 




 I am on non addictive medications which I believe is the best for young adults. So many kids are abusing pills that it isn't safe. Of course many non addictive medications aren't as strong as their addictive relatives, which sometimes poses a problem 




 That's a good point. We are becoming more self aware of mental illnesses. I've also noticed it becoming a "trend" in young teens. Could anyone attest to the same?  




 I love that show! I'm doing that this summer along with The Little Mermaid and Young Frankenstien 




 I'm so sorry, adults sometimes don't react like they should  




 i guess i have a lot of questions; let me start out with how you feel about young adults being put on anti-depressants, and how social media affects young adults with mental disorders. you can PM me if you wish 




 Sorry! i guess i misinterpreted what you said! i just dont like upseting people :) 




 i wish they would have just ignored mine? what show were you in? 




 can you tell me your opinion how why it is more common for young adults in america to have mental illnesses than it was in the past? 




 Thank you so much! 




 I'm so sorry :/ 




 the look of disappointment hurts me the most 




 No problem :) 




 That's fair enough, judging based on the story should be the best fit  




 you dont sound mean at all! i've been doing plenty of research and was just wondering if anyone is this sub would like to be apart of it.  




 As my title said, I have a paper for class that i have chosen to do my paper on. I want to understand why depression and other mental disorders are showing up more and more recently in high school/ college students. Any help would be greatly appreciated.  




 you really should. They work for YOU and only YOU. if you tell them that you want to keep it confidential and are open and willing to talk about it with her/him than he/she must not tell anyone by law. I've tried keeping things from  my therapist but i found its much better for both of us if i just tell her 




 sorry, no need to be sassy. i just didnt want to mess it up :( 




 im so sorry your mother has reacted this way, do you have a therapist? my mother was crazy until i had someone talk to her and explain the right and wrong ways for her to act around me 




 exactly. its ridiculous that she enjoys hurting your feelings. I'm glad you have people in your family who support your feelings  




 why? i'm 14 years old, was diagnosed with depression at age 11. My family has a long line of depression running through the family, I've witnessed my cousins suicide, ive attempted suicide, i'm on medication and making final adjustments on those meds, and im a recovering self-harmer. why couldnt you take me seriously just because of my age? 




 hold on to him, try to find other sources of help (i.e therapist, friends, realatives) because nothing lasts forever. (not trying to be morbid, i just want to help you)  




 aha, even though i've been a redditor for over a year now, i'm still lacking a lot of knowledge of how things work. I'cm not exactly sure how to approach it/ where to contact them/ etc. 




 Should we suggest to the mods that we get some? 




 :D thank you, it means a lot 




 I have another story i'd like to share, when i was in 8th grade i had fallen asleep in English class while we were watching a movie. A few boys who sat near me thought it would be really funny if they took red pen/marker and drew lines all over my wrists and legs. I woke up to bouts of laughter from the people around me and as i looked down i saw crimson lines everywhere, I ran out of the room and went to the bathroom, once i realized they were just marker i began to wash them off. By this time one of the councilors had heard of what happened and came in to help me wash off. As we were cleaning she said "i cant seem to get this one off!" i turns out she was trying to rub off one of my actual cuts and i had to explain to her that i self harmed. I didnt get into any trouble, but it was truly the most embarrassing time of my life  




 any time, i'm here for anybody and everybody 




 exactly. your beliefs are yours and no one should dictate you on what you think.  




 tangents are fine! Its rough when people assume i try to "kill myself" or "cut" for attention because i'm the exact opposite. I'm in theater so when we are changing of course you're going to see some old scars. That's not me trying to cry for attention, that's me trying to live with the mistakes i've inflicted onto my body. I've been ridiculed countless times about my view on how i live with old scars. I see them as something i cant change and i refuse to be worried about them. They are there and if you see them its nothing you should need to worry about. 

i went off on a tangent as well, oops! 




 i've been in therapy for a year or so, and we're slowly figuring out what it is, this helps when i have to explain it to people 




 I'm so sorry that happened to you. From what i've read i feel that your boyfriend cares a lot about you, I'm glad you have that in your life. He could help you immensely.  




 I've read it so many times! I think its absolutely fantastic 




 that's absolutely terrible. Try to remember that she isnt the only opinion in the world, she could say the worst things, but i promise there is someone out there who is saying that exact opposite of you :D 




 Understandable, tons of people go through this. I am an open atheist in my house but my parents aren't very religious. Just remember you are in control of YOU and no one can dictate what you believe in 




 that could work, i dont know how to use flair, but if someone could explain it i'd be happy to do it! 




 thank you so much, it was a dark time in my life, but i've grown from it 




 that has to suck. I get really angry when people try to tell me praying or god is the answer. I usually yell back! 




 thats terrible, i cant believe someone would do that as a joke! And thank you, i'm a lot better now, it was almost a year ago, i'm attempting to recover 




 im so sorry that happened to you, 




 she shouldnt act like that. How does she think that will help you? public humiliation isnt the way to go 
























 Any tips for while I'm in school besides breathing? Also no recreational drug use? 




 Thanks ill try this! 




 I'll go and listen to it sometime!  




 a lot of people my age are really into imagine dragons, i havent really heard them but im going to Lollapalooza this year and theyre playing. i might check them out! 




 Passion Pit- Little Secrets  




 No way! so am i! I saw icona pop open for Passion Pit a few months back and i fell in love instantly. Not usually my genre but its so good! 




 thats a new way to look at it! I'm honestly more concerned about my health rather than the humiliation part of it, I'm a vocalist and performer so having to constantly throw up its the best for me 




 thanks for the tip! i'll try it 




 Icona Pop!!! 




 I have a therapist and she has explained that it's natural and that i should try not to let things get me anxious. easier said than done.... 




 While i'm at school i have this problem of getting really high anxiety over something and having to leave class and vomit for 10 or so minutes. It only happened rarely at first but it has slowly gotten to about 2 or 3 times a week. Anyone have (or had) a similar problem? It's very difficult to deal with and i'd like it to stop 




 fuck you 




 getting colder! 




 sorry kid, try again 




 asssssshoooolllleeee 




 dont be an asshole  









 Thank you, with a new life comes new problems, but I wouldn't go back to where I was for anything in the world  




 exactly, i switched schools and im in a much better situation 




 thank you so much! 




 That must be heartbreaking, I'm sorry  




 My god, thank you so much.  




 thank you! 




 PM me if you think theyre something i need to keep in mind or specific things pertaining to a certain sentence/paragraph. overall comments can be on the thread 




 yes it is an I Search paper! i dont understand the point of doing that vs a research paper but you know, i do what i have to 




 you can do either. and i am fully aware that we cant use I in normal research papers. This one it set up differently ( i dont know why this is just how she assigned it) the first two paragraphs (what i know and what i want to know) can use i you us etc. as well as the last paragraph 




 new link! 




 sorry! ill try and fix it 




 I wrote a paper on how mental illnesses affect teenagers and i would love if i could get feedback/criticism before i turn it in

Thank you so much for your help!



Here is the link:

Edit:I think i fixed the link  




 that truly terrible 




 10/10 




 Oh god.... 




 The fuck? 




 Well gross  




 I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MY HANDS 




 Lovely :D 




 I switched schools thankfully  




 Man fuck you and your fairly tale life 




 Guess my ironic sense of humor doesn't bode well with you  




 Perfectly awkward  




 PIMP! 




 get it where you can amirite? 




 sounds lovely :D 




 golden 




 it sounds like a middle school experience!!! how old were you 




 awks 




 being a teenager it goes without saying that mine was incredibly awkward. what was yours like? 




 sleeping :D 




 I'm really into tattered combat boots 
























 same 




 lol wut 




 Good! I hope it stays that way for both of you :) 




 i got them at Hot Topic back in 2009 




 no problem. maybe taking a break will be best for both of you. I am glad i could help :D 




 only if you get caught. im just messing with you. its something you should experience once in  your lifetime at least 




 there you go :) i like helping people come to this realization. i had the exact same problem 




 you should. i found that if you try and force them to change it only makes yourself come of as overbearing and selfish. You cant critisize  your friends boyfriend because even though you may be right, you're coming off as jealous and trying to get her away so you can have her. even though those are not your intentions 




 the freshman life is tough, love iseven more difficult 




 lot of things are illegal. doesnt mean they're bad

cigarettes are legal and those are fucking lethal. 

marijuana is something that is gaining more respect in the mainstream lately. soon enough, by the time we actually get employed, we wont have to be drug tested.  it will be as common as a cigarette smoker 




 cool, my guy friend and are are both 15. So are you freshman? 




 try to not talk about things that are so heavy. dwelling on the bad is only going to make both of you worse. you may not like her boyfriend, but it is her choice and you dont have a right to make judgement. tone down on that and find ways to help her. you arent selfish you just want whats best for her. but you have to let her make her own choices 




 dont worry about it, it can be a positive influence on you. you have to just try it.  




 how old are you and your friend? just curious to see if this gets better or worse with age 




 don't get yourself down, you bring joy into her life. thats all you could ask for 




 thats gotta be a little awks. i was friends with my guy friend's past girlfriend, i was respectful to them because you shouldnt put people in a situation like that. im glad that she has the message 




 lol piss on her. she'll get the message 




 i feel you, do you know that she likes you? 




 i feel ya, i have clinical depression and severe anxiety,  my emotions were getting the best of me to the point where i had to be hospitalize over what i like to call a broke heart 




 how so? 




 i wish i had the courage. 




 thats a great point. i think our friendship is more important than  the risk of losing him to awkwardness 




 wow that was really interesting! seeing that helped me realize what type of relationship i have with my friend. we dont talk about feelings. we just hang out 




 im glad you guys were able to talk through it, its really mature to acknowledge feelings and try to figure them out and move past them 




 my situation seems like that, only the opposite. I feel that way. we've been friends for about 5 years now and i only recently discovered my feelings for him (the beginning of high school helped me figure it out) but i dont have the knowledge of whether he ever did like me and i didnt see it or if his feelings are purely platonic 




 I'm worried that our friendship will end/ not be the same. i care about him too much to not have him in my life over something silly like unrequited love 




 it seems to be a reoccurring thing, having a best friend of the opposite gender and falling for them, why do you think that is? 




 i seem to have the opposite problem, i am a girl who has a guy best friend, i fell in love with him and i just can't read him well enough to figure out if he does or has ever felt the same. 




 i'd love to. dont have a skype though, we could email? IM maybe? im old fashion but i'd love to help 




 do any of you have girl best friends? how to you think of them? I have a best guy friend who i can never seem to understand sometimes. What to boys usually feel about a girl like that?

EDIT: thanks for all the comments! i love talking to all of you! upvote for visibility? i fell like this could help give answers to a lot of people, not karma whoring i promise 




 well...

 find a friend who does, hang out and smoke with them. let them teach you the ropes. dont worry about feeling lame when you smoke. if you aint choking you aint smoking :) 




 panic at the disco
passion pit
icona pop
the shins
fall out boy :D 




 Time to  relllaaxx 




 it feels fucking good man 




 drugs 




 i really enjoy makeup, i dont put much effort into it, simple mascara and powder. I like using makeup to enhance your features, not hiding your flaws. you feel me? 




 for the record, i am going with 2 other people (15-18) and don't have tons of extra cash to spend. Thanks for any help! 




 no problem! i hope you're able to sell them! 




 one of my favorites! 




 damn, it looks like i cant afford the tickets. I am going to Lollapalooza this year also and have put most of my money into that 




 how much are you selling for?
 




 an excellent point  




 Skins is also a good show. Episodes are very short so you arent bored and i find them enteratining 




 Sherlock is amazing 




 Supernatural!  




 I cant choose, most of Pretty Odd is so poetic and wonderful. Ryan was a beautiful writer; not saying Brendon isnt but ryan just had a way with words 




 Good idea! I'll look for them  




 Thanks for letting me know, I'm a casual smoker usually only at parties
