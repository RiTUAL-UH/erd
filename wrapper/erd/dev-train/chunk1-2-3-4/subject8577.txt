 Pretty much everything I hate in other people is something I recognize as a negative trait in myself. I just try to associate myself with people that I look up to and admire, and hopefully their loveliness will rub off on me :) 




 I'm broke. This might be my last Christmas with my mother, and I'm so sad I won't be able to give her a great Christmas morning. I'm trying to swing getting her a gift card to a spa, but I don't know if I can do it because good spas are expensive. I don't know what to do. I've just been thinking of every dollar I spent this semester and how much I regret spending them. Christmas is hard :( 




 I'm so sorry. I have a similar situation with my mom, except we don't know how much time she'll have, which makes it really scary. I don't know if this will be my last Christmas with her, or if I'll have three more Christmases with her. Or more. Or if she'll even make it to Christmas. She's had to change treatment several times because it seems to be working splendidly, and then it stops working completely. As an only child with a dad not in the picture, it's hard for me to imagine my life without my mom. I feel like I'll just be alone--the one person I trust above everyone else will be gone. It's been hard to come to terms with that, but I've found a lot of comfort just in being able to appreciate every moment I have with her. I always ask her about her life, what things were like when she was younger, etc., because I want to know as much about her before she's gone. It's completely changed my relationship with my mother. I feel closer to her than I ever have before. And it's also changed my relationship with everyone in general--I now know that life is really fragile and could end at any time, so I try to love every moment with every person I know.

I hope you can come to see this situation as a time to learn to appreciate your father more. I'll definitely be thinking of you this holiday season. Enjoy it :) 




 If you like computers, find people who also like computers! Talk to some women in your major. If someone in one of your classes does something awesome in class or seems to have a better grasp of the subject than you do, then talk to her about it. You don't have to force it--just get to know her a little over the course of the semester. And don't be afraid to eventually ask if she wants to work together on a project or something.

Or you could join a CS-related club! That's a wonderful way to meet someone who's passionate about the same things you are. 

Good luck! :) 




 Yep. I have a roommate like this, it's horrible. Whenever she has a problem with someone in the house, instead of politely and patiently saying, "Hey, I noticed you turned the heat up a little high--would you mind just using a space heater or some extra blankets, because I can't afford to pay that bill," she'll just bombard the person with assholery without them even knowing anything was wrong in the first place! She always just jumps to the most dramatic and angry way of handling a problem, rather than just talking it over and making a compromise that's fair to everyone. 




 Wow, that's awful. I hope she eventually recovered. :( 




 JASON BOURNE. YOU'RE JASON BOURNE. 




 Oh man, one of the things I miss the most is goldfish crackers--you should post some of your successful recipes on /r/glutenfreecooking !!! That would be amazing! I'm recently diagnosed and I'm a broke college kid who has almost exclusively been eating gluten free soups and tortilla chips for the past few months (needless to say I've lost a lot of weight...not a great thing), and I miss all the old snacks I used to eat! :( 




 Yeah, just because I knew he was the relationship kind of guy and I wasn't prepared to enter into a relationship at that point in my life. He's a great guy, though--still a good friend, and he's happily with a girl who loves him a lot. :) 




 The best first date I've ever been on was with my current SO. We went to an open-air flea market in our city that sold a ton of antiques--there was a lot of really cool stuff that we were able to joke about and it helped spark a lot of great conversations. After we were done at the flea market we wandered around a little, exploring all the cool places in our city's historic district, and we eventually found a spot near the river where we just sat for hours and talked. We then went to my favorite restaurant, and then afterwards we saw a movie at a cool little local theater.

The reason it was so special is that it was kind of an all-day event. I mean, we spent HOURS walking around, talking, etc. It came naturally to us--it didn't feel forced or anything.

Also, it was awesome because we both got to show each other some of our favorite places--unique shops, cool, hidden spots, and so on. If you want to take someone on a great first date and have it actually mean something, show them one of your favorite places! 




 I work at a grocery store in a neighborhood largely comprised of 50- and 60-somethings, and at least twice in a shift I'll get told by one of them that I look like Julianne Moore. It's cool, because Julianne Moore is definitely an attractive woman, but also not very cool because Julianne Moore is 54 years old and I'm significantly younger than that. 




 Oh, Paul... 




 That's hilarious. Did he have the wrong building or something? 




 This [gave me an idea](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2p094u/ras_of_reddit_what_is_the_craziest_thing_youve/)... 









 This is creepy, but also... I'm laughing? 




 I absolutely agree she should have called the FD/PD, but I'm sure it was difficult to even get a word in edgewise and explain what was going on while that guy was raging at her. Plus, the guy who filmed it wasn't able to get his point across to the operator very well because the crazy dude just kept interrupting him as he was trying to explain that he was having an asthma attack.

It seems to me, though, like the operator wasn't really trained for emergency situations at all, because she handled it very poorly and didn't seem to know what to do. She didn't even give any medical advice on how to calm down a person having an asthma attack (or a guy who debatably was having a panic attack). But I wouldn't go so far as to say it was "her fault for getting yelled at" by any means--how on earth could she control how another person was acting?  




 I have no idea, that's what the website said? Keep in mind, I only work part-time (I'm a student). I definitely make more that $2.64 an hour, haha 




 For me, it said it would take him 11 seconds... 




 Exactly, and the way he kept referring to her as a "foul-mouthed young lady" and shit like that--like how prudish and ignorant do you have to be to hear the word "fuck" and decide that that is somehow grounds for arresting someone or refusing them care? She wasn't even directing the word at him, she was just freaking out about her father. I'd say that's a natural reaction, but that guy was horrible about it. 




 It seemed more like she was trying to calm the guy down when they were talking to her in part 2, but then in part 3 I think she was just tired of being threatened and called a bitch. She probably should have treated it more like an emergency situation, but the guy yelling at her definitely made is more difficult to do so--all around the guy who filmed this is just entrapped in a clusterfuck of other people's outrage. And all he needs is his asthma puffer. :( 




 Never seen it, I'll have to check it out. That's an awesome story, it would be really interesting to follow something like that 




 I live in Pennsylvania. We have terrible infrastructure. There are so many potholes! So many!!! And especially after last winter. 




 Someone should write a movie about you, holy shit 
























 This one and /r/cringepics are in the same vein for me. They make me feel better about any and all bad decisions made during my life. 




 I work at a health food store that offers a prepared food section. We have a lot of ridiculous complaints, but the worst I've heard most recently was a lady who was gluten-free by choice, not by medical necessity, who was mad that we offered ANYTHING with gluten in it. She thought that we were not upholding our standards as a so-called health food store by offering items with gluten, and that we were helping people kill themselves by selling gluten products. 

Now, I'm gluten free by medical necessity and I understand that it is very frustrating to find good gluten free food, but seriously, she was acting like she's the only person in the world. While instances of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity are rising, most people can eat it without any harmful effects. If our whole store went gluten free, we would lose like 90% of our business. 

I consider myself a nice person, but sometimes when I'm ringing difficult customers up I think some of the most horrible thoughts imaginable about them. Working in customer service causes me to scare myself. 




 I like that you phrase it like, "I *did* 6 years at OG," as if you were describing doing 6 years in prison. 




 most prettiest girl their is

BLEECCHCHH 

TALK LIKE AN ADULT HUMAN. Why would anyone ever think that that is charming?! 




 While that sounds awesome in theory, I feel like a lot of people would end up puking and/or copulating on the equipment. Haha 




 First of all, don't tell me what to think about my experience. For your information, he *did* continue to make sexual remarks to me and about me the whole time I worked there and even when I went back as a customer when I got a better job. 

Secondly, the question itself was EXTREMELY inappropriate at the time he said it, regardless of whether he continued to make sexual comments thereafter. Common sense should tell anyone that that is not an okay thing to ask someone in a work environment. It's not like we were great friends anyway--he was just a coworker with whom I was friendly *at* work, not outside of it. If he asked me that in an office setting, he would have been reported immediately and there probably would have been some sort of punitive action taken against him. Unfortunately, however, behavior like that is all too common in restaurants (as evidenced by the study posted above), so nobody blinked an eye when he made remarks toward me.

If you missed it, I linked the American government's definition of sexual harassment in the workplace, and my story clearly fits the description of sexual harassment. He cornered me in a room, alone, made an unwanted sexual advance, and asked me if I would have sex with him. I'm not sure how that could be considered anything BUT sexual harassment. 




 It was an unwanted sexual advance in the workplace so...yes, yes it was

Here's a [source](http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/sexual_harassment.cfm) for you 




 This list is amazing! Kudos to your friend!

Definitely try to go to all the places in the Fairmount/Logan Square area!!! Fairmount is basically my favorite part of Philly. (Although the Rodin, Natural History Museum, and Barnes Foundation aren't as awesome as the PMA itself).

Old City is lots of fun to just explore, but I usually prefer going when it's warm out. Elfreth's Alley and National Mechanics are a must! And the historical sites are cool to pass through as well.

Also, it's not in Center City itself but try to go to Chestnut Hill. It's super historical (they even have cobblestone streets still!), there are lots of beautiful houses around there, and there's tons of fun little shops. Plus, it's right near the Morris Arboretum, which is objectively the coolest place ever, even if plants aren't really your thing.

Enjoy your time in Philly! :) 




 When I worked as the takeout girl at a restaurant, I had one of the kitchen workers (whom I knew was casually hooking up with one of the waitresses) come up and ask me straight up, "Would you lay me?"

When I was appalled and said no, he asked me if it was because I was white and he was black. I couldn't believe it--there were lots of reasons why I wouldn't "lay" him (I didn't know him that well, I only thought of him as a friend, we were coworkers and that would result in a lot of awkwardness, every time I walked into the kitchen I saw him making out with another coworker, and many more), but the fact that THAT was why he assumed I didn't want to sleep with him really blew my mind. I kind of avoided being alone with him after that... 




 Former 2 year old girl here, I can confirm that scented chapstick is delicious 




 This is pretty much unrelated but I first read "any man knows that his penis has the memory of ten thousand elephants" as "any man knows that his penis has the memory of ten thousand *eggplants*" so that's kind of a funny thing 




 it is one of those cases where it is a hitler fighting a stalin, hitler is pretty objectively ideologically wrong, but stalin uses a perverted ideology that is good in theory, and while stalin may be the better of the two, you know, it is still fucking stalin.

You just perfectly described it. I'm definitely, proudly a feminist and was raised to be such, but a some feminists here and on Tumblr take it TOO far and are simply mean and unforgiving to people who don't understand all the new terminology feminist and queer scholars have coined to describe certain groups of people, acts, etc. The way I see it, you need to show patience with people and try to reasonably discuss these issues. If you're respectful, you're a lot more likely to get the person you're talking to to see things your way (or at least to be respectful of your opinions). But some people believe that people who don't fully understand feminist beliefs don't deserve respect at all (which is absurd because it completely undermines the whole basis of feminism--that all people are equal and deserve to be treated thusly). When people ask them questions they'll answer with things like, "I don't have to educate you, go figure it out yourself." 

I understand that maybe they wouldn't have the time to write out a full explanatory response, but at the very least I think that, if they posted something that leaves a lot of questions to be answered, they could simply link to a few resources to help the person asking questions to understand. The hostility I see from people (and which I have even experienced when asking other feminists questions about their beliefs and about terms I haven't yet encountered) turns a lot of people off from a movement which overall, I so fully believe could be beneficial to everyone. Makes me sad, man :( 




 It's not even that your post is poorly worded, it's just that not a lot of people know what "doxing" or "copypasta" or a lot of the other strictly Internet-culture terms you used mean. No need to be hard on yourself or anything! :) 




 Exactly, the girl on the phone was obviously really scared when they finally pulled over to meet with the police officer, but she held it together so well while they were still driving. Kudos to her for sure. 




 I actually came here to recommend those two songs as well! Personally I prefer 10,000 Emerald Pools, just because it's a lot more relaxing. Love the harmonies. 




 I start a lot of my sentences with "so," and my mom hates it. Most of the time I don't even realize I'm doing it, but I definitely understand why it's distracting. 




 I just found out the other day that the athletes in my school don't have to pay for their textbooks if they've been recruited. Granted, there are tons of really great athletes at my school, and probably many of them are great students as well, but let's take our football team, for example. They suck. They are terrible. Yet they have amazing scholarships, they get new workout clothes from Underarmor every WEEK, they get free housing, free textbooks, free meal plans, and they get special treatment all the time. I feel like I work hard and contribute a lot to my student body in different ways, yet I still have to struggle to pay my way through college. And there are lots of people who have to drop out or take out hundreds of thousands out in loans to get through college. That makes me really, really mad. 




 ~capitalism~ 




 Beautiful design, but yeah, I totally agree that they would be great banners. This design would be wasted on currency. 




 If you have any friends who are into dystopian novels and/or women's rights, I'd definitely say *The Handmaid's Tale* by Margaret Atwood. It's my all-time favorite book, and it's a classic. 

(It's also my personal belief that we should have all kids reading it in school because it directly ties to some of the reproductive rights themes we see in politics today, but that's just me) 




 I used to use the face washes and toners you get at a normal convenience store, but that was drying out my skin too much and wasn't really helping. Then, I tried oil cleansing, which worked alright but not well enough for me to warrant going through that process every day (it would take around half an hour including cleanup--it was really messy--to do altogether).

Then I read about these microfiber washcloths from Norwex that wash off makeup, dead skin, dirt, etc., with just warm water, so I started using those in the morning. After I'm done scrubbing away all the dirt and dead skin, I just put a thin layer of Aveeno lotion on my face and neck. I use "Simple" brand wipes at night just to get any makeup or dirt off before bed. And occasionally, I give myself a facial if I notice a lot of blackheads or if I'm having a breakout. 

Most of the time it works! Around the time of my period I get a couple small pimples, but other than that, this plan has kept my skin looking pretty great! It's cheaper and less wasteful than everything I've done in the past, plus I'm putting fewer chemicals on my skin. My face does feel a little oily on occasion, but it's nothing that's too bad. 




 Ugh, I'm with you. So sad I won't be able to go. Good luck! 




 A lawyer? 




 I hope this isn't real. They're threatening the newspaper, which is definitely not okay, especially considering the police's heightened political status. 

Our First Amendment rights are put in place for many reasons, one of the most prominent being so that newspapers can print opinions (like those shown in that political cartoon) without retaliation. By threatening to sabotage that newspaper through intimidating people into not supporting them, the officer who wrote that letter is directly threatening the cartoonist and editor's First Amendment rights.

Edit: Also, did he seriously just refer to that cartoon as a "slur"?? Does he not know the definition of a slur? 
























 Yay! You're amazing, thank you!! 




 This is so amazing! Would you mind posting the recipes for a few of these? I would try to figure it out myself but I'm a terrible cook, haha 




 The thing I personally focus on the most is rejecting gender norms. To me, it's a simple gesture that has a huge impact. Doing this obviously benefits me as a woman, but I believe it largely benefits men as well, who are often told they have to behave a certain, more "manly" way that can often be psychologically unhealthy.

For example, my cousin's son loves Frozen--he looks up to both the male and female characters in that movie. He already has a Hans costume from Halloween, so I bought him a hair braid like Princess Elsa's for Christmas so he can be either character :) 




 Between this lady and the gif of the cop pepper spraying innocent people, I'm pretty much done with Reddit for the day. Yuck. 




 Hearing Muslim extremists make threats like this toward Obama specifically makes me wonder who radical conservatives will hate more, and whose side they would take in this situation. Like do you think Ted Nugent would say, "Yeah, sure, ISIS, go for it!" or would he be like, "YO FUCK ISIS, NOBODY THREATENS MY PRESIDENT. EXCEPT ME OF COURSE. I'M THE EXCEPTION." 




 Don't focus so much on boys, because no, none of your high school boyfriends will end up lasting longer than high school does. 

Communicate better with your parents; they don't know the amount of trauma they're inflicting on you because you hide from them as much as possible. Tell them, they actually do care.

Take more time to learn about things you don't care that much about--computers, cars...you know, practical things. It'll pay off, and once you're in college you won't end up frustrated and feeling helpless and having to ask your boyfriend to fix your computer every other day, or having to ask your dad to come pick you up 2 hours from where he lives and change your tire for you. 




 I dated a Michael, too. He was a real piece of shit. 




 I mean, from a painter's perspective, they're actually incredibly well-done. He has a great understanding of shape, light, and color. I'm actually a little disappointed that they're good, because I kind of really dislike James Franco as an actor and wanted to keep riding that hate-train all the way toward his art. But what can I say, they're really good. 




 Thrift stores and flea markets when I have the time to really search, I just find oversized, comfy sweaters (often men's sweaters) and wear them. 




 Fresh tomatoes, bacon, and fresh garlic. It makes your breath smell terrible but holy lord it is amazing. 




 Yuuup. On this note also, Kitten Forever is a great band. They're not as big as the people listen here but I dig them so much. They're more noise-punk though, so I'm not sure how much your son would like them--that sound's definitely not for everyone! 




 My seventh grade teacher was just like this. It was also clear that she didn't prepare any syllabus for class or lesson plans. She taught us English (as well as a few other subjects) and completely missed the point of most of the literature she assigned to us. Once, in a test she made for a book we read, she asked, "Who was the book dedicated to?"

...Seriously? 














 I always date guys who have similar features--brown hair, brown eyes, slim, around 6' or taller. Of the white guys I've dated, they all had tons of freckles. Almost every one of them had glasses. I didn't even think I had a type until recently when my friend pointed out the similarities in all the guys I've dated! 




 This. I had a boyfriend in high school who refused to eat any spaghetti sauce that wasn't his grandmother's, and when he took me out to a fancy dinner for my birthday, he ordered chicken fingers from the kids' menu. I mean, I know we were only in high school, but seriously? Have some class, man. 




 Currently typing from the grave it was nice knowing you all bye 




 I would be so incensed if that was my family member. That is so disrespectful. 




 I like how he says you aren't "accommodating" him multiple times, like you're a hotel clerk or something.

He also just doesn't seem to understand that none of the supposedly logical reasons he gave you to get you to send him nudes change the fact that you just don't want *him specifically* to see them. It doesn't matter that he's giving you "confidentiality," you just don't want to send him pictures of yourself. And he argues about it so much. He seems to think of himself as really smart, but clearly he's not smart enough to understand that he can't make you do anything just by arguing endlessly. 




 I ate a lot of things that were definitely not for eating. Play-doh (I vommed), chapstick (I vommed), entire bottles of cough syrup (I went to the hospital and vommed). The list probably goes on, but I can't remember because I ate so much poisonous shit that I forget everything. 









 This comment blew my mind 




 "Begins the slow process of seduction" HOW CAN THIS BE REAL?? 




 They are some ridiculously photogenic dogs 
























 This one actually made my jaw drop. Holy shit. 




  The Swamps of Dagobah

I  deleted my last reddit account a couple years ago, haven't been on it again until recently...but I still knew *exactly* what you were talking about before I even clicked the link 




 You're doing so well! Congratulations! Keep moving on the path toward mental and physical health, you deserve it! 




 I have never cried in a movie theater before--until I saw that movie 




 HOW WILL I EVER KNOW WHAT MOVIE IT'S FROM WHEN NOT ONE PERSON HAS RESPONDED 




 Air Bud. When the kid's like, "Go away you stupid dog!" it kills me because I know he doesn't really feel that way but he has to make Air Bud run away because he can't keep him, and Air Bud then ends up homeless and he doesn't understand why he can't stay with the kid and it's just a whirlwind of emotion and I cry ever tiem 




 Omg. Recipe? 




 I think by that, he or she meant to say that people of color have not historically oppressed white people by employing racism--racism is more than just "I hate this group of people" (which would be prejudice), it's actually widely recognized as race affecting the social order. So by THAT definition, no, it's not possible for people of color to be racist--at least in America, where people of color have historically been (and arguably still are) oppressed by the law. People of color can DEFINITELY be prejudiced and hateful toward others, though, obviously--I think that that's unfortunately just inherent in most people.

The person just said it without explaining it, though, and to someone who hasn't studied racism and prejudice and learned to discuss it using the widely agreed-upon *academic* definitions of the terms (rather than the colloquial definitions), that may come off as a really, really dumb statement. 




 I'm assuming you got in contact with him to sell him your textbook on like a Facebook group for your university or something. You should post this exchange in the same place. People like this are shit. 




 I don't know my boyfriend's username (not because he, like, refuses to tell me or anything, but because I just never asked), and now I'm so curious. Every time I read something that applies to me I've been looking through the comment history to try to figure out if it's him! Haha

Edit:  Just kidding, I thought about what it could be, searched it, looked through that person's comments, and figured out it's him. I feel like an evil genius mastermind. And no, he did not post about me here. I'm relieved. 




 ULTIMATE BETRAYAL OF TRUST. If I found out my boyfriend was watching one of our shows without me I'd be so mad, haha. 




 As someone whose parents left each other *way* too late in the game, I think you should probably just try to figure out custody for your kids and separate from her. She can't make you stay. Your kids will be mad for a while, but believe me, it's better to spare them the trauma of living in a house where both parents absolutely hate each other. I'm just speaking from personal experience here, but I wish I could unhear the things my parents said to each other and unsee the things they did to each other when they fought. Even though the idea of them getting divorced seemed scary to me when I was a teenager, I wish they hadn't waited 'til I left for college to separate. It would have spared me a lot of pain.

I don't know what your situation with your wife is--whether there's abuse involved or what--but it could potentially spare your children a lot more pain and uncertainty if you were to separate sooner rather than later. 




 I can't decide if that's weird and creepy or adorable and sweet. 




 I just wanted to let you know that this comment made me laugh out loud, thanks for brightening up my day :D 




 "Plus I read somewhere that rebellious, slutty women usually have lots of tattoos and piercings"

Oh, he read it somewhere, it must be a fact! He should definitely shape his worldview around that! 




 I assure you "Celiac" is a word, regardless of what Google says, because it's a proven medical condition that affects millions of people just in the US alone.

only a loss if they don't think there is enough Celiac people out there

It's not about what large corporations *or* small businesses *think*, it's about the *fact* that there are millions of people with Celiac disease, and if they offer a couple of gluten-free items on the menu (which really isn't that hard or costly at all) they're opening up their market to a huge group of people who previously wouldn't have been interested in their restaurant/coffee shop/store/whatever.

And I'm going to repeat myself here, but no, eliminating the fad will not help people with Celiac...at all...because it would mean that more places will stop offering gluten free food due to a reduced market for it. It would mean that gluten free food (you know, the only food people with Celiac disease can eat) would not be available to people who need it, and they would have to search hard just to get a box of pasta or a loaf of bread. It would be incredibly limiting.

Also, why does anyone give a shit what exercise plan or diet people follow? That's their personal choice. It's stupid to expend energy hating them. Their right to that choice is as American as Nascar's choice to run their poorly-made, awkward rap-country hybrid, Nick Offerman commercial. Just because you personally wouldn't do it doesn't mean they don't have a right to eat what they want to eat. 




 In the same vein, I hate when people talk on the phone and have it on speakerphone in public. That perplexes me for two reasons: 1) why would anyone want other people to hear your whole phone conversation? and 2) why would they assume I want to hear it?! 




 I work as a cashier at a place that gives you the option of not printing your receipt to save paper. I have this one regular who always gets REALLY mad when I ask her if she'd like her receipt. Once I told her it was just a yes or no question, and that she was welcome to say yes instead of yelling at me, and she reported me to my boss. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 









 No, I'm not offended by that message and I understand that the commercial isn't targeting people with Celiac disease. However, in spreading the message that people should not go gluten-free because it's stupid or whatever, it affects people with CD in that it makes it more difficult to find gluten-free food. Like I said, I'm not offended that they called people who don't eat gluten "soft" (I have a legitimate reason not to eat it so I really don't give a shit what other people think), I'm more concerned with the fact that this mindset limits availability of gluten-free food for people who actually really need it. 




 Well gluten-free living as a *fad* started around 5 years ago, yes, but Celiac disease (which is capitalized, btw, so that's why you're seeing a red squiggly line under it) has existed for a long time. We've seen a lot more cases pop up starting in the 80s and 90s because we changed the way we cultivate wheat and other crops within the Triticeae tribe starting around the 1950s. (Currently, they're harvested much earlier than they're meant to be, making it harder for some people to digest, and as a fun little side fact, they're also genetically modified so that they have estrogen in them--which of course is dangerous for anyone with hormone-based illnesses).

Also, nobody's trying to change the way people who don't have Celiac disease eat, we're just trying to get gluten-free food more readily available. It doesn't cost that much for a restaurant to keep a few boxes of gluten-free pasta around to replace regular pasta in their dishes when a customer asks, so it almost definitely wouldn't end up hurting restaurants.

And that last bit made me laugh out loud--of COURSE we're lobbying for a cure. But until a cure is found, we still have to eat gluten-free, and being able to eat three square meals a day is kind of a more immediate issue than finding a cure. 




 But at the same time, and as I wrote in another comment, when people say going gluten-free makes someone "soft," it influences a lot of other people to think that. And when a lot of people think that, it makes it difficult for the people who actually do have Celiac disease to find food we can eat easily. 

So basically, for me it's not so much a matter of "someone said something about gluten and I'm taking it out of context and being sad about it," it's more a matter of "someone keeps perpetuating the idea that gluten free food isn't worth providing to people and now I can't comfortably go to most of the restaurants my friends want to go to because the only gluten free things they sell there are salads and if I have one more fucking salad this week I will scream" 




 I mean, I wouldn't call it *offensive* per se, but as a person with Celiac disease, yeah, gluten is actually pretty fucking dangerous. And people who perpetuate the idea that "people who don't eat gluten are soft" make it a lot more difficult for me, as a person who can't eat gluten, to go out and easily find gluten-free options.

And I don't give a shit if some people don't eat gluten for "real" medical reasons--if more people are requesting gluten-free options at restaurants, then that means that more restaurants will start offering gluten-free items. And *that* means that I can go out with my friends and order something easily, without having to send the waiter to the back and check the exact ingredients of everything (which I don't like doing and they don't like doing). Each time a person makes a joke about gluten-free people being pussies or something, it makes it harder for people with my condition to live their lives comfortably.

/rant

TLDR: Fuck all y'all, make gluten-free foods more readily accessible 




 If it makes you feel better, the people who did things like that in middle school have to grow up knowing that they did that. And they have to live knowing that they were the bully, not the underdog. They did bad things, and someday their kids are going to come home from school upset about something mean someone said to them, and they'll understand the kind of sadness they inflicted on you. And they will feel really, really bad and probably hate themselves a little bit for it.
