 I did. I was always an incredibly morose, aloof child and was diagnosed with depression and on meds since I was 10. I'm 25 now and it really makes me sad to think that I've been this way most of my life... Even before actual diagnosis. I feel you on that. It makes it hard sometimes to imagine a truly happy life when I've been sad for most of mine and that really hurts to think about. I envy people a lot of the time who can at least look back on the happy years of their lives, but I guess I just hold into the idea that I've had to be a stronger person because of it, even though I feel weak so much of the time.
A specific memory I have is of being a little girl and getting out if having to go to birthday parties. I would get invited because they invited the whole class, but I never felt welcome or like I would be able to have fun. I used to sleep with bags of ice on my chest hoping I would get a cold. If that didn't work, I'd drink a bunch of hot water and blow my face with a hot hair dryer to convince my mom I had a fever so I wouldn't have to go. Being a depressed child really is strange. 




 High fiving or one chain link fence from a mauling?? 
























 Thanks that's a nice way of thinking about it :) 




 Thanks, that's a good option. I feel shitty lying but I know that's what I gotta do. 
























 Thanks, that's what I think would be best. As much as I eventually want to get back to working full time and feeling like I'm a proper member of society again, I think wading into it is my best bet. The last thing I want is to overwhelm myself and break down again. I guess part of my anxiety is based on the pressure I've felt from everyone to "just get a job already" and the guilt I feel for being so dependent at my age, but I really do need to ee acclimate myself and do what's best for me. Thanks so much for the advice. It's nice to hear from other people who have managed to get back up on their feet. 




 Thanks I was planning on asking in jobs and getemployed but I figured I'd reach out here first since I kind of just needed to get all this off my chest and knew that I'd need to extremely abbreviate this there. Thanks for the advice though, that's going to be my next step :)
