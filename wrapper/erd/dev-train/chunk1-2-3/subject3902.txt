 "Duke Leto's Pet Puzzle"

ಠ_ಠ 




 This legitimately creeps me out 




 Whenever I meet anyone, I can't help but imagine what it would be like to have sex with them, or what they look like during sex... 




 YES! I also love reading to myself (normal talking volume or whispering) on occasion, if there's no one else within earshot, of course. 




 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_satiation 




 Personally, I love just a little bit of shyness.

Oh my God, it's so adorable, and I don't even mean 'adorable' in a patronising sense, just plain attractive. I'm a shy person myself so maybe I just would prefer that to someone who is mega outgoing, which would be way too much for me to be around. 

So, yeah, quiet/shy/introverted/introspective, that general family of traits... 




 This hurts in such a relatable way, OP...
 




 Hey, hey guys...looks like...guys it looks like he made a...made a... 

MOO-MAID...

Heh, get it? Get it guys?
....heh... 




 I'm not even sure I understood this. So disjointed

Reminds me of those threads on 4chan like "dubs says what I say next"... 




 Oh God the last one... D': 




 "hope you have a great Sunday!" 




 I never pictured them without hair either, although I must say I quite like the idea of them as bald.

"a bunch of Hellen Mirrens"

Oh God yes, somehow that is perfect. 




 The rest of Mark Zug's amazing artwork from the 1997 card game can be found here: http://markzug.com/dune/dune-the-card-game/ 

I particularly love this picture though, if anyone has a spare $1400 and is feeling generous then by all means feel free to buy me the original, available on his website :p 









 No you wouldn't. FUCK. Please report her OP, she could do this to other people. I'm so sorry for your terrible experience... 




 Is he always saying things and denying them later on? Or trying to make out that you're the crazy one? Don't even bother trying to call bullshit, just distance yourself from someone like that, no matter how you might feel about him. 




 I feel like I suddenly want to get really into everything Dune related at the moment, and I can't believe it's taken me until my early twenties to discover what a cool franchise it is! :D I'm genuinely quite excited to read on 




 Sweet, thanks for the input, folks. I was expecting there to be a bit more variation in people's suggestions but the general vibe I'm getting here is definitely original six first.

Maybe when I've finished those I'll dip into the others for funsies.
Thanks all :3 




 Now let's all agree to never be creative again... 




 Yeah I've seen how controversial they appear to be with the fanbase and I must admit that I haven't found Paul of Dune to be anywhere near as enjoyable as Dune or the cheeky few chapters of other FH books in the Dune series I've glanced over in the past. 

In Paul of Dune it just feels like I'm getting whisked through an assembly line of events that feel kind of flat. Were it not for the fact that I feel like maybe I'm learning a few more details about the Dune universe and getting a few bits and pieces reinforced for me I don't think I'd be as keen to read through it.

Thanks for your input, guys. 




 Coolio, I may as well carry on and finish Paul of Dune and then I'll see about finding copies of the other books after I've read Messiah :D Thanks. 

Out of interest though, do you recommend reading them this way because it provides a better narrative or more due to the (presumably superior) quality of the Frank Herbert books over the others? 




 So, publishing order? 




 So after having read Dune for the first time some months ago I was kindly given a few of the sequels for Christmas (Paul of Dune, Dune Messiah, and Winds of Dune) by someone who isn't a fan of the books themselves but knew I liked the Dune franchise and that I wanted to read more. They say they got the suggested reading order (as I listed them) from snooping around online, but of course, given the many different ways there are of reading through the series, I'd imagine it's pretty open to interpretation.


I started Paul of Dune a few days ago and am now most of the way through it and appreciate that it reads completely differently to Frank's style (if I'm honest I'm not sure I enjoy it so much though, personally). My question is, as a newbie, is this the best way to go about reading the books? Should I have just read the original books first and gone back to fill in the gaps with the Brian/Kevin Anderson installments later on? Or should I plow on with my current trajectory (chronological from Dune onwards). Or some entirely other order? I'm very open to suggestions and advice at this point and would be grateful for your input :) 




 SO QUICK! YES! Thanks so much...oh man...that was a sad film... 




 To prolong the sugary goodness they keep sniffing the tin after they have run out and pour water into the tin to make a sort of drink out of what is left inside?

I think I'm going mad here, please help :p
 




 I feel a bit disappointed with the clear Bilbo (the one I got) I would have loved to get Gandalf or Thorin instead. Might try swapping with someone or taking it upon myself to paint him for funsies 




 I found it was waaay too big for me. But I guess I do have tiny lady wrists so... Going to find a way to take some links out, maybe I'll donate them to you guys :p 




 I can't see this one mentioned anywhere yet so:

'Wilder' - by Gnesa http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CF2o5RDkq9A

Those lyrics, the dancing, the off-keyness of it all, that almost sinister sounding melody...*shudder* 




 This...hurts my soul :( 




 I assumed they meant that it was their second painting specifically using their lovely new early Christmas present set... right? 




 To be fair, Santa did die for our sins, or something...? 




 "party like a" what?! I need to know now...

 34287edgy666me 




 Oh yes, also seconded with many of the sentiments here, some scenes/reactions/bits of acting made me wince... 




 I recently got around to watching it for the first time too. I have to say I absolutely love the aesthetics of it; I feel David Lynch really did bring something to it in that regard. The whole look and tone of it felt 'right' to me and only added to how I'd personally pictured things from the book. Different and separate from how I experience the books, but I like it well enough.

Beyond that though...yeah, "meh"..."meh" all the way, especially with all that inner dialogue. I've no doubt that a good film adaptation could somehow manage to capture all the introspection of the books but this one didn't quite.

I feel that I'll always be fond of it as an adaptation, though.
 




 "Regular Conservatives HATE HIM" 




 So nice, I can almost hear the pencil scratching :3 




 I dunno, that just sounds kind of unnecessarily expensive to me... 




 These are all so great! :D 




 Well that just sounds incredibly rude of them. Please don't take it personally, OP, or let it get you down. Feel free to PM me if you need someone to talk to. But seriously, that's on them, not you :) EDIT: Sorry yeah, also, I know it's hard to follow advice like, don't hang out with people who make you feel bad when you've no other options. But just know that you shouldn't have to put up with stuff like that just to avoid loneliness. 




 Oh God my sides 




 Yeah, I find moving about and interacting with the world helps, especially if it comes on when I'm just lying in bed at night looking out at my room. What's most annoying is that I can easily 'switch' to viewing the world like that at will and used to do it all the time when I was little, (especially during long school assemblies, making the speaker's head look tiny, like you did with your friend). For some reason it didn't bother me. Now, I feel like younger me maybe made it somehow more likely to happen out of habit or whatever, gah... 




 When I was little I didn't know "twat" was a bad word, I thought it meant "to hit".
 Ended up in quite a bit of trouble with a friend's Mum after talking about "twatting" something... 




 Yes this, happens especially when I'm tired or ill and I absolutely hate it. I went through a phase a couple of years ago where just reading triggered it, especially if the print was small. Really didn't help with my uni work but I somehow managed to shake it off: I found that I can sort of 'will' it to stop if I try reeeeally hard, or sometimes literally shaking my head or even hurting myself helps. 




 In our house we called it the 'doofer'.
Seriously though, I'm going to make it my mission to make sure my kids, if/when I have them, grow up with so many weird idiosyncratic names for things. They won't know who or what to trust for the first twenty or so years of life... 




 She's a golden long haired female Syrian hamster, I've had her since June of this summer and here she is hanging out in my slipper :p 









 I'm glad this was someone else's first concern too 




 Thanks, this is probably the only photo I have of her so far that isn't a complete blurry mess. Unfortunately it doesn't really show off her dark cheek flashes from this angle though 




 Thank you, she's got such a sweet personality too, (though I guess I am somewhat biased :p) 




 Congratulations and good luck, university can be such a great experience and I hope you end up doing what you want to do and loving it :)
May I ask what you plan on studying? 




 GUYS SHE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT JUST LEAVE HER ALONE, OK?! 




 She's a golden long haired female Syrian hamster, I've had her since June of this summer and here she is hanging out in my slipper :p 









 I...I don't think it...matters...? "Deworming (sometimes known as worming or drenching)"  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deworming 




 Dude, get your cat wormed. 




 That looks like it would be a truly uplifting read 




 Yeah, I sometimes pick my nose a bit too much too :( my boyfriend has also stayed through my side during those times, so...relatable. 




 That sounds like an awful lot to be dealing with on your own, though it's great that you're trying. Sounds to me like you should definitely try to find some outside help on this. Maybe a professional like a counselor/therapist. 
The house issue sounds like a tough one but my best advice for that would be to just take a small area at a time, and once that area is clean strive to keep it that way. I've no professional advice to offer but pm me if you need someone to talk to :) 




 To be fair, it is a bloody good movie 




 But...but...I want to be as amused as the girls in the comic definitely totally for real were 




 I want to know what that cautionary tale was... 




 Monocular cues (cues to depth relying on only one eye) such as the ones listed in the other comments (movement, object size, texture gradient, occlusion, relative movement of your single eye etc...), are one part of the story. However the reason the world doesn't suddenly appear flat when you close one eye is also partly because you have gone through your entire life (from a certain young age at any rate) seeing the world in 3-D. Eyesight depends on your eyes but vision happens in the brain, the world is actively constructed for you by the information coming in through your eyes and even if one eye is shut it 'knows' that the world is still one of depth. This is why, even though people with one eye, or eyes that are unable to coordinate together (most commonly, for example, people with untreated childhood strabismus), can use the monocular cues to navigate the world in three dimensional space, *but they lack that subjective feeling of 'depth' and 'space' that comes with stereoscopic vision*. One famous example of someone who trained themselves to coordinate both eyes to see in depth after a lifetime of seeing the world in 2-D is Susan Barry, or 'Stereo Sue'. In her talks and book (which I recommend to anyone interested in the psychology of visual perception) she details the subjective, qualitative differences between seeing the world in monovision and stereovision. Hope that helps :)

 This whole album clobbed my bonkers 
























 I might get in a lot of trouble for saying this but the Lord of the Rings trilogy. 

I loved the films and the whole new generation of Tolkien fans it inspired, and I love the books for sure, but for me the films are just much more enjoyable.
The Hobbit, however, is a whole other barrel of dwarves; the films are watchable enough but I don't see them surpassing my affections for the book anytime soon :3

EDIT: Misspelled 'Tolkien'...awkward... 




 Seconded with Fight club, in fact I just said that somewhere else on this board.

EDIT: Just realised it's you again, mega awks :p 




 As a psychology person, it'd be remiss of me not to say anything by Oliver Sacks.

Even for those going in to psychology without plans for going into clinical or abnormal psychology, or I guess for anyone really, his books and his writings are just brimming with humanity and such respect for people and how we all variously experience the world. Definitely a strong role model for me throughout my time at university, and definitely influential on how I view a number of different aspects of the human experience.

Just such a lovely, intelligent, and witty man, everything he writes, and every documentary he features in, is a pleasure to read/watch :3

EDIT: a word
EXTRA EDIT: Hey I just realised you mentioned Oliver Sacks in your post anyway, OP. Rock on. 




 Yeah, and after loving the film for so long, dare I say I was actually a bit disappointed when I got around to the book :-\ 




 Seconded. I made it through, I appreciated bits of it. What more does the universe want from me 




 Me too, I wish I reread more books, and there are a couple that I do go back to over the years (The Hobbit, Jane Eyre, a book I read as a teen that meant a lot to me) but for the most part I just see that as time I could be spending on new titles. 

As with everything, I feel guilty about it :p 




 Threw up in my mouth a bit and wished I hadn't clicked, 10/10 




 That's adorable. I chuckled heartily 




 I've always felt pretty guilty about the amount that I not only sleep talk but sleep shout, actually, I pretty much only sleep shout... If I'm shouting angrily at someone in my dream then chances are I will shout it out loud too, waking us both up. It's become so routine (happens at least once or twice a month, usually more often during periods of stress or whatever) that we just accept it by now. I'll mumble a quick "sorry" and we'll both be back asleep again in seconds.


I've also hit him in my sleep a few times, usually pretty hard, I always feel really bad about it, especially seeing as I'm normally half awake as I do it, and realise just as I thump him that whatever I was fighting in my dream is actually just my sleeping SO. The first time I did it was only a week or so into our relationship, felt so so guilty about. I'd done the shouting thing before with a previous partner, but the hitting is a recent thing (I must sound like such a terrible person now, omg, he's pretty chill about it thankfully and teases me about it).


I'm honestly not an angry person or anything, IRL I'm really normally passive and quiet and would never hit anybody and rarely shout, nor do I tend to have particularly violent dreams. But if I do have them, chances are my boyfriend is gonna get hit or sworn at.

(Damn, he's tolerant, I'm going to go hug him right now...)

EDIT: Mostly it's just me yelling at dream antagonists to "F*CK OFF!" or some variation on that. Such rage, where does it all come from? Oh parasomnias, amirite?... 




 Ok, from what I can glean from Googling "Dune graphic novel" there was apparently a graphic novel made following the Lynch film...so, not so much of the book itself I'm afraid. But I must admit I'm curious to see it. io9 has a post from 2010 that's supposed to link to where it's hosted online but it doesn't seem to be there any longer... :(

Anyone here know anything about this? I'm so curious... 




 Guys...there should totally be a Dune graphic novel...

EDIT: Wait, there apparently already is one?! In which direction should I throw my money so I can own a copy? 




 This struck a chord with me... 




 "He IS the Kwisatz Haderach!" 




 Hey, I like the sound of that, maybe it's just because I'm so attractive I'm intimidating? Yeah, that'll be why ... *sobs heavily* 




 *something something* "just like your Mum" *something something* 




 I audibly "awwwww"-d :3 Are the two of them now friends? :p

This is precisely how my terrier would react; one time she picked up a mouse in a field that jumped out in front of her, froze in shock, and dropped it immediately. She used to be terrified of my gerbils :p 









 Are you a wizard? 




 She's basically a female Eric Cartman 




 I was expecting her to make him carry her perishable goods. This...this was much worse... 




 These are so gorgeous, thanks for sharing 




 It has some pretty blue eyes so there's that I guess...? 




 I will! :D I'm just finishing up another project this weekend but I feel that it's definitely time I turned my attentions to something inspirational and Dune related. Maybe I'll start a thread asking for quote suggestions? : 




 I know right? Who thought a colouring book for kids was a good idea?! http://blogs.sfweekly.com/exhibitionist/2012/02/post_2.php 




 Don't worry it's completely SFW 




 Dude, harsh 




 Subs like /r/BeautyDiagrams and /r/Makeup are great but they seem often assume a level of pre-existing knowledge and familiarity with makeup, fashion, and beauty that not everyone (certainly not me at any rate) has.

Does anyone know of anywhere a totally clueless individual could find tutorials and advice, pitched at a sort of Explain Like I'm Five level? Basically for those of us who grew up without feminine mothers or sisters to explain all this stuff to us, and have since been muddling a long like idiots :p

 




 They don't like women, they don't like people in other subreddits, or anyone who isn't into Red Pill ideology. A lot of the time they talk like they hate other men...I don't think those guys like anybody... :-\ 




 You are not alone 




 I have sex dreams from time to time, like a regular person I guess, and they don't particularly bother me, unless they're particularly hilariously awkward like with someone I know. I always just think, "yeah whatever, it happens".


But then I have these dreams which aren't exactly sexual so much as...**completely adorable**, like I'm snuggling or just kissing with someone I know, and it's so tender and loving and PC and sweet, regardless of how I actually feel about that person IRL. And those are the ones I wake up from feeling a little bit guilty and awkward about, not the scary crazy sex-having dreams... :X 




 Hahaha...aw man... I wasted my one turn on a goddamn Hello Kitty bag... :( 




 Oh oh! And while we're on the subject, spot popping or squeezing videos, am I right? /r/popping Hell yeah. 




 I moved into a new flat in August last year and oh GOD the lighting in our bathroom is so bright and the wall space is basically three quarters mirror  at face height and I will spend minutes upon minutes.

Basically I'll tell my boyfriend I'm off to brush my teeth for bed but I get distracted and then half an hour later he'll have to come get me from there, my face all beat up and swollen and he'll be all "not this again god damn" and I'll have made tiny invisible or imagined imperfections into ugly marks that are gross but every time it is WORTH IT.

Edit: a word 




 Aw man, the compliments! The compliments make me feel like a princess :3

"Time for your facial spa treatment, my your skin is so radiant!"
 




 Yes yes yes, I got into it because I have a friend who's really into it and she suggested I watch a couple, so we talk about it sometimes, though I watch only occasionally myself these days. But yeah, it's the sort of thing that'd be really awkward to explain if someone walked in on you watching it... 




 Good choice. Also Heather Feather, if you find that you like the RP type videos, she's such a sweetie :3 they pretty much all are, actually 




 Yes, thank you, I love this site, such a good read 




 Oh man, this is just making me really sad, if anything :( especially when she mentions that she lives with her parents, they must be really worried for her.

Also, ew, my vagina just about clamped shut reading this. 




 Please deliver! Like, maybe this isn't the most popular comment ever but each one of us is a person who really frigging wants to see this picture! 




 This happened once to me! I was such a superstitious kid, unlike now, being a super suck-the-fun-out-of-everything-mega-skeptic, and I had lost a bag of mine, a Hello Kitty bag, for those who care. It was gone for days and it was bugging me so so much and I had turned the house top to bottom looking for it. I must have been about 10 or 11 and I thought "meh, maybe if I just focus on it really hard I'll be able to do some kind of remote viewing psychic voodoo or whatever".

Sat down and thought about the bag as vividly as I could and then the cupboard in our hall came to mind, equally vividly, the very first location that did come mind, too. Sure enough it was there, someone else must have tidied it away as I certainly hadn't put it there and it was completely an unlikely place for it, this was where we'd normally put things like phone books and stolen IKEA pencils, you know, hallway junk, but not bags.

Needless to say it never happened again or anything similar, as cool as I thought it was at the time and as hard as I tried to repeat it. The brain's a big place that remembers stuff you may have explicitly forgotten and we have plenty of unremarkable experiences in our lives, so...yeah, probs just a neat fluke/coincidence. But it totally rocked my 10/11 y/o mind. 




 This is a lovely idea, maybe I'll try live my life more like that's actually the case, thank you :)

(Side note, I think I've heard a similar thing before, like, what if everyone else is just you, but living out a different incarnation, I don't know if that makes me feel comforted or lonely) 




 Aw man, sorry to take things off topic but one time in high school we marathoned the extended edition LOTRs. Started about 10pm and finished the next morning. No one was allowed to sleep, one of the nicest memories I have from that time :3 Such a great time...

But yeah, enjoy the mini series. I keep meaning to check it out myself when I find the time, report back with findings! 




 Adorable :D great job 




 So tempted to make an inspirational cross stitch sampler of this... 




 Thanks everyone for your comments, it definitely seems possible to convert someone :p might just show him this thread and see what he thinks :3 




 Yay, that's reassuring. I wouldn't see why they'd be any more bitey than any other type of rodent. My aunt, who is a vet has always said it's hamsters she dreads dealing with the most in that regard :p  




 British person here, I don't think anyone referred to Queen Elizabeth's Mum as "the Queen's Mum". But her 'title' was "Queen Mother", so maybe that's what threw you off...?

 




 Hang tight and I'll try find some Youtube or other sorts of tutorials for you to try! (scurries off to have a look)

Edit:

Ok so here's a few things I've found...

**Bracelets**
Friendship bracelets are very inexpensive (for materials you just need the string/floss) and quite sweet, plus there's a lot of scope to make a custom, personal pattern or two, plus there's instructions for making them everywhere online:

Hope those are a helpful place to start, OP, sorry I didn't find loads of stuff, but I hope you find something to suit your crafting skill level and the sorts of things your girlfriend likes.
(Also, don't forget to let us know what you end up making!) 




 Also 800g?! I was aware males could get big but, wow! :O 




 Sweet, that's a whole bunch of cool information, I hope I can one day be in a situation to use all those rat care tips :3 




 Aww, yeah my Mum has said that if I get rats I can't take them home to visit her :p But then she always said we'd never get dogs...and now we have three, so... 




 Hi there :)


I would love to keep rats; goodness knows I've spent hours pouring over pictures and videos of them online, or researching the cages, food, supplies etc. I would buy for them. They seem like such smart, funny, lovable pets and I want so badly to adopt a whole bunch of them. I love keeping various animals and have had a variety of healthy happy pets over the years but have yet to have a go at keeping rats.


My only real problem, however, is that I live with a boyfriend (for now and the foreseeable future) who is very much staunchly against the idea of keeping rats. Together we currently have just the one pet, a Syrian hamster, and we both love her to bits. We're always talking about all the animals we'll own one day, he's just as pro-let's-get-a-whole-bunch-of-animals-to-live-with, as I am, but whenever the subject of rats comes up, he adamantly refuses to entertain the idea of getting any.

Hamsters/Mice/Gerbils/Degus/Chinchillas/Guinea pigs/Rabbits etc. are all fine: rats seem to be the only rodent he has a problem with. Reasons he's given so far include: "I don't like their tails" (yet mice tails, which are pretty much the same are fine?), "They're vicious and more 'bitey' than other rodents", and "They're too big" (yep, way bigger than a degu or a rabbit, sure...).


Obviously I'm not going to force the issue, and if he truly doesn't want rats in his home then I won't force them upon him, but his reasons against seem so trivial and I would so love to keep rats...


**TL-DR**
Does anyone here have any experiences of convincing the reluctant ones in their lives that rats are adorable? Were you yourself once anti-rat and if so what made you change your mind? Any input welcome, really, he seems currently immune to all the cute rat pictures I can throw at him. Appalling. :p 




 Out of interest who is the narrator for the audiobooks? 




 Yeah using lip balm makes you need lip balm (I'm definitely reliant on it)...but I wouldn't go so far as to say it's a huge sinister money-spinning conspiracy, it's just a pretty much accepted annoyance
 




 I'm entirely new to this but so far as I can tell I think it's mostly done free hand, though molds and stencils can help you get certain shapes. I can see why a beginners' kit would come with a mold to make things a bit easier getting the general shape (I still found I had to 'sculpt' in quite a bit of definition freehand). 




 Aw shucks, thanks :) 




 How did you know?! :p Jabbed one of my fingers quite hard early on, after that I was a bit more careful, and 'only' had a few more lighter accidental hand stabbings... 




 Thanks, I mean, with a kit I couldn't go far wrong, to be honest :p

Although the instructions could have been a bit more helpful; I had no idea what sort of density I was meant to be aiming for, I stabbed away for hours and hoped for the best, really :) 




 Thank you, and yes I am feeling better :) I have a whole lot of work to do at the moment but you better believe I'm instead choosing to spend my time searching for needle felting supplies instead! 




 Thank you :3 I'm quite pleased with how he's turned out, too.
Totally going to try make needle felted versions of my pets now...

Edit: missing word 




 So very very many :p I'll must admit it did feel a bit wrong stabbing a tiny fluffy bunny... 




 Thank you :D 




 I wasn't feeling too well yesterday so I decided to treat myself to some craft supplies including a little needle felting kit by Dimensions. It was pretty fun considering I'd never even considered trying needle felting before :3

I totally want to do more!

(Also here's a few more pictures if you're interested http://imgur.com/a/u8Osj#0 )

 This is interesting because we somehow got around to talking about pills and dosage in a recent lecture actually. 

Part of it is to do with how you use the pill as a product. Certain pills might be marketed in small doses per individual pill for safety reasons, e.g. so you don't accidentally harm yourself taking too much; one less concentrated pill on its own isn't going to be so harmful. Also so that you can take smaller doses than one might normally need, should you wish (I'm talking things like paracetamol, asprin, everyday over the counter type pills).

But a lot of the time it's for general ease of dosage, particularly if they are prescribed pills that you yourself are meant to take regularly to a prescribed schedule. For instance, it's easier to remember to take one slightly weaker pill per day than a slightly stronger pill every two days, as the routine you maintain in doing so is easier to remember, and also with a weaker pill, the damage of missing one would be less (I'd imagine). This way you're more likely to receive the right dosage because you are more likely to take it correctly.



It's also why a lot of birth control comes with placebo pills for seven days, rather than simply a break of no pills. I'm not sure how familiar you are with birth control pills but with the most common type you basically take it once a day for 28 days, then have a break for seven days (have yourself a period), then resume with it. With the brands that come with additional placebo pills that don't do anything for the seven days, rather than those that simply give you 28 days worth of pills on their own you just keep going without breaking your routine, no potential difficulties in trying to remember where you last broke off etc.


Sorry for my dreadful examples, but hopefully you get the idea was trying so so poorly to convey :p

EDIT: 21 days, not 28, rather 




 Falconry!

I'd love to try it, and who doesn't think the idea of owning and caring for a bird of prey would be cool? But I've no idea how people go about starting with it. You obviously can't (or rather shouldn't) buy a bird of prey without first giving it a go and finding out if it's really for you and learning a whole lot of background stuff. But from where?

Like, where do you even go to learn about stuff like that outside of the internet?

:( 




 I find this both stressful and satisfying to watch... 




 Thanks for the replies folks! I've currently taken on a swap to keep me busy for now. Hopefully we can sort out swaps for the next time I'm swap-free :3

Have a lovely day 




 Nice, I wish I'd known this was on, would have loved to have gone 




 This was nice... I really enjoy seeing comedians or whoever handling hecklers well without being too heavy handed :3 




 Aww shame, she was awesome, and she signed my book :D But if that sort of thing's not your cup of tea then fair enough :3 




 Seriously you should go anyway, you'll regret missing the chance to see her! 




 Agreed, this video just made me uncomfortable :( 




 I don't think the clothes are even that bad, it's just...why so angry? :( 




 Aren't they? 




 Seconded the mlp stuff, (am also griller). I truly believe there was a time when it would have been (somewhat moreso) socially acceptable to be into ponies and now the golden age has passed.  I just lost interest once it became known as the fandom with all those grown men in it who masturbate to children's toys and stuff... 




 No I totally agree here with Cryptic. It was pretty mean to make fun of him that much...though...maybe in a way it could be what he needed, poor guy...

EDIT: Just reached the part about "when are you going back to Ohio, we want you to leave". Bit harsh, like... 




 Needs more Nick Cage ;) 




 Jonathan Rhys Meyers is a nice touch, I don't think he gets as much appreciation as he should 




 Oh God Shia Laboeuf as Paul, that'd be so horrible... 




 Well...gosh 




 This is Reddit. Suffering Olympics and all that... 




 Came here to post the exact same thing you beautiful son of a bitch

I don't know, the BG can be pretty cold but, Nazis? Maybe I need to read further on with sequels than I currently have though... 




 Elaborate 




 THANK YOU. Nice to know I'm not alone on this one 









 "STAY OUT OF OUR FANDOMS FILTHY WHORE CASUALS"..."Why are there no m'ladies here?"

 Literally Hitler. 




 I was obsessed with the Hogfather adaptation when it came out. I think it was maybe mostly to do with a teenage crush I had on the actors playing Mr Teatime and Susan. Good times. I should dig the DVD out sometime... 




 American Gods would be cool. I think HBO was going to make it into a tv miniseries(?) but then it just hung around in development purgatory before getting abandoned. 

Failing that, A Handmaid's Tale or the Wasp Factory would be cool options.

Also, two of my favourite books ever, Titus Groan/Gormenghast would make a great film/films. They were made into a miniseries back in 2000,  it was so-so, has Stephen Fry in it and a bunch of others, a feature length film would be wonderful though.

Yeah, Brave New World would be interesting to see on the big screen.

EDIT: Turns out there was a Handmaid's Tale film...huh 




 Rite? You would go to class and study but it's all so easy you find it dull and that's why you can't do any of the work or get good grades /s 




 I know, god damn Blue Pill is full of hotties.

I mean, ^beta ^faggots ^or ^something? 




 Bloody hell, the internet is intent on sucking Joss Whedon's dick these days. Hope you can get it sorted out, OP :) 




 I like this. More of these. We could have them from all historical eras... 




 I'm too late, aren't I? :( 




 I'm doing the thing! 




 Same, one time when I was a teen I went almost a year without a period. A YEAR. Everything was fine btw, but yes...tracking periods because of the influence of hormones on a slight shift in preferences for facial features is an awful, impractical idea... 




 Also other guys, basically everyone is a threat...it's a terper eat terper world out there... 




 What. 




 Your guy friends are pretty hot...*runs away giggling* 




 DAE Extroverts just (le)terally don't get it? 




 "You smell of fear. I can taste it from here and you are in Sheffield"

For some reason, this is where I lost it. 




 I had a bit of time in hospital a few weeks ago and played SO MUCH of this game, beating it was such sweetness. I'd been playing it at home a lot too and my boyfriend was starting to make fun of me for all the times I ended up yelling "I don't even think I'm having fun, I just have to keep playing though!" :P Grats.

Might I also suggest you now try the Fibonacci and Threes editions? Just as infuriatingly fun as the original ;) 




 10/10 would display proudly on my bookshelf 




 Yeah, Kyle Maclachlan was a pretty decent Paul in my eyes. Not exactly how I'd pictured him though, especially in the sequels beyond 'Dune', but honestly I think he was well enough cast. Also I ^sort ^of ^have ^a ^lady ^crush ^on ^him... 




 YES. Duke Leto was spot-on for me, shame we couldn't have seen just a bit more of him 




 Gotta love Toto 




 Oh hai there, fellow VisualBoy Emulator user 




 This just came to me last night. When I was little I had a VHS tape and it had some short animated kids stories on it. I can't remember if there was any rhyme or reason as to the things on it, maybe it was things we'd recorded off tv, but one of the stories was about a couple of panda cubs.

It may have been in anime or Western style, I'm unsure, but basically the two panda cubs (possibly some other type of bear cub) are travelling some
where together. Starts off with one of them saying they were bored, which I remember because I had to ask my Mum what 'bored' meant.

Eventually they start squabbling and, I don't know, smash the world or cause some sort of rift (possibly something to do with that part of the world being made of crystals)? At any rate, it ends with them being separated, either from each other or with no hope of ever getting home again.


Something depressing like that. The moral of course was "don't fight or quarrel".

Anybody? I feel like I would definitely recognise the voice acting if I heard it (American accents). Please help me recover this bit of my childhood :p 




 Wild stab in the dark with the 'Wind Singer' books? 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind_Singer

All I really remember of them is that there's an oppressive society, an underground fringe society, and a circular 'S' symbol on the front, they are YA books and came out around about that time. A lot of the other details don't add up though, so I won't hold my breath on this :p 




 YES! Thank you, I knew it was by someone familiar

Edit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LNHYz89sNc found it.

Second Edit: I will totally read the short story at the earliest convenience 




 That is, the machinery in it goes through the motions of setting out food (possibly) and other actions like waking them up, but the actual inhabitants are clearly dead (though I don't think we see their bodies or anything).

Sorry that that's so incredibly vague, I'm sure this is a real thing and not some grim dream I had or whatever. Almost 95% confident it was a short animated film with no dialogue. *Unhelpful shrug* 




 Also, brb, installing Chip's Challenge... 




 Sounds like it, does this look familiar, OP? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip's_Challenge 




 Check that SMV... 




 FINGERNAILS. OH GOD. FINGERNAILS.

I mean, you surely don't have to have a vagina of your own to realise that scraping/stabbing with your uncut nails is going to happen if you just ram them in there...*shudder* 




 Yeah, we had a one-way system at our school too, like, all the way around the entire school (which was sort of ring, shaped, with bits coming off it, if that makes sense). It was a bitch to get around if you had to get to your locker, go to the bathroom etc. and get to class on time, but I guess it made sense from  a safety point of view
 




 My, what an attractive individual. 




 Interbreeding with wolves and dogs does sometimes happen, however, some dog evolutionists argue that the grey wolf may not be the sole ancestor of the modern dog anyway, rather it could be some other canid like the jackal or something similar. At any rate, we need to remember that dogs aren't wolves, they *are* their own species, one artificially created through their ancestors' ongoing symbiotic relationship with humans. 

I reckon, although as someone else said, there is no way of predicting what evolution will do, that we could reasonably expect to get a mongrely sort of 'street dog', as we see in dogs living on the fringes of human settlements today, the type of dogs we think early proto-dogs living alongside humans would have looked like throughout most of the species' history. There'd be variation depending on geography and so on, but probably a medium build type of dog, not too chunky, not too anything, fairly generic. But that's just my speculation.

Selectively breeding dogs for certain breed types is only a relatively modern phenomenon, and it is the Victorians we have to 'thank' for a lot of selective pet breeding, and for the rigid breeding of dogs to a particular standard or appearance. There have been breeds and types before this time of course, but breeders were more concerned with performance; a shepherd might breed his best herder or whatever, hunters might select for dogs with good retrieval skills, you get the idea. Companion or pet breeding was similarly casual, and of course, with less strict rules about roaming, and less spay/neutering, dogs tended to just do the biz with whoever else they damn well pleased. What I'm saying is that there's so much variation in how dogs look, and it's not always been necessarily down to us intentionally breeding for it.

If you'd like to learn more about the history of dogs and their place alongside humans, I highly recommend the book 'In Defence of Dogs' by John Bradshaw. Hope that was even remotely helpful. Like I say, I could be totally wrong, and I'm just speculating (please be gentle, Reddit people) :3

Edit: Ofc I'm not saying there is no influence of their ancestors in the dogs genetic makeup, just that dogs are now pretty much their own species, and so long as they inhabit an evolutionary niche alongside humans, I don't personally think they would 'revert' to wolves. 




 ^ What this guy said, these 'after image' effects caused by rhodopsin (the chemical in question) depletion, are what gives us these cool optical illusions: http://izismile.com/2011/11/11/mind_blowing_afterimages_optical_illusions_3_pics_11_gifs.html 




 My body is so ready, but where can I find showings in Europe/The UK?  




 Yeah, I think threads like these are pretty good for asking the question "can/should we actually compare books to their film adaptations?". I know I've definitely come across those who think it's meaningless to even compare two different types of media like that. I can appreciate why, I guess 




 No you're right, I misspelled it and didn't even notice until you pointed it out.
Rest assured I feel suitably dirty and ashamed :p 




 Thanks, I think they're adorable too :p
She's a long haired, which in female Syrian hamsters basically just means a couple of ear tufts and maybe a bit of a butt 'skirt' (though my hammie just has little butt tufts). As far as I'm aware the females don't really express long-hairedness to the extent that males do. 




 Oh no, would you not recommend Memoirs of a Geisha? I've always had a notion that I'd get around to reading it some day but, meh, worth it? 




 For me reading the books along with the show has just heightened my enjoyment of both, I couldn't imagine being as into the books as I am if I hadn't seen the show and vice versa 




 That's cool, I didn't know that. 
I've read a couple of other short pieces by Palahniuk that I thought were just great, Fight Club just left me underwhelmed :p 




 Children of Men was great both in book and film form, but I honestly felt like the two were completely different stories, but for the fact that there are no children happening. It's one of the film adaptations I've seen that's the least similar to the book on which it was based, just a completely different tone, focus, everything, even down to the fact that men are impotent in the book and women are barren in the film (or whichever way around it was :p). 

I'd still have a hard time deciding between the two, though in terms of preference. 




 Close one for me to call but I'd maybe just have to go with the book this time. But man I love both so much...
