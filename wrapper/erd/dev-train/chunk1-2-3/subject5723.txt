 I've must've wasted more than 15 pieces of paper trying to wrap my mind around this.

A tank is half full of oil , which has density 920kg/m3. Find the work (in joules) required to pump the oil out of the outlet. Assume g=9.8m/s^2.

The tank is a right circular cylinder and is lying on its side. The radius is 1.5m and the pump extends 1m. The length is 6m.

I had to rewind some parts at least 3 times because I couldn't see the screen through all the tears.

 Try [electro-swing.com!](http://electro-swing.com). they have lots of different genres of swing, lengthy dj sets but really awesome tracks!

I like minimal beats too. Beats are suppose to compliment a good swing track, just like salt and pepper are suppose to compliment a good steak.

 Sweet. He's in Vancouver now. Lucky us.  




 This is a fantastic source, thanks so much. 




 Thank you! 




 My sister believes that at some point Canada had a climate similar to one at the equator, before the Ice Age. I know that Canada has sub-tropical and arctic climates but I can't find any information to refute her. 

Is it possible that at some point in history northern part of North America had a desert or rainforest climate? 




 Ay Ah ah ah Ay! 




 The earth is 3 million miles (5 million km) closer to the sun in January than in July.

 You could also talk about your experience dealing with a difficult school subject, describing your problem area(s) and how you overcame it through receiving extra help from a tutor, or going out of your way to make sure you'd ace the material and you've learned how to stay motivated, not to give up, etc. Hope that helps. 

Good luck! 




 It's funny because part of the building is up for lease too. Farewell imaginary government agency.
