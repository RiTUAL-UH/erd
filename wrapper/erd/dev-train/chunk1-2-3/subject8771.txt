 D: That poor dog...I'm so happy someone rescued it. 47% down vote...Really?! 




 This is where Pixar animators laugh because they are so sneaky. Mwahaha 




 I don't think anyone understands the amount of excitement I have right now. And for goodness sake, who on earth would down vote this??? 




 my band teacher's go to joke. 




 My band teacher's go to joke.  




 Sorry bro...I wish you the best of luck.. 




 It's beautiful!! You're a lucky person.. 




 Not the most attractive expression for her...but she's still pretty. 




 You know what they say about big dogs...? Short life spans. 




 Hey look! Its the babysitter from a Disney movie!  




 That guy wishes he was in a fish bowl.  




 Many interwebs for you.  




 That is freaking nasty. Ew. However, its the little ones that'll kill you.  




 Go get 'em tiger.  




 Really clever. But no. 




 I'm 18 (fresh out of high school) and have never smoked weed or consumed alcohol. And as a girl, I have also never dyed my hair or gone "fake" tanning. I mean come on, the sun isn't broken! 




 She has huge racks..of lamb.  




 Agreed. I took a first look and was utterly overwhelmed. It was a lot to take in and I wanted to walk away from it at first, but was coerced by my friends try again...and here I am..damn peer pressure. 









 D'awww. Can I have one? Along with one of these? http://helablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/slow_loris_umbrella.jpg  




 The Louvre!..a bit of a hike to see it...but it's beautiful. 




 Have you ever dealt with children who have had to take responsibility for their depressed parents?  
























 Reddit, I have noticed more and more that old people just CAN'T DRIVE!! Even my dad is becoming a horrible driver. He drives through stop signs and is generally reckless and my grandma doesn't know how to maintain a steady speed, braking constantly for no reason. What are your stories about old people driving? Do you think they should retake a drivers test?  




 I imagine cat people are a little more introverted and therefore, go on the internet (and post about their cats), whereas dog people are more socially active and go out instead of go on the internet.  




 I don't think her experience would make it less special for you. I had a similar experience with my current boyfriend who had never kissed anyone, but i had. When you're in the moment, those things don't matter that much.  




 A first kiss is very special, especially with someone you care about, but it could turn out awkward if you don't quite know what you're doing. Practice makes perfect.  




 I grew up with a single mom. She was an alcoholic and I am an only child. By the time I was 12, I had learned how to forge her signature, pay bills, do groceries, clean the house, do laundry, wash dishes, make dinner, and be a nurse. Who needs parents anyway...?  




 Society has a serious problem. 




 THIS! On to the Legend of Korra?? 




 I am happy to report that I am still with the person I first had sex with. No regrets

 Wow dude. Sorry, but I cannot muster up any sympathy for you.  




 I think the heart makes it obvious enough 




 She might have been testing you. It was manipulative, but I think she may have wanted to see if she could trust you.  




 Do you know what the music is from? I recognize it, but the name escapes me.  




 I don't get. 




 My mom died when I was 14 years old. She was an alcoholic and prescription drug addict. And I'm sure everyone has heard "Your Mama" jokes. I realized early on that my tragedy was not going to change what people say and that they won't understand what it's like to have a dead mother. All the time people say "Your Mama" jokes and even my friends sometimes forget that my mom died and they will say them to my face. What helps me is to realize that people are stupid and they won't change. When they do say the joke to my face, I wait until they are done and then, with a smile on my face, I remind them that I don't have a mother. Almost every time the person will feel guilty and say sorry and the jokes are over for the day. I don't have a problem with the jokes, I just feel like the honesty will remind them in the future to be more aware of their audience and I think it works. It's worth a try in your case. It's kind of like seeing the funny side and saying something at the same time.  




 In all seriousness, I think http://www.themaidofhonorguide.com/ will help you get started.  




 YES YES YES http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyqUj3PGHv4    




 *arrangement, spell-fail. unless they want an arraignment for having a creepy foot fetish 




 Well, I can say from experience that the mother probably has had a huge influence in how your daughter feels. I lived with my mom for most of my life. My mom hated my dad too and I grew up thinking I should hate him. I learned later that a lot of things my mom said to me were only half-truths. I don't know the whole story with you, but the mom could have something to do with it and your daughter is a teenager now. You rarely see her, so she can easily use you as a target for her anger. Teens are nasty sometimes.
Is there anyway you could collaborate with your daughter's mother to work something out? It seems like you aren't on good terms with her, but in the interest of your daughter, maybe something can be worked out.  




 This has a resemblance to the island depicted in Harry Potter. 




 ostentatious  




 It does seem rather silly. 
























 Those geodes are awesome!! I catalogue fossils at school, and we have nothing like that... 




 felix-means lucky 




 I have a picture of myself as a baby, wrapped in a yellow blanket. I looked like a melon with a head. Hence, train_subject8771.  




 I see your point about Agravaine. He needs to go if Arthur is going to succeed. 
However, what I dislike about him is that he acts like a leech. He doesn't act independently and needs Morgana to tell him what to do to get his own revenge. If he was a real villain, he would act on his own accord and not on someone else's. 
And you know that once he is exposed, he's just gonna run away like a coward.  




 This episode made me optimistic about Arthur's progression. His outpouring of emotion seemed genuine and I hope that he will uphold his word in future episodes.  









 I agree with you on the snow and rain thing. It's amazing what a little precipitation can do. All of a sudden it's like "OMG!! THERE'S RAIN/SNOW ON MY WINDSHIELD! I NEED TO DRIVE LIKE A MORON NOW!" My dad was one of the smart parents who taught me how to drive in both.  




 Personally, I think it means loving someone more than yourself and knowing that they feel the same way and they'll do anything to see you happy.  




 No. It sounds like devotion. Good for you.  




 I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully you will find someone else who will appreciate you more.  









 I'll keep that in mind.  




 There are lots of unmarried couples who have kids and live together, with every intention of staying together. And there are lots of parents who are married with kids that get divorced anyway. That's why I'm questioning the purpose of the institution of marriage.  




 Just one question then. Why were you engaged for so long? Were you still unsure? 




 I like that. I hadn't thought of it that way before.  




 These days, people get married all the time and then get divorced. The divorce rate is astonishing. What's the point in getting married anymore? Do you think there is any meaning left in the promises of marriage? 




 Girl Genius! That was the first comic I started with. It's very well done. I also like the V for Vendetta suggestion. http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/  




 You make a valid point. There are a lot of people on the road who shouldn't be.  




 I can make a clover with my tongue.  




 Wow. That's crazy! I've never heard of that. In Pennsylvania, licenses last four years.  




 Hahaha..Different sides of the family.  




 Nice one. You would be correct. I am a teenager, but I've been driving for 2 years.
