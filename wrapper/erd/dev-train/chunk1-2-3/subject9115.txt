 Here is the back story you need to understand: My grandmother didn't raise any of her kids. The relationship she had with her children is like the relationships royalty had with their offspring. After giving birth, she pretty much only them at meals. My grandpa and great-grandma raised my mom, aunt, and uncle. 

My sister is engaged, and grandma asked, "When are you having kids?"

Sister answered, "Probably never. But if we do, it'll be years from now."

Grandma looks bewildered. "No kids? But why?"

"I don't like them."

"Well, I would raise them for you."

At this point my mom starts laughing so hard she nearly drops some dishes. "Mom, you didn't even raise me, you know nothing about babies."

"That isn't so! I raised you kids."

"No you didn't. Grandma got us ready for school every morning. I remember dad taking care of us during the night. You laid in bed every day until noon and then went shopping."

(Here's the kicker.) "Well, I gave you a bottle once."

I gave you a bottle once. *Really.*

Grandma is still trying to convince my sister she'll raise her baby for her.

I'm still not sure how Tumblr works, so in case what's in that link changes here is another pic:http://i50.tinypic.com/243iwqs.jpg

Okay:

Sleeping Beauty: It's annoying when people act like some random prince just raped Aurora. That might have been what happened in the original tale, but not in the Disney movie. In the movie, Aurora and Philip fell in love on their own. They met out in the woods and sang together. Aurora eventually stuck her finger on the spinning wheel, and went to a magically induced sleep until Philip could kill the villain, and kiss her to wake her up. It wasn't as if Phillip came across a sleeping woman and decided to rape her here. They were already in love and he just had to kiss her to wake her up. In what way is that anything like rape? If you want to bitch about the original tale go ahead, but that's not what the Disney version did.

Snow White: I've always felt that the true heroes were the drawfs, not the prince. The drawfs opened their home to SW and cared about her. They didn't make her cook and clean for them; she chose to. There was a homeless child wandering around the forest, and they adopted her. The prince just kind of happened among them and decided to kiss a corpse. He didn't protect her in any way.

Ariel: Ariel didn't change her body and leave her family for Eric. She did that because she wanted to be human. She wouldn't have met Prince Eric at all if she hadn't been going to the surface to spy on humans. 

Jasmin: Well, this is true for the time Jasmin was written to exist in. But in the end she chose to marry Aladdin, who was worth nothing politically. And her choice was accepted and supported. What's to bitch about here?

Belle: I'm confused here. Is this saying appearances don't matter to the guy as long as the girl is pretty? Belle's appearance isn't what made the Beast fall for her. It was because she was smart (all that reading she did) and wanted to help him. In the deleted scenes it even shows Bell teaching the Beast to read. That's why he liked her. 

Cinderella: Or maybe if you keep your chin up, try your best, and believe in yourself even in bad situations, good things can happen and you'll be rewarded? 




 Men:

Circumcision - Can we please give baby boys the same rights girls have and stop mutilating them?

Child Support - I have no problem with it generally, but it's just wrong that sex can lead to a man being stuck shelling out money for 18 years. If a woman is told from the get-go she'll be a single mother, she accepts full responsibility if she decides to keep the child. She can still abort (which I also think should be legal in all 50 states and cheap as part of healthcare), or put it up for adoption, so it isn't like she has to be a single mother if she doesn't want to. Obviously I don't think a man should be able to leave a heavily pregnant woman after they've decided to have a child, or a child he already has, but it's wrong that a woman can just say, "Yep, I'm one month pregnant, so get a job because you're on the hook for 18 years." *She has choices available to her, so should he.* I know poverty is also an issue, but I would also have a minimum wage you can live on, like Sweden does.

-The draft. Mens' lives aren't worth less than a woman's. I believe the draft should be done away with entirely, but both sexes should have to register as long as it exists.

Women:

Abortion legal - That's it. Her body, her choice. She gets the only say.

Military - Standards should be the same for men and women if they are doing the same work. All roles, even combat, should be open for women if they meet the requirements.
 




 I don't have dental insurance and can't afford it, so I'm looking into getting my teeth looked at by dental schools as I hear it's cheaper. How much cheaper is it? My teeth need so much dental attention but I'd settle for just having cavities taken care of, will they do that?  




 If you've ever had a retail or any sort of sales job, you know the drill. You're expected to smile, be energetic, and make customers feel welcome. Yeah, not very easy for someone whose life involves mostly misery. I can't even count how many times I've been called into the managers' office because someone complained that I didn't smile (yes, people have actually complained because I didn't smile at them), or because I wasn't friendly.

Now, I am never rude. I am polite, always give customers my full attention, and try to help them in whatever way I can. But I simply cannot act enthusiastic enough to satisfy managers. That's why my job interviews often lead nowhere. Smile? You have no idea how much energy it takes not to cry sometimes, smiling is quite out of the question. And I can't act enthusiastic because I can't remember the last time I was excited. I have my good days and bad days, but my two main moods are depressed and neutral. If I'm neutral, it means I'm having a good day.  









 http://mybrownbaby.com/2011/12/taye-diggs-says-fatherhood-is-a-little-scary%E2%80%94but-easy-and-romantic/

I know this article is over a year old, but it made me chuckle. I'm a huge Broadway fan, and a fan of Idina Menzel, Taye's wife, so I watched some interviews with them after the baby was born. They mentioned having a nanny, a cook, and at one point, a driver.

No, I imagine parenting wouldn't be at all difficult with all that. But the scary thing is, when this article first came out, on Broadway forums were saying, "See, parenting isn't that hard, you just have to love each other!" I hope they won't think their baby comes with three people for help too. :X 




 I was put on 10mg of Paxil at age 11, maybe 10 at the youngest. At around 17 I was put on 20mg, and in my 20s (I'm 24 now) I was put on 40mg. I've been feeling like my medicine isn't doing as much as it used to, and have been since I was 17. The doc thought it would help to keep increasing the dose, but finally I said I don't think increasing the dose would help a lot. So she switched me to 20mg (to start) Prozac, and told me to go down to half a dose of Paxil for a week, stop taking it, then switch to Prozac.

Well, Monday (the 4th) was my last Paxil day, and I feel like complete shit now. Headaches, those electrical shocks in my head (I'm sure you know what I'm talking about), the nausea, the back aches, the dizziness...just ugh. It totally feels like the flu. I'm sweating enough to fill a swimming pool. I've always been an easy crier, but now I can cry just on command. I go back to the doc in April, I just hope it's better by then. 

Also, yes, I'm aware a week is a very short time for Paxil to be weaned off of. But it's been 5 days, I may as well ride it out, since it wasn't doing much for me anymore anyway. On the bright side, at least I haven't found a job yet. Working like this? No.

And finally, old suicide wishes are spring back up, but I don't have to worry about that since I would feel really bad for my grandma if I did, so I'm putting it off until she dies, at least. I've been dealing with it for more than a decade, it's just a little stronger now. 




 You have to agree it takes a special someone to make it through something so rigorous as medical school. Not only is the subject of your learning difficult, med schools tend to test your stamina by making you go on little sleep and outrageous hours. For years. 

Now look at me. I failed out of school (not med school, but still) and I don't feel comfortable complaining about my inadequacies  to someone who's basically a god compared to me. I can barely keep it together to hold down a job, let alone do anything that takes skill and intelligence. I just feel like they'd be right to look down upon me, although I know they wouldn't. 




 I know this article is a few years old, but I haven't seen it mentioned here before, so...

http://thestir.cafemom.com/healthy_living/8143/_Baby_Lust_Would_You

There's an alarmingly high statistic floating around CafeMom of late:
Forty-two percent of women claim they would lie about contraception in order to get pregnant, regardless of the wishes of their partners. In other words, women so desperately want a baby that they tell their partners are on birth control when, really, they aren't.

Honestly, this sort of shit should get men off child support responsibilities if it's found out. I already sort of support "financial abortions" for men (of course, some things would need considered, such as cost of abortions for women, access to healthcare, etc), but how can anyone find this shit acceptable?  









 So many people say you can't compare female circ to male circ because of these things:

-Female circumcision removes the clitoris, which would be like removing the entire penis in a male

-Female circ is only performed to diminish sexual stimulation in the female

-Female circ is done in dirty conditions with pieces of class, inviting infection and death

-Female circ ruins lives

I don't deny all this is true in certain parts of the world, like a lot of countries in Africa. But too many people are unaware of other types of female circumcision, which can very easily be compared to male:

-In places like much of Egypt and Indonesia, the clitoris isn't removed. Only the clitoral hood is removed. This is very similar to removing the foreskin in the male. The development of both types of prepuce is the same. Both uncover the glans during sexual stimulation, both are fused to the glans at birth, and both collect smegma. 

-This type isn't done to diminish sexuality. It's done because they believe it to be cleaner, healthier, and more visually appealing. 

-This type is very rarely done in huts with pieces of glass. Doctors in hospitals do it with sterile equipment.

-Women who have had this type done to them seem happy with it. Let me post two links:

http://aandes.blogspot.com/2010/04/circumcision.html

This one is a blog written by an Indonesian woman. In the blog, she talks about taking her daughter to the hospital and having her circumcised. She says her daughter never cried, and she herself had it done as a baby. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcJNAtn-c6Ifeature=youtu.be

This second link is about circumcision in Egypt, mostly of women. The women interviewed said they enjoy their circumcised bodies, will have it done to their daughters, and they go on to describe how safe it is since it's done by a doctor, how much healthier it is, and how much cleaner it is. 

Now, for the record, I believe even this form of female circumcision should be illegal. It's body modification on a child. But what's striking how similar it is to how we view male circumcision in America. 









 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaqFHT8oOBo

Here's part of Nanny 911 - see if you can even get through 10 seconds of it!

This just astounds me. If my sister and I had acted like that I'm sure my dad would have killed one of us. And I always cringe when I see kids hitting their parents. I went through a hitting phase as a child, but I never hit an adult. I knew my dad would have had my hide. 




 They have to put emotion into everything.

For example, the word victim. It means you were the hurt or oppressed subject of a crime or other malicious activity. It's just a term. Recently I was told I'm not allowed to say rape victim anymore. I have to say target. Not sexual assault victim, it has to be sexual assault target. 

But WTF's wrong with victim? It just means you were taken advantage of. And you were. Nothing is shameful about it, it's just a term. Soon they're going to decide target implies the person wasn't human, or something. 

Some others:
Dumb (it used to mean you couldn't talk, so it's offensive to people who can't talk)
Retard (Can't even use it in its correct context now. Retard just means to slow down. You can't say "One pedal makes the car speed up, the other retards it)
Broad (Yep, I had someone tell me it's offensive even if you mean wide or big, since it's also an offensive term for women)

How about we make these people so afraid of every English word they just stop talking?

EDIT: Can't believe I forgot to add my favorite one! Butthurt. A SRSer told me it's offensive to rape victims(targets?) because it implies rape. I said, "I always thought it meant you fall down and hurt your butt like a whiny little kid." They answered, "Well, some people say it means rape so you shouldn't use it." So now you can't say things because other people MIGHT think it means something else. 









 I didn't feel good one day, and decided it must be my empty stomach, so I ate some shredded beef jerky. I guess I was actually sick because I threw it up 15 mins later. It was oddly foamy and tasted so sour. I didn't eat beef jerky again for about a year.

What's your experience? 




 I live next to a family that is fucking huge. Two parents and three kids, all of them really large people. The oldest is probably 19 or 20, the next kid is 17 or so and the youngest is about 12. 

I was about 11 when the youngest kid was born, and I remember her being a normal sized baby. Maybe on the large side, but nothing crazy. As the months passed, I noticed the baby getting way too big to be healthy. My parents said the same thing, but with her family being huge, what else was there to expect? By the time she was 4 years old she was too heavy to lift. This trend continued. 

I remember the youngest (let's call her Sara) was always complaining that her legs hurt. Her mom said, "Everyone's legs hurt, you'll get used to it." This family is very "being-fat-isn't-unhealthy" despite the fact that the father and the oldest daughter are both diabetics because of their weight and the middle girl has breathing problems, also weight related. We live out in the country and there is quite a walk between our houses. I played with them when I was younger and I remember having to stop inbetween houses to they could catch their breath. 

Well, a little bit ago their mother called my mother on the phone, upset, and told her this: Sara had fallen and broken one of her knees a few weeks ago. It was a slight fall, but her weight and the stress on it over the years broke the knee pretty easily. The doctor said she needed to stay off it at all costs. He didn't even want her walking on crutches because the recovery was going to be so slow and fickle. Her mom asked why she couldn't just use crutches, and he said frankly, it was her weight. She was too big to walk around on one leg without risking injury to it, and it was also too risky for her broken knee because of the stress put on it. 

Well, they couldn't accept the news from the doctor that weight was actually having a negative impact on their daughter. When Sara got home they didn't take his warning seriously. They didn't believe weight would hurt her injury further, so they got her crutches and let her walk around.

Guess what's happened now? Sara started complaining of extreme pain in her knee. It was so bad one night they took her to the ER. Diagnosis? Bone death. Probably caused by the break not being allowed to rest and having to continuously bear a lot of weight. They're going to have to replace her entire knee. 

Honestly, I believe child services should be called in these cases. You'll get your kids taken away if they're dangerously skinny, so why is being dangerously overweight okay?  




 SIDS - sudden infant death syndrome - is what they call it when an infant dies and there is no explanation. It's probably caused by babies falling into a deep sleep and not breathing. Despite many ways to lower the risk, thousands of babies still die from it every year in the USA alone. 

What kind of shit is this?! Knowing me, if I had an infant I would be driven literally insane from the worry. At least I don't feel the need to check to see if my cat is breathing every 5 minutes. 




 I really don't mean for this to be a pro-suicide message. I was just wondering if anyone else ever felt this way. Most people see what they think as their eventual suicide in a negative light, but I've seen it positively for years, and want to know your thoughts.

In my view, my life is a trap. Doing a job I hate to support a life I don't want for years and years. I'm only 23, but I think my middle aged years would just be more of the same. The same old depression, sadness, and annoyance continuing for years and years until I finally die of old age. Well, knowing suicide is there helps me, sort of. I know I don't have to live that life if I don't want. I only have to live it as long as I can stand it then finally check out.

Again, I don't mean for this to be pro-suicide or anything of the sort. I've just never met anyone else with these same feelings and wonder if anyone is out there.

I know you can't expect a toddler to behave, really. They can barely understand what you're saying and they tire easily. But this kid sounds miserable to be around, and the mother is at fault, IMO. 

And they go to the zoo once a week? WTF? I rarely got to go to the zoo. 

And she's proudly vaccine free? I wish I could send these idiots to the past so they can see the terrible things the diseases we don't have now because of vaccines did to people. 














 -Clothes. I will never spend more than $8 on a pair of pants or shirt. Goodwill has a lot of nice stuff for very cheap. It boggles my mind why people spend hundreds of dollars on clothes.

-DVDs. I can understand picking up a cheap copy of a movie somewhere, but do people still really buy $20 DVDs? Even with piracy easily achieved?

-Baby stuff. Again, Goodwill is great for this. I've never seen anything that looked dirty or heavily used in the baby section. I also saw a good crib for $20. A stroller that looked like it just came out of the box for $20. Even some clothes with the pricetags still on them originally costing $15 or $20. Goodwill's price? $2.50. If I ever have a baby, the nursery is going to be made up from Goodwill shit for under $100. 

-Most things in a pet store. If you're getting a special item I can understand it, but why would you buy basic supplies at a pet store? You can get the same exact objects at Walmart for a third of the price. I got my rats a water bottle for $1.50 at Walmart. The exact same bottle was $4.50 at Petco.

-Books. Textbooks not included, since there is really no way around that. I can't believe people buy books at Barnes and Nobles at those prices. I buy my books online (in great shape, too, some even brand new) for half those prices, even if you include shipping. 









 http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/16xipk/moms_of_reddit_whats_something_about_pregnancy/

I do want to have a baby someday despite this horror, but I swear a gagged a few times reading this.  




 According to SRS's idea of privilege, the only people who can openly speak about anything without being invalidated by their race/sex/sexual orientation/etc are black transsexual gay women who are disabled. So these people are the lucky ones. They can say whatever they want without being told to check their privilege and shut down. 

So whenever they begin talking, tell them to check their privilege privilege. 









 I mention tearing up at the lyric change "a man who only learned to love when you were in his keeping" during the finale, and my cousin scoffed at me. "But you don't like kids."

So that means I wouldn't see the importance of a man who hasn't seen any sort of love in 25 years adopting an abused child and finally finding some purpose in his life. 



















 I'm not bothered by women who nurse in public as long as they don't make a spectacle of it, but I am annoyed at the "Look at my exposed tit while I suckle my child, aren't I a goddess!" women. Breastfeeding isn't that amazing. All mammals do it, and you aren't mother nature. I'm glad you've chose to nurse since it's the best an infant can eat, but someone isn't being unreasonable if they ask you to cover up a little in a restaurant.

I don't mind nursing done discreetly, but you don't need to have your entire boob out while you glare at strangers silently daring them to say something. 




 http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2250785/I-locked-toddler-room-night-save-marriage.html

Really, the parenting problem began long before this. Why did the boy think it was okay to get up after his parents put him to bed? Even before I started kindergarten, I knew once I was put to bed, I wasn't allowed up unless I was going to the bathroom or getting a drink of water. And if I was doing that, it'd better be fast. And pounding on the door? I didn't dare pound on the door after being put in my room, I would have had my butt beaten. 









 I've worked three jobs so far. The first two in food service, and the current one in retail. I always hear about how rude and entitled teenagers are, but I've noticed the exact opposite. I'm actually happier to serve teenagers. They're a lot more patient, forgiving of mistakes, and treat me like a human being.

My least favorite customers are the elderly. They get mad at me if computers are slow, roll their eyes if I ask for ID, and I've even had a few flat out walk away while I was talking to them. 














 JROTC is a program the military has in high schools to teach about the military and promote signing up after high school.  4 days of the week is learning about the history and how the military is run, and one day is uniform day. Students are given a military uniform and graded according to how correctly they wear it. 

Well, my cousin in ROTC told me that in October, instead if your uniform shirt you could wear one of those pink breast cancer awareness shirts and it counted as part of your uniform. Nothing wrong with that. But in November, male students wanted to be allowed to grow their beards for a month as part of Movember, the movement to gain awareness for male specific cancers. They were told no, that a beard isn't part of the uniform. Well, neither are pink shirts, but that was allowed. 

But for some fun, let's answer how SRS would when told about this problem: BEARDS! YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT BEARDS WHEN 100% OF WOMEN IN THE MILITARY ARE RAPED EVERY DAY! *insert dildos and poop here* God, when will men learn no one cares about their beards when women are so oppressed that they're considered too weak to be in the military at all! Ever think of that? They probably just want to wear beards to scare the women who were raped by men with beards! 




 For one, I have severe depression and anxiety and it's a chore to talk to people for me. Not good for a retail worker, but who really works retail because they enjoy it? I have a running habit of getting complained on at work. The usual comments are "didn't smile" "didn't look at me" "didn't greet or thank me." I got two in the past two days. Now, I can be a bitch, yes, but not at work. *Hell, I don't speak back or even react to customers who are rude to me.* I just continue doing my thing. Right now I work behind a counter, and my comments are usually, "Hello. It comes to a total of $_______. Swipe your card here. Here's your things. Take care." And the best part is, these past two days I wasn't even in a bad mood. I was just kind of like: Yeah, another day, what's up? Even the bagboy behind me said he didn't notice me being rude. 

One problem I think is that I don't smile very much. It's just never been something I've done. It doesn't feel natural and plus, I have weak teeth and don't like to show them.  




 Just a vent about how pointless my existence is.

I started going to nursing school in 2010. Luckily for me, my parents paid for it. Paid for the classes, my books, the gas to get there, everything. But less than 9 months later I had to drop out. It was because I was beginning to fail some classes (no matter how hard I tried, I could not get my test scores above 76%, and they were always frustratingly close, like 74), and the teacher said if I ever tried to enter any other nursing school with a record of failing out, they'd be less likely to take me, so it's better to have a "chose to drop it" on the record. 

For the past two years I've been feeling pretty guilty about wasting my parents' money. I put my school books under the bed because I can't stand to look at them. What's more, I want to go back to college (not for nursing, don't want to go through that hell again), but knowing I'll probably fail and throw $10K down the tubes again, and this time be weighted down by student debt. And who's to say going to college will even lead to a job? It doesn't for so many people.

My situation is a *little* better than it was when I was last here. Instead of making $7.70 at Wendys I'm making $8 an hour in retail. I don't enjoy it, but it's certainly better than Wendys was. At least I don't spend my off time fantasizing about dying as much as I did there. 

I was diagnosed with depression at age 11 and have been on Paxil since then; I'm 23 now. I feel like one of those people who will never really be an adult, since I haven't been able to move out and still live at home. And I feel like an ungrateful bitch for failing out of college by parents paid for, although it's been 2 years and I feel as bad for it as I did when it happened. 




 I'm 23 years old, and want a baby so bad I could cry. But I know I have no business with one since I have a crappy job and live with my parents. Still, I hope someday in the future that may chance and I will be able to be a mother. 

Despite this, I support childfree people strongly. For one, children deserve a loving family, and they may not get that if they have parents who don't really want them. It's so stupid to pressure people into having children who don't want them. It's 18+ years that will be spent mainly on taking care of another person. Besides being expensive as fuck, we're talking about a child here. They need so much love and attention. 

Another thing is overpopulation. There are 7 billion people on this planet, and growing daily. There is no need for people to breed like bunnies. Not really part of this topic, but I feel it's appropriate here, I think adopting should be easier. No, children shouldn't be given to just anybody, but it shouldn't cost $60K to adopt a kid, and we shouldn't be turning down wonderful potential adoptive parents because they were caught with a joint 10 years ago. 

My last point: As someone who has worked crappy service jobs my whole life so far, I've some terrible kids that have made me almost reconsider wanting a kid someday. I've seen kids spit on, hit, and bite their parents and face no punishment, I've seen kids make hugh messes employees with have to clean up and their parents don't bat an eye. Now I work at an expensive store that sells exotic decorations, and parents even let their kids climb onto the shelves and knock items down that probably cost more than I make in a week. And the managers let them do it because they don't want to make customers feel like they can't come back. If I were in charge, I'd make parents pay for everything their kids ruined, AND ban them from the store. 









 Here are a few pics of my goats:

That's all I have by way of proof. I could send a mod my Facebook profile, which has more pics of goats in our yard, if you want. 














 I'm talking about suicide, of course. My mom says that  phrase all the damn time, and I just want to say, "Or it could be a permanent solution to a problem that never goes away and eats at you until you have to do something to end it." 

They act like suicide is something people decide to do when they're behind on a couple bills, when they have a flat tire, when they're currently working a job they don't like. They don't understand that people choose this because they can't take the never-ending sadness and loneliness anymore. I know people do it for different reasons, but no one has decided, "Well, I loved life before, but I got this F on my report card, so I guess I'm checking out."

I'm just venting. We heard tonight that someone who lives nearby shot himself because his business was going under. It aggravated me that people ignored the other possible issues he may have been having and think he killed himself because he'd had to close his hardware store. 




 I don't see my life going anywhere. I still live at home, and Wendys is the best job I can get. Failing out of nursing school only made me realize how stupid I am and that I'm unlikely to ever progress beyond Wendys. I wasted thousands of dollars on nursing so I'm afraid to try to go back to college and waste even more money. And even if I did manage to get some degree, so what? People with degrees are working fast food jobs too. I'm exactly where they are now, except I'm not in terrible debt. 

I know your 20s are confusing and you often bounce from job to job until you find one you're fit for, but I have co-workers in their 30s, 40s, and even 50s. I refuse to let that happen to me. How is that sort of life worth it? I don't want to leave my loved ones, but I cannot stand the thought of working at a minimum wage job my whole life, more miserable than ever, just to scrape by. 

I'm only 23, so I guess anything could happen, but I doubt it. I just don't see the point of living a life with little happiness on the off chance something might get better. Oddly enough, knowing I won't be doing this into my middle age years is comforting, whether it's because I found something else or because I'm dead. Frankly, I'd rather be dead.

I've been on Paxil since I was 11 (I wanted to kill myself even back then), and it seemed to work in my early teen years, but even the higher dosages my doc put me on only takes the edge off. I guess we could try other medicines or other dosages, but what's the point? I would just be more miserable than I am now between now and the time we found the right medicine and dose, which could take who knows how long. 

I just felt like venting tonight instead of just keeping it to myself. Thanks for reading. 




 Mine was a cystoscopy. I'm female. I have frequent unexplained UTIs that are still a mystery, but last year the doc sent me to a specialist for this. They pretty much stick [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cystoscope-med-20050425.jpg) into your urethra and into your bladder. It's got a camera on it so they can see what's going on.

They did this with some lube, and that's it. No pain medication. The insertion was...something terrible. It hurt less once it was into the bladder, but it still hurt a lot and feeling it move around was just adding to the discomfort. Removal was another horror and peeing afterwards felt like I was pissing lava. 

And yes, it's normal to not receive any anesthetics for this.

What are yours? I'm waiting to read! 














 For some reason, I can't stand to take a bath in narrow or small bathtubs. Something about sitting in one with my knees touching the sides just makes me shudder. I also can't stand the thought of laying in one without water. Even seeing other people do it makes me cringe. 

I also can't take a bath with no bubble bath. Something about seeing the bottom of the tub while I'm in it bothers me. 




 I work at Wendys, and we're not supposed to void anything. That means if someone orders a single, and I enter it into the computer then they decide they don't want it, I have to void it, and this is one count against me. If my void percentage is up to a certain amount, I get written up. WTF? First of all, most voids aren't my fault. "I want a cheeseburger deluxe with extra pickles. Then a water. You know what, scratch the burger. I want a chicken sandwich." Ugh! Then the manager looks at the voids at the end of the day and says, "You lost us $25." How does this lose any money if the line hasn't even begun making the sandwich yet? Why do restaurants do this?  




 I'll start. My cousin told this joke:

Martha asked her mom, "Mommy, can I go outside and play with the boys?"
"No, darling, they're too rough."
Martha thought for a moment, and asked, "If I find a smooth one, can I play with him?"

My mom's friend thought it had something to do with pubic hair and said child abuse jokes weren't funny. 




 I work at Wendys. It was during lunch rush, and I owed someone $0.42 in change. I got out the $0.40, and started to unwrap a roll of pennies when my boss started yelling at me to be faster. She scolded me in front of the customers, and forgetting I still owed the man $0.02 I gave him his change and called the next customer. The next guy ordered for about 10 seconds when the last customer pops back over and puts the receipt in my face. "Young lady, this says my change is $0.42. You gave me $0.40." I had already closed the register, so we waited for the boss to bring the key so I could open the register again and give him his $0.02. 

Honestly, he cut back in front of a very long line and held us up during lunch rush for $0.02. The next guy in line did not look happy.

Edit: Yes, I noticed the typo in the title. 




 Warning, this pic is a little gory. She's recovered and is totally well now, but we have no idea how she ended up like this. Does it look like a bite? An impalement? The vet couldn't tell.

 I work in fast food, and this happened today.

A pair of young parents brought in 7 kids. The oldest might have been 10, the youngest looked to be only a couple months. While they ordered, they let the children run around and do as they please. Darting under the tables, making a bunch of noise, nearly knocking over other patrons, ect. I noticed while they were ordering they left the infant in a carrier way on the other side of the restaurant by himself. 

I thought this was bad enough, but it was worse when they actually sat down to eat. The parents watched as three of the kids actually climbed up on the neighboring tables and jumped off, again and again. The oldest kid pushed out a chair and stood one of the toddlers in the window, which was about a good 4 feet off the ground. The kid pounded on the window and giggled madly. 

When they left, I had chairs to put back, tables to push back together, handprints to clean off the window, footprints to clean off the tables, not to mention bits of food everywhere and drinks spilled all over the carpet. If I was the manager, I would have told them to leave long before they sat down. 




 This was in 2006. I was 17, and my aunt took me to the mall along with her 2-year-old son. She was going to get her eyebrows waxed, and asked me to keep an eye on Jakey (the kid, obviously) for her. We could go wherever we wanted, and she'd call me on my cell when she was finished. 

Let me just say that I wasn't all that keen on watching Jakey. He was a spoiled brat, and since he never listened to his mom, I doubted he'd listen to me. He threw a tantrum like any toddler when he didn't get his way, but unlike most toddlers, his tantrums mostly got him what he wanted. He'd even been known to call his parents "bitch" and "asshole" without any consequences. But I agreed to take him, and we wandered over to the Disney section. 

Another thing about Jakey, he loved escalators. His parents would ride them up and down with him again and again, and the Disney store was right next to the escalator. I was looking at the princess dresses (I've always been a Disney Princess fan) when Jakey started his "I want to ride the escalator!" fit. It started out as just whining, but he got louder and louder and began stamping his feet. People were looking over, but I was determined that unlike Jakey's parents, I would make him mind me. 

I said, "We'll go up and down the escalator in a minute, but if you keep throwing a fit about it, we won't go at all." He threw himself to the floor, immediately screaming and hitting his fists and legs on the ground. I heard people mutter about teen parents, but I ignored them and tried to pull him up. He climbed away from me and dove under the clothing rack. Of course several shirts fell to the floor and I worked to put them back as quick as I could. I didn't realize I would lose track of Jakey so fast. 

By the time I put the last article of clothing back, I had no idea where my cousin had gotten to. I was beginning to panic. What if I couldn't find him? What would my aunt say? My gaze shifted towards the escalators although I hadn't really thought of looking there. Jakey had been wearing a red shirt, I can remember that very clearly. I saw a woman heading up the escalator carrying a curly brown haired child with a red shirt. 

I instantly sprinted out of the Disney store, shouting for her to stop. I knocked several people out of the way running to the escalator, but the woman thankfully didn't try to run or anything. When I reached her, she put Jakey down and said, "I'm sorry, I just saw a little kid alone on the escalator and was worried he'd get hurt on it. I was going to take him to customer service." I didn't say anything, I just grabbed Jakey's hand and dragged him all the way to the elevators once we reached the top floor. I had decided there was no way in hell I'd let him enjoy another escalator ride after what he'd done. Finally my aunt called, and I got to release Jakey back into her supervision. 

I did tell her about the incident, but she just laughed it off. I don't think she realized how scared I'd been. Also, I'm sure the woman was telling the truth, I was just already so nervous kidnapping was the first thing that popped into my head. I know this isn't as scary as some stories, but it was a couple hours before I felt normal again. 

Oh, and at age 8, Jakey is still a big a brat as ever. 




 My dad and I were watching The Shining when I was about 10, and the part where Wendy sees the guy in the dog suit blowing the old man came on. I asked what they were doing, and dad swore he didn't know.

Oh, and "Fluffy went to the farm" stories don't count, since we've all had those. 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/x5y4u/on_obama_why_is_he_considered_a_black_guy_when_he/

First, it's true what the OP said. Obama is as much white as he is black. What's wrong with acknowledging this? It's just a fact. I myself have wondered why everyone says he's black when he's exactly the same amount white. I'd vote for him again regardless of his race, it's just something I've always wondered. They're claiming we're saying Obama's biracial because he *must* have some white in him to be successful! Yeah, sure. 0.o

Also, what's this about defining Obama's race for him? No one gets to decide what race they are. It's genetics. That's not something that is up to interpretation. You're whatever your genetics say.  














 And if you've been raped before, what would you do this time?

I probably wouldn't. I'd want to go to the ER to get tested for disease and such, but bothering with the police would be the last thing I would want to do. In fact, I probably wouldn't tell anyone. 




 (This is my sister's AMA on my account, since she isn't on Reddit)

http://i46.tinypic.com/21mhvn4.jpg

Info: Sat on a draft horse with no saddle or bridle, and fell off. Surgery was performed on Thursday, and she wasn't able to come home until Saturday. Pain meds were making her hallucinate and panic. She had a nerve block done before the operation, which she said was the worst pain she's ever felt, but the docs said it would have been worse without the nerve block. It will be about 6 months before she's able to walk without the help of a wheelchair or walker. Ask away. 




 I know it's been done, but I want to have trouble falling asleep tonight! 









 http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/uhfpx/im_still_waiting_for_reporters_to_follow_women/

The feeling I got from the quote was, "When we realize how creepy it is that men are following women into their locker rooms, maybe we'll also realize that it isn't right to allow the women to make the nude men feel uncomfortable, either." Maybe a little vengeful and sarcastic, but true.

But of course, SRS can't have that! You can't even joke about a woman's locker room and a reporter now, although *women actually are allowed into mens locker rooms.* 




 I am a cashier at Wendys. If you go through the drive-thru:

-Have your money ready. If you went through the screen right to the window, I can see not being ready, but if you waited in line, there is no damn excuse for not having your money out.

-Please understand that we're on a timer. If you take a long time to get to the window or take your time digging for change, I have people on my headset yelling at me because they think I'm holding you up or something. Having exact change or giving me change so you can get an even amount back is fine, but if you must dig through your purse or coin pouch to get it and I'm waiting on you, please just forget it and give me the nearest dollar so we can get you through and my boss will stop yelling at me through the headset.

-Please don't put your money in your mouth or lick your fingers before going through the bills. Would you want to handle money with spit on it?

-Please drive to the second window after you get your change as soon as you can. Again, if you sit there putting your money away, checking your make-up, putting everything back in your purse, my boss is on the headset telling me I'm taking too long.

-Please don't get upset if I don't laugh at your lame jokes or really return your small talk. I've been standing there for hours for minimum wage, or running between the window to the sink to do dishes between orders. I'm wet and miserable, especially if it's cold out and I can't close the window because you're talking. I will not be rude or pushy, but please understand I'm doing a job and my job is to get you through ASAP. If you sit there and try to joke with me, you're holding up the line, getting me into trouble. 

If you get your food at the counter...

-Please speak up! People are talking behind me, in front of me, beside me, and there are also the sounds of cooking and pots and pans hitting surfaces. I can't hear your murmuring and whispering. I'm also partly deaf in one ear, so if I tilt my head towards you, speak into that side of my head.

-Go slowly. Fast food computers are shitty, and I often have to hit the buttons a couple times before your order is entered. While you're going on about your Frosty, I'm still on your burger trying to get your preferences entered in.

-Don't come up to the register without me calling you up. In the afternoons there are no runners, so I have to collect the food and put it on the tray myself before I can take another order. This makes me nervous, and the person waiting for their food is now pushed into the wall. Wait until I call for the next person.

-Be nice! Believe me, I want you to get your food quickly as much as you do so I can move on. If you say, "Excuse me, I think I ordered a large and you rang in a small," and you're polite, I'll probably fix it without charging you the difference. But if you push the other patrons aside and act like a smart ass, you can bet I will charge you the difference.

Any other tips, Redditors? 




 -If they start their post with "going to be buried, but..." It's so annoying. Annoying enough that I downvote your ass.

-Horrible spelling and grammar. I also downvote a comment if they're just replying to correct someone's spelling and grammar. 

-Insulting someone. If you can't convey your thoughts without insulting people, DOWNVOTE! 

However, I never downvote someone just because they offend me or I disagree with them. 









 For those who aren't familiar, the idea is that since a woman can 100% control when she's going to have kids by using condoms, the pill, abortion, etc men should have more options than just condoms. They can break, some men have reactions to the latex or the lube, whatever. A financial abortion would allow a man to tell a pregnant woman early on that he won't be around financially for the child, and she won't be able to go after him for child support. Of course, this would have to be done very early on, when she can still have an elective abortion if she decides. He wouldn't be able to tell his 7-month-along girlfriend that he's skipping town. 

This does present some problems, one being that the child might be living in poverty if the mother keeps it and can't afford it (which no child should have to do). We also have to think about how difficult abortions can be for women. They're expensive, painful, and possibly emotionally wrecking. Also, for some women, abortions can be difficult to get, especially in red states.

I support FA in theory, but we have the above kinks to work out. I just think that if a woman has the total power to never have children even if birth control fails, so should a man. A child is a huge responsibility, and "parenthood by choice, not by chance" should apply to everyone, regardless of sex.  




 Any horror stories at all.

Today, I had someone come through the drive-thru with no pants on. She was a very big woman and I'm pretty sure I saw her labia. 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/tijog/13_year_old_girl_dies_and_by_donating_her_organs/

Okay, anyone who donates organs should be admired, but there is some crazy shit going on here. I love how they're claiming it's because the girl is female, when the original comment said nothing at all about the donor's sex. Not to mention all the comments about the doctors being men. How do they know some of the docs weren't women?  









 http://ravallirepublic.com/news/state-and-regional/article_244325fd-723e-5739-9cb1-8f9c10f526bf.html

Come on Missoula, that's pathetic. 




 Some TMI details: I woke up at around 4 AM with severe cramping. I figured it was probably a miscarriage, as I had been experience some light bleeding for the past two days. I was almost 9 weeks in. But I had work that day and since I wasn't able to call in 12 hours ahead, I would need a doctor's excuse. I couldn't afford the copay to see a doctor, so I just decided to go in. It was very painful, but I took a Vicodin I had left over for my wisdom teeth and tried using a pad. The pad was full in about an hour, so I just decided to wear one of my grandpa's leftover Depends. (Yeah, weird, but what else was I going to do?) 

I went in about three hours into my miscarriage. The Vicodin was helping, but it was still in pretty terrible pain. I think everyone knew I wasn't feeling good because they were really helpful, and I think even the costumers knew something was up because I was tipped extremely well. 

The next day my mom lent me the money to see the doctor, and she gave me a doctor's excuse for that day. I was bleeding a lot less, but it was still nice to have a day off to rest. She did confirm it was a miscarriage, and it took a few days to completely pass. 

Not sure how I would prove this, I didn't take a picture of my dead embryo or anything. But when I told my boss what happened when I went into work next, she was pretty shocked I came in in that condition, so maybe others would have questions? 




 http://loop21.com/life/marissa-alexander-stand-your-ground-against-black-people

The article is about the stand your ground law and the controversy surrounding it and Trayvon Martin's murder, but I'm posting it here as a gender issue.

What happened to Marissa here is something we usually attribute to men: She was in an abusive relationship, fired a gun into the ceiling to scare off her husband who she said threatened to kill her and began to charge her, and is now in jail because her husband claimed she tried shooting at him and his children(from another marriage). 

I thought I'd post this because it's another case of the wrong person being arrested in a domestic abuse case, even if it's the woman in this case. I can see having her in custody for awhile since she supposedly fired a gun at someone, but why not her husband too? He has a history of domestic violence, and threatened murder.  




 My cat is 13-14 years old, and I've noticed for months she's been peeing on the carpet. I'm at the end of my rope. I've tried new litter, new litter boxes, even taken her to the vet to see if anything is wrong (nothing is). She uses the box sometimes, but I've seen her pee on the floor with my own eyes. I've tried to clean it up as best I can, but I think the carpet is ruined, it always smells again an hour after I've scrubbed it with urine neutralizer. As I've said, I'm about to lose it. I have no idea what else to do. Has anyone else's cat done this? I am going to replace the carpet, but it's sort of pointless if she's just going to keep doing it. 




 All my examples are strangers thinking our family needs assistance.

The first is me. I don't remember this, but I've heard my parents tell it. When I was about 5, I asked my mom for a PBJ sandwich, but she said no because it would fill me up and I wouldn't eat my dinner. So I simply went a few houses over and asked the neighbors working outside if I could have a sandwich. They made me one, but since they didn't know my family well, they followed me home to ask my mom if we had enough money for food.

The second time my sister was in 2nd grade, and told the teacher we didn't have anything to eat in the house. The truth was that my parents were on a health food kick and there wasn't anything she wanted to eat, so to her, we had no food. We got a call from the counselor asking if we needed help applying for food stamps.

The third example is about my cousin. In high school he refused to wear anything but these ratty worn out pair of boots. My aunt got a call from the teacher offering to buy him a new pair of shoes if they were going through a tough time. 














 Also, my account is now 27 hours old. Why is it still not letting me have a shop? 









 The Most Interesting Man in the World. It's never been funny. Ever. 




 http://hamptonroads.com/2009/10/military-men-are-silent-victims-sexual-assault

We were discussing the current controversy about women in the military and having to "expect" to be raped in the equality subreddit, and someone said it's a common hazing technique on both men and women, even though the spotlight has only been on the female victims. The link above claims 22,000 men were sexually assaulted compared to 14,000 women. If this is true, it's another example of only the women getting the attention and help when the men need it just as much. I thought it was interesting. Too bad not many people realize it. 




 A Clockwork Orange has been one of my favorites since I was 15. I love the original Picture of Dorian Gray from the 40s(and have since high school). I recently saw the original Doctor Zhivago, and loved it. 

I hate the stereotype that teenagers and people in their 20s only like the shit rappers put out. A lot of us have better taste than that. 




 I've had this dream several times. I am in my grandparents' old house. It might be important to state that I miss this house very much. I felt more at home here than I did my own house, and I moved away when I was 11. Well, anyway, I am in the bathroom, and I plan to take a bath. But the bath tub is filthy, so I decide not to. I then go to the sink to brush my teeth, but the sink is disgusting too. At this point, my grandpa tries to come into the bathroom. I am naked or in a state of undress, so I try to stop him. The door is suddenly unlocked (it was locked before), so I have to push back against it. My grandma suffered from alzheimers for about 10 years before his death, so several times he'd try to come into the bathroom on you, not understanding why the door wouldn't open and why you wouldn't let him in, but he was never this bad while he lived in the house I was dreaming about. 


I'd normally consider it to be just a weird dream, but I'd have it several times. It might also be worth mentioning that I am fickle about bath tubs. I will only bathe in a clean, familiar one. In places like hotels, I will only take showers. 




 Ever. He's nearly 23.

I thought this was something that happened to every guy. Any other guy ever been this lucky? 









 I just want to share this wonderful thing I saw on court TV(which I usually hate). First off, this man and woman came into court, both saying the other was guilty of domestic violence. Of course, the audience automatically sided with the woman, even though the woman had no proof he ever beat her. Lucky for the man, he had police reports proving the woman was arrested for domestic violence three times. Then the woman claimed he owed her thousands in child support. The man retorted, "No, I don't, and here's the proof." He had brought several receipts proving he didn't owe a dime. He also showed the judge a text the woman sent him, basically saying, "I'm never letting you see your kids, HAHAHAHA!" So the judge awarded him *several thousand dollars* for his mental suffering, since she had kept him from the kids for months. The man got everything he was there for, the woman was proven to be a lying bitch and by the end of the show, the audience was cheering for the judge's decision.

I hope the man realizes how lucky and smart he was to keep all that paperwork. Without it, there is no doubt the woman would have been believed.

It was Judge Joe Brown, or one of those.
 














 I was put on Paxil 10mg at age 11. I felt better until about 19, I guess. I went to the doctor every 6 months for a med check. The doc always asked if it was still working, and I said yes until I was about 21 even though I had been feeling steadily worse for 2 years. I'm not sure why I waited so long to say anything, but I don't really like to talk about wishing I was dead to people, even people who are there to help. I just said it felt like it was slowing down, so I was moved to 30mg, then 40. I was taking that for a year and it really didn't feel any difference, but I didn't say anything and was on 40 for about a year. Then in October I found out I was pregnant, and since Paxil has a bad birth defect risk I was weaned off it and onto Buspar. I ended up miscarrying at about 6 weeks, but I'm still on the Buspar. Now ever since around the new year I've been feeling pretty crappy. I live out in the middle of nowhere (and continuing my lengthy job quest), and it takes a tank of gas to go anywhere, so I've really been unable to leave the house, which I'm sure isn't helping matters any. I'm wondering if the Buspar simply isn't as good as Paxil, or if it wouldn't matter in the first place since Paxil was losing its effectiveness. I know it's pretty stupid to not share much with the doctor besides, "Eh, I need more" but it takes so much energy, mostly emotional, to voice it to anyone. That's probably why I wouldn't get too far with a therapist either. It's not that I'm too private, it just takes so much out of me to discuss it. 

This was mostly a rant, but I'd gladly hear from others who feel the same. 




 My entire childhood I remember my mom yelling at my dad for going right from the shower to the bed without drying off at all, and my boyfriend only dries his face off. Then he pulls on his clothes while still soaking wet. I cannot stand getting dressed if I am the least bit wet from the bath. And isn't getting your clothes on difficult if they keep sticking to you? Someone explain this to me. 




 I especially want to hear from males, since it seems fairly common in females.

Anyone see Monty Python's Life of Brian? For the scene where Graham Chapman opens the window naked, the director Terry Jones said, "We can tell you aren't Jewish mate," and they applied a rubber band to imitate the look. Not a very good job, IMO! Anyway, yep, nice foreskin. 




 As I'm nearly impossible to get to orgasm, I usually just go until I get tired. By then I'm too exhausted to do anything but lay there. 




 Females: Does you labia hang low or are they small?

Males: Does your foreskin hang past the glans? (Circumcised men N/A, obviously)

Females: Can you orgasm with vaginal stimulation only?

Males: How long does it take from the moment of climax for your erection to totally go away?  




 When I was about 10, my parents rented a room with one of those doors that lead into the next room if you unlock both doors. All night someone knocked on the other side. Both my parents were too freaked out to aggressively pound back on the door, and they were too nervous to even walk to the office and complain. I don't remember being that scared, but maybe there was more going on than what I can remember.

Whoever it was, they were dedicated. They knocked softly on that door for hours. 




 Everyone posts the tl;dr version of their story, and the ones with the most upvotes must tell the whole version. 




 I ate some sausage for breakfast, maybe it was undercooked. 




 I'm 22, and have no idea what I want to do in life. I was in nursing school but I realized although the pay would be good, I'd absolutely hate every second of it, and honestly, I'm squeamish. But I have always loved history. I was disappointed in my high school history classes because they were so very basic. My dad has a history degree, but he's never done anything with it, he delivers packages, but I've liked reading through his old school books over the years. If I invested a lot of time and money in this degree, could I do anything with it? I know you can teach, work in a museum, etc, but is it the same as other non-scientific degrees? Tons of people wanting 2 openings and the rest having to move on to something else? I know the classes would be wonderful education wise, but I really can't spend thousands of dollars on something that won't lead to a career. Thanks for your input! 




 Not sure how I would prove this, so I'll just include some curious details. My doctor doesn't know why this is happening. I've tried fiber. I'm anemic so I'm on iron tables. Iron tablets can cause constipation, so this is weird as well. I even had doctors notes for my teachers telling them to let me spend as much time in the bathroom as I might need. The "attacks" come on quite quickly and I can be in the bathroom from 10 minutes to half an hour. I might have a solid bowel movement once out of every 5 times I go to the bathroom. The rest is pure liquid. The doc suspected IBS, but nothing I was given worked to help it. It's made trying to work quite a challenge. 









 As the only loser that still plays Sims 1, sometimes I run into old Sim sites that have turned into a page selling insurance. 




 I never understood how a chemical imbalance in your brain could make you feel worthless or hopeless. I know evolution plays a part as well, what is that about? 




 The true answer is that the economy is crap and no one will hire me. It's difficult enough getting a damn interview. But I can't say that, what do I say instead? 









 I just ordered my Diva cup. I know it takes a bit of learning to properly use it, but do you have any tips? I also know I have to be careful what soap I use and how I should boil it after each period. How long should this cup last? Anything else?

 I've whispered to myself for years. It's usually the last few words of a sentence I've just said. For instance, I might tell my dad about something that happened during the day. Let's say my story ended with,"So then, he finally left!" For about thirty seconds, I'll whisper under my breath, "He finally left, he finally left," until something else catches my attention or someone brings up that I'm whispering to myself again. Sometimes if I think of something in my head, like, "Oh yeah, I have to feed the dog," I'll whisper, "Feed the dog, feed the dog," over and over without even realizing it. But sometimes, I will whisper things that I haven't even thought of. This morning, I was sitting while putting my shoes on and thinking about a movie I wanted to watch. My sister says, "You know, that's creepy." "What's creepy?" "You whispering over and over again that dad told you to let the dog out." The scary thing? Dad had said no such thing to me. He was still in bed. I wasn't even thinking of the dog. What's even more concerning is that it's happening more frequently. I'll whisper things no one said; things I'm not even thinking about.
Maybe soon it'll be on the news that I've killed my family with a steak knife while maniacally repeating the lyrics to a song. 




 This isn't homework or anything, I'm just curious. I love history and all the explanations I can find are too wordy.  




 One of my aunt's friends. She says using a lot of water is wasteful, so she only showers once a week, and even then, she doesn't use any soap. She doesn't brush her teeth and only washes her clothes in water(after several wears). Anyway, she was telling us toilet paper is bad for the environment. She said she didn't use it unless she had diarrhea. She also never flushes the toilet unless there is poop.

 Remember, I'm 5, and have no idea why I should have an opinion on this, and why politicians do. 

Also, when did the current calender we use come into use, year-wise? I know they didn't say, "Okay, Jesus is here, this is year one." Obviously that came later.  




 I understand you might cry if you need to get something out of your eye, but what purpose does crying when you're hurt or because you're sad serve?

Oh, I don't mean why do people cry, I mean why is that a response that's possible? 









 Just want to state that I'm one of the few women who supports this. 



























































 Underwear means panties, bras, and socks in this case. 

I only wear underwear for one day. Every so often I change them twice a day. Bras usually once a day, but never more than twice. Socks get changed every day.

I wash them either when I run out of clothes or the laundry basket gets full.

Taken from Askmen. I was a little shocked to discover how some of the men admitted to wearing their underwear a few days in a row... 









 So, in class we recently read Medea. For those who don''t know it, here's a quick summary: Jason leaves his wife, Medea for the chance to marry a princess. He owes all his success to her (Years ago, Jason had to get a Golden Fleece to prove himself to a king, and Medea basically did all the work for him) so she felt very betrayed. She spends the entire play wondering how to take her revenge, and decides she will kill both their children solely to hurt Jason, and leave the city to escape. 

The professor asked who we felt was responsible for the death of the children, Jason or Medea. I thought it was obviously Medea. Jason was an asshole, but Medea is the one who purposefully killed her kids to get back at him. To my surprise, a good number of my classmates (all female) answered that Jason was responsible for driving Medea to the edge. If he hadn't treated her so poorly she wouldn't have been in the position to feel she needed to murder her children for revenge. 

I just sat there in awe. I couldn't believe a class of adult women weren't blaming the person who took the knife and physically murdered her children. No, it was the fault of Jason for pissing her off. A few choice quotes I remember...

"Jason obviously wasn't respecting Medea and she felt she had to act out to prove herself."

"If Jason hadn't left her none of this would have happened. He's just as responsible for the deaths of his children as his wife."

"Maybe Medea is the murderer, but Jason as good as killed his children when he left his wife."

Next the teacher asked us if we felt Medea was evil. The female students mostly agreed she wasn't evil, she was just hurt. Jason is the true evil one for driving her to such extreme actions. 

A few male students did say they felt Medea was more responsible, but Jason did have some of the blame. A few other female students didn't say anything, so I am hoping they were too stunned to speak, as I was.

It's true that in the ancient Greek world women had very few rights, but Medea's actions are all on her. I wonder what response I would gotten if I had turned the tables and said, "I bet Jason only left because she sounds like a crazy bitch." 














 Before I start my story, I have to explain something. I've never been afraid of dolls. I was allowed to watch Chucky movies when I was little, and I'd go to bed in a room full of dolls without the slightest bit of fear. I've also had some really creepy dolls growing up and they never caused me any discomfort. 

My mom bought this doll at a flea market around 2009 for me. She said the lady she bought it from let it go for a measly $10. This was $90 less than she was asking for, and apparently she didn't take a lot haggling to agree. 

That night I put the doll in a corner and went to bed. Right away something was off. I didn't like the fact that the doll was looking right at me. As I said, I love dolls and I have literally dozens of them facing me all around my room. But for some reason, this one was unsettling. Finally I fell asleep.  I dreamed that she appeared beside my bed. She didn't move or say anything, but it was a very unpleasant dream. Of course when I woke up she hadn't moved from where I placed her the night before. 

Later that year I moved out of my parents' house and took the doll with me (I took most of my dolls with me). You're probably wondering why I didn't leave the one giving me the willies behind. It was because I thought I was being really silly. And I didn't want to hurt my mom's feelings. It was really a nice doll and she thought I would like it. 

Anyway, the doll was putting off the same vibes in the house I was renting with roommates. I eventually put the doll into my closet because I learned she didn't have to be staring at me to make me uncomfortable; she only had to be in the room. It didn't help. I imaged the closet door slowly creeping open at night while I slept. 

The roommate situation didn't work out (nothing to do with the doll though) so I moved back in with my parents. By this time I was used to being creeped out as I slept so I just put the doll in the corner there she stayed for a few years. 

Only it got a little worse. I began hearing voices whispering in my room. I could never make out what was being said, but it would always happen when I was trying to go to bed. I kept having that same dream where I would look over to the side of my bed and there she would be, staring at me. This kept up until 2013, when I moved in with my boyfriend. 

My boyfriend *hates* dolls and flat out forbade me to bring any into his house. He calls them creepy demon portals. So I left them all with my parents. I didn't have the dream anymore and I didn't think of the doll again until this summer, 2014. My boyfriend had to leave the state because of a family crisis for awhile, so I moved back in with my parents. 

When I entered my room, I didn't notice anything funny. I didn't really notice any of the dozens of dolls around my room. I just laid down and went to sleep. For the first time in forever, I had the dream again. This time I heard the whispering in the dream, which I never had before. It always occurred as I was going to sleep, but I didn't hear it once I had drifted off.

When I woke up I noticed the doll was gone. Very concerned, I asked my mother what the deal was. She said my grandma had stayed over and slept in my room, but was so creeped out about the doll, she asked my mom to move it into another room. So the doll was now in my sister's vacant bedroom. (My sister was living elsewear.) 

This part really freaked me out. I always thought maybe the voices and the dream were products of suggestion. The doll was creepy, so thinking of her created voices in my imagination and some bad dreams. But why would that happen when I hadn't even noticed the doll was missing? I hadn't been thinking of her at all when I went to sleep. Another big red flag is that my grandma was creeped out by it too. I've collected dolls since I was little, and my grandma had never before had an issue with any of the dolls in my room. Just the Native American doll. 

Here's a picture of the doll:

http://i.imgur.com/5cP0eAj.png

I tried to do some research on it, like if it was mass producted and if anyone else found them creepy. I can't find anything at all. 

One last thing I should add: I never named the doll. I always name my dolls. It's just that I've been a little put off by this one, so I never bothered to name her. My boyfriend joked that she's probably just annoyed I didn't give her a name.  









 Having just watched the movie, I was going through imdb's forum page for it, and came across this:

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067093/board/thread/112869960

Basically, since Fiddler has more 1 ratings than other musicals like Oklahoma and West Side Story, it's because antisemitics gave it a 1.

It just reminded me of Tumblrites claiming anyone who didn't like 12 Years a Slave was racist. Nope, there is no other reason to dislike a movie than that.

For the record, I loved Fiddler, but still. Fucking stupid. 




 My cat is 17/18 years old, and she was declawed about 15 years ago. (Not my fault. I was 10, so I didn't make the decision myself). She's been driving me insane from her avoidance of the litter box. I had to completely replace my living room carpet and replace it with hard wood so it would be easier to clean. Even my vet couldn't give me much advice besides trying different litter.

I recently learned declawing can cause cats to do this. It certainly fits with the time frame. All of this began shortly after her declawing, although she used the litter box more than she didn't. Now, she almost never uses it. Now that I know the cause, is there anything I can do to make it better for her? 

The vet said sometimes people put their pets down for their litter box issues, but that's out of the question. I won't put my pets down for anything besides serious illness. 





























 Yes, I am using the Nattlebane. I stand in front of the roots and slash at them, but nothing happens. Any ideas?

 If the things didn't sell, stores wouldn't carry them. 

I'm sure everyone has heard about how bad they are for your vagina, so what's your reason? 




 I'm in Ohio, if that matters. 



















 I'm sure you've seen it on TV. These women carry babies to term (or nearly to term) without showing signs of pregnancy. No missed periods, no weight gain, and no belly. 

I have to say what shocks me the most is how fast these women start worrying about the baby that just fell out of them without warning. I can understand if they love the child later, but how do they jump right from worrying about themselves to worrying about a baby they just learned existed? 

If it were me, I'm not saying I flat out wouldn't care if the baby died, but I would be far more certain about my own health. After I was stable, I might ask, "Oh, and how did the baby turn out? Is it okay?" But in this show they begin showing concern almost right away. The psychology intrigues me.  




 Anyone remember these?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyewitness_%28TV_series%29

I remember watching these in elementary school. I loved them! I'm 25 now, and I admit to watching them still. Many of them are on Youtube, and I even bought a few of them in VHS form from the library when they were selling everything that wasn't a DVD. I've also picked up a few from Goodwill. 

My favorites are Monster and Weather. 




 I'm 25 and female, if that matters. 

I have very weak enamel, so I buy those bubblegum fluoride rinse bottles and swish it around in my mouth after brushing twice a day. Does this help or is it a waste of money? Thanks. 




 We have the unpopular opinions threads, let's do the opposite! 









 Please note that I only mean vet services such as emergency surgery and other things like that, not routine services like vaccines, neutering, etc.

I would agree that you should only adopt a pet if you can afford to feed it quality food, take it to the vet for routine procedures, spend time with it, etc. All of this can affect the quality of life for a pet greatly.

But for shelter animals, millions of them die a year. A much smaller number will ever need surgery or medical attention beyond what's routine. I just feel like it's better for those animals to spend their lives with a good owner and be put down if it gets cancer than to spend their short lives in a shelter because the owners who might have adopted them decided not to, because they knew they couldn't afford hundreds or thousands in emergency vet care.

In an ideal world, I'd agree that you should only adopt a pet if you have thousands to spend on it in emergency care. But as it is, many adoptable animals are dying in shelters anyway. May as well give them a chance until they get a chronic or expensive disease.

Am I making sense? I did have a late night last night, so if I need to clear anything up, I will. 



















 I seem to remember Hermione's parents being in Diagon Alley in one of the earlier books. Is that something my brain made up, or does anyone else remember it?

 Admittedly, this was a several years ago, but I'm now looking at it in a new context.

I was 20 years old taking some technical classes with other adults. One day we were learning PowerPoint, so the teacher had us make a slideshow on whatever we wanted. Now, you know how most classes start out with an introduction session? Tell everyone your name, age, why you're there, how your family is, etc. Well, a good 3/4 of the class had kids. I noticed when we were watching the presentations at the end of class that virtually all the parents had made slideshows on their kids. It struck me as odd that not a single one of them did a show on any outside interest besides their kids. Now, I'm not saying my show was great; I did mine on the last imperial family of Russia, which I'm sure bored everyone to tears, but at least I had a hobby as a history lover to do a project on. 

I mentioned this to my mom when I got home that day in amusement, and she said, "Well, they probably didn't have anything else to make a project about. Think about it. Since they're in a technical school trying to get skills they've probably been working crappy jobs and trying to raise children. They likely spend most of their time working and parenting. Not a lot of time for outside interests there."

That just hit me as being so sad. Now, I'm not saying every single one of those parents had nothing else to do a project on. I'm sure a few of them were like, "I'm doing a project on my son, he's hilarious, this'll be awesome! And more interesting than doing it on my stamp collection!" but I'm willing to bet a great many of them had nothing else. 




 I had to buy new supplies for her since my parents need those for their cats, but I am taking one of her mouse toys, so at least that will be familiar to her. Anything else? 
























 It's been brought to my attention that sometimes I will utter something under my breath, but when someone mentions it, I can never remember what I was saying. My boyfriend said I also use a very strange voice when I do so. The best way he can describe it is a horror movie whisper. 

Might be relevant: I was diagnosed with severe depression when I was very young - around 10 years old. I was on Paxil for 13 years, and am currently on Effexor. 

Anyone have any insight? 




 I've noticed this in many threads lately. 

Person: I think pedophilia is probably just an orientation like heterosexuality or homosexuality. They didn't choose it and it isn't unnatural.

SRS: Shitlord! You think it's perfectly okay to rape kids! You think "child" is a gender!

Person: No, I didn't say it wasn't morally wrong or shouldn't be illegal, I just said that it's another natural orientation that pops up. That doesn't mean it should be acceptable in society, though, no one is saying that. Feelings are different from actions.

SRS: Benned! God, what is it with Reddit and being tolerant of child rape? 














 These are all paraphrased:

(How do you feel about the fact that your son, since he was born in the 80s, probably received no anesthesia at all?) "If I didn't see it, I don't care. He was fine when he was brought back to me."

(You don't own him or his penis.) "I beg to differ. Until he's 18, his penis belongs to me."

"I'm sure it hurt, but I bet it was nothing compared to how giving birth to him felt, so he shouldn't complain."

"Circumcise them all! It's what men deserve for the amount of raping they do." To be fair, this might have been a troll. There wasn't a single person, even pro-circ people, who didn't jump on them for this one.

And the worst one, IMO, just from the ickiness:

"I had my son circumcised because it just looks better." (Isn't it creepy that you care how attractive your son's penis is?) "Maybe, but I just want him to be sexy. Sex is important to women." 




 I know these threads are common, but each one offers hours of entertainment!

Last I heard this was being expanded into a full movie, but I've never heard anything else about it.  




 Walter Mitty Syndrome is when you daydream about yourself being in another life as much as or even more than you pay attention to your real life. The name comes from a short story where the main character thinks up exciting scenarios for himself in his head when he's bored. I don't think it's a formal diagnosis, but it's a symptom of narcissistic personality disorder, and it's something some depressed people tend to do also.

I just recently realized I've done this for as long as I can remember. Even as a child I would daydream about a life where I was happy. I'm almost 25, and I swear I do it more and more as time passes. In my current fantasy I am happily married with children and money isn't an issue. I get to travel anywhere I want and live however I want. It's scary sometimes how often I find myself in my fantasy. Sometimes I don't even know I'm doing it, it's like it happens on its own. Much of the time I wish I could just slip out of myself and into the fantasy forever. 




 My boyfriend regularly brushes with mouthwash as if it were toothpaste. Does it clean about the same, or is it a bad idea?  




 I want to have a study/source on hand about men circumcised in adulthood and say sensitivity is lessened. The more scientific, the better. Anyone have anything? 









 This happens after exposure to semen specifically however I have not really experimented enough to determine that this is the cause.  The core of my body just involuntarily tenses up and twitches repeatedly for at least 30 seconds.

Oh, and I'm sorry if this is the wrong place for this, I just didn't know where else to go to ask. 



















 Both college and work tend to make me even more depressed, since I'm going to college full time, and I also have to work. I feel like I have no time for myself, and I'm so miserable that there's hardly any point to being alive because I am getting no enjoyment out of anything. Right now since it's the holidays I have some free time, but it's just going to start up again next month. Anyone else who hates working and college have any tips? 




 People under 18 are legally considered children, and therefor cannot vote (except in one city in Maryland that has a 16 voting age for local elections), drink, drive in some places, smoke, or sign contracts, etc. Even if an individual proves mature, they still are not given any rights until they turn 18. 

So why are teenagers considered mature enough to be treated as adults when they commit a crime? The undeveloped brain is used to deny them privileges adults have, so why doesn't the undeveloped brain argument keep them from facing adult consequences?  









 I only know a small number of them since I am a newish player, but the "To Kill an Empire" quest along with the ones preceding and following it had a lot of twists and turns and was pretty entertaining.

 I was on r/morbidreality, and there was a video of a soldier stepping on a landmine and losing both his legs and an arm. In the comments, people were talking about how for many soldiers, after stepping on a landmine the first thing they want to know is whether their genitals are okay. Their limbs come second. A few other men commented and said they'd rather lose their legs than their genitals. 

As a woman, I would rather lose all my sex organs than my limbs. This includes vagina, clitoris, uterus, everything. Am I just an exception or do most women agree? 




 Let me just explain my feelings. I know I only feel like I want to die because of my depression. I know if I was mentally healthy I probably wouldn't feel this way, but that doesn't change the fact that I am completely miserable and this probably won't change.

I've had depression ever since I was 9 years old at least, and was put on Paxil at age 10-11, and am now 24 years old. It takes the edge off and I've had some happy moments but overall, living is exhausting and I've yet to see how it's worth experiencing. 

Right now I'm in college for history. I know job prospects in that area are pretty much nil, but it's one of the few things I enjoy. Despite liking history, I hate college. I'm doing it because without it I'll likely be working fast food the rest of my life (which might happen anyway). Despite loving history, I hate going to college. It just makes me more depressed and exhausted. Throw in having to work at the same time, and I'm failing to see the point in my continued existence. I have to do something I hate for years in order to try to secure a better future that I don't think will be worth living anyway? 

I guess my point is that when I mention this, people just say, "Well, you only feel that way because you have depression." Yeah, that's probably true. But so what? If I decide to live my life and die a miserable old woman, at the end of the day, I was completely miserable my whole life. Does it really make a difference that I was miserable because of a mental illness? I don't think so. 

Please understand, I'm not typing this on the edge of a 5 story building about to throw myself off. I intend to finish college since I've already worked so hard at it. I just think it's unfair to say someone is "only" feeling suicidal because of a mental illness. Those feelings are still very real and I don't see the point of a continued existence if that person is through being miserable and wants to die, even if it is caused by mental illness.

One final argument: Yes, mental illness can be treated, but not often cured. Even if it's being treated, it's still there and still having an affect.  




 I have a cat named Lydia who's about 15-17 years old. Besides being a bit skinny (she always has been) she's been in good health and acts the same as she always has. It's that she's getting so old I know it's coming.

Lately I've been very anxious about finding her dead, or coming home from college on the weekends to learn she's died. I even freeze up a little when I see my mother has called or texted. I know no one ever knows how long their loved ones will be around. She could die tomorrow or she could be around another few years; there is no way of knowing. 

I am only 24 years old, so Lydia has been part of most of my life. When she goes, I honestly don't know if I could go on. The silly part is worrying about it before she's even sick or showing signs of illness. She seems as healthy as ever, but I'm still twisting myself into an anxious meltdown. Anyone else in a situation even remotely close to this? 




 I can't seem to understand it. 




 I'm of the opinion that if you had lots of money, parenthood could be enjoyable. You'd only have to be there for the good parts. Don't want to get up in the night? Hire a nanny. Don't feel like cleaning poop off the wall? Nanny. Kid being a bastard? Call the nanny to take him away.

I'd be open to having kids if I could have a nanny. That way, I only have to see the kid when I want to.

He then said, "If you want socialist medicine, get out of this country." I mentioned the USA already had some socialism with the roads, police, schools, libraries, etc. His response? That's not socialism, since not everyone pays in. The best part is when he agreed with the distinction of socialism and communism I put up, but it was still wrong somehow. And of course, how Sweden no longer has socialized healthcare.

What's even better is that another person who claimed to be pro-life chimed, and was okay with people with pre-existing conditions not getting healthcare because it'll drive up HIS costs. I guess it's true what they say. Pro-life until birth. After that, screw you.

I only got half the conversation because I copied it for my friend to laugh at, but decided you guys might appreciate it. 




 A few weeks ago I had a colposcopy. If you don't know what they is, they take a chunk out of your cervix with this bastard: http://www.wemed1.com/catalog/ob-tis.jpg

Predictably, it hurt like hell. They don't numb the area at all, they just take a chunk out. This is to test for cancer cells after an abnormal pap smear. After this was done I felt like I had to vomit and actually dry heaved a little. I had never felt my stomach react to pain like this before. I got very pale and the doctor made me lie down for awhile. As I was expecting, a few days later they said I needed some of my cervix removed using LEEP. http://www.webmd.com/cancer/cervical-cancer/loop-electrosurgical-excision-procedure-leep-for-abnormal-cervical-cell-changes

They basically take a hot wire and slice through your cervix with it. After the terrible colposcopy I was understandably worried about the pain. The doc said, "Oh, don't worry, we use a local anesthetic. Now, even though part of your cervix is gone, you'll still be able to have children. Preterm labor might be an issue, but-" 

I interrupted, "I know you use an anesthetic, but I have a pretty bad anxiety disorder, and after the miserable experience with the colposcopy, I am a nervous wreck knowing this is coming up. I'm even nervous about the anesthetic injection. Can you sedate me somehow?" 

She answered, "We can get you a Valium. Luckily, you don't need all your cervix for pregnancy and childbirth, so removing some of it won't hurt too much in that category."

I wanted to talk about the second colposcopy that you need a couple months after LEEP to check up on everything, and whether that would be more or less painful since the cervix has already gone through some trauma. She gave short answers on that, but kept going on about how pregnancy and childbirth would still be possible.

Here's what annoyed me: Couldn't she see I was way more interested in the level of pain I had to expect, and how I needed some sort of sedation, even mild to calm me down during? I wasn't asking questions at all about pregnancy or birth, but that's what she kept going back to. I understand that might be what most women want to know, and that's fine, the doctor should discuss that with them, but that isn't what I needed info about. 

The kicker is that I am not even fully childfree. I am open to having a kid someday (just one), but the pain and anxiety facing me was much more immediate and real than childbirth complications. 









 I can't decide between these:

1) The feeling of dread simply living can give you. Remember that feeling in your stomach you'd get as a kid when you know tomorrow you'd have to go to the doctor and get a shot? Sometimes I get that feeling just knowing I have things to do the next day.

2) Rumination. Living through a bad experience once is quite enough, I don't need to think about it years after the fact.

3) Maybe this is more anxiety, but I can't handle things. Something that would only give most people mere annoyance for a couple days will turn me into a hyperventilating mess. Inconveniencing others will make me feel so guilty I'm sorry I exist. 









 I knew already he was pro-circ, but I still considered myself a fan because I think he's funny and I agree with him on a lot of things, especially religion and politics.

But on his show tonight, Real Time With Bill Maher, he interviewed Billy Crystal and the topic of circumcision came up. Bill said things like, "Aren't you glad you're circumcised? Foreskins are so ugly, they ruin porn." 

I am honestly not sure if I can continue being a fan or not. I've sent him a polite Twitter explaining that he should educate himself on the matter, but I am not naive, I know he isn't likely to read it. I just hope enough of his fans can write and maybe he'll take notice. He prides himself on being pro-science, maybe he'll change his mind with evidence. But I sort of doubt it. He's kind of an ass, I acknowledged he was an ass when I was a big fan. Then again, he does say the USA should be more like Scandinavia, and Scandinavia is having a lot of pushes to ban RIC. He could notice.

Anyway, if you're a fan, write him. 




 My boyfriend mentioned this happening twice in his life (that he's noticed) during an especially big BM. Is this kind of thing common?

 A store near my house has a donation box for clothes and shoes type things for the Special Olympics. I threw a bag of clothes into the back of my car and drove over there. After I tossed the clothes in a saw a blanket sort of wadded up in my trunk and decided to throw that in too.

After I got home mom informed me she laid that blanket out in the back of my car to transport a goat to the fair. Afterwards she wadded it up and threw it in the trunk to deal with later.

I hope they don't think someone did that on purpose to be an asshole. 




 * I'm sure we've all seen it on shows like America's Funniest Home Videos. Someone videotapes their kid attempting to pour milk or juice into a cup on the floor and they end up dumping it everywhere. I've never found it funny in the slightest. If you've grown up poor you know how expensive milk and juice can be. Not to mention having to clean that up, but it's mostly the expense that bothers me. I've always been annoyed by people who waste expensive things like that. 




 He supposedly had an extra face on the back of his head, which could neither eat nor speak, although it could laugh and cry. Edward begged doctors to have his "demon face" removed, because, supposedly, it whispered demonic words to him at night, but no doctor would attempt it. He committed suicide when he was 23.

Apparently there is no real record of this guy existing, but I wonder if JK Rowling got her idea from this. 




 I'm not in a situation, just curious. 









 In 2009-2010 I tried going to school to become a nurse aide/patient care technician/phlebotomist. I've never really had an interest in any of that but I was being pressured into going to school. It was a disaster. I was successful at becoming a nurse aide, but I hated every part of it. The rest? It was miserable. I felt like no matter how hard I studied I couldn't grasp it and forget actually sticking people with needles. I could do it when my aunt (a nurse) showed me, but in front of the teachers? One issue was that I knew one teacher had no confidence in me, so that made it worse. Well, I dropped out because I was failing anyway. But that's not what's bothered me for 3 years. Yeah, I failed college, but a lot of people do that. The hard part was that I just wasted thousands of dollars of my parents' money. They might think I'm ungrateful, but I spent 3 years being unable to look at my books because I felt so guilty, and they made me feel so unintelligent. They sat under my bed but even knowing they were there bothered me.

Well, I threw away my workbooks and the textbooks I have in my car to take to Goodwill tomorrow. I doubt they'd be assigned now, but they'd make good reference books for someone. The fact that I basically threw thousands of my parents dollars out of the window will always bother me, but at least I feel like I can move on now, especially since I'm attempting college again this fall, and this time, it's something I actually have some interest in. And I'm paying for it. Even if I fail again, at least the financial burden will be on me.

 First, please understand that I started out on the "Zimmerman is guilty" bandwagon, but now I don't think I'll ever have enough knowledge of what happened to have an opinion on whether or not GZ should be in jail. But even when I was 100% on TM's side, I thought calling him a child was a stretch. Yes, I understand that he was legally a child, but he was physically an adult and a match for GZ. I feel like people who say GZ "killed a child" only want to make it sound like he allegedly stalked and shot a 10-year-old. 









 http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/1jtfzx/usharou_explains_why_a_mens_rights_movement_is/

Someone types up a few paragraphs about where they think sexism came from and why MRAs aren't necessarily opposed to feminism. Okay, you can read that and agree or disagree, but the SJA I found in the replies is entertaining. The name is putitintheface...

-Someone says MRAs aren't worth it and neither is the quote. Okay, fine. But then we have...

No it didn't. It's a load of biotruths bullshit that ignores reality in favor of painting a picture that reflects ridiculous beliefs.

Biotruths! I knew this would be fun right away. How dare you say men and women are biologically different! I wish these SJAs would understand what a biotruth really is. A biotruth is this: Women were mostly mothers in the past, and they're made to give birth, so all women should be mothers now because that's all they're designed for! 

Know what isn't a biotruth? Explaining how sexism came to force women to be homemakers because that's what women generally did, so society figured it worked and didn't let women do much else.

Then this:

I've been involved in this debate long enough to know that it's bullshit. It's not my job to educate every frothing moron who stumbles onto the internet.

Not my job to educate you, shitlord! I don't come to the internet to discuss things!

Then someone said this:

So you can't defend your position? Noted.

The SJA response?

I don't need to; my position is like a fucking bunker. It's fortified. There are tanks all around it. At the center, buried deep, there is reality, preciously providing all the information necessary, being examined and re-examined by clever people to make sense of it.

"I don't have to defend my position because I'm right! Stop making me debate, I don't like it!"

It was awesome. 









 So you don't get the "exceeds daily budget" crap? 




 I've shown goats at the county fair for several years now, and I always bring the babies that will go on sale in a few weeks to see if I can draw some early interest. 

The first year I didn't have any babies to sell, but I saw parents picking up the kids (meaning baby goats) of other stalls and actually letting their children hold them. What would make someone think it's okay to pick up an animal that's not yours out of a stall and let your child that is way too young to hold a kicking baby goat handle them? I even saw many kids **drop** the goats. Luckily I didn't see any injuries but goats lets are fragile and can break easily within the first few months. 

The second year I put up a sign. It was my first year having babies there and knew what to expect. The sign said: *Petting is okay, but do not pick up the goats!* Guess what? Parents completely disregarded the sign and lifted the goats right out of the stalls. 

The third year, my sign said: *Do not touch the animals!* Again, parents didn't listen. Their precious toddlers wanted to handle the babies, and that's all that mattered, I guess. 

The next year, I brought dog cages with me and put the goats into the cages, then put the cages into the stalls. I almost expected parents to open the dog cages, but they surprisingly didn't. It's ridiculous that I'd have to go that far. 

It didn't only happen in the goat barn. I saw children running behind draft horses (and a kick from one of those hooves can easily kill someone), kids pulling the tails of pigs, etc and their parents either not caring or telling them to stop only once, but not doing anything when the kid did it again. 




 I understand the game's in alpha and this could be fixed, but it really annoys me. I can tell my workers what I want done, then have to wait 10+ minutes for them to finish building. It's even worse when your prison is finished and you're just watching everyone go about their day. It can take an hour just to go through one day. I know there's a speed up option, but I could swear it doesn't make them go any faster.

It's like they can't tell the difference between "I'll hit anyone back who hits me, even a woman," and "I love hitting bitches! All women deserve to be hit because I'm a man!" 




 I recently took a temporary job at a trap shooting competition. About 1/3 of the people hired are obese. It isn't easy work. There's a lot of walking between sites in the hot sun, picking up shotgun shells, moving trap sets as well as packing them up and unfolding them again, plus a lot more. It isn't unusual to have 12 hour shifts. I started getting a little irritated when I saw most of the fat people start complaining about how their legs hurt and how they had to sit down for a minute. It always left the skinny people doing most of the work while the fat people sat around the benches and talked about how hot it was and how much they hurt. 

Today I nearly reached the end of my self control when the obese girl I was working with announced her legs hurt and she had to go home. They agreed she could go home. This left me with all her work as well as my own and I snapped at her, "My legs hurt too, but I'm not going home." 

She shrugged and said, "You're skinny though. It isn't as hard for you to walk around in the hot sun and move around on sore legs."

I retorted, "Well, if it's really hard for you to work because of your size, maybe you shouldn't take a job where you have to get up off your ass once in awhile."

She teared up and left. I feel a bit bad, but damn it, I'm not being paid extra to do the work of two people. 




 I've seen it. I'm sure you have too. Among all the celebrating good fathers, there's the few people or posters who want to ruin it with things like: This is fathers day! All you deadbeats out there better hop to it!

Do we see this sort of thing on mother's day? Do we draw attention to women who abandon their kids? No. We thank the mother figures in our lives for all they do. The father figures do just as much and don't deserve to have their day used in this way.

It could be satire or a poe, but either way it's hilarious. 




 My boyfriend's house has been having plumbing problems. The toilets tend to back up and won't flush. The water does go down within a few hours, so I got my boyfriend's okay to use the toilet. He said as long as there was just one flush it should go down.

So I go in there and empty my menstrual cup (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cup) into the toilet, like you're supposed to do. I flush. The toilet fills up with water. The blood is still in there, looking gross. I tell my bf, but he says to just shut the lid and it would go down in a couple hours. But what we didn't know is that his dad had called a plumber, who appeared less than 20 minutes later. The plumber checks all the toilets, including the one I had just used. It was still filled with water and period blood.

It was obvious whose it was, too since my bf's mom is post-menopausal. I'll never be able to look his dad in the eye again. 




 Nothing makes me stop listening to someone's political argument faster than this, maybe besides defending it with religion. Can't have gay marriage, I might have to explain to my kids what a gay person is. Can't have legal pot, someone might offer my kid a joint. 

Why do the rest of us have to stop living because some people think their kids might lose some innocence?  




 http://lybio.net/tag/garfunkel-and-oates-the-college-try-lyrics/

The lyrics are there if you don't feel like watching the video. It's about a "modern heteroflexible" woman who thinks she's bisexual until there's a vagina in her face.

 




 Two years ago I was working as a waitress. One of the other waitresses went to the bathroom, so I said I'd take the food to her tables when they came up. One tray came up, so I took it to a table with a woman and a little girl. I put their food down, and the girl said, "Thank you."

Before I could reply, the woman says, "Honey, you don't have to thank her, that's her job."

I've seen plenty of parents remind their kids to be gracious, but I'd never seen this before. I bet the kid doesn't say thank you to anyone now thanks to her mom.

Men being afraid to read "girly looking books" is pretty stupid, yes, but some of these books would have no reason to look the opposite way. They wouldn't work. Here are just the ones I read:

Game of Thrones - This one works, actually. It's ugly, but it works.

Stardust - This one works as well.

A Clockwork Orange - Why the hell would this cover have a woman on it? I know they're pretending the revised titles were written by the opposite sex, but they don't give any indication that the story's changed. ACO is about a sociopathic man.

Carrie - A girl is viciously bullied and gets blood dumped on her at prom. Why would she be smiling and happy on the cover?

Shutter Island - Yep, a book cover with a peaceful island view is what I imagined for a mystery novel about mental patient abuse.

Lord of the Flies - This makes the least about of sense. A bunch of children stranded on an island turn into anarchy. We need a picture of hands with a smiling pig thing.
 









 In 1989 my mother worked at a pet store. She was 25 years old, and I was only months old. While my parents worked my grandparents watched me. Well, one day my mom was cleaning out cages when this middle aged man walked over to her and asked how she was. The questions started out general but got more and more personal. Mom was busy but didn't want to be rude so she just gave short and vague answers. 

Eventually the man bent down and whispered to her, "You aren't being very friendly to your customers. I know you have a baby, maybe if something happened to her you wouldn't be so standoffish to your customers."

With this, the man got up and left. The manager found my mother so shaken and upset and after he learned what happened, he insisted on calling the police. Nothing ever came of it, and mom couldn't recall having seen the man anywhere before. She never had me at the pet store at the time so he couldn't have seen me there. He also knew I was a girl, so that's an extra bit of info he knew as well. 

Mom only worked at the store a few days after that, she quit and found another because she didn't feel safe with him knowing where she worked. Apparently for quite a while after the incident, my grandpa kept his rifle within grabbing distance when baby-sitting. 




 One stereotype of a depressed person is the ability to write, draw, paint, etc with talent. Anyone else here not like that at all?

I can't draw a straight line. Paint ends up everywhere but on the easel, and I have no imagination for writing anything. Now, I can sort of write. I've kept a fictional diary for almost 8 years now. I always did okay with reports in English class and things like that. But I have no imagination in which to improve my average writing skills. While I read Harry Potter, all I can think of is, "Good lord, how did this woman think this up?"  









 We've all heard of people who won't take no for an answer when trying to get you to hold their baby, but apparently the opposite is true also. 

I was on peopleofwalmart.com (yep, don't judge) and one picture was a baby in a carriage. The carriage had a sign hanging on it that said "Please don't touch the baby." In the comments someone explained hospitals usually give signs like these to parents with preemies because their immune systems can't take a lot of fight yet. 

From the other comments I gathered it was common for people in public to come right up and touch and even *pick up* other peoples' babies without permission. I just...what? I wouldn't touch someone's baby if it fell out of the womb and rolled over to my feet. 

Just another reason to not have kids. I don't like people bothering me in public to begin with, and if one of them tried to touch a child of mine, I'd be going to jail for breaking their fingers. Having a kid doesn't mean you don't like shopping in peace.

 




 I'm a little ashamed to say animal abuse bothers me a lot more than anything that happens to people. It's not that violence against people doesn't bother me, it does, but I can't even stand to read about instances of animal abuse because I feel physically sick. Forget actual video of it. If I see a video of something happening to a person, I'm only bothered for a few minutes afterward. I saw a video of animals being skinned alive for fur coats, and I felt sick for literally a week.  
























 The father is full of shit then. 




 A child cannot have phimosis. It's normal for the foreskin to remain attached to the glans until puberty for some kids.

...non-retractability (in the absence of scarring or other abnormality) can be considered normal for males up to and including adolescence.

 Can you explain why I still get ovulation pains while on birth control? 




 I support financial abortion for men because I don't believe in forcing anyone into parenthood, but sorry, as a woman I just don't believe a man should have any legal say over whether or not a woman has an abortion. It's her uterus and body being risked, not his. It's unfortunate if he wants to become a father and she aborts, but she was bearing the full weight of the pregnancy, not him. 




 ...wat 




 You saw this enforced? 




 My parents wouldn't even let us blow bubbles into our soda cups, let alone make a huge mess. 




 Even China has mandatory break laws. 




  Even if it is just an option and a woman can choose to send a baby to the nursery for the night, it is not necessarily narcissistic. Many loving mothers do this.

Of course, but that's quite a bit different from sending them away because you don't feel like dealing with them the very same day they're born. This story was coupled with her comment, "I'll be dealing with her for the next 18 years." 




 That's because more students in Sweden leave home when going to college than American students.

Swedish students pay for their costs of living themselves and American students live off their parents. 




 Tech schools would be tuition free too. 




 Being tired as hell and letting someone else take the baby while you nap isn't quite the same as saying, "Take her all night, I want to sleep and I'll have to deal with her for the next 18 years anyway." 




 Growing up, I always heard about how when I was born, after everyone had saw me and held me, my mom told the staff to put me in the nursery instead of leaving me in her room for the night because, "I want to sleep, and I'll be dealing with her for the next 18 years."

I never thought that was odd, and no one in my family acted like it was odd, until I told my boyfriend about it and he was horrified. I've told the story online a few places, and the responses were the same. 

My mother had done plenty more nmom stuff throughout the years that were more severe, but that stands out as a very early sign of how our relationship was going to be. No, no bonding time. Just put her in the nursery. 




 He was probably held under and drowned. 




 Well...that's upsetting. 




 I can find no good source for this. 




 I don't consider this to be immoral. Age of consent in most places is 16. 




 Eh. I don't find that to be that bad.
 




 Source? 




 Anastasia Romanova was a bully. She was known for biting, scratching, and hitting her cousins.

Yeah, she was a child, but still...;) 




 I only see white and gold when the picture is washed out. 




  People were dismissive of the actor playing Enjolras in the film, even though he was one of the best singers in the whole movie, just because he was too masculine-looking.

Funny, of all the actors who have ever played Enjolras I thought Aaron Tveit looked the most feminine.  




 I don't get to see the night because if I stay up late, I'll be tired for school/work the next day.

Nothing to do with fear. 




 Huh, my panic attacks cause me to hyperventilate for several minutes along with feeling like I need to tear my hair out and curl on the floor.

And it's never brought on by anger. 




 They're degrees, not vocational certificates.

The point is to make society more educated. The only goal of education isn't to get a job.

 The point is to get a more educated society, not to hand out degrees. 




 America: where things other countries do daily are considered impossible. 




 Does this mean countries like Germany, Denmark, Finland, etc are infantalized?  




 Not everyone will go. Not everyone goes to college even in countries that offer it for free. 




 Way to make sure the poor can't get an education. 




 I think you missed the word "tuition" there. 




 Holy crap, I can't believe there are still people who deny marriage is a civil right.

Really? This is the first time you've ever heard that there are people against gay marriage?

 Eisenhower did this in the 50s. Did people leave? 




 The richest people were taxed at 90% in Eisenhower's time, and America had some of the most booming business in the world. 




 Socialism: a way of organizing a society in which major industries (meaning something that produces goods or services) are owned and controlled by the community instead of individual people and companies.

If you still have private business and private industry you cannot be living in a socialist economy.

 




 Someone else? You're as entitled to use the education you pay for as anyone else. 




 Socialism is the workers and community taking over businesses and the means of production for themselves and keeping the profits for themselves. 

Tax funded education is no different from tax funded fire departments, police, or roads. None of those are socialism. 




 Oh, so now America goes from striving to be #1 in the world to just attracting people from developing countries and calling that good enough?

Good for you, South Korea, Japan, Finland, UK, Canada, Netherlands, Denmark, Germany etc. We'll never be among your ranks in education because we're just focusing on being better than developing nations instead of being as good as we can be.

 I've heard my mom say to my dad, "You're the one that wanted kids." 




 There's one of her at the beach as a toddler. 




 Honestly, any time a parent wants to refuse medical care for their child and it puts their child at risk like this, they should be ignored and the team of doctors allowed to do whatever is necessary. 




 But a friend of mine who is a psychologist said that one of her clients actually suffered traumatic flashbacks because of that scene. And it makes me so sick to my stomach to think that even if I did express this to these people, that at least one person was forced to relive one of the worst experiences of her life because DD just couldn't resist adding in another pointless rape scene, reddit still wouldn't give a shit, because lol triggers and lol only war veterans get ptsd.

And it sucks for that client. It truly does. But GOT is known for its violence and sex. It's a very adult show, as anyone who has watched 5 seasons of it would know by now. It isn't up to the writers to cater to people who have sensitivities. Chances are there is someone who would be triggered by anything violent shown. Hell, I'm sometimes triggered by "Roseanne" because Dan and Roseanne's loud fights remind me of my parents' fights, nights of hearing my dad tear the house down in anger, and crying myself to sleep as a child. But the writers had no responsibility to cater to me. If you know something it bound to have aspects that upset you, don't watch it or at least wait for a summary. Also whoever said rape victims don't get PTSD? You must be confusing that with when we make fun of people who say they got PTSD because some asshole wolf whistled at them.

Finally, how do you know this rape scene was pointless? It existed in the book, just for a different character than Sansa. And how do you know it doesn't play a part in continuing Sansa's character arc? 




 I love how they're saying Sansa being raped takes away her agency and turns her back from being a player into a pawn.

Because there's no way a strong and willful person can be raped.

 Plus, the world needs cashiers and waiters and whatnots.

And yet still doesn't want to pay them enough to live on. 




 No, there is no evidence for it happening at all. In fact, Norse and Hindu mythology have similar stories. 




 The Old Testament tells the Hebrews to kill everyone who doesn't believe in the same god as they do, but the vast majority of Jews ignore that part. 

It's the same with Muslims. The vast majority don't follow that part. There are 1.6 billion Muslims in the world, and the world would be far worse off if a huge number of them took to killing people. 




 Nicholas II, not Alexander III. And there is no evidence that he ever slept with Alexandra.

 You're a troll because you think violence against innocent Muslims is a reasonable response to that.

ISIS kills other Muslims who oppose them by the thousands. Not all Muslims are the enemy. 




 Well said.

Your comment deserves more than just an upvote. 




 Tagged as troll. Thanks. 




 Male fetuses don't start off female. Someone explained it pretty well earlier:

Human fetuses don't start out female. It's a common misconception that I see all over the Internet. We start out undifferentiated. There's a genital tubercle that contains the rudiments of both the male and female external genitalia, and the Wolffian and Mullerian ducts-- the internal plumbing--are both present. If the fetus has a Y-chromosome, then the SRY gene kicks of the masculinizing program: the female plumbing degenerates, the labioscrotal swelling closes up to make a ballsack, and the glans and urethral folds enlarge to make a penis.
In the absence of that signal, the male plumbing degenerates, the glans diminishes to make a clitoris, and the labioscrotal swelling remains open to make labia with a vaginal opening. The female program seems to be the "default," meaning that if something goes wrong with the masculinizing program, the genitals often resort to female development (though they can remain in sort of an intermediate intersex state). Maybe this is why so many people think that we "start out" female.

 The only goal of college isn't to get a job. It's fine to have that goal, but it's for general education as well. It's beneficial to have a well educated population. 




 I'm happy to pay for this, just like I already pay for public schools, libraries, roads, fire departments, police stations, etc.

We know it's paid for by taxes. 




 A goal of college should also be general education so you have a well educated population, not just training for a job. 




 These people would probably defend those rabbis who suck the blood off of the penises of babies after circumcising them. 




 Not caring if someone is killed in front of you isn't a crime.

 $400 a month is pretty common for America. Some people pay as much as $800 a month. 




 The same reason why everyone has to pay for everyone else to have access to fire departments, police stations, roads, etc. 




 Those services are well worth it. 




 I'm happy about it. 




 Except our [economic and social mobility](http://www.decisionsonevidence.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Economic-Mobility-Across-Developed-Countries.png) has been dropping off in the last decades. 

You're very likely to remain in the same economic class you were born in in the USA whether you work hard or not.  




 Just like you're paying for other people to have firemen put their houses out. 




 Denmark and Germany (as well as a few other countries) have free college. Their professors are paid through tax dollars, like firemen and policemen. 




 Despite their high taxes (or because of them) they have a much better economic mobility than we do.

You can actually crawl out of poverty in Germany. The USA? Good luck. 




 Do you think other countries with free education pay their professors with unicorn farts?

It's funny how America claims to be #1 but sees things other countries can do as impossible. 




 I've been through a living hell since October 2014 (my whole life really, that's just when it got worse).

I am not intentionally starving myself and do eat when I feel a little hungry, but I have lost all appetite almost. I was at 136 lbs when I last weighed myself am now at 128. Still a healthy weight for my height, but I am feeling the affects on my body already. The shakes, the dizziness, etc. As someone who used to cut and is no longer able to, I get the same satisfaction from it that I used to get cutting. So I do enjoy it a little.

As I said, it isn't that I am hungry and am ignoring it. I'm just not hungry. If I felt like I was hungry enough to eat an entire hamburger, I would.

But I do wonder how long this will go on. 




 In anthropology class we were discussing how archaeologists discovered the bones of a person, thousands of years old, that had a limb pretty cleanly amputated, probably to prevent infection in an injury from traveling. 

Understandably, everyone in the class inhaled sharply and started discussing how much that had to have sucked. This was in the days before adequate painkillers, so in all reality this person was probably just held down while they went to town cutting his arm off. 

I said, "I think I'd have rather just been allowed to die." A guy beside me gave me a funny look and said, "*Really?* Sure it hurts, but at least you're alive afterwards."  

Someone else chimed in, "Yes, and once it's healed you go about your daily life again. I mean, at least you're still alive."

Just...wow. As someone with depression I have contemplated ending it just because I can't take the emotional and psychological pain anymore. I can't imagine electing to go through removal of a limb without anesthesia to stay alive. It's completely 100% not worth it.

Also related, this Cracked article:

http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-1604-major-surgery-with-no-painkillers-5-things-i-learned.html

The writer went through surgery without general anesthesia (including having his ribs spread open, which the local would not help) because they were working on his heart, and they were worried administering anesthesia would make his heart stop.

I'm afraid if that were me, I'd have to say goodbye to my loved ones and tell them I am choosing to die instead of letting them spread my ribs open without painkillers. 

I guess this attachment to living is something I will just never understand. I haven't had a single experience so far that I would undergo surgery without anesthesia for, and I can't imagine I'll have any in the future. 




 Just knowing I have work the next day drags my entire day down. Do you have any tips?

Oh, I should add that I don't really hate my job, it's just that I feel like a sucker working to pay for a life I don't want. I'd rather die. 









 If I spend any extended time outside when there is a cold wind - or even a breeze - I get this horrible pain in my ears. You know the feeling when you sleep with your ear folded over and when you wake up your ear is stiff and painful? It's a lot like that, except the pain extends under my ear (almost where my jaw starts) and goes up to about two inches above my ear. It can be so intense I have to lay down with a blanket over my head and just let my ears warm up.

Also, I know it's the wind because if I put cotton balls in my ears or wear a hat, I'm fine. 









 I was in kindergarten or thereabouts. My aunt moved close to us after living far away for a long time. She had no kids of her own yet so she liked to take me around and do things. I learned right away I liked spending time with my aunt more than my mom. Mom always had something mean to say and made me feel like she didn't really want me around. She complained and groaned whenever she had to take me somewhere. I heard her talk about her "goddamned kids" on the phone before and knew what she was talking about.

Well, one night my aunt was dropping me off back at home and I threw a fit, as 6-year-olds do. I said I didn't want to be left with mom and wished my aunt could be my mom. My aunt just said, "That's not very nice, your mom loves you," and left.

Well, after that, mom grabbed me and said, "If you don't want to live here anymore, you don't have to. I'm getting you a suitcase and you're packing your things to live in an orphanage. I'll get another kid who isn't a little brat." She hauled out a suitcase and forced me to start throwing my things into it. I was wailing because I believed her 100%. I thought I was never going to see my dad or grandparents again. I thought I was never going to see my dog again. I had just gotten a kitten, and I thought I'd never pet or hold him again. 

After packing all my clothes, she made me go to bed. I lay there and sobbed into my pillow the entire night. It wasn't until the next morning when mom went to wake me up for school that she found me still crying. She said, "Did you really think I'd send you away and bring home another kid?" Honestly, yes. Yes I did. What does that say about you?

Even then she made no real moves to comfort me or even apologize. She just made me get dressed for school. 

Apparently my grandparents (dad's parents) read my mother the riot act when they learned about this. My grandmother even said, "But don't you know even if you were sent to an orphanage, your grandpa and I would come pick you up right away?" So at least I got a little comfort from them.

Oddly enough, I never really understood how fucked up this was until I told my boyfriend about it. I knew it was horribly mean, but I didn't realize it probably counted as psychological abuse.

Also, to this day my mom insists it was a just and fitting punishment. 




 Growing up, I always knew my mother was awful to me and my dad did some awful things too (although not nearly as bad as mom) but since the entire side of my mom's family is like that, I always saw it as normal. "Yes, today my mom called me a worthless idiot, what's for dinner?"

Then just 2.5 years ago I met my boyfriend and we were sharing childhood stories. I remember my boyfriend looking shocked or offended at some of mine and finally one day he said, "Your mother is awful and you should cut all contact with her."

Later I brought this up with my friends who I've known since middle school, and their replies were along the lines of, "Yep, we can't stand your mom." They just never mentioned it to me. 

I lived with it for 20-odd years, but it never occurred to me until it was pointed out.  

Anyway, I decided to make this post because I just found this subreddit and I already relate to so many of your stories. I'm sure I'll go into details at a later time, but right now I'm just reading other posts and coming to terms with the fact that I lived with emotional and psychological abuse for so long without realizing it. It's certainly had an affect on me. I've had severe depression since I was younger than 9 (9 is when I learned what suicide meant and could put a term to the feeling I'd had) and my anxiety can be pretty terrible too. I may have had those issues anyway, but my mother has made them 5 times worse at least. 




 I still think about small and unimportant things that upset me when I was a child. I am constantly replaying my worst experiences in my head.

Worst of all, tips to stop don't seem to help. "Go for a run." I'll ruminate while I'm running. "Find a hobby you enjoy." I'll ruminate while I'm scrap-booking.

What are your experiences? 




 She had cancer for a little while, but blood in her urine told us it spread to her bladder, so we decided it was time to put her down.

So I was there in the office with her, crying my eyes out. The vet said I could hold her, or just put her on the table and pet her. I felt absolute dread at the thought of her going limp in my arms. I was barely holding up as was and I was afraid that would make me lose it. It was taking all my strength to be there at all. My sister had offered to take her in so I wouldn't have to, but I was determined to be there in her last moments. So I rubbed her back as she was euthanized.

Now I am extremely sorry I didn't hold her. I know she didn't know she was about to die. She only knew she was in a place where she had been before and I was petting her. She passed away peacefully feeling me pet her back.

I know even if I had held her I would find something else to be upset about, but I can't shake the feeling that I wasn't properly there for her.

As I said, I've had her for 18 years and she was always there for me when my depression was at its worst and when I needed her most. Now she's gone and I feel I didn't return the favor on top of it.

 JK Rowling used a werewolf as a metaphor for someone with AIDS (or so I have heard), and while the social stigma is probably very similar, there is one huge difference: Someone with AIDS isn't going to kill you, and a werewolf is his natural state will rip your throat out.

In his first and only year, Lupin almost killed four people. If Sirius Black hadn't been there to fight him off, Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Snape would have been werewolf chow. And if by some chance they survived, they'd now have a lifelong curse.

What's the most damning is that Lupin forgot to take his potion (that keeps him in a human state of mind after transformation) himself. Snape didn't sabotage it to out him, and no one else did anything like that either. Lupin simply got distracted and forgot. Who's to say that couldn't happen again?

It's very unfortunate for Lupin, but if you turn into a deadly animal once a month, you probably shouldn't work in boarding school. I can certainly see where parents of Hogwarts students were coming from. CMV.

Edit: Yes, he resigned, but it was because he knew he'd eventually be fired. 














 My nearly 18-year-old female cat has sprouted a tumor on her side. I've been away so my family isn't quite sure how long it's been there. Some quick research makes it sound cancerous, since it grew sort of quickly and is hard to the touch. She doesn't seem like she's in pain or having trouble moving around.

I'm going to make an appointment with the vet on Monday, but I'm prepared for the worst since it seems cancerous, and her advanced age makes treatment difficult. 

Anyone else gone through this? 




 I've had one, but it was after learning to relax my ass. It took a long time. 




 I downloaded some mods, now all of a sudden I can't finish quests. I'll get all the way to the end of one, and it won't finish. It won't disappear from the journal, and the marker won't go away. I killed a dragon, and once it was dead, it just laid there and didn't burn out. The marker didn't leave from it, either. 

I have...

Arissa, the Wandering Rogue

I have some others, but those have worked fine for a long time. Anyone else have an issue with the mods I listed above?
 




 I've looked around the official medicaid site and couldn't find the answer. I am in Ohio, if that matters.

I am applying for medicaid, and I know it asks what your yearly salary is. The thing is, I have only had crappy jobs and I jump from one to the next. Do I just use the amount from last year's tax information? Or do I have to estimate what I'll make this year? 




 Maven leaves notes around Riften, saying that she'll have to take the losses from her mead out of her employees' salaries. I've been collecting them because they seem interesting, but I haven't found anything to do with them.  



















 I'm hoping to get onto Medicaid next year since at $8 an hour pay I am too poor to afford any insurance. On top of that I tend to have expensive medical bills. I have a $500 one right now that's ruining my credit. 

I had been hoping that I could get braces on Medicaid. Now, my need for braces isn't cosmetic. If it were, I wouldn't bother. Crooked teeth don't bother me much. My problem is that the two teeth beside by front teeth came in in such a way that they put pressure on the front teeth. This causes them to crack and cavities to set in very quickly no matter how on top of brushing and flossing I am. Not to mention the terrible toothaches and headaches that come with constant pressure on your teeth. 

A dentist told me that without braces there is really nothing that can be done besides just filling in the cavities when they appear. All that can be done for the pain is ibuprofen. I can easily finish a bottle of those a month because of this. Nothing can be done for the cracking either.

But Medicaid only pays for braces for those under 21. So I'm pretty fucked. At least dental care is included in Medicaid, so I can get the cavities filled if nothing else. I learned for some states, Medicaid doesn't cover adult dental care at all. Federal law makes them cover dental care for children, but it's up to the state if they cover adults.

What's really infuriating is that when I was about 12 the dentist told my parents this problem with my front teeth would likely happen, and unless treated with braces, it would cause cracking and pain. Excellent spot on prediction. But my parents decided it was too expensive, and "not necessary because he's probably wrong."

I am completely for children receiving medical care, but they aren't more important than adults.

 I've been having a very difficult few months. I haven't cut myself in almost 2 years but I really needed the release. I was seriously dizzy afterwards and now my heart hurts, but at least I could relax a little after I had done it.

It doesn't have the same affect it used to when I was younger. Less release now and more dizziness and pain. 




 I feel like I don't really have a place in the world. I'm unlikely to ever get a job that pays very well and I'm still dependent on my parents at 25 years old. I am so sick and tired of living and the idea that there's a higher power watching over me is very attractive. It would be nice to think that it doesn't matter if this life is a complete failure because there's something more important afterwards.

My family seems to get a lot of comfort out of religion. It gave my grandma strength when my grandpa died and it seems to give my formerly-atheist cousin a place to fit in and feel good (her church is pretty liberal). 

The only problem is is that I just don't believe it. I may as well wish Hogwarts was real. This is something I've always been a little jealous of religious people for.  




 I am just getting over the flu, and I have such a severe phobia of vomiting that I refuse to eat or drink anything if I feel nauseous. (A serious risk of dehydration, I know) And yet I threw up a few times despite not eating or drinking for 8+ hours. The vomiting lasted as long as if I had actually eaten something, too. 

Why would I vomit even if there is nothing in my stomach besides normal fluids that are always there? 




 Inspired by my case of the flu. I vomited and was bawling the whole time.

It's probably because I hate it so much. Whenever I vomit the one thing I want most in the world is to stop. However, I learned a lot of people don't seem to mind throwing up much. I've had both my dad and my boyfriend ask why I was crying after vomiting in the past. They couldn't understand why it upset me so much.

So ladies, how do you handle this unpleasant situation?
