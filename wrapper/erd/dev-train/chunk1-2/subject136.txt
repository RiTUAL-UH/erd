 Its a little low on activity though.  :( 




 my credit is shot due to the holidays

Wait... what?!? How does that happen? 




 yes!! 




 It seems like this should exist already but basically what I'm looking for is a place for people who are already employed to discuss their daily work lives.

I guess watercooler talk, if that makes sense. 




 Exactly.  I'd waste even more time if I was trying to socialize.  Plus music helps me stay motivated. 




 These are good points and I'd add that since the OP has been a homeowner he should already have a good grasp on what to look for in a property.

Trust your experience.  Worst case you can leave in a year. 




 Holy crap white people are crazy! 




 Well, I'm trying to revamp my wardrobe piece by piece but my mind goes blank when I get to the store.  I'm thinking I'd rather go into the store with a plan because I mostly buy clothes when I need them or when I see a really good sale.  What happens is I buy something but it doesn't really fit what I already own.  I want to gradually upgrade my wardrobe. 




 Dangit...  Photoshop seems like too much work.  




 My biggest weakness is putting it all together.  I'll buy a fine piece here or there but not know what I need to layer it with.  I'm starting to just look at the models on clothing websites and try to piece together a matching outfit.

I'm wondering if there is something out there that would allow me to place virtual clothing on an avatar or mannequin for every piece of clothing along with a bevy of options.  Something like what you see in the create a player mode in video games but focused on clothing only.


TL;DR:  I want to be able to piece together entire outfits in a virtual setting. 




 I disagree.  It's a major pain to cancel XM radio.  They lure you with that sweet deal hoping you forget.  Then when the deal runs out they try to do it again and again.

There's no way to cancel online and you HAVE to go through their phone system and reps to cancel.  It's like trying to dump someone who hasn't faced reality.

I know XM was more than happy to offer me the discounted rate three times until I finally stood firm.   




 Looks fine to me.  Especially in the setting you described. 




 Sounds like a mob threat. 




 I'm a guy and I have it. It was a nickel sized patch in the back of my head when young.  I tried creams and injections and eventually just settled on a style that kept it low and faded in the back.

Now I'm 29 and it looks like its coming back at my right temple so it looks like I'm balding on one side.  It sucks because the dermatologists are no help.  I think its stress related. I wish there was a cure.  




 On another board I frequent someone asked "what's the point of no fap challenges?"



And someone retorted with this:


an occasional fap session is fine...  but i agree...daily? thats way too much... cats here go from one extreme to the next....  theres no middle ground... either you guys fap 10 times a day or you have to go 90 days fap-free....  moderation is the key to life...learn it.


Thoughts?  I thought he made a good point

 Burp. I literally can't.  :-(  




 Pardon my ignorance, but what's an REO? 




 Yeah after looking at all the math and seeing how I might be staying here awhile I can't justify renting.

Even if it turned out to be $800 a month that's still considerably less than $1050 which I'm sure will go up when its time to renew. 




 Works for me!  this is great 




 Can I just be nice and pay you to do your job?  I'm not into bringing gifts, baked goods, and all that other stuff. 




 Based off of what you wrote, I'd cut him off.  As a man that dated a chick for 7 years and didn't really appreciate her until she left... Believe me when I say you have to move on.  It's tough and initially it will be painful but he seems a lot like I was.  Don't let your fantasy of a "great love story followed by a happy ending" cloud the truth that is right in front of you. 




 Wow.  You've given me much to think about.  I don't think i'll have to deal with that worst case scenario situation but I can't predict the future either.


I still want a townhouse but I will now expand my search to houses as well.  Since buying a snowblower and paying someone to do my lawn will be cheaper in the long run anyway.  Thanks. 




 HOA is $120 a month.  $435 not including taxes. 




 Location: Des Moines, IA.
HOA fees are around $120 a month.
I'm a senior engineer for a Fortune 100 company based in the midwest.  My job is as stable as it gets.

Anything else?  I'm more than willing to answer questions so I can make an informed decision.

Why do you guys hate townhouses?  I used to as well until I saw my coworker's setup and the low costs he was paying.  It makes sense for a young professional. 




 Here's my story.  I bought my first home about 3 years ago in GA with the First Time Homeowner's credit.  I had to move two years later and lost $20k on that home.  (Luckily I didn't have to pay the govt their $8K back)

Fast forward to now.  I've been renting a townhouse in my Iowa for about a year and a half.  My rent is $1050.  I can get similar and newer townhouse for $100K and a mortgage of $435.  The area seems stable and is actually being built up.

My questions... 

1.  Is there anything I'm not considering?  I don't want to get burnt again.
2.  Will the market ever pick up again?  I foolishly bought 3 years ago thinking rates couldnt get any lower.

I want a townhouse because I don't want to deal with the maintenance of a yard in this climate.  My thought process is worst case scenario I could always rent it and my company buys the house for market value if the ask me to move. 




 You need to look at all the other costs as well.  Is there an HOA?  what will your property taxes be?  Maintenance? upkeep?  etc.

The difference is only $75.  That's not that drastic. 




 This is honestly where I'm trying to get.  I want to be able to interchance work and play clothes seamlessly.  Any tips? 









 Doesn't matter.  The internet sleuths will track it down in a matter of minutes and it would be publicized anyway. 




 I felt like I had found the cheat code to life.

To be fair, I tried to break up numerous times but my gf was in denial and wouldn't let me go. 




 If I'm driving and see someone trying to cut over into my lane at the last second to bypass a line of cars I'll purposely box them out.

Wait in line like the rest of us.

 While true, I have a corporate job now.  That iron from college has to go!

 My 2006 Honda Accord makes a horrible whiny sound when I turn the steering wheel in cold weather.  After the car gets warm it goes away.

I've checked the power steering fluid and its fine.  What do I need to know before taking it to a mechanic?

 Oh I see now, you're mixed.  I didn't see the comments earlier where you mentioned it.  I was trying to visualize a dark skinned woman with fine caucasian hair and couldn't...

Even with the face blurred out you seem pretty attractive. 




 Black with white hair?!?!?  :mindblown:

I'm black btw.  I'm trying to picture a visual here.  A picture (with face blurred out) would do wonders. 




 I have a friend that's in the hospital.  I need an idea of something to bring.  I feel like flowers and balloons aren't manly at all. 




 This may help some of you out there.  I'm a 29 year old bachelor who makes enough money to buy whatever he wants.  But never buys what he needs.  Heres' a list of things I need that are inexpensive and would totally bring a smile to my face if I got them for Christmas.  

**Iron** -  I've been using the same cheap iron I had in college.  An upgrade to a decent one around $50 would be very useful.

**Vacuum** - Same as above.  A man is unlikely to buy himself a new vacuum.

**Nice Kitchenware (pots, knives, blender, etc)** - A nice pot here or there would be great.  When I need something I always go cheap.  Someone else springing $60 for that nice pot or a set of quality knives would be great.  I recently tried to make a cheesecake without a mixer and shredded cabbage without a food processor.  The experience was terrible.  I need new kitchenware bad!

**Logitech Harmony Remote** - I keep losing my remotes.  I need to consolidate.

**AA/AAA Batteries** -  Cheap.  But who's gonna turn down batteries?!?

**Dress Socks** - I can't explain it, but I always need some. 

Just some suggestions. 




 Nice.  I'm stealing this! 




 Hijack away, that would be awesome as well. 




 I'm new and interesting in learning more about Stoicism.  I'm a visual an audatory learner.  I will defintely read the literature at some point but I would like to know if there are other forms of media about Stoicism.

 I wish I had the answer.  It's sad.  The ironic thing is that there are more blacks in college than any other period in history yet there's probably more teenage pregnancies as well.  So we're doing better, but worse at the same time.

I don't have the percentage breakdown tho.  Forgive me. 




 "Stop actin' like a lil bitch.  You'll be alright."   Strangely this worked better than the cookie cutter stuff. 




 It started with the government pushing drugs into the black communities.  It's documented and everything.

People like to blame black people like we don't come from a history of hard workers.  Insert drugs, destroy black male leadership by having J. Edgar Hoover  take down the Black Panther Party and here we are today. 




 Not sure I understand this.  For example in boxing a right handed person leads with his left foot forward and his left hand closer to his opponent.  Are you suggesting they box southpaw? 




 I used to work for Papa Johns.  Do the drivers still dilly dally and avoid hard work while waiting for orders to come out?  

In the two stores I worked at the drivers would play hooky while I stood up all day making pizzas, answering calls, and folding boxes.

Also, do you know how to toss dough? 




 Someone needs to make a "negged" version of that gif. 




 Yeah it's the latter.  I already know about VLC sync.  I love it.

Like someone said earlier, close captioning is probably what I'm lookin for 




 Vivo en Iowa.  Hay un poco de nieve en las calles.  La temperatura es de cinco grados.  Soy originalmente de Georgia.  Por eso, no me gusta la temperatura y soy muy frio. 




 True.  Is there a high availability of Spanish shows/movies with closed captioning?  I know on Telemundo they have closed captions but I can't find any dvds with it.  I also can't access the captions on through my HD tv and cable box.  (but I know they work because I've seen them on other tvs) 




 Last time I watched a Spanish movie on Netflix it only had English and France as subtitle options.  I'll check again. 




 I've gotten some from there but they don't match up.  I don't know if its because I'm watching the Latin American version and the subs are from Spain or what, but its frustrating. 




 Puedo buscar peliculas en ingles con subtitulos en espanol pero no puedo encontrar peliculas en espanol con subtitulos en espanol.  Sin embargo hay muchas peliculas en espanol con subtitulos en otras lenguas.

Can anybody help?  I'm willing to pay.  This goes for official dvd releases as well.

Oh yeah I used both *buscar* and *encontrar* in the passage above because I'm not sure which one I should've used.  

I also have a hard time finding subtitles for English movies dubbed in Spanish.  The ones I find are slightly off.  The actors are using a script so I'm sure the proper version exists somewhere. 




 did you give her a real chance? - no rebound, pity acceptance of relationship, sex only relationship, other. crap reasons to be with someone

It was a semi-rebound I guess. but I gave her a chance

were you attracted to her? physically, intelectually, emotionally

Of course.  

what are the best things about her?

She's independent, smart, attractive, genuinely fun to be with at times.

what are the worst things about her?

She is the total opposite of me and is HIGHLY emotional.  She can be rude and cut people off when talking.  Also in most cases she lacks the ability to look at herself from other's perspective.  and she can be a tad bit materialistic.

what's her favourite thing? something that always makes her smile

Makeup accessories, Hello Kitty, coffee, tea... I could go on and on.

what was the greatest thing you've ever done for her happyness alone?

I cant single out one thing by itself.  I spoiled her at Christmas though.

have you thought about her while out with friends/work wtv?

Sure.

have you always been there for her when she was sad? have you done stuff to make her happy after?

Usually.  The only problem is since she's so emotional, she gets sad and mad a lot.  This is admittedly my weak spot because I never know what to do in these situations so I just listen and try to be empathetic.  Best thing I can do is take her mind off of it.

ever thought about marrying her? giving her babies?

Not until right before the end.  I would have kids with her.  She only wants one but I think that she was open to changing that. 




 Yeah she knows.  I told her when I was breaking up that I didn't think it was fair for her to be with someone who didn't care as much as she did.  




 Actually I was in a relationship from ages 20-27 and was really in love with that girl.  So I know what it feels like.  But sometimes I feel like I'm unfairly comparing my new girl to my old one.

But I also got my heart broken in that relationship so I'm apprehensive to let my guard down and love again. 




 He's not saying it because he doesn't love you.  He might care about you A LOT, but saying it is a probably a pretty big deal to him.  He would probably feel all sorts of anxiety and pressure once he says it.

I put my last girlfriend through something similar before I cut it off since I wasn't in love as much as she was.  No one should ever have to be in a lopsided relationship.

Keep in mind my actions all pointed to me loving her.  I did everything you could ask a bf to do, but my heart wasn't all the way in it.  

If it's an issue to you it's probably worth bringing it up with him. 




 She was in love and I wasn't ready for all that.  We were together 7 months.  I feel like I did her a favor by not wasting her time any more.  But now I feel lonely and sad.  

I'd reach out to her but I feel it's a selfish move if I'm not ready to give it my all.  I really wish we could be friends and I hope she's around when I get it all together but she has a strict "no contact" policy with exes.

Any advice?  



**TL;DR.**  Dumped gf, right decision, help me feel better about it. 

**EDIT:  I think I may actually love her.  But I'm not sure.  How can you be sure?  I feel like the fact that I'm not sure means I should leave it alone.**

It's just a start.  I got bored one day at work and ran with it.  I'm sure someone else could do a MUCH better job.

My logic was to create a basic avatar comprised of cells that I could fill in with the colors of clothes I actually own.  This allows me to get an idea how colors work together when layering.

The downside is that its very hard to get patterns (plaid, etc.) in Excel.  Also, I had to make my best guess as to find the closest color to khaki and the jeans I own. 




 I took pictures of my closet then tried my best to match the colors in Excel at work. 




 I feel your pain.  I'm in a relatively small city and I feel like I have very few occassions to show off my nice clothes.
 




 This is funny.  I've been doing all my layering and outfitting in excel.  I created a person that looks like an 8-bit video game character and match up my outfits by filling the cells.

 So what's the plan when you get married?  Are you expecting the problem to magically go away?  You might as well deal with it now and make the tough suggestion. 




 You should be.  I do the same thing, but she's only my girlfriend.  I would expect myself to be completely open with my spouse.  Some people are very private, but you're his wife and you guys should have an open-access policy. 




 Dude this sounds like me to a tee!  *mind blown* 




 I think you're overexaggerating a bit.  People don't usually get excited when a 6'10" center does a simple two hand dunk under the basket.

But when you see Gerald Green come through the paint and windmill dunk on somebody of equal or taller height then its a big deal.  Because that's pretty rare and hard to do. 




 I went to the store today and didn't see any.  Maybe others will have better luck. 




 Holy crap how did I miss this.  Thanks.  I've also started looking at albums for inspiration. 




 Thanks.  I will keep this in mind. 




 I'm confused.  Are you telling me to splash the alcohol on my face or rub it?  Or both?  Also, won't alcohol dry my skin out?

 No offense to the non-black guys.  It's just that ***I've heard it all before.***

I currently use a pair of Andis T-Outliners to cut my facial hair.  I still get razor bumps but its kept to a minimum.

Every now and then I get the urge to shave with a razor and it **always ends up badly**.  I even splurged on an Art of Shaving kit one time using the brush with the lather and oil before shaving, etc.  I followed the instructions on the dvd and  STILL got crazy razor bumps.

My facial hair is very coarse, thick, and curly.  Even more so than the typical African American's.  To put it in perspective **I can use a depilatory like extra strength Magic Shave, leave it on my face for 30 minutes (double the time listed on the container), and it will still leave a good 30% of my hairs on my face.**  My facial hairs are some tough sons of bitches.

So any input is welcome.  I'd grow out my beard if it didn't look so sparse and patchy.  Also, my beard grain goes in all types of directions so shaving with cream and not being able to see the hair is a risk I'm concerned about.

A search brought me here and I'm really hoping this can solve one of my major dilemmas in life.
