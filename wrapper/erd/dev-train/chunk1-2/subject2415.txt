 Haha, no worries. We still enjoy your contribution!

 I'm sorry I didn't really make that clear. We basically never bring up religion with her. We pray before meals, but that's all.  We don't regularly go to mass, but she wouldn't have to go if she chose not to. We may mention that we feel blessed because something happened, but we wouldn't get into a deep discussion about how God granted us life and it's good, etc. etc.

When she brings it up, she goes into lengthy discussions of "with logic, the Christian God is easily disproven" or something along those lines. I have never said to her face that "God is an obvious fact of life" because no one really knows. Yet she has to shove down our throats that she doesn't believe in God, when we honestly are fine with that.

If we were making her uncomfortable and she spoke her mind, I would understand. But it's more like there is a break in the conversation and she'll say "so I saw this article" and go into a religious rant. I would never do that for her sake, yet she doesn't have the same courtesy for me.

I have friends who are atheist, and we get along fine. We either don't bring up religion, or when we do, we agree to disagree. Just conversation, not debate. My sister just thinks (and she's made this clear, I'm not just saying this) that as an ateist, she is discriminated against, which she most definitely is not. 




 My sister is an atheist and I am Christian. Being Christian, I know that I can't make a real point to my religion because it doesn't make sense; that's why it's called faith. I have no problem with my sister being atheist and think she can believe whatever she wants, yet she regularly brings up the beliefs of Catholics and why she is not one.  She not only does this around me, but around our Catholic family. Then we all get very uncomfortable because there is no way for us to back our beliefs because they are spiritual, not logical. I think she constantly brings it up because she is worried that people won't understand or are displeased with her for being atheist, yet we don't really have any opinion of it, we just don't want to have to explain to her why we believe what we believe because, well, we can't.

**TL;DR** People can believe whatever they like, just don't try to reason your beliefs because you'll just get in a heated discussion that makes everyone uncomfortable and angry.

you're welcome. 









 No, you definitely only want to give them one head shot. They're going to see a lot of people, they want as little from everyone as possible. Even if you will be wearing your glasses most of the time, auditioners want to see what you look like without them. It's just easier for them to know who and what they will be dealing with if you are hired. 




 I agree with TSpange. He/She is concerned that this person may be seeking fame, not a life as a performer. 




 I like it! The clothes and scenery are definitely great. I would definitely suggest taking off the glasses in the future. When you're in an audition, your auditioners want to see your face and your entire face. Also, I might try having the camera from a higher angle than you face. It makes the picture seem lighter and happier, but that's just a preference of mine. Nothing to look deep into.

You look great! 




 That's a really nice quote. I'll have to hang that up in my dressing room some day(; 




 Oh my God, you're right!! I just remembered something!!

My junior high had a little radio station (online, noone listened to it) and they wanted to interview me (because i'm just that awesome, haha). I sang two songs, both of which were very sad. Afterword, I had a friend tell me that someone thought I was actually crying, but my friend said it like it was an insult. Like, why would I be crying? It's just a song about growing up without a father and all the regrets you have... nbd. I was totally embarrassed.

Anyway, thank you so much for that!! This just made this all so clear to me. Thank you, thank you, a million times, thank you!! I'd give you gold if I had money, sorry that I don't): 




 I saw this last night on /new, but I decided not to post a comment... Oh the irony... 




 I think they were practicing on your comment. Sorry about that :/ 




 Totally agree. I try to do this as much as possible, but definitely good advice for me to remember. Thanks so much(: 




 Well, I think I'm pretty much good on your first and second tip, being a trained performer (though they are true and helpful nonetheless), but I think you're right one for tip three. I usually put on a brave face and say I'm not scared, but something is holding me back and I think it might just be me. I think I just have to let go and not be afraid of whatever I'm afraid of. Thanks Johnny Numbskull! 3 




 I am a high school student and a musical theatre actress hopeful. Being that I'm going into theatre, my voice teacher doesn't just have me sing songs, but act them as well (as all singers should). If I am singing a very emotional song, I find myself afraid to really get into character. I don't know why, but I can't just... get to where I should be. I hold myself back.

Does anyone have any tips on what I can do to fearlessly get into character, no matter how... extreme the emotion? 




 lazy ass title... 




 It's actually to the tune of an old drinking song, but I think it does the job as well(: 




 I don't know why so many people are ganging up on you, I'm behind your comment 100%. 




 OH MY GOD YES! This is why one of my goals as a musical theatre actress is to some day sing the nation anthem like I didn't just talk a few muscle relaxers. Personally, I think people screw up the national anthem so bad because they don't think their voice can deliver it well, so they have to fuck it up in order for it to be any good. 




 This may work for some people, but then eventually the reasons you reward yourself become smaller and smaller. Maybe at first, you smoke after cleaning the garage. Then it becomes after you did the dishes that were piling up. Then it's for making your bed in the morning.

Being an addict (not of smoking), I believe once you have an addiction, it never leaves you. You can tame it, but you can't get rid of it. Of course, each person is different, but I don't think it's worth risking. 




 I think it's horrible. The singing is okay, but definitely not up to par with the Broadway performance we all know and love. Also, the acting is just not there. Just lots of stone faces. Luckily, the music is so beautiful, it makes to movie slightly bearable, but the actors just don't do the job of telling such a beautiful story. 









 I love someone that knows a lot about stuff. Even if it seems random and uninteresting, I *love* it. Someone telling me about any topic and being able to listen and learn, I love. I have no idea why, but I think it's awesome. 




 You have to be careful, though. I have a friend who upon meeting someone will hug them and even begin to hang on them. Even though I am around this person a lot, I automatically feel uncomfortable around her when she gets close. Just be careful to hug when it counts. 




 I do this all the time because, as an actress, I naturally get nervous when looking someone in the eye. (It's like I'm looking my audience in the eye, just scares me instantly). I've only had one person realize it, and it because very awkward because they honestly thought there was something wrong with their nose when I would talk to them. 




 With in limits, I think. I know someone who in an instance of meeting them will hug them and ask them personal questions a friend would ask. It gets very uncomfortable, very fast. But of course, when I meet some one that will automatically be nice to me, talk to me, joke with me, and whatnot, then that's fine. I love that, in fact.(:

 I am so sorry hun. If you ask me, that is sexual assault. go to the doctor as soon as you can, and the the police. I am *so* sorry, no one deserves this treatment. And also, in my opinion, if you never wanted it to happen in the first place, you didn't lose your virginity. You have to freely choose to give that away, no one can take it from you. I hope you heal well. Please know that our hearts all go out to you. 




 I'm sure a lot of people here will think this is a very minor problem, but to me right now it's huge. Right now, I'm on my school's drill (dance) team, and it's every single day, so it's basically my life for the next four years. I plan on going into musical theatre, so I enjoy being involved in my school's show choir as well. The problem is that since my drill team takes up such a huge part of my life, by next year I'll have to chose between drill and choir. If I quit drill, then I can join more of the after school choirs [women's, jazz (which is basically more advanced), etc.] and open my schedule to more rest, homework time, and other activities that I wouldn't have even been able to consider before. But if I give up on drill team, I would also be giving up a huge part of my life: performing at football games, not being with my team which is like a family, competitions, an everyday activity, a great exercise, and a huge label (that I really like). One of my biggest issues is that I enjoy being a leader, and not just a member, so I couldn't be a leader of either if I'm in both, because, sadly, conflicts will force me to choose. (I'll be able to stay in choir no matter what, but a much lesser portion that I would prefer.) Also, just to note, I am a very skilled singer (as I've been told by professionals, I'm not just conceited) and not the greatest dancer, but I'm pretty good and much better than someone without any experience. Note, if I gave up drill, I could also start dance lessons. It amy seem small to a lot of you, but it's a huge part of my life right now and could determine how the rest of my life pans out. Of course this is a very personal decision, but does anyone have any opinions or points that may help me sway one way or the other? Thank you!

P.S. Sorry that my thoughts are kind of scattered!

 May I ask why? I found it very contradictory and the music kind of seemed half-hearted and kind of like a music box: easy to listen to, but isn't going to make you think or feel anything at all. 




 OH MY GOD YES!! I just saw an ad for this on facebook today and I seriously got up and started singing and dancing. 




 Thank you so much for sharing your story, it really means a lot.  Your motivation and sweet words will definitely get me through a ton throughout my life, I know.  Thanks, you are so kind for everything you've said to me (: 




 Good for you. I'm glad you have such strength(: We're all glad you're here. Thanks for staying with us. 




 Thank you. I truly appreciate your acceptance and support. Thank you for understanding, or at least trying to3 




 Thank you so much. This really and truly made me tear up because it made me so much happier. I've never had anyone tell me that I didn't have to be perfect, no joke. Thank you. You may have just drastically improve my life. (:

 Hi.  I'm a fourteen-year-old girl who just started high school and is pursuing a career in musical theatre.  I'm just going to say this right now, I'm not some sort of Rachel Barry (Berry?) wanna-be or some sort of YouTube singer that has no talent or real aspiration, just looking for fame and money, no.  I've been aspiring toward the theatres of Broadway since I can remember and I don't want any sort of fame or money. I just want to sing and be heard. And yes, I liked it before it was cool, and I'm fully aware that makes me sound like a hipster.

Anyway, like I said, I just started high school, but I have all the expectation piled on me. Honestly and truthfully, I'm good. Some might say great or amazing, but I'm not trying to brag, I'm just letting you know.  Because of this, I'm expected to be amazing and inspirational and all that, but I'm not. My mother expects me to get perfect grades, my sister expects me to get the lead in the musical as a freshman, my entire choir expects me to be perfect and on top of my game every day and never make a mistake and they think it's okay to put all the attention on me sometimes when it makes me uncomfortable (because come one, it's a choir), and it goes on and on and on.

I can't handle it.

I know my limits and my abilities, but noone else does. I'm supposed to be perfect. When I make an achievement, noone cares because it's expected. When I break down, it's just not okay, I'm supposed to handle all of this. When I make a bad grade, my mother tells me that I won't get into college. When I make a good one, it doesn't affect her. I, honest to God, got a 101% in French (granted, it's only the first half of the first quarter), but she was unimpressed because the rest of my grades weren't quite there.  They're all B's and A's, and again: I. Just. Started. High. School.

I'm breaking down.

When I was twelve, I was diagnosed with clinical depression. All of my friends had abandoned me for a dumb reason I'm not willing to get into and my parents thought I didn't need help. Every time I reached out to someone for help, they thought I was lying, or be overly-dramatic. I had three failed suicide attempts. (Note: I AM NOT CURRENTLY SUICIDAL. THIS WAS A YEAR AND A HALF AGO.) Finally, my principal caught wind of my situation somehow and decided to suspend me until I got medical help. (Just saying, she's a bitch. Never, ever force anyone with a mental problem to get help against their will.) I went to a therapist, I went to the hospital. My parents were in shock. They thought I could handle my own problems. They didn't realize my mom not being there and my dad's abusive, alcoholic, depressive behavior had rubbed off on me. They still don't. They blame everything all on my own inability to take care of myself. I got out three days before my thirteenth birthday.

Now here I am, going down a scary path again. The only friends I can get right now and mean to me, selfish, and expect me to be perfect, my parents are ignoring me, and I have all these.... expectations.

I'm not okay.

I want to self injure again, I'm inclined to take pain killers (I'm not doing these things, nor do I plan to. Just inclined. I have self-control.), I'm lonely, I'm sad...

I'm not perfect.


Well, I guess that's all I really have to say. Thanks for listening to me ramble about myself. I really appreciate it. 




 i was just thinking this today. so truee.

 Thank you aswell. As a Christian who is also quite liberal, I get nervous telling people about my religion because I'm worried that they will react like someone from /r/atheism . People like you make it less scary and remind me that I'm part of a wonderful community, even if we have a few nut jobs, like every other religion.

I know that this is all talk because you don't believe, but I do hope you find God someday. I hope this doesn't come off as pushing my faith on you, but I know that He loves you. I hope you have a wonderful life full of prosperity and happiness.

 Drop your vowels a bit. When in choir, you make all you're vowels very "tall" or "proper" sounding. If you simply relax your tone, you should get more of a pop sound, or whatever you're looking for. If that doesn't work for you, practice saying one line by itself three times. Then say the same line three times in rhythm. Then sing it, trying to match how you said it, but to the correct tune. It should provide a more relaxed and spoken sound.

I hope this helps! 




 Right, but he was 61 at the time and didn't need any hospitalization (or at least didn't receive any), so it was definitely less. 




 I was twelve, and I tried to bleed out. I cut my wrist, but I didn't fully understand just how far I had to go. Eventually I got to weak from crying, etc. to keep trying, and I gave up waiting for another day.

I also tried ODing once, but again, was too young to know just how much one must consume to actually die. I only took six (maybe more, I don't really remeber) dayquils, but that's all I really had access to. Another time I took what was left of a bottle of Excedrin migraine (like 30 pills or so). I thought I would get high, pass out, etc., but I just got sick. I mean, really, really sick. No pain relief at all, just my stomach felt like absolute hell. I decided to throw up as much of it as I could. That time I think wasn't actually a suicide attempt, but really stupid that I could have possibly died from, since I was 12 or 13.

I'm one of those people that believes everything happens for a reason. I think I went through my suicidal phase so young, because I didn't have a full grasp on just how to take ones life. Now I just have to hope that I don't go threw another one.

Hope this answers your question(: 




 Nice repost. 




 They probably do. I know people that do this, and they think it's not obvious. It is. 




 Oops, sorry, I don't know what I was thinking there. I meant more like 1.5ish. Woah, I honestly don't know why I put that... 




 This isn't for advice animals. Go to a subreddit like /r/confessions or something. 




 Wow, that's amazing! I saw her in Les Mis in Fort Meyers, and I had heard so much about and of her. She is truly an amazing performer. It's great to hear that she's an awesome person as well.

Thanks so much! Hope unifieds went well(: 




 I have a very similar situation. My dad is a slight alcoholic, so whenever anyone I know / am around is drunk, I suddenly get scared and nervous. My dad has done very stupid things when he gets drunk, so naturally, I get scared. For example, my freshman year of high school, he actually picked my up raging drunk (like probably 1.5 or higher blood-alcohol level).

It is a naturally feeling to be nervous/uncomfortable with drinking, it just depends on the person. I personally feel like it's just stupid. Why drink something that's going to make your weird and out of control? You shouldn't need anything to have fun, you should just get high off life and enjoy it with a clear mind. It almost turns people into animals, in my mind. They can't actually make good decisions because they're not capable of reasoning. They just do.

And, to be honest, I have taken sips of alcohol from time to time, but only so that curiosity doesn't get the best of me and I get flat drunk. I just sip on it, realize it's gross, and move on. You don't want to risk the curiosity of why people do it getting the best of you.

I personally decide to set myself apart from people whilst intoxicated, and have learned that I can't stop them. It's a hard concept to deal with, and sometimes I get a lot of anxiety about it, but I know that I can't deal with being around that stuff, but I can't stop anyone. It's just one of those things that's completely out of my hands.

I'm sorry that you have to experience this, it's really hard. I honestly wish noone would drink; it's so stupid, and people die everyday from it. You just have to accept that it's a social norm and not much you can do about it, but decide that you're not going to.


Tl;dr   It sucks, and you're feelings are totally normal, but you can only control what you do.

EDIT:  Crazy typo on BAC, fix courtesy of nomopyt 




 What about with the couple? 




 I was at a presentation freshman year of high school with my entire class, and they showed a picture of a Uterus with cervical cancer. The speaker at one point said "Can we get a teacher over here?" We all seriously thought he was going to use female teachers to demonstrate something beyond embarrassing, but it had turned out a girl had passed out and needed to be carried out.

Tl;dr  A girl passed out a picture of cancerous uterus. 




 Can you tell me the story? 




 If you're going to use my single brew Keurig, throw the fucking pod away. It's not my responsibility to throw *your* shit away.

 You're somewhat correct. Users are supposed to take annoying, painful, etc. things they find in their daily life and, of course, blame Obama (all jokingly, of course). Redditors are not supposed the make things up, though. It's like if one were to take a picture of a flower, photoshop it to have two "heads," and then posted it to a subreddit like /r/mildlyinteresting. It would be interesting, if it were true.

And I knew all the things about the oily skin, but thank you still. My problem is just that I don't hydrate enough during the day. It's a horrible habit that I can't seem to break.

Thank you so, so much (again)!!3 




 Thanks so much for your reply! I have oily, acne prone skin, so I'm inclined to say full coverage, but I'm worried that it'll be too... fake looking I suppose. I normally go with medium coverage, but I probably would prefer a fuller coverage. And I definitely want a matter finish.

Thanks so much!! 




 I'm always buy my makeup at drug stores / target because I'm fifteen and don't really have enough money to invest in good quality makeup. Now I'm very excited because I received a large sum of money for my birthday, and can invest in some good quality makeup! My plan is to go to a Mac store and just get some foundation, powder, simple things that won't use up all the money I received, but I will be very happy with.
So I was wondering if you ladies and gents had some advice for me on what I should buy: favorite products, dos and don'ts, etc.

Thank you so much!

 These are fantastic! I prefer the third, glasses are usually not the best for headshots, in my opinion. Your auditioners want to see your entire face and what their working with. You also look beamingly happy, and it made me feel happier instantly. It was definitely a stand out.

Great photos!! I wish you the best of luck. 




 How stupid are people? 




 I love this one. 




 *applause* 




 If you go to the frontpage and click on "Submit a new text post," it'll let you. 














 Reynaud's is a bitch. That's why we moved to Texas. Invest in a good pair of mittens, they will save you from serious discomfort. 




 The photography isn't great, but as for your work, I think it's very nice. Facial expressions are good and the angles are flattering. Just, as most have said, invest in a better photographer.

Best of luck(: 




 The color white and grey in general (not necessarily together). I don't know what it is, but it will make a man stand out in a very sexy way. 




 Old Spice is fucking delicious. I am instantly more attracted to a guy who wears Old Spice. 




 Oh God yes. This is the sexiest thing a man can wear. 




 Yes. I already find you attractive. 




 I assume (s)he means tighter as in not sagging, but skinny jeans are not the most attractive thing on a guy (though it's usually not a turn off). 




 Damn, girl!! GORGEOUS3 




 I moved to Texas four years ago, things like this don't fase me any more. 




 I'm currently in high school and hoping to wait until marriage to have sex. I know that it is a difficult commitment, but I want to do that for my future husband because I know that he's worth it. I haven't entered a very large dating atmosphere, so I'm worried just in general how that will affect my dating life. Is anyone currently going down this path? Do you have any advice or stories to help me out. All entries are welcome and appreciated.

Thank you! 




 TIL Quakers are still around. 




 I've had a similar situation with "hearing" a voice. I was fourteen and upset about something stupid and I asked something, though I don't remember what, and I felt as if I heard the word "yes." I can't believe it was over something so stupid, but I've heard others say they've heard this voice. I when I found out about others, it helped me believe that I wasn't just a young, hormonal girl, so I thought you might like to know.

Amazing story, made me smile(: Thanks for sharing. 




 Gorgeous! 




 Some people actually believe that... 




 I cannot believe this real... Congrats, femmes françaises!
