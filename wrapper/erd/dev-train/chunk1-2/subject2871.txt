 Meh. I like my shape. My meds made me gain a couple pounds though. And I can't just go to a gym even if I wanted to.  




 Yes. 




 Thanks. Purses are dumb, tool belts are where it's at.  




 Yes it is. I have a lot of health conditions so if I have any weight on my shoulders they get horribly sore. Also I love my tool belt. It cost $10 and will last forever.  




 Earl? It doesn't get in the way. 




 How does someone even look like they like anal? 




 How is it self destructive? I'm just wondering how clothing can self destructive.  




 Not into anal. Not goth. 




 And bored. It's crazy how many girls on here are gorgeous but they are saying how self conscious they are when they are all way prettier than I am. Not that I think I am bad looking. I am pretty confident in my appearance especially when I have makeup on. I just don't look like all the other pretty girls here.     
I live an "alternative" life and have unconventional looks (physically and with how I choose to dress). So I'm not really concerned about looking like a fashion model. But I suppose I am curious as to what people think.     
Thanks!

 Looks like I am about to be diagnosed with HEDS. It feels like I am going to lose everything. I am back in my home state seeking treatment because of how much pain I have been in. I had to go on leave at work, leave my home that I share with my boyfriend, and leave all the dogs I work with. So chances are if I can't go back to work because of my body I lose all those other things with it. My life means nothing if I can't be where I need to be.     
How do the rest of you guys function? Do you work and go to school? Or if you're on disability I take it you have hobbies and such.       
I have no idea what will happen, I just want to be with the dogs and my partner.  




 Still waiting on the geneticist but it's looking like that's what is going on with me. If that is the case then that means no more hard labor so I won't be able to go back to the job that I love. And if I can't support myself I don't know how I would go back to my home and my boyfriend (I am currently in another state with family trying to get treatment).       
I just don't know what to do or what will happen. I can't lose my partner, my job, all the dogs at work, and my home all at once. How am I supposed to be a person if it is like this?      
Even if I went on ssi I would have to do it here because it pays almost nothing where I live. But that could take forever. I want to go the fuck home and have a life.      
And on another note I am in so much fucking pain all the time I am constantly angry. Why is it doctors always seem to be shoving pain pills in people's faces but when I need them it is not an option? They tell me to eat better and all that garbage but I can't even stand at the stove for a few minutes. Maybe if I could take two wimpy pain pills a day I could actually attempt to take care of myself.  




 I am a 23 year old female and have many medical conditions. (CRPS, TMJ, arthritis, hyperothyroid, hypermobility, maybe fibromyalga). I am currently in the process of trying to get it all figured out so I have been seeing a bunch of doctors because I have been so unwell that I can't work and had to leave my job that I love.      
Basically I am just waiting to see a geneticist because it is looking like I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. Which would make SO MUCH sense.      
Long story short the collagen in my body won't do its job so things won't stay connected and are very bendy.       
So about my ribs, the very bottom front ribs on each side seem to slightly overlapped by the ones above it. More so on my left. They are both also curled in a bit almost like a candy cane or something. Because of how bendy all of me is and how much cartilage make up the front ribs I can actually reach under them and bend them outward so they are straight. When I let go it makes sort of a thunk or a popping noise. Which as you can imagine is a delightful party trick.   
I have just always wanted to know if this is something that happens to other people and has a name. It doesn't really look very abnormal or anything and it doesn't hurt at all so I never remember to ask my doctor but my ribs have been like this my whole life.        
Thanks for reading.         
[P.S. I don't know if you really need this information but I am about 5' and 130 lbs. Farley healthy weight for me. My ethnic background is French, Irish, Welsh, Spanish, Mexican, and Filipino.] 









 I don't sew much so excuse any ignorance.       
I have a dress like this and love it. When I tried to search for more I had no idea what to call it and can hardly find any. It is a somewhat obscure design but I know there are plenty out there. I got the one I have at a little Indian import shop.    
Super basic design, when you lie it flat is is totally square and just has a cinched waist.      
http://imgur.com/ERdLixZ       
I am considering trying to make a dress with the same basic concept but was thinking about using a jersey knit fabric (because it's soft and stretchy and the edges don't need to be stitched). It's also a fabric I can put paint on using stamps or stencils. Will I run into any problems with using a stretch fabric? How much fabric do you think I will need? 




 I am staying with a friend and have free range of her kitchen. I decided I wanted some hot chocolate because it's a rainy Netflix sort of day and I remembered there is some Hershey's cocoa powder in the pantry. Great! That's what I usually make cocoa with, generally following their basic recipe that is on the back of the container. [heat cocoa and sugar on stove in a small amount of water until desolved, add milk and heat on low, then add a couple of drops of vanilla extract.]       
BUT. Once I was heating the cocoa I realized the the powder was the special dark edition. Then when I went to look for vanilla extract I happened to see some orange extract so I used that instead.     
Best. Hot. Chocolate. Ever.       
Edit: I am significantly better at cooking than I am at spelling. 









 Just looking for feedback. Whenever I tell people I have anxiety I know I am coming off as emotionally anxious. The thing is that I don't feel that way. I have depression and all so I do have emotional issues but I am generally not nervous. I have hyperthyroidism which is probably the source of most of my anxiety.       
My symptoms are mostly increased heart rate, sweaty palms and feet, shakey hands, labored breathing, trouble sleeping, fatigue, and some general uneasy feelings. I don't really feel nervous so much as just discontent because of the physical symptoms.           
Anyone else?  




 It can be something small or something big. I just think it is good to project some of our concerns in a different direction sometimes and give the good things in life more credit. Not to downplay any serious issues. But sometimes the bad can even amplify the good.       
For me there are many things I try and stop and appreciate. Though all too much is overlooked. Even the fact that I have running water in my home is something that is so convenient that I forget that I am privileged to have it.      
Some of the biggest things are my boyfriend and my dog. They love me so actively. My boyfriend doesn't always understand what I am going through and can't always comfort me when I need it, but he is so supportive I couldn't ask for more. He cooks for me when I can't, he picks up after me, and works a ton of hours to support both of us while I am unable to work. He is my hero.         
I also want to add that my mother left her awful husband recently an is now with a man that treats her like a queen. That woman is a saint and for the first time in her life she is being treated the way she deserves. I have yet to meet the new guy but I am beyond grateful for him.       
So what do you have in your life that is wonderful?       
[Here's a picture of me and my boys.](http://i.imgur.com/lEp2m8B.jpg)          
I would love to see your pictures as well.  









 I left the city I live in a week ago to seek medical treatment in the area I am from. Today I saw a pain specialist who sat in the room with me for almost an hour listening to what I had to say and asking me a bunch of questions. It felt great to actually have a medical professional listen to me.      
The clinic is a bit weird in the sense that they don't treat patients, they mostly work in tandem with a primary care doctor. It would be frustrating but they really seem to know what they are doing so I don't mind. The doctor told me she wanted to double check my thyroid for a rare condition, get me a bone scan, do more tests for autoimmune diseases, and see a specialist they have there who seems to know a lot about fibromyalga. They ended up having an opening with him tomorrow. So once I see him and get his opinion I just need to go to a GP for them to run all the tests. I feel like I am finally on the path to get all of the diagnoses I need.     
Hopefully I wont have to deal with any more doctors that wont or don't know how to treat me. 




 This actually happened yesterday/the day before but I did not have the energy to post it.
FU Part 1:     
So I was flying from one city to another and had an hour long layover in Dallas. Turns out the plane was having issues so they informed everyone that they weren't boarding yet. Ten minutes later they tell everyone they are boarding. Twenty minutes after that they inform everyone that the plane once again has issues but it had been decided that it could not be flown and they were working on finding a new plane but it may take several hours.     
I should probably add that I am traveling to get treatment because I am having medical issues. The day of the flight I had just been prescribed new meds. Turns out they make me loopy. Very loopy.     
Back to the announcement, as soon as everyone hears this half of them sigh and grumble in unison. Except me. My reaction was a quick burst of laughter. I tend to find situations like that funny as it is but along with the meds I had a brief moment of inability to contain myself. 
Turns out my sunny disposition was unappreciated. I am pretty sure at least half the flight heard me which lead to half the flight hating me. Now I'm thinking "Great, now I'm stuck with these people for at least six hours."      
FU Part 2:      
The airline finds a plane that is landing in two hours that we will use once those passengers are off of it. All of us waiting for our flight now move to the new gate and hunker down to wait for the plane. At this point I am exhausted, feel awful because of my medical problems, and just want a bed. Here is where I fuck up again. I fall asleep. The reason I let that happen is that I usually wake up easily if anything is going on around me and figured that the movement of my hundred and some fellow passengers would wake me. I guess not. And the fact that half of them hated me probably played a roll in the fact that no one bothered to wake me up.    
I ended up waking as the plane was taking off. It was the middle of the night and I had to search the whole airport to find an agent to get me on the next flight which wasn't until the next morning. By the time I was telling the agent I had missed my flight I was crying and she eventually got the whole story (of the medical issues and the sleeping, not the bit about the laugh). She had me set up to stay at a hotel but then one of her co workers basically cock blocked it from happening so I ended up sleeping on the cold hard floor once again.     
It was an exhausting adventure and by the time I got here I was feeling all kinds of weird. Finally got good sleep last night though so it worked out.     
TL;DR: Traveling in search of medical treatment because I feel like garbage, thought my delayed flight was funny, pissed off the other passengers, fell asleep, missed my flight, had to stay the night in the airport. 




 I am looking into some multimedia decorative crafts and I am hoping for some advice.    
My original idea is to decorate canes, crutches, and walkers. Specifically for children. (picture some elbow crutches with frozen characters and glitter)     
So what I am looking for is some kind of sealant that will go on clear and stay that way that is durable. So if I were to paint onto the metal and add stickers and so on I want to be able to coat it in something that will seal it for good. The problem is that I dont know anything about acrylics or resin or whatever I need to use...    
Help. 




 I am currently based out of Auburn and Olympia so those areas are good too. I have an appointment with a pain specialist at UW soon but they apparently do not prescribe any kinds of meds (?!weird?!) so I am also looking for a primary care doctor that is willing to put some effort into someone like us that has many complications. I am also on the hunt for a rheumatologist.     
Any suggestions would be great. 




 So years ago I had a bit of a problem with abusing pain medication. At the ever so mature age of 18 I quit because it was stupid. My sister on the other hand never did and now she shoots heroin. The last thing I want is to be like her.       
Now that my disease is kicking my ass I actually need pain meds. (Chances are that I started taking them in the first place because I have always been in pain and turns out those drugs help with that.) So a couple weeks ago I ended up at the ER and was prescribed 20 norco. I did alright with those and they lasted a week until I saw my gp. I thought that I could overcome my problem with meds because I have learned some lessons since I was 18. Well my gp prescribed me 60 norco to last a month. That was a little over a week ago and I have three left which are now in the possession of my wonderful boyfriend. I feel so stupid. Its stressful because I know I need them if I want to get out of bed ever.     
In a few days I have an appointment with a rheumatologist who I was referred to by a pain specialist. So hopefully I am on track to begin getting treatment. Ideally I want to get something done that will get me to a place where I dont need pain meds. But until then they are necessary. So you can see my predicament.       
I think I have a plan to help the situation. (I know, you probably already think I'm screwed due to my stupidity.) Basically I just plan to have my boyfriend hide them from me and distribute them as they are supposed to be taken. I know myself enough to know that I know I wont dig around to find them. If anything I will have him count them and keep track. I know that if he is keeping tabs on me I couldn't bear to disappoint him.         
Do I sound like I'm being reasonable or do I sound like a total idiot who should just have suffer because I can't keep my shit together?  




 What made you decide you want to be nice? Or have you pretty much always been like that? What are your thoughts and views on how to behave towards others?  




 Its strange how your sense of taste changes.  




 After being told by a pain specialist that he cant treat me because basically I am too messed up and my disease is too far progressed he referred me to a rheumatologist. I called to make an appointment and the lady told me he doesn't treat CRPS and I should see a pain specialist (lovely right, I had just told her that is who referred me). Then she told me that there are two other doctors there that will treat it but they don't have openings for a while. After that I called my gp in tears because I didn't know what to do and was almost out of my pain meds that I had gotten from the ER. She was actually helpful and prescribed me more to tide me over until I can see a rheumatologist. Today I got an appointment with one for next week.       
My main concern besides getting treated for my pain is that my boyfriend is exhausted from working so much to make up for the fact that I can only work two days a week. I know he loves me and wants to do everything he can but at the same time I know he would be relieved if I were out of his hair. While I appreciate everything he is doing and think he is amazing for it I cant help but be hurt that the relationship might not be strong enough to deal with me and my shitty medical issues. We are basically in the mindset of being a married couple, but I guess its not to the point of 'through sickness and health'. Which breaks my heart. I guess it's one of those things that is great in theory but not so much in practice.       
So hopefully my appointment will go well and I can start treatment and begin to get better so I can pull more of my own weight to take pressure off him. If not I may fly back home (on the other side of the country) and stay with my dad and best friend. They are near Seattle so my dad can drive me to appointments and I will probably be able to get better treatment. I just really dont want to do that. It would be good an many ways but at the same time I want to be home with my boyfriend and step dog. I also dont want to risk losing my job. I really love my work.        
Being so young and in such poor health is devastating.        
My condition is so complicated that I am worried about finding a doctor that is interested in getting to the bottom of it. You would think that more doctors would be interested in solving a puzzle. Not only do I have CRPS but I have it in my entire body and never had an initial injury that caused it. It also didn't seem to have ever started in one place and then spread, it has just always been everywhere. I still have yet to hear of anyone who had the same.       
Everything is so convoluted.  




 For the past few months my pain has been getting worse, in the past month it became unbearable and I had to take time off work. I have been trying to figure out how to get help. Last Sunday I went to the ER because the pain in my hips and jaw was so bad. They gave me norco for it and they knew I had an appointment set up to take care of it.      
Today I finally had an appointment with a pain specialist and he basically told me that I am too far fucked up for him to even know where to begin treating me. He didn't even know people with my condition could have it in their entire body. And he told me he cant help me with the meds because he doesn't know how he is going to fix me. I feel shattered. The hope of not being in horrible pain 24/7 is now gone. I have no idea how I am supposed to get though this. He gave be a referral to a rheumatologist so I will pursue that. I just dont want to get my hopes up.      
Edit: I called the rheumatologist to make an appointment and the lady checked with him and apparently he said that he doesn't treat my condition and that I should see a pain specialist. Fucking seriously?       
On the bright side I called my GP and told her everything that happened and that I just dont know what to do and she prescribed me some more of the pain pills I got from the ER. So at least theres that. They dont help as much as I would like but its a lot better than nothing.  




 I thought it would be good to start a thread for everyone to vent and discuss the things we cant do anymore. From little things to the things that we are passionate about. What do you miss most? What are some alternative things you have found to occupy yourself? Maybe we can throw around some ideas and help each other out?       
I'm currently not able to work until I can get treatment. Its sad because I work with rescue dogs and miss them and I miss being active. Before that I was a working musician and performer. I fell out of it for a few reasons but part of it is that I cant do the traveling and making it out all the time on my bike. I play washtub bass which is too physically demanding and a banjo ukulele that I can play but only for so long and my fingers hurt later. And now even singing is a problem because my jaw pain is so severe.       
I also used to do sideshow performing, primarily as a contortionist. As you can imagine that is no longer an option (not to mention things like the bed of nails which is way out of the question). I really miss it. I miss doing shows and getting free drinks and having a blast. Now I'm in bed constantly while all my friends go on bike rides and have fun. Its even difficult for me to do a puzzle I'm working on.  




 And I hated it. I'm 22, at a reasonable weight,  and dont look sick. Today I'm having a high pain day. Usually I don't need a scooter or I just sit in the cart and make my boyfriend push me because I would rather look like I'm dicking around then like I have health problems.     
Anyway, the variety of looks I got made me incredibly uncomfortable. Being a white punk in a dominantly black southern area that happens a lot anyway. Haha. But a lot of the looks were either the sympathetic 'bless yer heart' looks or they would look at me like I'm a jerk for using a scooter that someone unwell might need. When I was returning the scooter a guy came up to me and with a dirty look said "Can I have that?". Yeah dude, I'm half way off.     
Luckily I'm not as irritable as some days. I just wanted to vent to some people who understand having an invisible disease. I know this is not a major issue,  but its the little things we have to deal with.      
Edit: You guys are fantastic.  




 The reoccurring dream I had happened during the same dream session. It happened once, I dreamt about some other things, and then it happened again. Pretty abnormal or me.     
What happened is I was in a car someone else was driving and I was giving directions. We took a ramp that came to a rusty metal bridge that crossed the bay where I live and once we were on it I realized that the bridge just ended and we had to stop so not to drive off into the water. It was only afterwards when I got out of the car that it was scary. For some reason it just ended and there were no signs on the way indicating danger. When I got out I walked to the edge to look down into the water and saw a semi truck that had drove off and landed in the water which was fairly shallow as I could see the floor of the bay. The truck was standing vertically with its front end on the floor and its back end up in the air, half way submerged. Then it tipped over. And when I headed back to get off the bridge it was smaller and had lots of rusty metal posts and bars both vertical and horizontal that I had to dip and climb through. Like a little obstacle. Im an agile person so it wasn't difficult.      
The second time it happened it was all exactly the same except for this time there were two semi trucks next to each other in the same situation as the first one. There was also several men in the water heading towards the trucks, like they were a rescue team. The trucks both tipped over before the men got to them. When I headed back it was the same obstacle but this time it was more memorable. There was also a little girl I was with waiting for me who I had to tell to stay there.      
I also just had another dream that stands out, I don't remember a lot of the context but I was breaking my foot. Like I jammed it in a doorway between the frame and something else and slammed the door on my foot. It had something to do with giving up being a dancer which I was in my dream as well as in reality. It was a strangely desperate act.      
These dreams feel significant somehow, more so than my usual dreams. Thought I would share if anyone found them interesting or wanted to give me their opinion on what they might mean. 




 I have had pain for as long as I can remember,  it got worse in my teens and I was diagnosed with CRPS at 16. Since then I have pretty much gone untreated, though I take Tylenol and ibuprofen regularly off and on.     
Since I have been working a more physically demanding job I have gotten 40 times worse. Sometimes I cant get dressed in the morning, other times I would come home from work and have to sleep on the couch because my bed was a loft and I couldn't climb the five stairs. There are good days and bad days but it was getting to be too much, I got prescribed cymbalta for my clinical depression and that has helped. But now I am having situational depression and its making my pain more than I can handle. 
A week ago I had to have a procedure done, it has caused a lot of my depression and kept me out of work a bit. For the procedure I was prescribed 10 Tylenol 3 tablets with two refills. It definitely dulled the pain it was prescribed for, and it almost eliminated my regular daily pain. Because of the situation I didn't even realize that I wasnt in pain until I needed a refill and my pharmacy was closed. When my pain came back I couldn't believe I was in that kind of pain constantly.  How do I do this every day and also work all week? Im only 22, how can I look forward to anything when its all downhill from here?      
When that happened I broke down because its all too much. Work, pain, procedure, pain, work. Lucky for me my boyfriend is here for me. I have decided I need to try and take some time off work. Which is a whole other issue trying to secure my place there. But I need to find a pain doctor,  and I need time to get myself better. I just want to be able to work, but right now I'm miserable at work because I'm in pain and irritable. Its also stressful that I may be risking my job which is one of the most important things to me. I dont get paid great but I work with rescue dogs and I don't know what I would do if I didn't have that.       
Its really hard to not just be angry about everything. I feel like I'm being cheated out of my life.  




 I was diagnosed at 16 with CRPS that effects my entire body, I'm now 22 and have been functioning through my pain since then. They had me doing physical therapy for a bit but I stopped because of the commute and it wasn't helping.        
A few months ago my pain and depression became so severe that I finally found a doctor and was prescribed cymbalta which has virtually made my depression a non issue. My pain on the other hand has not gotten better, in fact it has become worse since I started a more physically demanding job. My doctors response was to double my dose which still didn't help so I'm planning to go in again soon and see what can be done.    
One of the struggles I have with my health is that I feel like I'm faking it due to my surroundings seeing as no one can really understand. Its like my disease is some  kind of mythical creature or I'm just being dramatic. I take it that this is not uncommon? I mean besides my truly empathetic loved ones no one will be able to grasp  the severity of my condition.  Its not like my pain is visible (unless I have hives).     
On that note, like many of us I have to fake it most of the time and suppress the fact that I'm in pain and exausted. I have to support myself somehow and if I were to go on disability I would become lazy and miserable. So I work six hours a day six days a week mostly being pulled around by pit bulls and other dirty jobs. I probably should do something less physical but I love those dogs too much.   
Anyway (im real bad at words n stuff) I really just wanted to hear from others with chronic pain and specifically CRPS as I have never talked to anyone with the same condition as me. Im wondering how it effects others.  




 Except of course the dark place my mind is trapped in. The past month everything has been fine. I started cymbalta which has almost completely suppressed my depression and anxiety, I have a great job now, and my boyfriend has been awesome. The only thing that has been shitty is my health. Im in pain constantly because of a disease I have and my job requires physical labor as well as riding my dumpy bike to and from work. Sometimes I come home and just sob because of the pain but emotionally I have been pretty stable dispite that. But this morning before I woke up I had some really disturbing dreams. I dont know if many other people experience this but sometimes when I have dreams like this the bad feeling they give stick around. I cant shake them. And I cant sleep. I dont know whats going on with me. Everything has been fine until today. I don't want to go to work tomorrow.  














 Mainly looking for resources about training specifically to her needs. I work at a dog rescue as of recently and new I would fall in love with one of them and bring hone home. And well, I found her. So here's my situation.    
I live with my boyfriend and roommates as well as my step dog. My step dog (Lucifer) is almost three and male. He is pretty well trained (he listens and understands amazingly) but he is extremely aggressive and anxious with strangers as he is also a rescue. He gets along with female dogs easily and sometimes with males. So I knew I would have to pick a girl dog. Which leads me to Beetle.      
I absolutely fell in love with her (along with a couple others) and decided she would be the one to take home based on her personality knowing she will fit in great with our little family. She is extremely friendly and VERY hyper. Not sure of her age but I was looking at her teeth yesterday and she is probably around three. Also she is probably some sort of black lab, German shepherd, pit mix. Mostly lab I think. The problems Im going to have with training her is basic obedience. She doesnt listen well or know commands, she jumps up on everyone, and she bites at her leash sometimes. Occasionally I can get her to listen like with the leash biting. I just worry about training her at her age.     
Any tips or online resources would be greatly appreciated.     
Edit: Heres my Beetle. http://imgur.com/rfd2uIa http://imgur.com/BSa6zhL 




 I love my boyfriend. And I love our dog. Its technically his dog that he has had for a few years. Hes a big, dumb, loving doberman. I have known them both for about a year but at this point my boyfriend even refers to me as his mom. Now since my boyfriend has had the dog longer I feel like I dont really have veto power to banish the dog from the bed.     
Heres my thing. I don't actually have an issue with the act of the dog being in the bed with us. What I dont like is the bed being covered in short little hairs and stinking completely like dog. Another issue is that we dont have a washer and dryer on top of the fact that we ride bikes and dont have a car. I happen to be the person in the relationship that has a friend with a washer and dryer. So I do all of our laundry. Which is fine when its just clothes. Not bedding.      
On top of all that a couple weeks ago the dog got sick and puked all over our bed. Ok. It happens. I spent half a day at my friends doing the laundry. Today I come home from work and the dog peed on the bed for the second time in the last couple days. Not sure why that is happening because he NEVER pees on the bed. If it were a regular thing I can see why I could banish the dog. But he has always slept on the bed. Usually its fine besides the fact that he is stinky.       
So reddit, would I be a wicked step mother if I wanted the bed to just be a place for humans? What are the rules of these short of things when you start seeing someone with pets?


tl;dr: What are the rules with pets and SOs?    
    
Edit: You guys are awesome. I want to reply to yall individually bit im on mobile. So youre right, I should get a dog bed. The only thing is we are up on a loft bed (we built it with stairs so the dog could get up) so I suppose the bed would have to go on our little landing. I will have to talk to my guy. Maybe we can still keep the dog on the bed on cold nights and such. 




 I would really love to learn more songs as im planning to get back into busking. Im a female musician, I sing and play a banjo uke. Ideally it would be great to learn more jazz and blues stuff but I also love bluegrass and my style is not horribly limited so anything helps. I love spooky melodic vocals. Also if anyone knows of other sub reddits I could x post to that would be great. Here is what I have so far for my set list... (I know many more songs but I have decided that these are the only ones I want to perform).      
Hey there little red riding hood by sam sham.        
St. James infermary.       
Fat gal by (merle?) Haggard.      
Tonight you belong to me (not sure about who its by, from the jerk)       
honkey cat by elton john.     
You know im no good by amy winehouse.     
Junk bones by dark dark dark.     
Stephanie says by the velvet underground.    
Oh my darlin clementine (I do this in a minor key because its a really dark song)     
gracefully facedown by the devil makes three     
lonesome whistle by hank williams.       
      
There are a few more songs im considering for that list but im not sure. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Also, im on my phone so I apologize for the bad punctuation and so on. 




 I dont know much about computers. So I need to be explained to about these things like an idiot. All I know is that I need some antivirus software and I have a Toshiba laptop. Sorry for being that guy.  




 My boyfriend and I like the song and wanted to figure it out but haven't and I'm out of town for a bit and would like to surprise him with it. Im on a banjo uke and I'm not the most experienced musician. So I haven't gotten past figuring out the first couple chords. Its Eb, D7 and C7? Maybe not C7. But something like that. It would be much appreciated if one of yall could help me out. I REALLY want to learn this. If you help me out I will send you a video of me playing it or something of you like. 




 Anyone that does anything even remotely creative, how do you keep the creative energy flowing? What do you do when you're feeling artistically constipated? 




 This is silly but I have been curious. I have never heard of anyone that dislikes potatoes entirely.  Naturally there are people who dont like certain ways potatoes can be prepared.  But does anyone just not like them all together?  




 I dont know about dog behavior in too much depth. I get basic things and absolutely love dogs.  But maybe yall could help. My dogs name is Lucifer,  hes half Doberman half Rodsian ridgeback. The thing is hes actually not my dog which is why im not entirely sure what the hell im doing. My boyfriend ended up getting himself incarcerated so I have been taking care of Lulu while he is gone. Naturally Lucifer is somewhat depressed but for the most part he has been fine because we have bonded a lot and seems to love his step mom. But the past few days he has acted distant. I couldnt get him out from under the bed for most of this evening, though that could have a bit to do with the bath I gave him. He also started barking at nothing at one point. Im just worried that these could be signs of a medical issue. He has fleas that I have actively been trying to get rid of. I know hes itchy and uncomfortable and has chewed off some of the fur on his back. I just feel awful.  I want him to feel better but I feel like a bad dog mom. I could be doing better.  Its difficult. Any insight is appreciated. And sorry about the formatting and punctuation and so on. Im on mobile.  




 So I was with some friends at a nice hotel because they had one and I needed to get away from my life. So were hanging out and swimming and drinking champagne.  The night goes on and most of us are in the room. I decided I wanted to swim some more so I ask one of the boys if he wants to come with. Naturally he obliged because ya know. Girl in a bikini.  So were out there, I swim a little, and he was trying to figure out how to climb onto some things to jump off into the pool. "Why dont you jump off that wall?" I say, and he says "Because its too hard to get up." Being the girl I am I took that as a challenge.  So while hes still distracted I sneak over to the gate and get on top of the wall relatively gracefully and proceed to say "Oh yeah, its so hard to get up." As he realizes Im somehow magically on top of the wall I realize that the whole top of it is completely covered in broken glass. I was not aware that was a common deterrent for birds (and I guess drunk assholes). So I get myself down alright but not before I manage to get many small but deep and bloody cuts all over my legs and feet. Luckily when I went to the front desk for band aids and such the guy didnt ask questions. Im trying to take care of the cuts but I live in a dirty city where a lot of people easily get staff infections and MRSA. I really hope I can avoid that.     
Edit: Sorry for bad formatting and grammar and such. Im on mobile. 


































 Someone recently posted about a 30's (I think) vintage, gypsy-esque style. There was a name for it but I cant recall. They posted some lovely pictures of it. Its driving me crazy. Google wasn't helping so you guys are my only hope.  

























































































 Like living situation, shared belongings, etc. Whatever comes to mind.    
My current situation is that my [ex]boyfriend who I live with at a friends house just broke up with me and he thinks that I should move out. Now these are mutual friends, though he knows them through me. I have known them for a couple years, he has known them for about six months. So in theory if anyone should move out its not me. But what I want to know it that even if we knew said friends equally who would have the right to stay? I think that if you decide you don't want to be with someone and they haven't done anything wrong you should be prepared to move out of the mutual housing. And its already unfair enough to impact someones life so heavily without adding even more stressful shit.    
But anyway, input, opinions, stories welcome.    
I'm having a rough time and I'm hoping my favorite online community will come through for me.    
Also, sorry for any bad wording or anything that doesn't make sense. I just had dental work and am functioning on pain pills.    
EDIT: A couple words. 




 I'm a [female] musician looking to find stuff to cover or get inspiration from and I think the right blues and I complement each other well. The problem is that I don't know my way around blues well. I'm looking for the slower, lounge, sad stuff. Anybody have any suggestions? Female blues musicians may be the right direction but I'm not sure. Any suggestions are appreciated.  




 I'm kind of scared and I'm hoping I will get the gas. And my jaw hurts so bad I cant chew my food. But I'm at my dads and I don't have a lot of options. I already have TMJ so it took me a couple weeks to realize the pain was because I have neglected to get the root canal I need. Hopefully my dentist will be accommodating. Acetaminophen isn't quite cutting it. 



















 Been doing a few stencils lately so I can sell/barter patches and such. Stencils are somewhat new to me but art and using a craft knife is not. Mostly been making smaller one layer with decent detail. But I have yet to get my brain to work in two layer stencil form and was hoping someone could help.

Thanks. 




 It has been over a year since I have gotten a tattoo and I'm so desperate for one. I have tons of ideas that I know I want but I'm curious on thoughts on the one I want next. I was thinking I want the red armband that Pocahontas has, but red is not a great color for me. So I was thinking of getting it in white. What do you guys think? I know the tattoo is a little silly. But I think it would be great looking. And ya know. Reasons. 



















 Its strange to think we wouldn't exist if it weren't for that one time our parents met. My dad told me about when he met my mom and it got me interested. My entire existence was literally based on the flip of a coin. I'm hoping the rest of you have some cool stories. 



















 I dont know if this has been done recently but I havent seen one and it seems like a good idea. 



















 May be leaving the Pacific North West and heading south. I know I can get across the border on foot with no passport, my friends seem to have no problem. I want to go meet up with a friend but will be in a car. So Im wondering if anyone has any good feedback. 

















































 For whomever find penises ideal.    
Edit: I mean size, shape, etc. And for the record, I am a straight female. Just wondering what is generally preferable. 







































 Also I have a sister and my sweater is red. Slightly hungry. 




 You can be so wonderfully plentiful. But then I have to buy cream cheese. Thought I should share. 


































 A huge problem for many people including myself is having an invisible illness. People assume a lot of us are just using someone else's parking pass and will actually confront them about it. For me there are times where I can do things fine and other times I have to use a scooter at the grocery store because of fatigue, joint pain, POTS, or whatever else. I have gotten so many dirty looks and a few rude comments because I am young and look healthy so people make rude assumptions.        
If you see someone stand up out of their wheelchair to grab something and sit back down it doesn't mean they are faking it. Many people use them to avoid more pain and because of fatigue and so on. A wheelchair doesn't mean they can't use their legs.    
Another issue I have seen a bit about recently is that people somehow think it is okay to give their opinions and advice to someone with health issues. I am so fucking sick of being told I should do yoga or try acupuncture. Not that I am against it, I just don't need recommendations from people that have no idea what my conditions even are. I just read something where a lady said a random stranger on the street came up to her to tell her she was using the wrong kind of knee brace. Without having any idea what kind of knee problems she had. She compared it to being pregnant where people think it is somehow their business.     
People always lecture me on how I need to just keep trying and pushing with my doctors and blah blah. Which is basically all I have been doing for the past four months. I seriously don't even have a life anymore. Somehow everyone assumes I am just not doing enough to get better. Which is absurd because it is the only thing I can do. I'm not being lazy, the collagen in my body doesn't work. Which means I am literally falling apart. Excuse me if I didn't brush my hair and go for a jog today.      
But anyway, just give people a break in general. You have no idea what they are going through. If a young woman is in front of you in a long line and asks you to hold her place and then goes and sits down 20 feet away don't assume she is just being lazy and spoiled. She could have lupus or a number of diseases. Public transit is another place to look out for those things. Little things like that make a huge difference.   




 I'm not sure I understand what you mean.  




 Not entirely the most extreme pain I have been in but the most unbearable has been the last 9 months or so. I have a bunch of chronic pain conditions that I have had my whole life but it wasn't until last year that it got bad. I had to leave my job and my home with my boyfriend and dog to go 2000 miles for treatment. I may be here for a year or however long it takes to get disability. Some days I can do shit but other days I can't even put a shirt on because the movement is too painful. I am a 23 year old female and I look healthy so my pain gets downplayed by lots of people including doctors.     
I have a connective tissue disorder so my tendons and ligaments don't really do their jobs. Which means my muscles are extra strained and my joints are really bad. I basically feel like I got hit by a car the day before. Every day. I have osteoarthritis, POTS, CRPS,TMJ, and autonomic dysfunction, among other things. So when I stand up I get dizzy and lose my vision for a minute. I get fevers all the time because my body can't regulate temperature as well as some other things that should happen automatically. Even trying to pee is difficult.      
None of my body doesn't hurt. Even my skin and nail beds. Basically everything I do is significantly more difficult to do than it is for most people. Sometimes I can't stay awake, other times I can't sleep. Even my low pain days I have no energy.       
It's not necessarily the worst pain, but the fact that it is every day makes it absolutely unbearable.      
The toll it has taken on my mental health is just as big of an issue. I went insane for a while before I got antidepressants. Even with them I'm not great. I basically don't get to take part in my life.      
So yeah this is by far the worst pain I have had to deal with.  




 My sister is 7 years older than me and I didn't start to get remotely pretty until I was around 14. So a bit of ugly duckling syndrome. It didn't help that my sister was absolutely gorgeous in her teens while I was a kid. She also got our moms complexion while I got our dads, so I am white and she looks more ethnic.      
As a kid I knew I wasn't very pretty and didn't care but not looking like my mom and sister bothered me. People loved to point out how white I am, others would ask if I was adopted. I hated it.      
Once I was in 7th and 8th grade I started to care more about my looks. Which was basically the same time they were beginning to improve as I was starting to bloom into the woman I am today.       
During that time I also was developing an eating disorders due to stress of moving and whatnot as well as the fact that I am just prone to mental disorders. I had started cutting myself a couple years before that. But my anorexia lasted a while.     
The kicker is that while I started getting skinny and pretty (not that I was overweight before) my sister got pregnant and gained 50 pounds in her pregnancy. She has struggled with her weight off and on since. Nothing extreme, she's has definitely never been plus sized. It was weird though that as the age gap between us became less significant I sort of also caught up with her appearance wise. Still white though.       
For the record I no longer struggle with an eating disorder or self harm. Still crazy though.  




 There are way too many people like this it's absurd. I have had to tolerate so many trashy people that take shitty care of their kids. I swear they have no idea how fucked up their priorities are. 




 Yeah I have one dread and I need to do the same thing. I have had it for near a decade so I'm sure it has some buildup.  




 I'm not confused as to why he would thank her. I'm confused as to why she would be around him. 




 Yeah I can see how freaky it would be so much later. And thanks. I am still trying to deal with it because it was just a few months ago. It would be easier if I wasn't away from my boyfriend but I will be fine. Every period I have freaks me out less than the one before. Heh. 




 I thought the friend was a girl.  




 I was really grossed out for a second.  




 I beg to differ. Give Complex Regional Pain Syndrome a try. 




 Well its a hell of a story.  




 Ugh. I had a miscarriage at 7 weeks. I'm 23 and not ready anyway, not that it isn't shitty. But in the couple days I was passing the tissue it felt so gross. The larger pieces would hurt coming through my cervix and as soon as it stopped hurting I could feel it in my vagina. I would sit on the toilet and feeling it fall out of me was really unpleasant. I'm glad it happened early on at least. The biggest pieces were about the size of a mouse but there were only a few.      
I'm sorry you went through that, especially being further along. That really must have been an awful reminder a half a year later.  




 When I got home that night, he apparently knew that I lied. I don't know how. But he thanked me. Thinking back on that makes me really fucking sad for her.         
        
The brother thanked you? I'm not sure I am understanding correctly. If that is what you're saying I am wondering why you would be allowed anywhere near him after that? 




 Do it. But really your body is already good. 




 Or you could just start camming as is. Your figure seems similar to mine from what I could see and there is no way I could lose 60 pounds. Just be healthy and learn to appreciate your body.  




 The part where the aunt said she wasn't adult enough to balance school and a job was so absurd. First off a high school student not have a full time job anyway. Secondly that was coming from a lady that couldn't take care of her own awful child without manipulating someone. That someone being a minor none the less. I know being a single parent is not easy but tons of people manage it. Even if she was watching her kid herself obviously she still sucks at raising a child. Considering her son won't get a job and apparently can't watch his own little sister. Doesn't sound like a very good adult to me.    
I can't handle manipulative people that won't hold themselves accountable for their own problems. Guilting a responsible teenager into helping her when she knows it is negatively impacting her life and education is several different flavors of not okay. 




 I know this is kind of an older post but I wanted to chime in. My wrists are one of my major problem areas as well. I am looking to get some braces but I was wondering if you have found anything that helps. I was at my cousins wedding recently and realized that I can't even hold a glass of beer for a whole minute.  




 I'm not the person you are addressing but I thought I would chime in. I used to have a recurve bow when I was in my late teens. I never *really* got into archery but I liked to go outside and shoot my bow for a while. It was only a 35 lb draw but I usually would put it down after I hyperextended my elbow a few times and the inside of my elbow would get in the way of the string. Which made for some lovely bruising.       
I was young and dumb and knew nothing about EDS at the time. I'm sure that now I couldn't pick it back up. My forearm and hands are way too weak. It's not exactly an arthritis friendly sport. Haha. I'm sure it's great for some of you though. I wish I still could. But I will have to stick ballet and such.  




 I'm all about the pan-jolele. Haha. My banjolele definitely has its wear and tear on it, it's an Oscar Schmidt and I love it, I would highly recommend it. I actually put steel guitar strings on it and it sounds even better.         
I got my EDS from my mom who is Hispanic and Filipino. Her skin is pretty fair and soft compared to her siblings. Her features are a bit more round than mine and I turned out white like my dad while my sister didn't. Genetics are weird. 




 Very nice. I play a banjo ukulele myself. It's strange but I seem to keep running across so many young women online with eds that all happen to be super cute. The whole fair skin and little face thing really works for us. Haha. I have noticed a lot smooth facial features as well as opposed to sharper ones like myself though. It's weird.  




 My cymbalta lowers my sex drive and makes it more difficult to climax. Narcotic pain meds also make it difficult for me to climax as well as get aroused in the first place (the cymbalta on the other hand doesn't do that).     
Pretty much the same basic response as others in this thread. Not sure of your gender. Female here though.         
Before I was on meds I also had a hard time reaching orgasm until I got a better understanding of my body and my sexuality. I eventually had a partner who was very well rounded sexually and intimately who basically taught me a lot about my body and I learned to relax enough that I could have a better time and an easier orgasm.       
Being in chronic pain makes us tense, especially when it comes to contact with others.We are also very used to ignoring how our bodies feel.      
I'm not sure exactly where your dilemma stems from but I have learned a thing or two about sexual function through experience as well as research. I am also very open about sex so feel free to PM me if you want. If you are shy about the topic I understand, but nothing will phase me. Ha. Good luck.  




 At this point I have no kind of medical equipment like crutches or braces but I am hoping I can find some that will help me. I think getting around would be easier if I had crutches but I definitely can't have much strain on my hands or wrists.       
Hopefully I can get some braces sooner than later. My wrists and elbows could really use it. My hips are the worst but I don't know how much braces would help. That and hip braces could cost a ton and on top of the other ones I would look like a robot or buzz lightyear. Haha. But I just really want to get to a point where I can function.      
I am new to all this and still going through the process of finding all the doctors I need and getting my diagnoses. I am curious about the platform crutches but any advice or insight is helpful. My pain is just so bad. I am working on getting all my medical needs met so I can have my life back. And I am beyond ready for that to happen.  




 Yeah I have been wanting to take a ballet class. But I am in too much pain at this point. Once I get better pain management I will probably take classes again. I grew up doing ballet so I am already fairly familiar proper ballet posture. I just worry that it's still not what my body should be doing.  




 My mom always does this thing now that I am an adult she feels the need to buy me things despite not having much money. When I don't want her to buy me anything she gets upset so no matter what I end up feeling guilty.       
My dad just never talked to me when I was young. Now he gets seriously sad when I don't want to spend time sitting at his house doing nothing for the weekend.         
Not sure what I'm being punished for.  




 Apparently the way I dress. Lately I have had a lot of people be concerned or confused and ask questions. It also pisses a lot of people off and they assume I have some kind of weird need for attention. It's really strange when random strangers are more worried about my appearance than I am. 




 Paper cut. I legitimately have a paper cut scar on one of my thumbs. 




 This is a small one but for some reason sticks out in my mind. A friend of mine hosts a trivia night at a bar and another friend and I go play every week. Every once in a while the first friend will recycle questions from several trivias ago. There have been a few that he has asked a couple times but there is one in particular that is something like "What musician is also a popular designer of neck ties?". I feel I should add that I am a 23 year old female and the friend I play with is a 50 something male. Every time I answer Jerry Garcia and every time he argues with me. But then I am always right because those neckties are fairly common. 




 I generally do wake up exhausted. I usually just get six hours of poor sleep every night.  




 I just use melatonin for sleep and that's all I need. Amatryptaline made me want to jump off a bridge.  




 Even 100 mg makes me loopy and tired. 




 Gabapentin makes me sick. I can hardly take 350mg. I can't imagine taking 900. 




 Yes. 




 Yeah I am very familiar with weed and have tried it all. It doesn't work for my pain. Best case scenario it does nothing but give me the giggles, worst case it helps some of my pain and amplifies the rest, or it just gives me a severe headache. When I was younger it used to give me hives. Really just not my thing. Unfortunately narcotic pain medication actually works for me unlike many of us.     




 Ah. Well if she is into it then I suppose you should stick to it. Ha. 




 You're plenty attractive, but it's weird that you're using photobucket stIll. 




 Your stature is large enough that you could use to put on some muscle. I also recommend boxer briefs. Tighty whities don't really look good on anyone.  




 Some of your pictures aren't very flattering, others are absolutely stunning. 




 Not a fan of the second picture but yeah, you know you're pretty.  




 You look like an action figure.  




 Your eyebrows are nicer than mine. And I'm a girl. Kudos. 




 I'm not usually into blondes but it.looks great on you.  




 I just think a lot of people fall into places in between those.  




 I like the hair. Not so much the facial hair. Can't see your facial structure but you seem to have nice features. The shirt is a bit of a turn off for me but if you're into it then rock it. Despite the shirt I say 7/10. 




 Personal preference I guess. The people that are attractive to the normal social standards aren't generally the folks I find attractive.      
Also when it is only 1 through 10 I feel like decimals are important because the round numbers aren't specific enough. Probably because I have chronic pain and am all too familiar with the 1 through 10 pain scale which I think is dumb. 




 Looks good. Cute face, I find Asians attractive. You look young though.      
7.5-8/10 




 Nice facial structure, smooth features. Like the other person said, kinda plain but only ar first. Upon further inspection you really do have nice features. It's just so subtle. Which is cool because you have a lot to work with and could try lots of styles with hair and hats and glasses and so on. I think you look good.     
At first glance 5 or 6/10 but you're actually more like a 7.5/10 at least. And then personality would play a role. You have a serious case of husband face. Which in my opinion is a good thing.  




 Too pretty.  




 Haha. I'm like 5' and 130. But yeah, you are probably pretty chill. I'm not much of a social parasite myself. Haha.  




 If you don't already know that you are horribly cute that would be dumb. At least an 8 by looks alone. Mor or less depending on personality.  




 Very handsome. Hard to say but you are *at least* a 7 but could easily be a 10 depending on perspective and personality.  




 You will learn to cut yourself some slack. Not only because you have to, but because chronic pain makes you incredibly strong. I am 23 and know how you feel, some mornings I can't get my shirt on because I have so much muscle pain. I'm still getting there. Some days I am bitter and angry because I shouldn't have to go through this. But as time goes on it becomes easier to except.       
I had to go on leave from the job that I love after finally getting my life together  and go back to my hometown 2000 miles away leaving my home and boyfriend so I can try and get a diagnosis. I have been here for about three months and it just keeps looking more and more grim. There is not really treatment good enough that I will be able to go back to work so now I have to apply for disability  which could take years.      
I can't say it's not eating away at me on the inside, but I am fighting it because I have no other choice. At the same time I know I am strong and it will only make me stronger. I'm sure the same goes for you. It's okay to be disabled. It sucks. But it's okay and we will still have fulfilling lives, it just takes a little extra fighting.       
From what I have seen people with chronic pain are some of the strongest people out there. You will be okay even if it does seem so.       
If you need someone to talk to for advice or support or even if you just need to rant/vent/bitch about *anything* feel free to PM me. It is really nice to talk to people that actually understand.  




 Yum! Thanks! 




 I don't think I know of anyone who goes too often.  




 Yeah I'm about to be diagnosed with ehlers-danlos syndrome. Most of the treatment is preventative and just treating the symptoms. So there are no great solutions.  




 Yeah I can't exercise until I see a PT and find out what I can do without causing more damage to my body. 




 Isn't tramadol a narcotic? 




 Maybe. I'm waiting for my diagnoses of ehlers-danlos syndrome and have most of my pain because of my tendons and stuff.  




 No, I'm back and forth between Seattle and Idaho. So there are plenty doctors. But my actual home is New Orleans.  




 Thanks. I have realized they take me more seriously and trust me more if I bring my mom with me. 




 seriously.  




 Yeah I smoke occasionally but it does nothing for the pain. 




 Yeah I'm familiar with the risks. I'm just at the point where I would like to function for a while.  




 All I have is chapstick.  




 Oh my god you just made me realize that I had a dream where I was eating chapstick last night.  




 I don't know why someone downvoted you. If nothing helps but the meds I would much rather deal with a chemical dependency than not be able to walk down stairs.  




 Likewise. I'm just past the point where I can handle it emotionally. 




 Yeah I wish the non narcotics would work for me. But at this point I don't even care and will take just about anything that will actually help. Waking up some days and not being able to put on a shirt is not okay.  




 Yeah I have tried several things and some of them help a tiny bit but my pain is so severe I can't do anything. My doctors know I had to quit my job and travel 2000 miles to get treatment and be near my family to support me. But I have been dealing with this level of pain for so long that I can't handle it anymore.  




 I am on cymbalta and gabapentin. Gabapentin does nothing and I think the cymbalta might even make it worse but it keeps me sane. My mom was sick of me being in pain so she took me to an urgent care and they gave me tramadol which I liked because it didn't really make me high. I am still waiting for all my diagnoses to happen so basically all my doctors are doing the bare minimum.  




 How am I in so much pain at 23? How am I supposed to live with this much pain and no pain management? I can't even keep up with people twice my age. I want my life back. If I were a doctor I wouldn't want to give me a regular narcotics prescription either, and personally I would rather not be on them long term. Being stuck on pills to function would suck. But you know what sucks worse? Not being able to function. I just want enough to get me through the day. The kind of day where I can go to the store *and* even take a shower. I don't even care about having pain, I just want it to be low enough that I can feel like a person and do person things. I don't get the point of this, why do I feel bad for wanting the pills that help? Is it wrong? Am I supposed to just stay in pain? Because this makes me feel dirty like a drug seeker.  




 I add decimals when I answer. The difference between a 6 and a 6.5 can make a huge difference for those of us who are so familiar with pain. 




 I'm one of those idiots that just freezes. Almost every time I am in a threatening situation I just don't know what to do. The only exception is if there is a kid or something. Then it's like that where I don't think and just act. I am completely useless when it comes to protecting myself.  




 I needed some pain medication for legitimate reasons but failed to procure any legally today before a road trip I am on. My uncle gave me some of his. So that. I'm also not wearing my seat belt because I need to lie down. I'm so hardcore guys. 




 Yeah, one of those shitty hairstyle magazines. 









 I was just thinking about this. About how many people are so healthy. Mainly because I don't know what it would be like to be healthy. But there are so many things that could go wrong, and that one thing that goes wrong sets off ten things to fuck up, and so on. And then you can end up with these two things going wrong that together cause another side effect. Then there's a ton of other things to get fucked up.        
I have also noticed that most people with serious health problems tend to have other unrelated health problems. I suppose that is just poor genetics though?  




 CAN WE PLEASE START REFERRING TO FEMALE MASTURBATION AS JILLING OFF?!??! I NEED THIS. 




 Have you ever delt with anyone with a vomit fettish? I have been trying too see if it has come up in this thread. When I was in my teens I had a yearly summertime fling that was into that. I never really did any of that with him. There was sort of an incident but it wasn't his idea. I feel like that kind of fettish isn't all that uncommon but at the same time I haven't seen much of it. You would think that it would be at least as common as a poo fettish.  




 I wish we did that in the US. I would be totally ok with getting my ass hit for being bad rather than being stuck in a cell for a few days.  




 That's my cousin.  




 I would like the hair if it weren't for the muscles. It could work with a lean rock climbing body type. But buff + ponytail = Fabio. I'm sure you could model for the cover of romance novels though. 




 I know but he is saying I am one of those girls that thinks it's cool to be all hardcore and wear Metallica shirts. Which is not what I do. It seems everyone in this thread is more worried about my style than I am.     
I am just confused because when I was playing bluegrass for a living my style seemed like no big deal. I feel like someone would have told me that I am a shitty hipster or if I was wearing a Metallica shirt. 




 I believe in equal rights but I try and avoid feminism and preechy people in general. Just because I like my armpit hair doesn't mean anything.       
I don't think labeling people is really a fair thing to do and personally I have many influences so there is no single category I feel comfortable being placed in.     
But when it comes to my fashion sense there are a lot of hippie influences including belly dance and fire dancer kind of apparel. Most of my friend groupe is pretty punk rock so I do a lot of that. I really like the 90s punk style.        
So I am whatever that's called. 




 Most guys I hang out with don't care about that sort of thing. Many people have realized it is a stupid thing to care about.  




 No thank you.  




 What vest? 




 Thanks. 




 Ha no. I was working as a musician for a while and a contortionist sometime during then. Then I got a job working at a dog rescue which was amazing and I may go back to that if I can but I stopped working because of health problems.  




 Ha. No way. I can hardly braid.  




 I am. I'm half white half not. 




 No, I did a few months ago and he just shrugged. Besides, I don't care that he doesn't shave his armpits. And considering the last couple women he dated he doesn't really care about that sort of thing. 




 What do you mean?  




 Haha. I do what I can . 




 I'm not really any of those things. 




 It's a waste of time for something so unnecessary. I like my body hair and so does my partner.  




 The piercing look?  




 That's the thing. It shouldn't be gross for girls and not guys. It all happened during WWII because all the men were off at war the razor companies started advertising to women. Which is a silly reason to shave. I think my body hair is feminine.  




 Securious. 




 I don't even know how that site works. 




 Yeah I am quite fond of my nose. 




 They're good live. Not really my thing though.  




 I think I have one of their patches. I saw them a while back.  




 I'm not interested in most dudes so it works out. I don't fuck guys that expect me to shave my armpits. Haha. 




 I really want to know. Haha. 




 That's ok. I have had bangs my whole life and have kept them because I have a tiny forehead. Ha. 




 No more sore shoulders!  




 I hate metal. As a matter of fact I am a bluegrass musician.  




 I'm not sure I get it... 




 I have a bunch of health conditions. One of my diseases causes all my tissues and ligaments stretch and tear so I can't really exercise besides swimming and I don't drive so I don't have much opportunities to go to a pool.      
And with all the chronic pain and fatigue I could give a fuck less about the couple pounds I should lose. I like my figure anyway.  




 I hope not. Haha. 




 Hahaha. Yes.
