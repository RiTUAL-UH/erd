 I already got my refund! it was approved than two days later BAM 


































 How does the maintenance records look? that is very important for a car with 100k miles! 




 I am looking to purchase this honda with 39,000 miles for about 13k the auto check looked good except it was used as rental at one point. Still the price is really good and the mileage is very low any advice ?
