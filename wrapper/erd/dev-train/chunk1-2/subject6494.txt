 i love that one! i've read it so many times! Have you read NoEnd House? thats another one that i find equally well written 




 I'll look into it! 




 that sounds really creepy? The only two Stephen King books i have read are The Dome and The Stand. But this one sounds interesting! 




 that's a great question! i really think it depends on the crime, criminals age, current mental state, etc. 




 its a haunted video game pasta, its alright, not terrifying by any means 




 thank you! i look forward to reading it :D 




 about to read it right now! 




 what is it about? 




 i've read squidward suicide and i find it really disturbing. could you send me a link to Ted the Caver? i havent read that one 




 that makes sense. I dont like to pull out the "self harm" card because i dont want to come off as unstable or attention seeking. I like to focus more on why and what is causing my depression as i know it has led to my self harm and anxiety 














 i'm so sorry that happened to you, stay strong :) 




 pray? are you personally religious? 




 that's a great idea, how can we get them to see this? 




 care to elaborate? 




 that must have sucked, at least she was discreet? 




 fair explanation. Do you think there is a way to differentiate teens from adults in this subreddit? 




 This used to happen to me a lot when i was full-out addicted to self harm and was trying to stop. I felt like i wasnt me without cutting. I've been clean for about a month now and i still get random urges to cut "for old times sake" its truly something difficult that we have to deal with 




 I was in a summer production of "Chicago" and at rehearsal i was very overwhelmed. I went back into the dressing room and used a hanger to cut two thin lines on my wrist. Once I calmed down a bit and had paper towel wrapped around my wrist, a girl from the cast walked in. She gasped as she saw the blood-stained towel around my wrist. I tried to call out and stop her but she was gone. She ended up telling everyone in the cast and i was taken out of the show, as well as hospitalized for a week for "unstable behavior" what kinds of stories do you have? 




 fair enough, i only ask because its hard to explain where my depression came from and why i have it. People always assume i'm "exaggerating" 




 i can feel the same way, one moment i'm leveled and calm, and the next i feel like curling up on the ground and not talking to anyone. Its very hard for me to get out of these situations, if its possible to remove myself i always do. It's whats best in that situation 









 I completely understand how you feel  




 thank you! I unfortunately reside in high school, so when i have my attacks within school its very hard for people to know what is going on. My teachers handle it very well, but you can't expect every person in your school to be mature and respectful towards you, you know? 




 I always feel guilty about what i do when i'm in the middle of an attack. When people try to help i always flinch away  terrified, like a wounded animal. Days later i have this lingering guilt and paranoia about what that person thinks of me now that they've seen me act this way. This only brings on more anxiety. Anyone else? 




 it just interest me, this whole subreddit interest me a lot, somethings (like this) may be a little too much for me, but many other posts i thoroughly enjoy 




 I'm aware now, curiosity got the best of me, can you blame me? 




 I wish i had a cat or dog to help me, as i know they are proven to help people with depression, but its not something that is available to me 




 This is really well done, i spent an hour or two getting through it, ive ended up exactly where i am right now. It makes me feel a little better knowing that it's all "normal"

(P.S a little part of me got attached to the kitten in the story, i think ill have to get myself one) 




 i dont know what to feel, i stumbled across this and i am a mere 14 years old. im shaking....most things dont faze me either but this....i cant even think right now.. 




 BAD VIBES BAD VIBES 









 i personally loved Toy Story 3, it was a tear-jerker for me! 









 I like my coffee like i like my women,

without a dick 




 hide and seek with you friends someone abandoned  




 i was aloud to sleep over at boys houses all my life. As long as i said i wasn't "dating" said boy i had no restrictions on where i went and where i slept. You can see how my young immature self took advantage of that 




 awks 




 I thought that "God" was always watching so i showered with shorts and a tank top on until i was probably 10.  




 no matter where you are, who you are, or what you do, there is always someone who hates your guts. 




 I wanted to be a pirate princess warrior from space

im still working out the kinks but i def working on it
 




 it really grinds my gears when i fuck bitches and dont get money 




 i do! it is that of a mouse :) 




 lets spread self love and confidence. 

i love my eyes and my sneeze! 




 my ability to help others work through their problems. 









 There are tons of amazing stories on this thread, and it kind of makes me feel a little boring. I spent my last day on my roof listening to The Strokes.  I had taken enough pills to (what i thought) end me, and i just relaxed. though suicide is not a light subject, i do admit what was supposed to be my  last day was very peaceful.  




 you could menstruate with lipstick. 
























 It all depends on the day for me, some days i think they show that i am strong and how brave i am for living my life with them. other days i just find them repulsive. 




 drink. 




 Thank you! It's not really appreciated where I go to school, where uggs and northfaces prevail over everything  




 Thank you very much!  I'm flattered :D 




 No problem :) 




 you fool, just your style and your body type makes me smile. not to be creepy or anything, i just think youre attractive

 youre beautiful O___o 




 that's just terrible, kids are so mean. I wish more people understood what cutting means and how its just as bad as someone with a broken arm. you should care that theyre injured. not taunt them 




 i am on fluxotine as well! i only take 10mgs a day, and it has little to no effect on me 




 I am on non addictive medications which I believe is the best for young adults. So many kids are abusing pills that it isn't safe. Of course many non addictive medications aren't as strong as their addictive relatives, which sometimes poses a problem 




 That's a good point. We are becoming more self aware of mental illnesses. I've also noticed it becoming a "trend" in young teens. Could anyone attest to the same?  




 I love that show! I'm doing that this summer along with The Little Mermaid and Young Frankenstien 




 I'm so sorry, adults sometimes don't react like they should  




 i guess i have a lot of questions; let me start out with how you feel about young adults being put on anti-depressants, and how social media affects young adults with mental disorders. you can PM me if you wish 




 Sorry! i guess i misinterpreted what you said! i just dont like upseting people :) 




 i wish they would have just ignored mine? what show were you in? 




 can you tell me your opinion how why it is more common for young adults in america to have mental illnesses than it was in the past? 




 Thank you so much! 




 I'm so sorry :/ 




 the look of disappointment hurts me the most 




 No problem :) 




 That's fair enough, judging based on the story should be the best fit  




 you dont sound mean at all! i've been doing plenty of research and was just wondering if anyone is this sub would like to be apart of it.  




 As my title said, I have a paper for class that i have chosen to do my paper on. I want to understand why depression and other mental disorders are showing up more and more recently in high school/ college students. Any help would be greatly appreciated.  




 you really should. They work for YOU and only YOU. if you tell them that you want to keep it confidential and are open and willing to talk about it with her/him than he/she must not tell anyone by law. I've tried keeping things from  my therapist but i found its much better for both of us if i just tell her 




 sorry, no need to be sassy. i just didnt want to mess it up :( 




 im so sorry your mother has reacted this way, do you have a therapist? my mother was crazy until i had someone talk to her and explain the right and wrong ways for her to act around me 




 exactly. its ridiculous that she enjoys hurting your feelings. I'm glad you have people in your family who support your feelings  




 why? i'm 14 years old, was diagnosed with depression at age 11. My family has a long line of depression running through the family, I've witnessed my cousins suicide, ive attempted suicide, i'm on medication and making final adjustments on those meds, and im a recovering self-harmer. why couldnt you take me seriously just because of my age? 




 hold on to him, try to find other sources of help (i.e therapist, friends, realatives) because nothing lasts forever. (not trying to be morbid, i just want to help you)  




 aha, even though i've been a redditor for over a year now, i'm still lacking a lot of knowledge of how things work. I'cm not exactly sure how to approach it/ where to contact them/ etc. 




 Should we suggest to the mods that we get some? 




 :D thank you, it means a lot 




 I have another story i'd like to share, when i was in 8th grade i had fallen asleep in English class while we were watching a movie. A few boys who sat near me thought it would be really funny if they took red pen/marker and drew lines all over my wrists and legs. I woke up to bouts of laughter from the people around me and as i looked down i saw crimson lines everywhere, I ran out of the room and went to the bathroom, once i realized they were just marker i began to wash them off. By this time one of the councilors had heard of what happened and came in to help me wash off. As we were cleaning she said "i cant seem to get this one off!" i turns out she was trying to rub off one of my actual cuts and i had to explain to her that i self harmed. I didnt get into any trouble, but it was truly the most embarrassing time of my life  




 any time, i'm here for anybody and everybody 




 exactly. your beliefs are yours and no one should dictate you on what you think.  




 tangents are fine! Its rough when people assume i try to "kill myself" or "cut" for attention because i'm the exact opposite. I'm in theater so when we are changing of course you're going to see some old scars. That's not me trying to cry for attention, that's me trying to live with the mistakes i've inflicted onto my body. I've been ridiculed countless times about my view on how i live with old scars. I see them as something i cant change and i refuse to be worried about them. They are there and if you see them its nothing you should need to worry about. 

i went off on a tangent as well, oops! 




 i've been in therapy for a year or so, and we're slowly figuring out what it is, this helps when i have to explain it to people 




 I'm so sorry that happened to you. From what i've read i feel that your boyfriend cares a lot about you, I'm glad you have that in your life. He could help you immensely.  




 I've read it so many times! I think its absolutely fantastic 




 that's absolutely terrible. Try to remember that she isnt the only opinion in the world, she could say the worst things, but i promise there is someone out there who is saying that exact opposite of you :D 




 Understandable, tons of people go through this. I am an open atheist in my house but my parents aren't very religious. Just remember you are in control of YOU and no one can dictate what you believe in 




 that could work, i dont know how to use flair, but if someone could explain it i'd be happy to do it! 




 thank you so much, it was a dark time in my life, but i've grown from it 




 that has to suck. I get really angry when people try to tell me praying or god is the answer. I usually yell back! 




 thats terrible, i cant believe someone would do that as a joke! And thank you, i'm a lot better now, it was almost a year ago, i'm attempting to recover 




 im so sorry that happened to you, 




 she shouldnt act like that. How does she think that will help you? public humiliation isnt the way to go
