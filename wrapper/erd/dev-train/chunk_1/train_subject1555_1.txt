 I, for some reason, lack the ability to walk like a normal human being without randomly losing balance or running into something. I have only gotten moderately injured twice because of this. first time, I was walking around my apartment and I guess I miscalculated a turn, ran into a wall, and broke three toes. the second time was when I was doing a graded mile run in my phys. ed. class and my friends and I decided to start skipping the last 1/4 of the mile. I completely tore my calf muscle and had to get surgery to fix it. all the other times are just me running into things or tripping over air, which only ends up in embarrassment and possibly a few scrapes 




 "I find it kinda funny, I find it kinda sad, that the dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had"

 I self harmed for about 6 years before i finally got help. I have struggled with depression and anxiety for a while and cutting was my release. it hurt a little but that pain distracted me from the pain i was going through psychologically. so in a way, it was my version of a painkiller. however people self harm for different reasons such as a distraction, a form of punishment, or sometimes even because the sight of blood is calming to them. 




 I'd love to know what goes through my cats mind whenever she hops into an empty box. she makes it seem like it's a portal to another world.
