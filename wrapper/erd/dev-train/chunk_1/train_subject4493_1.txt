 I generally don't like Vonnegut but if you happen upon his book Cats Cradle it is quite a good read.  




 Does this actually happen? Usually women get ripped the fuck apart on Reddit.  




 I loved her in American Hustle!  




 I don't like most of his movies but Reservoir Dogs was fucking brilliant and one of my favorite movies. 




 I totally agree with you. They are weird. And I don't get it.  




 All I can say is, don't cheat. If you are on the verge of cheating, recommend counseling. If she doesn't want to go to counseling, then tell her something needs to change or you will end the relationship. 

I'm saying this as a woman who was cheated on after being married for five years. It really fucked me up emotionally being cheated on. It's a difficult situation but cheating and getting caught is a horrible thing. You will be the bad guy no matter what.  




 Differences in sex drives are a huge, huge issue. And I found that out the hard way. My husband ended up having an affair because we weren't having enough sex. It ruined the marriage and we divorced. 

There were other problems, sure. But we were not sexually compatible and I was young and didn't realize how important that is. 

Could you see yourself only having sex with your girlfriend once a week? Twice a month? Once every few months? 

It sounds shallow, but I know my husband loved me with all his heart, and he still had the affair and our marriage still ended. It is a big deal.  




 I love this. It's not about the mistakes you make but what you choose to do after those mistakes have been made. 

I divorced my husband after I found out he had an affair and he became bitter towards me and ruined any chance of us still being close. I still miss him but he holds a huge grudge against me for dissolving our marriage. He doesn't understand actions have consequences.  




 I love everything about this picture! I would try not to get upset. Those PUAs are a minority group. My brother is one of them and guess what, dudes not getting laid. They're just bitter assholes. 

Also like everyone else said your hair is amazing and I'm jealous :)  




 My ex had ADD. I did a lot for him, fill out paperwork, help him with school, keep him on a schedule. Then I found out he had an affair. He claimed his ADD made him impulsive which is why he cheated. I'm almost 99% sure that isn't true. It sucks because I loved him and his ADD quirks. Oh well. I read every book I could on ADD and spent time in therapy figuring out how to live with someone with ADD. I'm an expert now!  




 That's horrible. My ex husband did something similar, he had an affair and then told me he didn't feel the same about me anymore. I'm divorced now and trying to move on and date but I don't trust anyone. I feel like I'm going to be alone forever. 

And this only happened three weeks ago? You're taking so well and I feel so stupid for letting it get to me even now after nearly a year.  




 What the fuck? Because you gained 20 pounds? This thread is making me angry! I'm sorry you had to go through that.  




 Well I've actually seen it a bunch of times growing up, my dad watched it a bunch. So... I guess I'm just ignorant of this phenomenon of seeing movies in a theater and yelling out the lines.  




 Like, I get if you want to laugh and have fun. But don't act like you're the only ones there you know?  




 To scream out all the lines? I've seen it before too but I don't see why that excuses people being that obnoxious. Every one else in the theater was silent except for them.  




 I went to see Monty Pythons the Holy Grail in an old theater because why not. This group of kids in front of me said all the lines as they were said in the movie, and then cackled madly. It was fucking obnoxious. Watch it at home if you're going to do that shit.  




 Yeah I'll have to try it!  




 Haha. Sounds like a bunch of bullshit to me.  




 Hm, I admit I have never heard of this woman. What about modern feminists today who are influential? It does seem like with any group, the ones with the most extreme views get heard most often. And that helps no social cause.  




 I keep hearing about all of you gals' FWB situations and I'm curious, how does that happen? I can never find a guy who just wants sex, they always want a relationship. Or they say they just want sex but then later they change their minds. Where do you find them?!  




 I get a weird satisfaction out of pulling the matted clump of hair out of my brush. I have long hair so I have to do this regularly. I used to chase my ex around with it because he was disgusted by it haha!  




 I see your point, but I don't think prominent feminists would disagree with my position.  




 I would call myself a feminist and totally believe she should have been charged with assault at the least. She should absolutely be charged with lying to police. 

I don't think statements about the patriarchy are meant to direct attention away from women being perpetrators of violence. My understanding is that the idea that women are weak and cannot be violent against men is a huge problem, because it allows people like this to get away with assault. But the issue here lies with the fact that police will not believe a man if he says he is assaulted. And why is that? I don't believe it has anything to do with modern feminism making women out to be victims. 

Basically we need to look at solutions. How do we protect both men and women in situations of assault? We need to teach police officers that women are capable of violence so they can be more objective about situations, ie if a dude has bruises and scratch marks and the woman looks fine, don't arrest the GUY. I had a good friend of mine get arrested and was charged with assault, then had to go to AA meetings because his drunk girlfriend decided to have a meltdown and start throwing shit at him and beating him up at a party. He was embarrassed so he didn't tell anyone what was going on until a neighbor called the cops. Dude had a gash on his face because she threw a lamp at him and he got arrested. 

It's just frustrating because I am a feminist and this issue is personal to me. Hope you see where I'm coming from! Regardless of what labels you choose to put on yourself I think we all agree this is a problem (except a few extremists maybe).  




 This happened to my brother too, he always plays as female characters. But he took it way too far and apparently talked to this dude for months pretending to be a woman. Yeah, my brother is weird.  




 I've never heard of that statistic. Do they have information about why the women initiate a divorce?

Even so, asking for a divorce doesn't imply they maliciously set out to ruin a man's life.  




 Haha, that's what my husband's brother told me. I had my suspicions and talked to his brother, he actually laughed and said he would never cheat on me. A week after that I found out. People change. Or they are very good at pretending to be someone else.  




 Divorce statistics just show marriages end. It doesn't imply the woman was responsible. 

I agree that courts favor women in the case of divorce and children. So I could see why a man wouldn't want to get married because of that risk.  




 Totally. I don't want them to be dicks about it, but they could at least acknowledge that yes, I could lose a few pounds, and it's great that I'm trying to be healthier. Oh well!  




 Well, he believes that it is the cause of a lot of problems. Feminism got rid of traditional families for the most part, and so family units aren't as strong with women in the work force. That's just one thing he talks about. I think it's very interesting.

What bothers me about his beliefs is mainly his idea that women are unempathetic predators, who will screw up your life on purpose, take all of your money, and sucker you into children. He doesn't believe women can be monogamous, they are always searching for something better even when they marry. It's very odd considering no women in our family fit that description at all. So who are these mysterious sperm jacking predator women? I'll have to ask him that next time I see him!  




 I think over the years he has become more entrenched, yes. I think the longer he goes without a woman in his life the more he buys into these beliefs. I want him to find a girl. Despite his beliefs he is very family oriented and wants a very traditional family. I personally believe he goes about it in the wrong way.  




 He's in his late 20s. 




 My brother says similar things. He believes a woman's sexual market value goes down as they age, and men's value goes up. I'm not sure how true that is. I think desire is pretty subjective. 




 I don't think people are necessarily owed a reason. But if I wanted to be with a guy and he didn't want me, I think it would be valuable for me to know why. It would definitely hurt to be rejected that way.  




 My brother buys into all of that. He's incredibly intelligent though, so sometimes when I have a talk with him, just me and him, we have rational discussions about feminism, life, women, dating, etc. I think he is into most of it for the shock value.

He still believes feminism is destroying our culture. And I can't change that. I think the best thing to do is to just voice your opinions on it if he brings it up. But if he inevitably decides to keep thinking the way that he does, you can't change that. 

My brother will always be a bit of an oddball but in the end he's my brother. He treats me and my mom with respect (most of the time, anyway). I think he's just going through a hard time because he's had bad experiences with women. He was with a girl once who ended up having a fiance the whole time they saw each other. So I try to listen to him and help him see my way of thinking.  




 This happens to me too. A lot of people tell me, "but you're not fat, why do you need to lose weight?" I don't know if they are just trying to be polite? I have extra weight on me and it's noticeable.  




 My mom does and I think it's weird. Even in winter. It's just unnatural.  




 That's adorable!  




 The cheating was what pushed me to file for divorce, but it was basically a culmination of selfish behaviors on his part. We struggled with a lot. We got married very young and we jumped right into it, we never lived together to figure out each others personalities better before marrying. 

Now that I think about it we weren't very compatible. I just wish we would have realized that and parted ways before he cheated. It hurts quite a lot.  




 I'm doing much better. I had a few months where I didn't want to get out of bed. I felt pretty worthless. But then I started going out with friends and family more. Just being around others helped my mental state a lot. And now everyone tells me I seem much, much happier.  




 Haha. I was pretty young when we met and got married. Infatuation can make you look past a lot of flaws. I'm certainly more cautious now about people.  




 I'm not sure where my depression stems from to be honest with you.  




 Like I've said before, at that point he should have filed for divorce. I'm not sure why people keep saying "what did I expect him to do." 

Cheating is never acceptable. There is a mature way of dealing with sexual incompatibility. I didn't want sex constantly, that is true, but I never stopped loving my husband. I did everything for him, except force myself to be sexual when I couldn't be. In the end he decided constant sex was more important than being with the woman he loved. It was unfortunate. 

I never needed sex in my relationship with him. I was totally fulfilled in other ways. I just wish we had realized that before we got married. I don't blame him for needing sex. But I do feel emotionally damaged from the betrayal. It still keeps me up at night knowing the only one who claimed to love me has hurt me the most in this world. Anyway, thanks for your input.  




 There were times when sex didn't happen at all. But I did try very hard. When the sex didn't happen it was generally because he was very insensitive about it. He'd get upset with me and say a man can only handle rejection so many times. I'm not sure what the right way to handle any of it was.

But you are right about jumping to conclusions about my ex being an ass. There are two sides to every story, and the truth.  




 It's interesting that you make the assumption that I did nothing. I never made that statement. 

I was clinically depressed. That hurt our marriage and our sex life. I saw therapists and doctors, took four different kinds of medication. I lost weight, ate healthier, exercised. We had sex. It wasn't every day, but we had it. I tried very hard. So when I read someone saying that I did nothing, even on the Internet, it hurts. 

He told me even after my efforts it wasn't enough. He needed sex every day, he needed me to be wet for him, which is something I couldn't do. My body just wasn't responsive. I could give blowjobs. But he didn't want that. 

I asked him why he stayed married to me if it was such a problem. He said he loved me, wanted to see me through it all. But in the end he was wrong. He needed constant sex to validate himself. 

I hope you understand my situation more. Maybe in the future you can not jump to conclusions. 




 I think that's pretty unfair. I had my own issues. I couldn't get physically aroused, and so when we had sex it was extremely painful. 

Regardless of what happened, cheating is not the response to a problem. If he felt we were sexually incompatible he should have left. 

I don't need validation from people on the Internet. I just hope eventually you learn to look at people with more empathy.  




 He should have had the balls to end the relationship before plowing another woman. Lol. It's pretty obvious.  




 Wow! I remember I went to a therapy session about a week after he had told me about his affair. After the session I tried to talk to my husband about everything and he looks at me and says, "When are you going to get over this?" A week after! Some people just need a good punch in the balls.  




 I really appreciate you making this post. I have been battling depression for a while and I too have been going on walks. I live in a big city so it's harder to find quiet spaces, but I still enjoy myself. Some days I still want to lay in bed all day and mope, but the days I get out are really nice.  




 I am also a tiny apartment dweller. I like to sneak over to my parents house during the day to use their hammock and drink their beer!  




 Haha! Right?  




 I got that reaction too. He also had issues with me not being "comfortable" enough for him in bed. He had issues with me because I wouldn't let him go down on me. Well, the girl he cheated on me with sure liked it, which I guess is a good enough reason to throw a five year marriage away. 

Good on you for leaving that situation. I've been depressed for God knows how long and every day he isn't in my life I feel better emotionally.  




 We weren't having sex because I was diagnosed with depression and was on medication. He thought I was being selfish by denying him sex. He had little ability to empathize. There was no perfect situation possible. I wasn't going to magically fix my depression and get my libido back. So he chose to cheat. 




 Just chiming in, my ex husband told me before he cheated that he wasn't getting enough sex and that he would look elsewhere. It didn't help anything. So what, I'm supposed to fuck him just so he doesn't go off and screw people other than his wife? It made me less likely to want to be intimate. And in the end he did cheat. And in the end we got divorced.  




 I was cheated on 8 months ago by my husband of 5 years. I know your pain. It sucks because when I asked him, "Didn't you think about how I would feel?" He said he didn't even think about me at all. We're divorced now but I'll always carry that emotional baggage. If you need to talk to someone I'm here.  




 I agree with this, although for me intense cardio workouts made me anxious initially, so I would build up to that point. Even something as simple as a walk helps calm me down.  




 It's beautiful! I want to make one :) 




 I can understand what you are saying. But I think a lot of your emotions are misplaced. But maybe that's based on my general ignorance on the topic of fat acceptance. I don't believe overweight people want society to start telling them they are healthy, or society to say, it's okay, it's out of your control. I think they just want empathy. I also think they want it to be socially acceptable for people to be overweight, in that people look at it as a lifestyle choice rather than a fault in their moral character. 

Now, I'm not sure how I feel about that. I don't believe you are morally worse because you are obese. If I see an obese person I admit I do believe they have an emotional problem that makes them eat to excess. And maybe that's wrong, I don't know. I don't think anyone chooses to be overweight as a lifestyle. Why would you? But maybe they just want others to stop shaming them. 

I think, especially on Reddit, we make a lot of assumptions about someone's character if they are overweight. Lazy and stupid come to mind. And we make those types of comments even when the person's weight isn't the focus of a post. We take pictures of fat people and mock them. Just for existing and being overweight. And I think that's wrong. 

It's a complicated issue and I'll stop rambling now haha. Thanks for replying to me. I find a lot of the time on here I want to have a discussion with someone who has an opinion different from mine but it usually never happens! So thanks.  




 I agree completely. I can't imagine how difficult it must be to be overweight or obese, especially because I believe that in a lot of cases they turn to eating to relieve stress. 

The amount of anger I see on Reddit over obese people is astounding.  




 My question wasn't rhetorical either. I really, really want to understand why someone would become this angry.  




 Hm. I guess I still don't see how you believe she is blaming you. She's coming off as defensive and I don't believe she is right when she says you cannot tell someone is healthy or not by looking at them. 

But I don't believe she blames anyone for her actions. She's upset that, in her mind, people want to make it a moral obligation to be thin. Or she calls it healthism, for whatever reason. And I agree that would not be a good thing. 

I guess what rubs me the wrong way about all of this fat shaming stuff is that people seem absolutely, insanely furious that some people would be fat and deny that they had any part in becoming fat. Now, I don't have statistics on this, but I do not think most overweight people truly believe they are not responsible in some way for being overweight. For the few that do, what's the big deal? A relative of mine claims he can't control himself when he drinks to excess. I roll my eyes. 

I mean, where does the anger originate? Are you worried that suddenly being fat will become acceptable and we'll all eat ourselves to extinction? Because I think right now there is still overwhelming social pressure to be thin. And I can't see that changing.  




 Are we the same person?  




 I need to join this club too!  




 You seem pleasant. How did she shift the blame onto you for her weight? I don't see that in the exchange.  




 I agree with her other point that we don't question whether a thin person is healthy or not. My friend was crazy thin but ate like shit and had high cholesterol and high blood pressure. No one asked her about that. But I think if you're fat we think you're open to scrutiny and can judge them based on their health decisions.  




 Why? Why would what this woman thinks infuriate you? I don't feel like it really affects you in any way. I don't think she is correct in her statement, but it certainly didn't infuriate me. 




 I don't think most women who have children stay at home with them, they usually have careers. I want kids but fuck if I'm going to be bored out of my mind as a stay at home mom haha.  




 Let's do it!  




 That's how I am, and I feel like there's something wrong with me. I like to masturbate but I don't really enjoy sex. I'm attracted to guys and I like doing physical things like touching but not penetrative sex. I feel weird about it and it's ended past relationships :( 




 This same shit happened to me. Guess what? He never contacted me again. 

But if he's telling the truth ignore how jaded I am!  




 This gif makes me so happy.  




 I don't have many friends either. That sounds awesome!  




 It's such bullshit that they're pushing this idea of perfection on us. Like, perfection is having a thigh gap? No. 




 Yeah, trust me, I know I gained weight. No one needs to tell me lol. 




 That's really awesome advice. I have anxiety as well and was super nervous on a date last night and couldn't pin point why. I think it's just what you said, I was excited and I misinterpreted the physical feelings for anxiety and panic. But despite all of that the night was awesome and we're going on a second date! So it's worth it to push past your anxiety! 




 This is one the best gifs ever. I love Potter Puppet Pals! 




 Motherfucking potpourri?! Who gives a flying fuck about potpourri. God dammit.  




 I must have zero imagination then. I hated dolls and any time I got one I'd look at it confused and then go read a book.  




 Ugggh that's so true. I don't know who got it worse, me having gained weight, or my brother, for having ridiculously long hair. I'd rather have people comment on my long hair than weight...sob.  




 My friend has people who ask her "what are you" but they are generally referring to if she is a boy or a girl. She looks pretty androgynous. Still, wtf? What kind of person goes up to someone and asks, "what are you, a girl or a boy?" Rude.  









 Good lord. That's all kinds of messed up. Glad we're both rid of the trash :)
