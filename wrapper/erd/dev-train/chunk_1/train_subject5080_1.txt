 Does anyone use myfitnesspal?  I could really use some friends on there to help with encouragement.  I keep falling off the wagon and I keep telling myself I'll start tomorrow.  So I started again today.  I'm getting married March 10 and need to drop some pounds by then so I can fit into my wedding dress and look super awesome.  

My name is lefoll.
 




 I haven't ever had a desk job; I've always worked retail, food service, tutoring, or child care.  The job I start tomorrow is, from what I was told, a repetitive data entry job at a major oil/energy company.  I'll thankfully be making enough to where I can move out in a matter of months.  There are tons of pros to this other than financial, like opportunities and just experience.

I'm still freaking out.  I'm terrified I'll suck at the job.  I've got minor anxiety, which doesn't help of course.  I know asking questions is encouraged but I'm still afraid to do so.

Anyone else have a lower level desk job who has worked retail or other service jobs in the past who can send me some encouragement/advice??? 




 I'm a female and I feel females are definitely the minority on this subreddit.  At least that's what I gather from progress pics I've seen.  I mean, seeing the male progress pics is awesome, but it is encouraging to see a lady every now and then, given that weight loss for men is (or seems to be) easier and faster.  

I have just started keto myself, so no progress pics yet.  Once I get down enough for a very noticeable difference, though, I'll be plastering them everywhere. 




 I was on keto for a whole week and then last night I had a handful of chocolate covered pretzels in a moment of weakness.  That kicked me out of ketosis and I'm a little pissed.  




 Seriously.  I would slaughter a pig for a sugar cookie, and I know if I indulged, I'd go overboard.  I just entered ketosis about 8 hours ago and I don't want to kick myself out.

**Thanks for all the tips/suggestions/anecdotes!** 




 After over 2 years of engagement, I finally set my wedding date for March 10.  In the last 3 months I've let my emotions get the best of me and I've gained 20 pounds, so my dress doesn't fit anymore.  

So, the things that keep me going are:

* 
The thought of my wedding dress fitting (or better yet: having to be taken in)


* 
The effects of my PCOS and insulin resistance will have subsided.  This includes unsightly things such as random facial hair


* 
Changes in how I feel every day.  Chances are the heartburn will be reduced (according to doctor and various personal sources) and more energy.  


* 
Won't have the urge to give into emotional eating.

I would really like to hear some other motivational thoughts that kept you going through the induction/detox phase.  Maybe there are some others out there just starting out who will benefit from them too. 




 Okay, I've been really bored lately so I'm knitting a beanie that I'm going to send to someone (along with other things) for reddit secret santa.  [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/Uurhl.png) the pattern grid I made for it. 

Anyways, I got 3/4 done with the hat before I realized that the color strands were too tight.  Any tips on keeping it loose? 




 I was on Zoloft for about a year at a high dosage.  The only positive thing I could say about it was that I lost 50 lbs on it.  I stopped my habit of emotional eating.  Everything else sucked.  I became an apathetic zombie.  My sex drive was way down, and it has remained so after being off it for a month now.  

I'm now sure that I don't need an SSRI, but I do need some kind of medication.  I don't have insurance to visit my doctor, but I've been going to my GP my entire life and he'll change my prescription with a free phone or email consultation.  I've heard good things about sex drive and personality on Wellbutrin and I think an NDSI might help me a lot more.  

What side effects have you experienced on Wellbutrin?  If you have experience with both Zoloft and Wellbutrin, which do you do better on and why?  I'm aware that my brain chemistry is specific to me, but I'd like to hear personal experiences. 




 For me, I was dumbstruck when I moved to Nashville and realized how few people had ever heard of kolaches.  It was only a few days later I was told they're localized mainly to Texas. 




 Three days this week I've tried W1D1 and can't find the strength or energy to finish it.  Before this week I decided to warm up by just walking the 3 miles for 4 days in a row, but I guess it didn't help very much.

I think one problem is my breathing.  I breathe through my mouth and I don't seem to inflate my lungs enough.  Breathing through my nose makes my nose burn for days afterwards and my lungs still end up hurting.  I get about 3/4 of the way done and I end up having to skip one minute of running just to stop my excruciating chest/lung pains.

Does anyone have any advice? Any resources to send to me about running/breathing/etc...?  The posts here are very encouraging and I'm just getting really down on myself because I can't complete the first day. 




 Complete newbie here, been playing around on the training maps for a while and am almost ready to jump into server play.  Is voice chat necessary? I know many find it beneficial for coordinating tactics and strategies, but is it absolutely necessary? Will I be harassed for not using it? I'm also a girl, if it matters. 




 I've been on the career hunt for the past 3 months now.  I graduated from college in August and have had about 6 interviews so far to no avail.  

I know how important appearance is in a job interview.  I have long, healthy hair but I realize now that the length is too long to look professional in any way other than a bun.  So I'm going tonight to get a few inches chopped off, and I was wondering if you ladies had any suggestions as to how I should wear it.

I've been going with a straightened simple pony.  I have hesitations about wearing it down because I tend to play with my hair, especially when I'm nervous.  I plan on keeping it medium length at least, but other than that I'm clueless as to what to do.

 I will preface this by saying that this question is more for the resident atheists of r/Christianity, but anyone is welcome to weigh in of course.  I am not seeking to involve myself in a back and forth discussion, I just want to hear your opinions.

Logic is not instinctual in human beings.  From personal experience, the classes that myself and many other people I know had difficulty with in university were philosophical or mathematical logic.  Acting emotionally, however, seems to be very instinctual to human beings.  My question is this:

Do you consider emotion-based belief to be incorrect and if so, why (when considering the emotional instinct we all have)?

Also, why is logic considered superior when it is also a set of rules coined by ancient philosophers? 

It might be a good thing to mention I have a degree in mathematics, so I understand why logic is important from a mathematical perspective.

Mods, I apologize if this belongs in a different subreddit.  I don't dare post it to r/atheism, and I decided against r/debatereligion because I don't plan on being very involved in this discussion.  I merely want to observe responses/opinions. 




 The past month I've been in the biggest depressive state I can remember.  My sleep schedule had been from 6am - 4pm daily, my Zoloft wasn't working, and I barely left my bed.  I wouldn't leave my apartment for days on end and when I did, it was to go get M Ms and drown my sorrows in junk food.

Two days ago I decided enough was enough.  I started taking my Adderall again, and I've gone for 3 mile walks every morning.  My sleep schedule is closer to normal now, and I have an interview today.

I hope this serves as encouragement for someone out there feeling as hopeless as I did.  Seriously, get off your ass and go for a walk, even if it's just 10 minutes.  Download a podcast (I recommend Wait Wait, Don't Tell Me, it's pretty funny) and just stroll.  It's amazing how depressing sitting in front of a computer/TV all day can be.   




 My sleep schedule is oriented in a way such that I am waking up at 4:30 am and I usually try to make it to memorial park to walk 3 miles, but I'm wary about going before sunrise.  Now that winter's coming and sunrise is getting later, though, is problematic.  I know the trail is lighted but I wanted to know if anyone has any personal experience with it being safe. 









 I just finished Dalek Invasion of Earth where Susan stays on Earth with David and it's assumed she marries him.  I've heard the general consensus is that she left to fight in the Time War when it started, but wouldn't she still have had the opportunity to have children?  It's not like the War started right away.  

Is it assumed Time Lords and humans can't procreate? 

Also, does anyone else wish more of the classic Who elements would come back to the revival? I know we've seen some things like Rassilon and the Master, and I realize it's difficult with the Time War and everything.  Oh wishful thinking. 




 I've been searching for a job for the past 4 months now.  I have a B.S. in Mathematics but no professional job experience.  If you know of any companies hiring ANYWHERE in the US, let me know please.  I need a job, and am willing to relocate if the salary is enough to cover cost of living plus student loans expenses.  I'd really appreciate it. 




 We love the show, there are so many good characters, but which one is your absolute favorite and why?

Mine would be Astrid.  She has that caring personality, she gets called hilarious names by Walter (Aspirin! Asterisk! Astro!), and she goes on supermarket runs without complaining.  She's Walter's sidekick and she's awesome. 




 I'm getting pretty tired of Moffat/writers ignoring the TARDIS translation circuit.  A few examples are: when the Doctor speaks baby, when the Doctor translates the Krafayis's last words as it's dying, the Doctor translating the alien Minotaur's final words in the God Complex... the list goes on. There should be no excuse for the TARDIS not translating this.  If the Doctor knows all these languages, the TARDIS definitely should.  The only exception should be Gallifreyan (as mentioned in this subreddit before), so that non-Time Lord TARDIS thieves wouldn't be able to pilot her.

Any other discontinuities out there that are pissing people off?  This part of DW canon that is being ignored by Moffat is unacceptable to me.  There have been dozens of other directors who have done DW just as well as Moffat, why does he get to rewrite everything? Don't even mention Big Bang 2 because that was a cheap attempt of shaking the DW etch-a-sketch. 




 I'm back on C25K.  I started in in March 2010 using the treadmill at our old apartment complex and got up to W3D1.  Then my mom left my dad, I had to move out, my dad died and I put it off.  I lost 50 pounds after my dad's passing but didn't exercise so I figured I was good to go.  Fast forward 8 months after my weight loss subsided and I've gained 15 back, so I decided to give C25K another go.  

I did W1D1 yesterday outside on a local trail.  It was hard, even though I'm 35 pounds lighter than I was before.  I had to distract myself from looking at my shadow, and I felt like I was barely moving when I was running even though I was exhausted.  But I'm excited! D2 tomorrow! doing Zumba on the days between :) 









 So I've decided to jump back on the keto bandwagon after being off for a couple years.  I've been gaining weight back and am not happy, and being insulin resistant I've found this is the way to go.  Here's my problem, though.  Over the last 6 months I've suffered from acid reflux.  I made a meatza yesterday and woke up in excruciating pain last night from it.  I'm assuming it has something to do with the pepperonis.


ANYWAYS, Could you share your favorite blander keto recipes with me? 














 Saturday's episode should be part 1 of the season finale :( Unless for some reason they forego the 2 part finale for the first time. 









 Can we add something to the sidebar of links to threads of FAQs? 

For example, I've seen[ this question](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/kj60a/to_those_of_you_who_reject_the_theory_of_evolution/) posted about 200 times since joining reddit.

Maybe I'm being nit-picky, but it seems after a while most of the regulars skip over it anyways since we've already answered it multiple times before. 














 [Beginning weight: 226.2 lbs](http://i.imgur.com/8xWIj.jpg)

[Lowest weight: 172.2 lbs](http://i.imgur.com/P4zZl.jpg)

I've gained some back (I'm at about 181 right now) and I need to get my motivation back.  Since I graduated I haven't been walking (big college campuses supplemented for exercise).  TBH I think most of the weight loss happened as a result of my father's death.  He suffered from severe anxiety and depression and that rubbed off on me.  After he passed away much of my anxiety and depression was gone, including my emotional eating habits.  While I was losing weight I was drinking Cokes (not diet) and the weight just kept falling off (it was weird).  I've fallen back into the bored eating routine again, and I think putting this up here will motivate me to get back on track.


 




 I'm a recent graduate and I've been asked about submitting to tests before I start work (non medical state).  I'm not worried about failing because I haven't smoked in a few months (bc of the job search), but once I take and pass the test will I be free and clear for the most part?  That is, do many companies have you submit to random drug tests while you're working? 




 I see people posing with penguins, sloths, koalas, and different exotic animals from time to time and as an animal lover, I was wondering how would I go about getting to do this?  I've looked into my local zoo and can't find anything, and I'd rather not be with a giant group all groping the animal at the same time (I'm selfish that way, I guess).   









 I currently live in Houston, TX but the job market here sucks balls.  So I started applying anywhere and everywhere.  I got a bite in NJ (specifically the New Brunswick area) and a preliminary offer of ~$40k/year with a promotion after 3-6 months. I know the standard of living is higher up there than down here.  Is 40 grand enough to live on decently? 

Also, if I do end up moving, what should I know beforehand? Is it reasonable to commute to NYC from New Brunswick every day via train? My fiance will be moving with me and his search area includes NYC.

Thanks, any help is much appreciated. 




 I've been on the hunt for 3 weeks now.  I know that's not as long as some people, but student loans are scheduled to be due in October and I *really* need to find a job by then.  I've tried submitting my resume to temp agencies, I've tried r/HoustonJobs, Craigslist, Indeed, Monster, CareerBuilder, CollegeGrad, RigZone, etc... but haven't found anything.  

I got some on here to look at my resume a while back and took all the advice and it's looking pretty good.  What should I be doing that I'm not? It's not practical for me to walk into a big corporation and ask for the HR manager and many companies don't list their information on the website.  Any advice? Any companies you know of to whom I should be applying?

Basic info: B.S. in Mathematics with an overall GPA of roughly 2.8.  Advanced proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite including Access and Outlook, intermediate proficiency in SAP, SPSS, MatLab, R, just learning Python, C#, and VisualBasic.

I've tried applying for careers in almost every field, mainly focusing my search to analyst positions.

Any help would be greatly appreciated and I can provide a link to my resume if requested. 




 I recently graduated from university.  I've been sending out my resumes for about 3 weeks now and yesterday I spent 4 hours sending them to temp agencies, as well as other cities.  Today I have gotten 4 phone calls from either the agencies or other cities' companies but have just let them go to voicemail and gone back to sleep.  

I need a job desperately yet I always sabotage myself.  Can anyone talk me out of it? I'm terrified of an interview, feeling I'm going to do horribly so why even bother?

Thanks. 









 Also, when I see a grackle doing a funny dance where it kicks back its wings and opens its beak and starts chasing another one around, is the grackle attempting to mate or scare off the invader? 









 I've read multiple posts saying "Put on a suit and go out and talk to someone face-to-face!"

To whom do I talk? Do I ask for the HR manager? I've been using internet job boards to no avail and tomorrow plan on getting out there but what are some things I need to know beforehand?

Edit: For clarification, I just graduated with a B.S. in Mathematics and am looking for a corporate analyst position (business, financial, risk, compensation, etc...).  I'm 24 and located in a booming business city (Houston, TX if you must know) 









 Third time posting to r/resumes. I've taken suggestions and revamped my resume to better showcase myself.  I'd love critiques.  

NOTES: 

* The actual .doc format is one page, but for some reason googledocs extended it to two.
* I didn't include my overall GPA because when my father died in the middle of the semester, the trauma of finding his body overcame my ability to finish the semester. I couldn't drop out due to financial aid, and as a result my GPA went down the toilet.

Also, along the lines of GPA, can I calculate my GPA from the credits that applied towards my degree?  That is, if I failed a class and re-took it, could I calculate it without the failed course factoring into my GPA? Or is that professionally dishonest?

 First off, I have a couple prayer requests.  They may seem petty to some, but I'm really struggling and need some guidance.  I graduated a couple weeks ago from university after the most emotionally tumultuous  5 years of my life and I'm stuck.  I can't get a call back for an interview.  I wasn't involved in many things during university and didn't have any internships.  I have a BS in Math and I've applied to every analyst position I can find, tweaking my cover letter for every company.  My health insurance runs out September 1st and I can't afford to renew it, much less pay my bills.  I would really appreciate some prayer or suggestions for my situation.  While you're at it, please pray for those who are facing even more difficult times than I am in this broken world.

Second, I have a friend who is 8 months pregnant.  Her husband is a youth minister, she's on leave from her hourly retail position.  They have a 2 year old daughter but donated her baby clothes as she grew out of them, and they're lacking clothes/accessories for their newcomer.  If anyone could assist in this it would be greatly appreciated.  [Here's the post I put in r/babyexchange.](http://www.reddit.com/r/BabyExchange/comments/jy9ti/request_infant_clothesitems_for_a_baby_girl/)

I apologize for using r/Christianity in this way for those of you who may disagree with this post.  I just have nowhere else to turn.  After 4 weeks of pulling my hair out from rejection emails, I'm lost.  

Thanks y'all.  Love you. 




 This sub was suggested to me by r/Assistance.  I think it's such a great idea!

I have a friend who is almost 8 months along.  They have one little girl already (2 years) but they donated her baby clothes as she outgrew them.  They're not super poor, but I doubt they have enough to buy their baby a whole new wardrobe.  They haven't had a baby shower yet and I'm not sure if they even will, so I was wondering if anyone had any clothes they'd like to donate to the cause.  The husband is a church worker and the wife has been on leave from her hourly retail job for a couple months.  I'd love to surprise them with a box full of clothing and accessories for little Harper so they aren't spending their own hard-earned but limited money when she arrives.  

Someone also suggested something of a digital baby shower on r/assistance and that would be great, too, but it's not necessary.

So if anyone wants to donate clothes/accessories/money to this cause, PM me and I'll give you all the information you need/request.

I'm a long-time redditor, check me out if you so choose :)  




 Helllo my favorite subreddit! I have a friend who is about 7.5 months pregnant with a little baby girl.  They already have one little girl but gave away all of her baby clothes after she outgrew them (not smart on her part).  She and her husband don't make very much and can't afford to go out and buy brand new clothes for their newcomer, and nobody has thrown her a baby shower. 

I'd love to surprise her with a box full of clothes to choose from when little Harper arrives.  Does anyone have any they can spare? PM me for info :) 




 I don't want to have to sift through shit to find gold, so I'm asking for recommendations here.  Movies I really enjoyed include Sunshine and Event Horizon.  Someone suggested Cargo (2009 Swiss film) that I'll check out but I'd appreciate more. 




 I never understood this.  Jesus is a part of the Trinity, therefore He is God through the trinitarian relationship with God the "Father" and the Holy Spirit.  Does that make the Holy Spirit the crazy uncle of the bunch who watches us when we sleep?  To me, Jesus being the Son of God seems to imply that God the Father has supreme authority, but that's not the way the Trinity works.  They're all equally God and in sync with one another.

I'm assuming it has to do with the trinitarian relationship, but I never quite grasped this title of Son. 




 I grew up thinking agnostic was a viewpoint similar to atheism, where someone just doesn't know or care if there is a God or not.  After coming to reddit, however, I've learned the true definition of this classification.  Here are the definitions of gnostic and agnostic, respectively: 

* **gnostic** Adjective: Of or relating to knowledge, esp. esoteric mystical knowledge.
* **agnostic** Adjective: asserting the uncertainty of all claims to knowledge.

Online dictionaries tell me that I was partially correct in my original thinking, but I prefer this definition to associate with my faith.  I have never had a "supernatural" experience of God outside feelings, coincidences, and situations.  I have no absolute certainty that God exists.

I'd really like to hear others' views on this and to which you ascribe and why.  




 Let me preface this question by giving some insight into my family history.

* **My mother's side of my family**: Her father, and all the men on his side of the family end up dying of cancer by the time they're 60, with the exception of my great-uncle.  My mother says he's "pickled" because he was an alcoholic his entire life and lived to be 79.  I doubt that, but it's not really relevant to my question.  The women on her father's side live to be 85 or older, as do the women on her mother's side.  There have hardly been any men on her mother's side of the family, and those that I do know of have had similar fates to her father's side (dying of something by the time they're 60 - 65)

* **My father's side of the family** is basically the same, with the men dying of heart disease or cancer by the time they're 65 (my father died last year at 60 from hypertensive cardiovascular disease). My grandmother on this side lived to be 90, her sister to 94, and their mother to 90.


So my question is this:

* Can susceptibility cancer and disease be genetically gender-specific? That is, since I'm a female do I have a higher chance of living longer than if I was a male?

 









 I'd just like some opinions on the matter.  I know for women, the hormones and everything involved with pregnancy is a way of bonding with the child.  I actively want kids, my fiance doesn't at the moment but is willing to have them for me.  He says he's sure he'll love them more than he can imagine now.

Fathers, would you be willing to share your experiences and maybe a story about your child(ren) that just makes your heart explode from love (if applicable)?   

 




 I'll just list my skills and qualifications.  I've been applying to analyst positions but can't get a call for an interview and I've been taking r/resume 's advice on everything regarding my resume.

**Previous work experience:**

* server (waitress) - 5 years on and off
* tutor - 1.5 years
* teaching assistant - 1 year
* day camp counselor - 3 summers



**Education:**

* B.S. in Mathematics
* Undergraduate research: Epidemiological Model of Cholera in Haiti
* Majored in Mechanical Engineering for a year and a half at the beginning of my college career


**Computer skills:
**

* *expert experience*: Office including Excel, AutoCAD 2D, Inventor
* *moderate experience*: MatLab, SPSS, Access, Pascal, R
* *some basic experience*: mySQL, VisualBasic for Applications




Can anyone PLEASE help me figure out what it is I can do or what I should be applying for?  




 Is anyone else better at google-fu or ravelry-fu than me that can provide one? 









 [A while back](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/itd82/is_there_a_commercial_that_you_hate_so_much_that/) there was a thread about which commercial got on your nerves, with Arby's Good Mood Food being in the lead. 

Now, which is your favorite?

 Okay, I already posted my resume on r/resumes, but that subreddit isn't very active.  Would someone on here be willing to look over my resume and give me some protips? I finally graduated and now am just looking for a career, but I've only gotten emails that include "regret to inform you."  

[Here's the link](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v pid=explorer chrome=true srcid=0BxjavmoMCR2qOWM1NGZhMzAtOTFmMi00NzJjLWJkYTEtNmJkNDAxZjc1M2Qz hl=en_US) to my resume on googledocs.  I've spent the last week and a half applying to over 50 positions.

If my cover letter sucks I'm also willing to pay someone $30 to write me a new one :D

**EDIT** You guys are amazing! Thanks for all of the advice, I'll spend the rest of the day perfecting my actual resume and I'll work on my career specific cover letters.

 I am very particular about my Coca Cola.  I will not buy 2L bottles of it because any time after the first opening it loses its carbonation. I will only drink fountain Coke if it has enough fizz (McDonald's is my go-to for fountain Coke), and I will buy Mexican Coke a couple times a week (nectar of the gods).    




 I'm a recent mathematics graduate, but I'm finding the jobs I have the best shot at have to do with programming of some sort, or with data analysis (SQL, Access, Oracle).

I bought a book on VisualBasic and Access 2007 but I want to teach myself a programming language.  Which one is the best for self-teaching for a career? I took *one* class in undergrad, and they'd teach Pascal or Fortran depending on which semester taken.  I unfortunately took the Pascal semester, which I didn't do too well in and have also heard that Pascal isn't even used for anything anymore.  I've heard C, C++, or Java are the way to go, but I'd like some more experienced opinions.

Thanks! 









 The 5 years I spent in college taking my undergrad were emotional hell, so I didn't have the emotional capacity to apply for internships or take initiative in building up my networks/connections. 

I'm going to a career fair hosted by my school next week, but my resume looks so lame.  I've put all the job experience I've had, the computer programs I can use, but with a bachelors in maths with no minor (one research project and a few good references), I'm absolutely terrified and discouraged to even send in my resume to businesses focused in the financial sector.  Ultimately I'd like to be an actuary, and there are a few internship opportunities for which I'd be willing to apply.  

Any advice? So far I've used a resume template that makes it stick out from the standard word-processor resumes.  What computer programs are invaluable to know for business related careers?  









 Tomorrow (8/2) marks one year anniversary of my dad's death.  My dad caused a lot of stress on our family by losing his business and then basically giving up on life, causing my mother to become physically ill every day (vomiting from financial stress). My fiance and I were the ones to discover his body and I'm still not finished grieving.  I went to therapy to deal with the trauma of finding him, but grief has its own way of doing things.  

I've been having a rough past couple of days, and I can tell tomorrow's going to be even worse.  My mother grieved the loss of my father while he was still alive, so she's been able to move on with minimal grief.  I however am still grieving and am basically all alone in this. It's also my last week of college and so I've got the stress of studying for an advanced mathematics final to add on top of everything else.

I'm taking the next few days off from reddit in an attempt to get my emotions straightened out and could really do with some encouraging words or prayers.  

Thanks, y'all. 




 My car isn't in the greatest condition, but I had it checked out by my fiance's dad (who owns a used auto parts place) and he said it will pass inspection.  Last time I got it inspected I got screwed out of $200 for unnecessary "repairs" (which I was told later were completely unnecessary for passing inspection).  I'm a female and so I've heard nightmare-worthy stories about women getting cars inspected and being taken advantage of.

Anyone on here have suggestions on a place that will just look at my car and pass it without offering five extra things it "needs to have done?"  I don't have the patience or money to deal with this and would rather avoid the BS altogether. 

Any suggestions would be much appreciated!  




 More times than not I see the verses quoted in KJV are misunderstood by those quoting it.

Edit: I was misinformed, thanks to mypetition and CanadianGal25 for clearing this up.  I probably should have noted that the only information I have on the translation is what I heard in passing in a religious studies course.

Edit 2: When I said in my first draft that KJV was a flawed text, EarBucket summed up what I meant with the KJV's source being the TR:

The Textus Receptus has over six thousand variants from the earliest Greek texts. It contains portions that were translated back into Greek from the Vulgate because they didn't have Greek texts available. Most scholars today don't give priority to the TR. 




 Passage for context: [Matthew 18:15-20](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2018:15-20 version=ESV)

What does it mean to you and how does it relate to the epistles and the modern church? 




 The deterioration of his mental health after losing his job caused so much stress on my family.  He refused to take heart medicine after he lost the business, and the final years of his life he was basically waiting around to die.  He was working a menial contract delivery job, and used the money he earned to give me spending money, buy cigarettes, and buy junk food.  

I still miss him, though, even though his poor financial choices almost broke our family.  He was the goofiest person alive and knew how to make me smile when I was stressed from school or my job.  

He passed away 8/2/2010.  I saw him July 30, 2010 for the last time.  We went to pick him up to drive him up to KC, MO from Texas for my sister's wedding.  When we got there he said he couldn't go.  I was furious, I thought it was from his mental instability and anxiety associated with long-distance travel.  I walked out of the apartment while my fiance talked to him, but something inside me told me to go back and tell him how much I love him and hug him

Looking back, he must have known.  That was the last time I saw my father was the first time I saw him cry.  The entire time we were in KC, my fiance and I had the feeling we'd come back to find him dead, but not from heart attack.  We thought he would kill himself.  When we got back to the apartment on 8/2, I conveniently went to check the mail while my fiance went to check on my dad.  As I was walking up to our building, my fiance comes rushing out, phone in hand, giving me the "STOP RIGHT THERE" hand sign and look on his face.  It was the longest night of my life, and I was still convinced it was suicide.  It wasn't until I got the death certificate a few weeks later that "atherosclerotic and hypertensive cardiovascular disease" became the most relieving words I had ever read.

I'm miserable today.  I'm having fits of sobbing, stuffing my face with junk food.

 I'm well aware of GraphicRiver, but I was hoping to start on my resume today.  I can't buy any on GR until a deposit to PayPal has gone through and I'm itching to get it done.  

If I have to wait I will, but [this](http://graphicriver.net/item/-3piece-swiss-style-resume-set/155832) and [this](http://graphicriver.net/item/get-minimal-resume-02/129773) are just so wonderful and I was hoping someone on here had another website resource to use that doesn't require a paypal-type transaction to purchase.  I'm one of those people who gets in the mood to do things and I get so frustrated when I hit a snag.

I'm also not proficient in InDesign enough to make my own, especially not that high caliber material.

Danke! 









 Any tips available on finding limits of matrices? I can work out markov chain problems fine until they ask for the eventual proportions, in which case I have a more difficult time.  Should I just work out the problem up until (A^5 )x and guesstimate from there?  




 I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people— not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world. But now I am writing to you that you must not associate with anyone who claims to be a brother or sister but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or slanderer, a drunkard or swindler. Do not even eat with such people.

*What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside?* God will judge those outside. “Expel the wicked person from among you.”

1 Cor 5:9-13

This chapter is the reason Christians like myself choose not to associate ourselves with hate-mongering groups such as the Westboro Baptist Church, who claim to be our "brothers and sisters" but their platform is one of slander and hatred towards those outside the church.

I think Paul got it right: we have enough crap to deal with inside the church body to start judging and enforcing our beliefs on those outside.  

 




 Introducing myself!

23 year old female from Texas.  Raised in the Southern Baptist church, now engaged to an LCMS Lutheran.  Fiance is planning to go to seminary at some point and is currently looking for a youth ministry job. He's been a great source of theological discussion and leadership for me and, while I don't understand some Lutheran things, I agree with everything so far (after 3 years together).

I hope this group will gain in membership and submissions.  Looking forward to it!

 




 My college career has been one of misery to say the least.  My family is in a large amount of debt, but makes enough to bypass the EFC limit for grants on the FAFSA.  My dad lost his business right before I started in 2006 and he passed away unexpectedly last August.  I have changed majors twice, colleges three times, and failed classes due to a drug problem and depression.

Today I took my last CLEP test and passed, meaning that assuming I pass my current summer school course, I wil be graduating in August.  This is also assuming financial aid goes through for the summer, but if it doesn't we should have a way of paying through my mom's or grandmother's credit union.

I am beyond excited to pick up my cap and gown, and now that I'm graduating, I am one step closer to marrying the love of my life.  We've been engaged for 2 years but we know well enough to wait until after we've graduated and have careers to tie the knot.  

I'M GRADUATING!  I've been doing a happy dance for the last 30 minutes since getting home from the test.  Just had to share :))))) 




 [Here's the post in reference
](http://blog.chron.com/newswatch/2011/07/ktrk-video-hpd-officer-apparently-punches-handcuffed-suspect/)

I've started taking it upon myself to communicate my feelings on Houston policy with the mayor via her email mayor@houstontx.gov.  Today I got a letter back consisting of just two sentences that satisfied me:

Thank you for sharing your concerns regarding Houston Police Department 
officers with me.  The officer referenced in the news article has been relieved of 
duty, and an investigation has been instigated. 

[Here's a copy](http://www.scribd.com/doc/60285980/Re-HPD-Officer-Punches-Suspect-07-18-11) of the letter emailed to me.

Annise, you're alright with me! 














 I suck at these, especially in the complex field.  This one's thankfully a real one but I'm having some trouble.  

Let A, B be 2x2 matrices with real entries st lim A^m, lim B^m, and lim (AB)^m exist as m -- inf, but Lim (AB)^m != (lim A^m)(lim B^m). Find A   B.  

I'm assuming there's no one correct answer.   














 I know this sub probably gets this asked all the time, but do I have a shot in the actuarial field? I've been taking 18+ hours a semester trying to finish my BS in maths.  I have excellent references from professors and past employers, but no internships or relevant financial experience. I'm studying this summer for the first exam and plan on taking it as soon as I can after I graduate in August.  I live in Houston, so there are many actuarial opportunities as it is a large corporate hub.  I have good resume boosters like volunteer work and tutoring, but nothing spectacular.

Help me, actuaries.  Do I have a decent shot at getting a job in the first 6 months after graduation? 




 Female, semi-attractive, graduating in a month from tier one research university with Bachelor's of Science degree in Mathematics.  Live in a very large metropolitan area with a major corporate presence (rated as a global city)

Is there hope for me finding a job outside of IT or CompSci? All of these unemployment threads are freaking me out. I'm good at going into interviews thinking I'm the shit, but will I even get that opportunity? 














 I grew up in a Southern Baptist church, where all I ever heard in youth group was 

Don't have sex, because you will get pregnant and die. Don't have sex in the missionary position, don't have sex standing up... Just... dont' do it, okay?

As you can probably guess, that had a significant impact on my own sexuality.  I never explored my body; rather, I was ashamed of it.  Though I'm still a Christian I wholeheartedly disagree with that approach to it, as it usually results in rebellion or shame (at least in my youth group it did). Thankfully my fiance encouraged me to have discussions about our sexual life, and he eventually gave me this book that we could read together and since then my attitude about sex and my own sexuality have greatly improved.

If you or your SO aren't comfortable with your sexuality because of what you've been taught at church or from your parents, please pick up this book: [Sheet Music by Kevin Lehman](http://www.amazon.com/Sheet-Music-Uncovering-Intimacy-Marriage/dp/0842360247).  It's a very frank book about sexual intimacy in a Christian marriage and the misconceptions the church places on its young people.  It deals with all kinds of relationships, too: two virgins raised in the faith, more experienced individuals, sufferers of sexual abuse, etc... The only poor reviews are ultra feminists claiming it to be misogynistic (it isn't) or ultra conservatives claiming it to be smut (again, it isn't).

[Here's an excerpt](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FArUKp-O6Sw/ThH_Gz1NCbI/AAAAAAAAAHE/osPCM3a_Suc/s1600/SheetMusicExcerpt.jpg).

Also, feel free to share any opinions or stories of growing up in the church and its affect on your sexuality.   




 So we were moffucked again a few days ago when Moffat said we still know nothing about River. What if her entire persona around the Doctor is an act, as she had been trained to do by those who raised her? What if she is really the bad guy in all of this? Is that even a possibility?

Also, I'm starting to think River and 11 aren't very romantically involved. I'm thinking the Stevie Wonder and Singing Towers Doctor is a future incarnation, especially since the screwdriver he gave River (for the Library) is not 11's screwdriver. She says it's his screwdriver (as opposed to a screwdriver), and 10's was destroyed in the Eleventh Hour.

Am I thinking too much? This break is destroying me. Thank heavens for Torchwood tonight. 




 I have a friend who is pregnant.  A couple months ago, they found out the baby wasn't developing properly.  Its organs are outside of its body, and its face is very disfigured.  The family of the girl are very pro-life and have had a difficult time finding a doctor that didn't want to abort the baby.  They found one, and they are testing to see if its a chromosomal abnormality.  If it is, they'll make the baby as comfortable as possible and let it pass once it's born.  If not, the doctors can do something about it (I'm not sure how but they say they can).

Now, I'm pro-life except in extreme cases where the mother is in danger, but now I'm thinking I'd be okay with an abortion in this situation.  I believe babies who die go to heaven.  I'd just like some input for the future, as this family has already made their choice in the matter. Extreme complications in pregnancy could happen to anyone, and just in case it happens to me at some point, I'd like to have opinions from well-rounded Christians such as you guys. 



















 I've seen many posts recently asking why certain actions are sin, mostly relating to homosexuality.  I need analysis of something I was taught by a theologically well-rounded Reverend (meaning, he has a Masters of Divinity).

He first referred me to Romans 6:23

For the wages of sin is **death** but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord

The reason he emphasized death, is that it refers us to the actions listed in the OT that are sinful.  That is, if an action's consequence is death in the OT, it's considered sinful post-resurrection.  He also told me I had to take into account the role of women in those times, and we had to alter it to fit the current worldview.  Women in the Torah were treated as submissives to men, not because the Torah commanded it, but because the role of women in those days was extremely submissive.  

For example, there's the following:

Rape of someone who is engaged. If she is not engaged you only have to marry her and give her father 50 shekels. No mention is made of the girl’s opinion. (Deut 22:25)

We're all aware of the dowry system of marriage, where a father basically "sells" his daughter to the best man who comes along.  The selling of a high price assured that the daughter would be going to a home worthy enough for her, by her father's opinion. 

I did some research and came across [this](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Actions_which_demand_the_death_penalty_in_the_Old_Testament) article. I personally don't perceive banishment to be the same as death, and I don't think Jesus nor Paul did either.  Jesus encouraged people to give up everything and follow him, which in Jewish law would be abandoning ones family or banishing themselves. 

Anyways, this entire rambling is just to ask others' opinions about the reasoning this Reverend gave me.  

As for premarital sex and sexual promiscuity, I recently read a comment that explained very well the benefits of [waiting until marriage](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/i31yo/any_redditors_who_waited_until_marriage_to_have/c20jv10)

TL;DR: Reverend answered a question I had about what constitutes sin, would appreciate feedback.  His reasoning: if the consequence was death in the Torah, it's a sin now.
 





























 I really appreciated Elisabeth Sladen and SJS, but it's been half a season since she passed.  Can we update it with something relevant to this series now? Perhaps River? Or EPL? 




 i hope this isn't considered spam. i just want to help someone else out since I can't use it. if you take heart meds or antidepressants, you should disregard.

[healthy trim](http://www.healthytrim.com/htlanding.asp)

This stuff is promoted on a local radio show and one day I gave in and bought a bottle.  However, after receiving it, I decided against taking it.  One of the warnings regards antidepressants, which I take.  So, would anybody like to take it off my hands? It's been sitting in a drawer of mine for 6 months and I feel like someone else could benefit from it.

 Forest of the Dead:

[River: Anita, if he dies, I'll kill him!](/spoiler)

W. T. F.

fixed with the spoiler. 




 The doctor saw a silent in his TARDIS before and after asking rory about why amy   river are cross.  That's something I didn't notice before.  But my question is this:

why was the doctor an idiot at flying the TARDIS on his way to the oval office? River corrected him a few times (scanner, invisibility, silencing the engines) and it doesn't make sense.  it's just a random thing that occurs.... which is why i think it's important.  

Something about this is screaming TARDIS but I can't figure it out.  Stetson doctor didn't interact with the TARDIS  at all.  why not?  why send the invitations if he could just hop over and pick everyone up?

**EDIT** I'm watching it over and scrutinizing every scene.  The scene where they initially get to FL and are using their flashlights (or torches) to get around, you see a spaceman watching them. Look in the reflection of his mask and you can see the doctor acknowledge him.  I'm going with River Song's number one rule on this one... *the doctor lies* 




 I love british entertainment, but I often find myself lost when it comes to poking fun at regions in the UK.  

One example I could think of is from the Boom Town ep of Doctor Who:

Blaine: "We're in Cardiff. London doesn't care, the south-west coast could fall into the sea and they wouldn't notice... [catches herself] Oh, I sound like a Welshman. God help me, I've gone native."

what are the major regional stereotypes in the UK? 














 I'm in the middle of my weight loss journey.  I'm stuck with all my fat clothes and not much $$ to buy a new wardrobe.  

I need advice on how I can transform my current "chubby" wardrobe into a newer "thinner" one without a shopping spree.

also, i hope use of the term "fatty" doesn't offend anyone.  I was just fattier then than I am now :)
