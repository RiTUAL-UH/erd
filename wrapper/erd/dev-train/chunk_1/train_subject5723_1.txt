 I've must've wasted more than 15 pieces of paper trying to wrap my mind around this.

A tank is half full of oil , which has density 920kg/m3. Find the work (in joules) required to pump the oil out of the outlet. Assume g=9.8m/s^2.

The tank is a right circular cylinder and is lying on its side. The radius is 1.5m and the pump extends 1m. The length is 6m.  




 Stoning of Soraya M.
I had to rewind some parts at least 3 times because I couldn't see the screen through all the tears.

 And even if you decide to lose just one more pound, be sure to post more pics. Your handsomeness is always welcome :)   




 Try [electro-swing.com!](http://electro-swing.com). they have lots of different genres of swing, lengthy dj sets but really awesome tracks!

I like minimal beats too. Beats are suppose to compliment a good swing track, just like salt and pepper are suppose to compliment a good steak.
