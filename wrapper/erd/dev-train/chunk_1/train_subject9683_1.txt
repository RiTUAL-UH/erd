 nice :D 




 Pekovic isn't a great defensive player either. 









 U got Kik? 




 At the end of the day Salmons, Stiemsma, heck even Kwame Brown and Smush Parker all of them  Andrea Bargnani. 




 And what if Bennett plays to full potential, you could have Brewer, Martin, Thad-Young, and maybe trade Pekovic and Barea for a good backup Center or PG. 




 Unfortunately, The Knicks and Kings have a much better chance of getting Rondo, if we trade anyone, we're done. Let's see how Hibbert and West lead the team this year. Maybe Stuckey can put up big numbers, his stats when he got starter minutes were just slightly worse than D-Wade this season. Let's hope Solomon Hill is a decent player. Lastly, let's hope Solomon Hill doesn't become the most improved player and Larry Bird does something stupid like trade PG, like they did with Granger, and let's hope they don't trade Hibbert for Monroe, cuz Monroe is only gonna demand a huge contract or leave in free agency. 




 Don't get too fancy, I would recommend at most, a free throw line finger roll, to look like you're gliding. Jump from as far as you can. 




 I love Singleton, but I feel like Dahntay Jones, Jordan Crawford, or Ronnie Brewer would've been better. 









 idk if firstrowsports.eu has fiba, but u can try 




 Another thing i forgot to add, is
If i make another Cavaliers Mix in the future.

What would like to see?
1. LeBron 
2. Love 
3. Irving
4. All 3?
5. Waiters
6. Other (comment suggestion)

 thanks for your sympathy...
...but i thought Joel Embiid was coming back later this season?? 




 :) i made it, glad u enjoyed it, im a pacers fan, but i cant wait to see what he can do.  




 we should waive Rasual Butler or Donald Sloan 

i really want to see some better players :( 




 I'm thinking since we didn't get Shawn Marion (the next juwan howard, riding the bench for rings)

Maybe Dahntay Jones, Ronnie Brewer??

or should we go for more offense? 









 but people could troll youtubers who upload things to their second channels. 




 it looks like this for me http://prntscr.com/4hld2c 









 I'm really late, but I'm really nice:

Enjoy(even tho it's a fake pic):http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9kPCkTpAsOE/UcBS6cwWMBI/AAAAAAAAAKU/lB9OfpMu-C4/s1600/191746700_Selena_Gomez_The_Big_OMG_fini_Swimtrun_123_357lo.jpg 














 Hi, I don't know if people are still looking at this. But....without further ado..

My name is Tim, I posted gaming videos, sometimes Chatroulette trolling, and occasionally a tutorial. 

I do have a capture card for PS3 gaming, but I need to buy HDMI Cables and PS3 HD/AV Component cables

I'm only 15, and I've had a YouTube account since I was 9 lol, but this channel isn't the one from 2007, I made this to start a new chapter in life.

I struggle with depression and anxiety like many teens but I'm also very socially awkward so YouTube is my way to escape from reality, somewhat.

I don't really like posting just gameplay, I like to discuss thing, I'm just not a vLog person so, I commentate over gameplay.

I hope you enjoy my content and subscribe.
Remember it's not an obligation, only subscribe if you like it.

 Lol Nintendo is like Nokia...#unbreakable 




 Have you ever thought of embracing the fact that you made a mistake. For instance, I once did something on instagram that made me look gay in front of most of my friends, but I eventually embraced it, if I accidentally did something "homo" I'd just say "oh well I guess I'm gay" and people would laugh. Soon everyone forgot.
