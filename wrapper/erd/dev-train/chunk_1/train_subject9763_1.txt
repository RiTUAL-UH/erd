 What's your best natural beauty 

That amazing thing that makes your hair super soft 

That perfect thing in your cupboard that makes your skin really hydrated 

The amazing secret that's better than any face wash 

Etc


My skin is really sensitive and my hair seems dry no matter what I do. So I thought maybe some natural treatments might work better.  




 I'm looking for a new foundation. I currently use the Elizabeth Arden plump perfect foundation and although it's good, my skin seems to have changed and now it just sits on my skin. 

I'm looking for a full cvs rage foundation that won't dry my skin out too much. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated  




 One of the most genius things he's said is 'I'd usually recommend the pill for irregular periods, but trying to conceive you don't want that do you?' And then he actually waited for an answer.  




 But that's it, I haven't had a period this month, it was two days early and it's just been spitting for 6 days now. Pink discharge that's sometimes brown.  




 Oops! I didn't think it posted. Stupid phone. 




 He finally agreed to tests lady month but left it too late to tell us that the blood tests had to be taken a week before my period. So we had to wait another month. 
We got the results and we didn't know what they meant so made an appointment. 
When we asked he said the test was 'fine' I asked what that meant and he said 'it means they were fine' I told him I didn't know what that meant and that the test was to see if I was ovulating, because any tests I've done the second line is never as dark as the control line. 
He said 'it probably means you are' and that was all the explanation we got. 
We urged him to refer us or send us for further tests because something is clearly up, especially with my periods being so irregular now. He just kept saying everything was fine and we were young and had plenty of time so there was no rush. 

When we left the receptionist asked if I was okay and I broke down, told her everything . 
She has booked me in with a female doctor and told me I should never have been told two years because all doctors advise a year. 

I'm so upset, I've spent two years feeling broken and devastated. Feeling alone even when my partner tried to comfort me or reassure me. 
Counting down the day in the month to ovulation and then waiting for my period. Doing test after test and willing a second line to appear. 

I'm still spotting, have been for 6 days. Extremely light pink discharge and still no real period.  




 We finally got him to agree to blood tests last month but he informed us to late that they had to be done a week before your period. 
So we waited another month, when we got them back we didn't understand what that meant so we made an appointment. When we asked he said 'the tests came back fine' I asked what that meant and he said 'it means fine' I told him I didn't understand what that meant and did it mean I was ovulating, because whenever I've done ovulation tests the second line is never as dark as the control line. He said 'it probably means you're ovulating' and that was as much of an explanation we got. 
I urged him that clearly we needed more tests and that my periods were now irregular and painful, he just said that everything seemed fine and we were young so there was no rush. 

When we went out into reception the receptionist asked if I was okay and I cried and told her everything, she has booked me in with a female doctor and told me that we should never have been told two years. That a year is always what is advised for further tests etc. 

I'm so upset, every month I take a day off work for when I get my period because I can't handle how depressed I feel once I get it, and I always expect to get it now. I feel broken and my doctor won't listen to me.  




 I wank a lot, when i'm bored or tired or can't sleep or because i'm horny or because i've done it once and i wanna see how quick i can do it again. Plus sometimes it's nice to check out what's going on, ya know. 




 If me and my boyfriend switched he would think 'well she wanks a lot when i'm not around' 'she looks at her boobs and vagina a lot' 'she poops WAY more than she makes out' and finally 'holy shit period pains are the worst thing in the whole world ever' 




 I don't have much in there at the moment, but here you go :)
