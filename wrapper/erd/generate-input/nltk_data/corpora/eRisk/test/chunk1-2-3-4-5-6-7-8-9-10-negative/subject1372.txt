**Profile**

*Monsters: 17*

* 1 Blaster, Dragon Ruler of Infernos ^(Not just good early game, but late game when my grave is flooded with fire monsters)
* 3 Hazy Flame Cerbereus ^(Searcher and can summon without tribute, can't run less than 3)
* 3 Hazy Flame Hydra ^(Easy to get from deck to field and makes Solda with up to 4 materials for field control)
* 2 Hazy Flame Peryton ^(Weeds out Hydras and phynx)
* 1 Hazy Flame Sphyx ^(Great card to summon while Plague Spreader is in the grave)
* 3 Flamvell Firedog ^(Can summon Cerberus, Hydra, or Magician. All great options)
* 2 Kuribandit ^(Set up the grave and possibly grab a rekindling? Yes please)
* 1 Flamvell Magician ^(Makes Star Eater playable as well as other good synchro options)
* 1 Plaguespreader Zombie ^(This + Hazy = Beelze. Makes sphynx more consistent.)

*Spells: 16*

* 3 Mystical Space Typhoon ^(I've tried less. Didn't run well.)
* 3 Hazy Pillar ^(For maximum consistency.)
* 3 Upstart Goblin ^(Many anti-hoban people will not agree, but it really is needed, and my fields can get massive thanks to rekindling.)
* 3 Soul Exchange ^(A very troll [read: bullshit] card that tributes my opponent's monster for my own summon. Starting a peryton play with this is always satisfying.)
* 1 Onslaught of the Fire Kings ^(3 wasn't working well since I could only summon Cerberus or Firedog. Neither is very good under Onslaught.)
* 1 Rekindling ^(Because I can only run 1.)
* 1 Soul Charge ^(Not attacking is painful, but not being able to set up a field at all is even more painful. Under the right conditions, this could win games.)
* 1 Dark Hole ^(Staple)

*Traps: 7*

* 2 Fiendish Chain ^(Cloggy at 3 since I want to be drawing cards to summon, not just stop 1 monster's effect)
* 2 Mirror Force ^(staple)
* 1 Bottomless Trap Hole ^(staple)
* 1 Solemn Warning ^(staple)
* 1 Torrential Tribute ^(Solda makes me wish I could run 2, but alas, I can only run 1)

*Extra Deck: 15*

* 1 Gagaga Cowboy
* 1 Abyss Dweller ^(Because Mermails)
* 3 Hazy Flame Basiltrice ^(Great card when consistently starting out large)
* 1 Evolzar Solda ^(Too good with Hydra. Probably should run 2. This + torrential tribute = fun times.)
* 1 Photon Strike Bounzer ^(Haven't used him at all)
* 1 Ptolemy M7 ^(Sometimes really good to get back a peryton and do another powerful play)
* 1 Gaia Dragon the Thunder Charger ^(Really good fit for when I have no better use for a 0-m basiltrice.)
* 1 Vulcan the Divine ^(Won me a few games when I just couldn't find away around certain stall cards. Fire Attribute for Blaster)
* 1 Stardust Dragon ^(Dragon-type for Blaster with good effect)
* 1 Scrap Dragon ^(See stardust dragon)
* 1 Crimzon Blader ^(Fire Attribute for Blaster with good effect)
* 1 Beelze of the Diabolical Dragons ^(See Plaguespreader Zombie)
* 1 Star Eater ^(Must I say it? I think this is a great card to have dispite being situational upon 2 cards of which I run only 1 of each.)

Looking for serious suggestions based on how the meta is doing. Considering anything for side-deck since it's purely experimental and I'm not committed to any of it.

We first narrowed it down to 5 based on preliminary performance. Then down to 3 based on our least favorites. Then we graded each one on different criteria such as creativity, believability, performance, fun, potential as an anime deck, etc. These two were practically neck and neck the entire time.

The Deck with a good backstory and ultimately some fun and unusual dragon mixing came out on top. Is it just coincidence that when tested against each other, Gem-Knights also won?

---

**Winners!!!**

P:M me soon and tell me if you'd prefer packs of Premium Gold or Dragons of Legend. Remember to leave me your shipping info there as well. Must warn you that PGLD packs will take longer to get. (They're vastly overpriced at locals, so I'll have to wait for either Wal*Mart or Target to have them in stock.) 




 I've come across an iPhone 5 that's connected to Sprint's network that I'd like to get unlocked, but it doesn't seem like any googling can get me a guide or service that can actually do it for a Sprint phone. 




 For anyone who was wondering, no, this contest has not been abandoned. We have just a few more decks to go through. It's hard when we often cannot find enough free time between all of our team members. The prizes are still has follows:

1st place: choice of 2 packs of PGLD or 2 packs of DRLG.*

2nd place:  choice of 1 pack of PGLD or 1 pack of DRLG*

*note: PGLD prize may take a long time to arrive since everyone nearby seems to be out of stock. 




 If you have not submitted your Anine Deck directly to me, then sorry, you will not be entered. My birthday passed last Tuesday, so the submission period is finally over. Team Two toes is working hard to rebuild all of your entries on DN for review and testing.

Again, we are judging based on how well the deck is put together and how believable it is that we might see the deck in the anime, as well as which ones we like personally.

Boy did we get quite a few lights worn and chaos entries. Because of this, we will not allow two decks of the same category to place for a prize. If it so happens to be voted as such, we'll only take the one that was entered sooner.

Thanks for your submissions everyone.

Also, PGLD at my locals jumped to over 20 dollars to purchase. Target and Wal Mart don't seem to be of any help. Winners will have a choice to take Dragons of Legend packs instead so I can distribute prizes faster. Later, I'll update this post with a list of all qualified entrants. 



















 I have a stage I want to use in my stage expansion, but the camera is annoyingly close to the players the entire time. Is there anyone who can point me to a guide that will help me fix this problem? 









 **These Guidelines are temporary**

Any complains or comments about these guidelines should be commented on in this post.

Please follow these guidelines strictly until we're done finalizing them. Failure to do so will result in a temporaray ban from /r/YGOSales only. Further non-compliance will result in a permanent ban across /r/YGOSales and its related subreddits.

**[Guidelines can be found HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/YGOSales/wiki/guidelines)**

From now on, the initial submit button will take you to these guidelines to remind you of our rules.

Also, some of you haven't been assigning your own flair. This is not the moderators' job. It takes 3 seconds. Posts over an hour old without link flair will be taken down immediately. 




 So, Those who took advantage of it, so what mat did you get?

I got myself a playmat I was planning to get for a long time. I took advantage of the sale to get this [Project M playmat](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/65160123/Playmats/Project-M-Playmat-flat.png)

---

Those who you who missed it, what mat would you have wanted to get?

Also, here's the code I normally use for $2 off a regular order: **INKED10** 




 You can now put a link flair on your posts. THIS IS MANDATORY.

This obseletes the old way of making sure we have a user-written tag on each one. This doesn't just allow our site to look prettier, but it allows you to change from one kind of post to another without waiting 7 days and/or creating a new thread.

Link flairs will help others quickly seeing whether you are buying, selling, or both. Remember to assign this flair AS SOON AS YOU MAKE A POST. It's not that hard, and only takes 3 seconds. 

I have done the front page a courtesy of assigning flair for them, but moderators will not be responsible for adding flair to each post. It is a user's job to distinguish their own posts.

---

If you do not use a pre-approved flair, or forgot to put flair up, a moderator will tell you to assign proper flair. After that, if you still don't assign the proper flair, a moderator is free to remove the post without any further notification.

Soon, I'll be adding sort links to the side-bar so you can easily sort by the type of post you want. 




 **[Binder](http://imgur.com/a/ePOJs)**

**[Misc Cards](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsFLBcRk6Sp6dGR2aEVOa2h4cUJVRFZNeDNFbW9VQmc usp=drive_web#gid=0)**

If you want to buy either binder as a whole, I can do it for $20 or a card lot worth $20.

Wants:

* **Paypal**
* Wind-up Arsenal Zenmaioh
* Maxx "C"
* Shared Ride 




 [](/paypal)  
only

**[Binder](http://imgur.com/a/ePOJs)**

**[Misc Cards](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsFLBcRk6Sp6dGR2aEVOa2h4cUJVRFZNeDNFbW9VQmc usp=drive_web#gid=0)**

If you want to buy either binder as a whole, I can do it for $20 (cards only) or $25 (cards and Binder). 




 I revised the entire flair system to be a bit more accurate. Don't worry, nobody's flair was "downgraded" and nobody has been "robbed" of feedback or any priviledges related thereof.

**If you're flair is wrong, or you do not have flair because of this new revision, PM me! or message the mods!**. If it's wrong, I'd prefer you message me.

This will be in effect for the next week. 




 I cannot seem to figure out how to make this element appear somewhere else. This is for /r/arryugiohmods. I've tried just about everything. The drop-down menu ends up blocking the very top subreddit that you're subscribed to and I really need to change this if I'm going to make it work.

---

I just figured it out. The proper CSS class is as follows:

    .drop-choices.inuse

In case anybody else is wondering. 




 A recent conflict has brought to my attention the very real possibility that users can be scammed out of hundreds of dollars. I will be planning an overhaul of our safety guidelines and regulations. Until this overhaul can be finalized, please follow these temporary short guidelines.

* No transactions worth over 20 dollars.
* Use tracking on all orders.
* Never use "Friends and Family" in the paypal options.
* Never pay more than half until you get a tracking number.

I don't want mods to become the "bad guys". When I started YGOSales, I wanted it to be a safe place for buying and selling away from eBays unfair share of your hard earned money. As the founder, i do not want the possibility, regardless of how remote, to be seen responsible for undeserving users losing significant sums of their hard earned money. 









 Today, I'm debuting a new feature for the subreddit. These are emoticons. You can use them the same way you would format a [link](http://www.reddit.com). For those of you who have never formatted a [link](http://www.reddit.com) before, you would do it like this:

    [Text here](http://www.fullURLhere.com)

The difference is, you do not have to put a full URL, and you do not have to put text. Simply do the following

    [](/exact-emoticon-name-here)

For example, to use the paypal emoticon:

[](/paypal)

You would enter the following

    [](/paypal)

I'll be working on condensing the formatting on the list of emoticons. For now, simply refer to the sidebar if you forget how to do it.

---

**Of course, with new features come new rules. For now, anyone spamming or abusing emoticons will be temporarily banned**. (This will not apply to the blanket ban across the sister and main subreddits.)

Please use wisely.

VOTE FOR NEW EMOTICONS IN THE COMMENTS!!! 









 Does anyone know of a reliable service for getting a GameCube controller's joystick replaced. My friend he a controller that shorthops whenever the user dashes right. No longer suitable for project m. Yes, we already tried resetting the controller.

I want to use this at locals in a couple weeks. It's what I've been trying to finish along with Airblade Turbo. Each time I look at it, I wonder how I can make it better, but I don't know how.

For locals, I'll need a side-deck that prepares for the following:

* Mermails
* Fire Fists
* Geargia
* Bujins
* Constellars
* Harpies 




 If you haven't seen the last meta post, you can find it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/YGOBinders/comments/21hlql/meta_old_guidelines_new_guidelines_community/). We strongly recommend you read it.

Both /r/ygosales and /r/yugioh101 have implemented a universal link placed right above the tabmenu. (See those subreddits for an example.)

As a user/trader here, what would you like to see above the tabmenu?

*Note:* I cannot make this link user specific. So, putting your own feedback thread up there for personal reference is not possible.

Thanks for letting me know!

 **Intro**

A new anime is coming. And it's called Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V. And as you may have noticed, Yu-Gi-Oh! characters don't exactly play on the level we do. Those powerful cards must be very rare. So I purpose this:

####ANIME DECK BUILDING CONTEST

Let's all build a deck as if we were an anime character in Yu-Gi-Oh! Why not? it will be fun. And there will be prizes.

**IMPORTANT**

READ CAREFULLY

Entries posted here and entries that do not follow the guidelines will be ignored. I'm also receiving a lot of entires that do this

 -monster -monster -another monster -yet another monster -why this monter -why not this monster

Please stop doing these. If I get too much more of these, I will ignore them.

**Rules**

Each deck must adhere to the following rules to ensure that each deck feels like it would be seen in an anime. It will also simulate the rarity of cards in the anime.

* Your deck may have 3 copies of 1 card, and 2 copies of another card. The rest of the cards must be 1 copy each.
* Your deck may have up to 2 Limited cards and up to 2 Semilimited cards.
* April 2014 ban list will be used for this.
* You are free to use any card available to Dueling Network
* You may use either synchros or Xyz monsters, but not both.
* You may use fusion monsters.
* Extra Deck extended up to 20 monsters.
* No side-deck. We will not pay attention to them.
* No custom cards.
* Please,  make it believable that it would be in an anime.

**Submissions**

Submissions start immediately. Go [here](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=test_subject1372) and submit a message with both a *Dueling Network Screenshot* and a text list with the *full name of each card* in your deck.

The decks will be judged by Team Two Toes themselves, meaning me, Lily247, and a couple other players from our locals.

The last submission date will be on my birthday, April 29th. After that, Team Two Toes will take up to 2 weeks to judge the decks.

**Prizes**

Since judging is right after my birthday, I'll be able to fund a couple small prizes. Those who wish to fund or donate a prize should PM me. By default, 1st Prize will be 2 packs of Premium Gold (10 cards total). 2nd Prize will be 1 pack of Premium Gold (5 cards total).

Any changes to the prize pool will be announced on April 29th or 30th. At that time, the prize pool will be finalized.

**Example Submission**

^(*Format your submission in the following manner.*)

Character Name: Reiden Lightman

Backstory: My father worked in a factory that helped make the cards, so he snuck me a few. I won a duel disc in a sweepstakes and started dueling outside the factory during my time off for extra money. ^(*Keep your backstories short.*) 









 A buddy of mine I met while pulling from Premium Gold told me that Primal Origins has a few cards that will cause **Gimmick Puppet Disaster Leo** to jump in price.

Is there any truth to this? Am I holding onto them for nothing? 




 Right now, I have a neat message for hovering over your karma in /r/ygobinders. But, I can ONLY get the positioning to be the same between firefox and chrome if I set "top:" and "right:" to 0.

    .userkarma:hover:before {
      position:fixed;
      top:0px;
      right:0px;
      display:block;
      z-index:1000;
      width:250px;
      height:83px;
      padding:3px 0 0 50px;
      border:1px solid #333;
      background:#FFF url(%%upstartgoblin%%) no-repeat left top;
      content:"YOU WANT SOME'A THIS?";
      text-align:left;
      font-size:10px;
      color:blue;
      font-weight:bold;
      border-radius:4px;
      -moz-border-radius:4px;
      -webkit-border-radius:4px;
    }

Top and right were meant to be 137px and 4px (respectively) to breifly cover the subreddit information between the searchbar and the "show my flair" textbox. But, when I use 137 and 4, it appears in different places between different users. This happens because one of the accounts I use to test doesn't have the mod mail icon, and the karma field varies in size based on how much karma each user has.

But I need for this to appear in the exact same location to matter what. I'm at a loss.

**For some reason, it just decided to work correctly, and I have no idea what is making it work correctly.** 




 First off, I'd like to thank BBgun69 for the subreddit that is /r/ygobinders and the rest of the moderators for the hours they have poured into this ecosystem.

---

**Breif Rundown**

As many of you know, /r/ygobinders started off as an iota of a trading community vastly overshadowed by trade binders on the main subreddit. At that time, feedback was submitted by all and tracked by one. All in all, it was not a very effective, efficient, or satisfying system.

I started posting here to promote the subreddit because I saw that it had potential. Strangely enough, /r/ygobinders and /r/ygosales began to blossom together when trading on /r/Yugioh was reduced to a single thread per week to cut the clutter. Nevertheless, it is you, the users and traders who keep this going.

You all deserve a thanks for that as well.

---

**Old Guidelines**

I, along with the others, have been working on a newer more streamlined method of presenting basic rules and information to the community. Less digging should be required to find the same information, and we are happy about that, and we hope you are too.

All basic rules are in the sidebar. Each user will still be held accountable to their own defiance of these rules. Sure, concequences may be small in many cases, but nobody has a valid excuse for ignoring them.

Some users may need be reminded that /r/Yugioh and its daughter subreddits are on a blanket ban system meaning a ban on any of these subreddits will earn you a ban on the others as well. These will include:

* /r/Yugioh
* /r/ygobinders 
* /r/ygosales
* /r/ygofeedback

^(Side note: /r/yugioh101 is not officially part of this blanket ban, but has common moderators with a few of the other subreddits and will constitute semi-blanket bans at its own discretion.)

---

**New Guidelines**

Continuous user feedback has allowed us to discuss necessary changes and guideline additions and that will be enforced as soon as they are available on our new [regulations page](http://www.reddit.com/r/YGOBinders/wiki/rulesandregulations). Be sure to check that often to keep yourself up to date.

New changes will include but not limited to:

* less cluttered titles
* descriptive, organized, and less lazy descriptions
* shipping cost awareness

Not to mention, we have updates to writings of old articles such as [Scam and Trade Safety](http://www.reddit.com/r/YGOBinders/wiki/scam_and_trade_safety). Don't worry, we are not relying on outdated information. We'll be making necessary updates.

*New*:

I've managed to hide the scores for each post, but we'll still have upvoting and downvoting available for binders. This is the take out the habbit of looking at certain posts or not looking at certain posts based on a high or low number. Thanks to upvotes and downvotes, the best posts and binders will still appear before the rest.

You are *HIGHLY* encouraged to search the "new" tab of this subreddit. Newer posts often don't get immediate attention resulting in decent and quality trades never happening.

---

**User Feedback**

We are constantly encouraging user feedback on all aspects of our subreddit. This ranges from look and feel to stronger enforcement of guidelines. There will always be a button to message the moderators. As well, feel free to line the latest sticky with more feedback.

---

**Closing**

We are a community of traders and Yu-Gi-Oh! players. Remember to respect each other and trade fairly. Once again, I'd like to thank everyone of you, my fellow mods, and BBgun69. This has been a great experience so far.

 Put more clearly, what has someone thought about you for liking my little pony that was unusual or paculiar. I'm looking for the non typical stereotypes such as being old, living with your mother, out of shape, smelly, homosexual, etc.

I've actually had someone ask me about other hub shows like Strawberry Shortcake and Littlest Pet Shop. They were surprised to hear I strongly disliked both shows and asked me why My Little Pony is the "exception" for grown men to watch and not other shows. 









 **Where to Get It**: [Link to Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/1vdar4/a_78_stage_build_for_project_m_302_back_and/)

**Build By**: GarbageHead4

This build is very unique. And there's a big reason why. It includes 78 stages. GarbageHead took a classic expansion build of Project M (which included stages from Smash 64, Melee, and Brawl) and now we have this piece of work.

A few gripes I have off the bat to get them out of the way:

* The Music menu is has completely inaccurate stage previews and icons making it hard to adjust anything.
* JCaesar's Menu Music.
* Feint - Homebound music. I'm definitely not going to be using this.
* Incomplete Music information (blank names appearing when round starts).
* Choosing Skyloft on music menu screen causes crash (should find a fix)
* Most icons in Menu music are strike icon (no fix in sight)

Of course, not all of this will count against Garbagehead. It just detracted from the general experience.

There are a lot of stages included in here. Some of them I've seen in other builds, others I haven't. I'll be going over some of the bigger points of some stages later, especially music since music had to be put to each added stage.

* Yoshi's Mountain: Cool but unfitting song. I'd find something better.
* Research Facility: I'd generally recommend staying away from screaming or metal given the very niche fanbase as well as it does not inherently fit well with technological stages.
* Castle Sky: Pretty okay song, but it's metal on a medieval setting, which doesn't fit well.
* SSE Forest: The song was fitting, given the visual context, but it wasn't what I would have picked seeing that it's supposed to be from Subspace, not Zelda.
* Final Needle: Music was well chosen. However, I wouldn't include this stage because it goes from being hard to see to harsh on my eyes. It's very distracting.
* Mewtwo Stadium: I much prefer this version of the stage to the brighter version I see going around. The other version has had shadow errors and wasn't as interesting as this one. Good choice.
* 1337M: Fun stage, but just because a song is titled "King Kong", that doesn't mean it is good for battle or fitting for a DK stage.
* Hyrule Castle M: Great music choice and love the stage.
* Jungle Hijinx: Didn't expect such a fitting song. Girlfriend flipped out like a fangirl.
* Bowser's Castle: Love the music choice. "Bowser's Castle". I once tried a version of this stage with tons of errors, but it's good to see a very well done version of this stage in use somewhere.
* Yoshi's Story M: Great steage, although with thin walls. Has its original Music from the N64 version.
* Summit: Cool flat P:M version with a fitting Metroid Prime song. Shoutout to Metroid Prime fans!
* Spear Pillar: More balanced version of the stage was a nice touch, but the song was uninteresting.
* Aquatic Ruin Zone: The music choice was meh. General remix of sonic sounds. It's called "Green Hill" but didn't sound anything like it. I didn't want to play on that stage anymore after hearing that.
* The Whirl Islands: Really don't like the techno Pokemon love song. It's just... not that good in any sense. This song cause my friends and I to stay off the stage aside from the stage being incredibly huge with little interesting details.
* Magnet Train: I don't understand the music choice. I would have put it on a main Pokemon stage. Not everyone is a Pokemon fan who will know what "Magnet Train" is.
* Venom: I'd take this stage out. It is very boring compared to the Melee original and functions improperly when compared to the Melee version.
* Twilight Realm: Has a remix of Midna's Lament (extremely over-rated song). I would have put in Zant's Theme instead since Zant is actually present in the stage. The High platform causes a balance/camping issue even with the moving platform.
* Dance Party: Great sounding dance song for a great looking well-designed dance stage. I won't spoil the song, but I wasn't expecting to hear what I heard.
* Paper Castle: A lot of Mario stages in thei sbuild. It started to get old. I do like that the Paper Mario Thousand Year Door battle theme was chosen.
* Half Pipe Dream Land: Meh. Music was okay despite being what sounded like a vague remix of Nintendo sounds.
* The Beginning: Good stage choice. Brings smash to its roots. The music was a great choice, but suffice to say, it didn't loope well with itself. I would have found an extended and/or remixed version to put in.

I cannot blame GarbageHead for a lot of this, and nobody should. I would however hold it to Project M fans to test their stages for fun, enjoyability, and noticeable errors. I didn't notice any lag on any stages, so there's that as well. And unlike some builds, there weren't any lighting errors.

The overall quality of the build's stage choices showed through, and I'm glad I can say that.

**Why you might want it**: 78 stages

**Why you might not want it**: 78 stages. It is a con as well. Customizing it could be a bit of a um... hassle. Not all of the stages are very appealing or balanced or fun. Different players will like different stages. I may end up using a derivative of these codes to expand my build with a few stages, although, I'll want everything to look professionally done.

**Would I recommend it and why**: If you like having an overload of stages, why don't you have this build? Get it, customize it, love it, have a blast.

**What about for tournaments**? Definitely not. I cannot see any tournament accepting such a huge expansion without defined neutrals, counterpicks, and casual stages labeled in game.

**Score**: 6/10

It's mostly because of the music menu and some music/stage choices.

I think I'll be taking on [this build](http://www.reddit.com/r/customsmash/comments/1wyx7w/project_w_update/) next. 









 Earlier today I enabled /r/Yugioh101 as a public subreddit to let the posting begin. Small questions and discussions will be up for starting yourself. Bigger scaled discussions can be submitted to /u/DiscussionThreads (link in the sidebar). Articles will go through a mod to prevent multiple articles on the same thing.

We are looking for a lot of budget deck write-ups so just get whatever you have to a moderator. 




 I'd like to thank the 50 and more subscribers who are already willing to learn and teach with others to help the Yu-Gi-Oh! online community grow, flourish, and most importantly innovate. We want to think differently here at Yu-Gi-Oh! 101 with the mindset that EVERYBODY can be good at Yu-Gi-Oh!.

So, some basic guidelines on general posting.

---

**Be Respectful**

If you are harassing others around you and demeaning others opinion, you are not only breaking reddiquette, but you're blatantly breaking our own rules. Do no attempt to make any argument without any elaboration.

**Follow all of /r/yugioh's rules**

This is a cousin of /r/yugioh and as such we will be following most of their posting rules. This includes including text deck lists along with screenshots and allowing room for everyone to contribute.

**Do no post coverage unless it is your own**

We are not here to observe coverage of any tournament experience other than our own. Deck lists and tournament reports etc. will not be welcome here unless it is your own deck list or tournament report. There may be exceptions from time to time, but not without running through the moderators.

**Check /r/yugioh for news and updates**

This subreddit is focused on discussion, friendly banter, and building each other up. Please, by all means, take into account any new cards that may be released soon, but don't post that news here.

**If you're looking for trading or sales, there are subreddits for that**

If you want to trade, you can go to /r/ygobinders. If you want to sell and buy, you can go to /r/ygosales. If you do either, make sure to keep track of your feedback at /r/ygofeedback.

---

That's about everything. If you want to be a writer of on of our official discussion articles, message a moderator and get approval. 









 /r/yugioh101

**I'd like to introduce everyone to what I've been building recently**. We seem to have had a lot of self-hate disappear within ourselves with the dying of certain threads. But we still often see people bummed that R/F and "I'm new" and "getting back into the game" threads still exist.

I figured that if they still exist, then obviously a few links in the side-bar is not helping these players out.

So I founded a new subreddit which not only doubles its purpose of a R/F deck subreddit, but also helps new and returning players ease themselves into the Online community.

---

**THIS IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR /R/YUGIOH** and it never will be and it was never intended to be.

The Wiki will have a lot of great information and archives ready to help new players get right in. Anyone interested in helping build these archives or improve need only message me or another moderator.

Speaking of which, if it gets big, we may need moderators. And I'm also looking for a fellow judge or 2 to help me fill in the Wiki's simplified How-To-Play section.

Thanks everyone for your interest.

---

**Features to look forward to**

* Occasional Budget Deck Features
* Simplified How to Play guides
* Tutoring/mentor Program
* Feature of video explanations for those who dislike reading
* User suggestions for other features are welcome.
* Possibly: I'd like to get per-deck communities started where players all playing the same deck can gather around and discuss its strengths and weaknesses. 




 [Mellenium Puzzles](http://i.imgur.com/Zyi26M7.png)

It's an improvement from another entry I did. If I could, I'd switch that entry with this one. But, it is likely that I'll adopt this for /r/yugioh101 and possibly make a green version for /r/ygosales. 




 Here's a game we can all play. Ask some bullshit ruling question or questions in the comments below. Reply to others with a ruling that is also complete bullshit.

---

**This is all in good fun**. Do not ask a serious ruling question. (Feel free to message me about rulings.) Have fun. Keep it one ruling question per comment.

Here's a minor update to my last constellar deck profile. It is still a mixture of your basic build and the +1 engine featured in Joe Boglie's Fire Fist build. Unfortunately, it's going to take me a bit longer to build this since my extra deck was stolen. My friends want to help me rebuild it, and some of /r/yugioh (you know who you are) have been helping too. Thanks.

Any questions or suggestions are very **very** welcome. Please help me improve.

Side deck could really use some help. It's Maxx C; Swords of Concealing; Upstart Goblin; Forced Back; Gozen Match; Shadow Imprisoning Mirror; Mind Crush; Soul Drain.

 My constellar's extra deck got stolen at locals and the cameras couldn't catch anyone. The only camera that could see me was from across the room. Now, I need to get that all over again, and one of those was the Ptolemy M7 that my GF gave me as a gift.

1 gagaga cowboy

2 Constellar Omega (1 ultimate, 1 ultra)

3 Pleiades

1 Ptolemy m7

Volcasauras

Zenmaioh

Our locals judge at least put up some good trades for my judge token (I still have another one), so I have a tiras and paladynamo, and a friend gave me a Volca to help me feel better.

Still have 70 dollars of cards to replace. Wish me luck. 




 My mom's computer, the one I would use to switch builds, is finally and fully dead in the water. I cannot switch builds. Our temporary replacement is old as hell. It doesn't have usb2.0 and cannot wen handle playing a small movie file.

I'm in the market for a USB-SD card reader. Until I get that or a new computer with an SD card reader, I cannot get to reviewing any builds.

I promise, as soon as I can, I will get back to doing more reviews. I'm especially excited for the chance to praise/rip apart that P:M+ build I just saw. 




 https://www.dropbox.com/s/97k7gcn51dvfjks/Photo%20Feb%2015%2C%201%2004%2046%20PM.jpg

Konami sent this as a gift. I'm sure my other two local judging buddies got these as well. I looked on eBay, and they are apparently very scarce and pretty valuable. (Around 50-70.) But I don't think I'll sell them anytime soon.

But look at me rambling on, let's have a bit of casual fun and show off what we've gotten in the mail. 




 Hello. We at /r/ygosales are trying something new. We received complaints about ebay links being a bit annoying. And we've discovered that it is a hassle to go through making a thread for a single card or small group of cards.

If you have something small to sell or would like to leave a link to an ebay auction you're doing, leave it here in this thread. This thread will last throughout the weekend.

Please limit your ebay links to 5 or less. 









 I can't stand this guy. Every day he comes to my house. He looks in through my window. I swear, if he wanted to kill me, he could have done it with a silenced rifle and been done with it. He probably would even get away with it. Nobody appears to have called the authorities to report this guy. He doesn't seem interested in talking to me or getting to know me or even steal anything of mine.

Every morning I look out my window. Sometimes he is already there, but on some mornings, he leaves me alone. Sometimes he will not arrive until I'm about to leave or eating breakfast. I guess it depends on when he wakes up and how long it takes him to get dressed in that redundant suit. It's the same black business suit he always wears. I never see him arrive. I always miss it. He's either there, or he's not.

When I get in my car and open the garage, he appears to be missing. Hiding near my bushes, I presume. They're not too far from where he normally stands. Can't he be more creative? It's not the most sneaky thing anybody has done. I just head to my office with a brisk pace, glad to be rid of him.

My office is on the second floor. No trees outside. I work in accounting with my nose on the numbers, and my numbers on the nose. I'm not bothered until I go out to lunch. I never stay in. No matter where or how far I go, that man seems to find me more often than not. I'm convinced it's not just one man anymore.

He wouldn't come in at all, but watch through the windows instead. Sometimes, when I try using a drive through, I could swear I see him inside about ten feet inside the building. A week ago, I started only going through the drive through. I have my meals in my office now.

End of the day, I'm at home, making dinner, and he is back here behind my tree watching from the outside. He looks a bit different now. He must be stubborn to keep an eye on me, since I keep the blinds and curtains closed now. Every time I peek, he is there trying to look in.

I don't know how nobody else sees this guy. He's at least six feet tall and standing in plain sight. I've started to believe he is part of some government surveillance. They could track me through my phone's GPS, and they could be suspicious of how well the company is doing with my clients. I can't leave my phone anywhere; a client might call me and I could miss something important.

For the love of god, I just want to be left alone. Sooner or later, I'm just going to run outside and attack him myself. Of course I've called the cops, but he's always gone by the time they come, which leads me to believe he's tracing my house calls. The cops refuse to stick around to survey the area since I have no proof.

Does anyone else have a problem with a tall man in a suit staring at you in secret?

This was strongly inspired by the *+1 Fire Fist* build by Joe Bulgli. I thought trying to get a +1 on every turn was a great goal. And since my spell/traps were so similar in Constellars already, I thought that adapting it a bit further might be a good idea.

And for the most part, this deck is pretty consistent. (It still gets those draws with 3 Sombre in the hand sometimes. Thinking about taking two out for Cardcar D or Upstart Goblin.)

I'd like opinions.

**INB4 SOMEONE SAYS "NETDECKER"**

Remember that netdecking is not inherently bad. I have experience running this deck, and I wanted to try running it a slightly different way. I heard different opinions about 1 or 2 bear in the deck, and 3 is completely unexpected, but I have 5 cards to get out the deck with bear, and 3 of those search either another bear or a Kaus.

It's great; I've been able to cycle tenki-bear-tenki-bear until I draw a Pollux or Algeidi that I can use with Kaus.

Also, I used to run the exact same traps in addition to 1 Compulsory Evacuation Device and 2 Dimensional Prison. So that didn't change much. I ran the 3 Tenki, 3 MST, 2 lance before this build came along.

 **Deck**: Dark Worlds

**Archetype**: Dark Worlds

**Cost**: $20-$150

**Description**: The first budget deck feature we have is a polarizing one. By that, we mean you either love and enjoy the deck or despise it with a passion. If you're new to the game, don't worry about this. No matter what deck you play, some players will respect you and others will hate you.

Dark World is an archetype that causes their monster's effects to be activated after being discarded from the hand. A lot of the spells and traps work hard to draw these monsters as fast as possible and then discard them. Their main tools for doing this are **Gates of Dark World** and **Dark World Dealings**.

**Building**: Structure Deck; Gates of the Underworld is a structure deck that comes with plenty of the cards you need to get right into the game. If you buy three, you will have the tools to play around with ratios of certain monsters, spells, and traps. These cost about $20.

If you want to change it up, after buying as many structure decks as you want, buy some traps that are not included with it to make it stronger.

Edit: viewers might like to know that we are a community driven source. This is also just a test/beta post. A different guide will be written to obsolete this one. If you want to write a budge deck feature, submit it directly to a moderator following this format.

My office is on the second floor. No trees outside. I work in accounting with my nose on the numbers. May be hard to believe, but my numbers are always on the nose. No distractions to ruin my day. But, somehow, I always seem to be bothered at lunch. I never stay in. But no matter where or how far I go, that man seems to find me more often than not. I thought that changing my patterns or just eating somewhere different would throw him off. More often than not, he seems to always know where I'm going to go.

He doesn't even come inside the restaurant. He watches through the window. Although, one day, at a drive through, I could swear I saw him inside about ten feet behind the woman who handed me my meal. A week ago, I started only going through the drive through. I have my meals in my office now.

End of the day, I'm at home, making dinner, and he is back here behind my tree watching from the outside. That's how it used to be. It's hard to watch through blinds and thick curtains. Every time I peek, he is there trying.

I don't know how nobody else sees this guy. He's at least six feet tall and standing in plain sight. I've started to believe he is part of some government surveillance. The only reason I could think of them watching me is my recent success with my clients. I get a call from one once or twice a night. It's a relaxing distraction from what's going on. A fifty minute call goes from redundant to a blissful.

For the love of god, I just want this man to go away. Sooner or later, I'm just going to run outside and attack him myself. Of course I've called the cops, but he's always gone by the time they come. And they refuse to survey the area and stick around to see.

Does anyone else have a problem with a tall suited man staring at you in secret? 









 **Hello again.**

test_subject1372 here with another announcement.

In case you missed the previous sticky, ArcaniteMagician is now a head mod, and we're looking for feedback to make this subreddit a better place for everybody.

**So here's what we're working on!**

We have a user working on an upgrade to the GracefulCharityBot to help users quickly get prices to make buying and selling faster and more fun.

Due to user feedback, we are no longer allowing Ebay links in user-created threads. We will be trying Ebay/Quick-Sale threads for those looking to sell individual cards/decks. Please let us know if you would prefer these threads over the weekend or thoughout the week.

I have slimmed down the side-bar to make room for a new section I am planning on for urgent sales. You will be free to message the moderators with a link to your thread and an explanation of your situation. If it is urgent, and you need the money soon, we can keep your selling threads visual for all to see.

I hope everyone will find these changes satisfying. We are always accepting user feedback. There's a handy button on the sidebar for messaging the moderators. 









 **Are you a calabrel fan? Are you Calabrel?**

You're probably going to hate a lot of what I have to say. And I'm sorry I have to start off on that note, but please stay with me and understand where I'm coming from.

**Where to Get it**: http://smashboards.com/threads/calabrels-custom-3-02-project-m-build.346028/

**Build by**: Calabrel

Just from the page, I could tell that this build had a lot of promise. Everything on the front page was kept to a firm standard of maintaining Project M's original stage collisions and camera movements. I guess this was to prevent his build of being banned from tournaments. And it shows. The stages feel great.

All of the changes are even reflected in the stage select screen. What a guy. I love it when I don't have to keep a pen and paper or laptop on me to know what stage I'm picking. Not to mention, page 2 is filled with very competitive stages. This must have taken a long time to do.

^(Side note due to complaints: the stages are mostly remixes of past stages so that it feels tournament friendly. Nothing too interesting outside of the addition of chibi robo stages and music changes to fit the stages. Doesn't do much for the build, but it is satisfying.)

That's almost all the good stuff I have to say about this build. And I'm pretty sure when Calabrel reads the rest, I'll be flamed and probably reported. Nah, he's a good guy, he wouldn't do that. Right?

Anyway, moving on, I have nothing to say about character additions since the fighters are identical to P:M with nothing added and nothing changed. No comments necessary.

But let's talk music. I feel like this was Overclocked remix on parade, and after a while of reading the song names and sources, it got boring. And who wants an entire game to sound so much the same? I did like his replacements over KK Slider's songs. I won't spoil that, so go figure it out yourself.

Starting at the menu, the music changes when you enter the character select screen which isn't necessary and is actually distracting. I said the same in BTBM's build. But let me bring up the music choices. Feint - Homebound was very obvious, and I'm tired of it being used. I also seem to find that intro the Smash Bros documentary, and I'm tired of seeing that in multiple builds as well.

You want to know the reason my build used music from Frozen? I didn't think anybody else would be doing it, it matched the look and feel of my build, and it was a fresh change from the techno and/or rock songs that everyone else seems to be using. On top of that, my choices make great, short menu tracks.

Menu tracks should be around a 50 to 90 seconds, but instead we get bulky files of 180+ seconds for MENU MUSIC. We're not in the menu that often, and it goes quiet after two minutes. A long file is not necessary and shouldn't be used as it takes up a lot of space and won't be heard full through.

Outside of the menu, the music isn't even that bad. There's a lot of OC remix, but it's good music at least. But I can't use this music pack with my friend Luke because he's a music major and will likely only hear noise in certain songs. Calabrel even has a few victory themes. (However, some are far too long, reaching up to 26 seconds. Victory themes should be kept to 10 seconds since most players rush to start a new round.)

It's also good to know I wasn't the only one who thought to put [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaBJpAS29qI) in P:M.

Now let's talk about looping!

The following files are not looped at all

* w15
* w19
* w26
* w27
* x01
* x04

Now let's read a little something Calabrel said.

 Some of it is. I took some of the more obvious ones and looped them.

 [source](http://www.reddit.com/r/SSBPM/comments/1vbn5w/calabrels_302_custom_project_m_build_enjoy/ceqqdvz)

Why didn't he loop everything properly? Fading a song out and having it start over again doesn't count as looping. HAL Laboratories didn't do this, and neither did the Project M Backroom. And what's with the Ballad of the Goddess loop? It's not looped very well, and all he had to do was take a file from a previous version of P:M.

Not to mention, the naming in the game and menu are not consistent. If you want to know more of what I mean, read my [last review](http://www.reddit.com/r/SSBPM/comments/1wpnnu/review_bobby_the_broke_monarchs_project_m_build/).

The music is a drastic shortcoming of this build, and the vast amount of hype and anticipation for this build is just horribly undeserved in my opinion.

---

**Why you might want it**: A plethora of awesome stages.

**Why you  might not want it**: If you take your set to a lot of tournaments, I'd recommend keeping this on a secondary SD card in case your TO doesn't approve. Also, everything I said about the music.

**Would I recommend it and why?**: Yes and No. If you want it, install someone ELSE'S music pack. I'd recommend [mine](http://forums.kc-mm.com/Gallery/BrawlView.php?Number=35478 Vault=audio) or [BobbyTheBrokeMonarch's](http://www.reddit.com/r/SSBPM/comments/1wloz8/btbm_302_custom_build_updated/).

**What about for tournaments?** Get approval from the TO a month in advanced so he/she can let others know that it will be there. The stages might be distracting and throw many players off if they are not used to these stages. If you go to a lot of tournaments, keep this on a secondary (not primary) SD card in case your TO doesn't approve.

**Score**: 6/10

Once I have plans for my next review, I'll let ya know. LEAVE A LINK TO YOUR BUILD TO GET IT REVIEWS. REMEMBER, A REVIEW IS GOOD PUBLICITY.

Edit: GenericallyEpic, I'm coming after ya! A new quota has been build. I look forward to playing more builds. 














 **Where to get it**: http://www.reddit.com/r/SSBPM/comments/1wloz8/btbm_302_custom_build_updated/

**Build by**: BobbyTheBrokeMonarch

I had a subliminal motive with [my build](http://www.reddit.com/r/SSBPM/comments/1wdrdb/project_m_302_build_by_reiden_lightman/) of Project M. I wanted to make something that users would see as a standard for the quality and time put into both full builds and music packages for Project M. A fresh build can be as simple as changing just the common5.pac and mu_menumain.pac for a new visual theme, and some can simply be using codes to add more stages and skins.

I must say, I was pleasantly surprised at the sheer quantity of changes BtBM could list on his build's page. Support for Hackless, Homebrew, and USB methods, new sound bank for the announcer and menu sounds, Apex quality stage select screen, voice banks for more than 10 characters, and plenty more to offer.

While it doesn't ooze of originality or creativity from the start, it does hold up in a bit of professionalism. I see the same professionalism that PMBR insists on when they add new content.

But it isn't without its flaws. Once again, I encounter a music pack that is full of JCeasar's music choices, which we all know are my least favorite. Really, I would never suggest any of JCeasar's choices. At least this time, I could see the changes from the music menu. But, not all stages had music replacements to keep the music fitting. I'm looking specifically at Project M Mushroom Kingdom which still has all the music from Shadow Moses Island. You could imagine how unfitting that sounded.

Also, the naming system was inconsistent. It should be in line with how HAL named their songs in the game. It should just be the song name (unless you plan on changing every single song name in the game to be consistent with your naming system). The only time a source is named is when the song has multiple versions or is a common name such as "Boss Battle" or "Final Boss".

Sources should be in parenthesis (unless, again,  you plan on changing all other names with sources to be in line with your naming system). The purpose of releasing a text list is so those who really want to know can see the sources.

There is one thing that I was thrilled about, and that was porting Skyloft over a different level and modifying the CSS order to keep the first page the same as P:M's official build. This gave Skyloft more music. Hell, I might do this in a minor update to my build.

Sidenote: I did notice that two tracks from Magmoor caverns were my choices as well. I'm assuming this was inspired by my build, and I'm quite flattered.

The second page was filled with some very excellently created stages that feel balanced and up to P:M standards. But some of the names had text that was almost too small to be readable. Some stages had shadows appearing in mid-air, and one stage (Great Bay) prevented AI from fighting back (which was disappointing). At least I didn't feel lag on 1v1 matches. You may experience lag on matches with 3 or more characters, especially if you use the imported character skins.

Speaking of skins, this build uses CBliss to add many more melee skins. Combined with Melee sound banks, this build felt more like Melee than P:M does for brief periods of time.

Melee sound bank you say? What about the announcer?

Yes, he's there, and he feels... inconsistent. None of the Brawl exclusive names were changed which makes it feel like an unfinished project.

---

**Why you might want it**: If you're looking for even more Melee-ified brawl, then this really is a good build. There are more melee alternate skins and plenty of melee sound banks.

**Why you might not want it**: If you're not a fan of JCaesar's music pack or are simply tired of Feint - Homebound being used for menus, or are tired of music packs that are just rock and techno remixes of the original songs, I'd steer away from here. The music changes when you enter the Character select screen which simply isn't necessary. It's distracting.

There were some great sources here, and a lot of it was fitting. But a lot of it felt same-old same-old compared to so many music packs. There's also the issue of the half-done name-calling sound bank. Yes, this is going to continue to be a pet peeve of mine.

**Would I recommend it and why?** Of course. Those looking for support for hackless, homebrew, usb, and forwarder methods have something to gain from this build. Remember to make sure you're using his codeset. This screwed me up at first. Portraits match their skins, which is awesome.

**What about for tournaments?** A lot of these custom skins may throw off some spacing for some players. If you plan to use this at tournament, make sure the rest of the builds are using this too, and announce it a month in advanced to give players time to get used to it. Or, simply disallow these skins (except in the case that both player's agree it is okay).

**Score**: 8/10

Next time, I have a special treat. I'll be spending more time for a review of Calabrel's build (a review I'm taking up by my own request).

I HAVE PLENTY OF TIME PEOPLE. Link me to your builds and let me review them!

Another footnote: I saw that [my build was breifly part of the "popular hacks" section on brawlvault](http://i.imgur.com/mg90GHM.png). Thanks for that everyone who downloaded my build. 




 **Where to Get it**: http://www.mediafire.com/download/9u61fwuakl3b3dv/PM+Custom+Build.zip

**Build by**: SelenHaar6

First off, I knew very little what I was in for. Every build is different, and unlike me, not every build will have the goal of tournament usability like mine does. I'd put this build on the same level my friends make their builds. It feels like it's unfinished, but that's because I'm used to doing more to make sure my build is professional.

The build includes character models, music replacements, and 1 replacement in the info folder.

The characters feel uninspiring. To get the obvious and my biggest peeve out of the way, Cloud is used as a model over Ike. I get it, Cloud is an iconic character for Final Fantasy, but he's pretty damn over-rated considering 99% of casual modders who know about Final Fantasy use Cloud over Ike hacks. I used to be guilty of putting Squall over Ike, so I'm not excused, but I got past my own fanboy services.

We obviously have a huge pokemon fan. Much huger than I can stand for a build like this. In this game, pokemon are already considered more over-represented than the Mario cast. And now the custom skins overload the game with even more pokemon. I spotted so many pokemon skins that I saw a few duplicates from my friend's build.

To make matters worse, the character selection portraits weren't viewable. I had to take more time than necessary to figure out what was going where.

The music was average. A lot of it was taken straight from JCaesar's music pack which so far is definitely my least favorite music pack. Final Destination and Battlefield definitely sound as epic as ever, but everything else feels like a metal version of what used to be there for the sake of sounding hard-hitting and non-Nintendo.

Skyloft, for example, starts off with a metal cover sounding Ballad of the Goddess. I'm pretty sure a lot of people are doing this. Hell, even I used to be guilty of putting a rock cover of BotG on this stage. 

To make THESE matters worse, he obvoiusly knows how to use Brawlbox to change a few text entries. And exporting the music track entries from info.pac allows you to put them right into mu_menumain.pac. It takes less than a minute, and if you're going to release a music pack, you should make the names visible in the menu.

**But I digress**

This is not too terrible of a build. It seems like an average casual build. There's no bugs, glitches, or crashes as far as I can tell. But, remember to defragment the card after you install it. Otherwise, you'll encounter audio issues.

**Why you might want it**: You like lots of music and fighter replacements

**Why you might not want it**: You're competitive and only use builds geared toward competitive play. If you're casual and frequently play with 4 players, you may experience a lot of lag on high polygon stages.

**Would I recommend it and why?** I wouldn't. Not yet anyway. It's clear that SelanHaar6 isn't new to file replacement, but could probably use some help getting Character selection portraits and song names in the music menus to be accurate. If you leave out the fighter package and just use his music, it's a decent music pack that I would probably allow at a tournament since none of the music is distracting.

**Score:** 4/10

Next time, I should be reviewing a build by BobbyTheBrokeMonarch.

Want me to review your build? Leave a comment and P:M me. 









 Well, I've been working on [my custom build](http://www.reddit.com/r/SSBPM/comments/1wdrdb/project_m_302_build_by_reiden_lightman/) for a long time, and aside from cleaning up loops, it's good to be done. I've received some awesome feedback through comments and PMs, so thanks for that. I'll re-upload my build over the weekend for those who really care about the small details.

BUT, as a designer, and just an avid smash player/modder, I wanted to see some other's builds. I have 3 SD cards that I switch between and I keep a master copy of my build on my external HDD. I can afford to see others' builds. If you'd like me to do a review of your build, leave a link to it here.

First come, first serve. Be patient as bigger builds need more time to review.

 Hello everybody. First off, congratulations to Calabrel on his release of his entire Project M build. I've been playing around with it now and again, and I plan to do a written review of it later after I'm done sorting through everything it has to offer.

I did release my current music pack last Christmas in 2013 and I promised an update when I reached an even higher goal of replacements (and even more surprise replacements to find). I've been rearranging a lot of the songs which has delayed the update.

The update will be available both as a download by itself and as part of my full build (which will take far less room than Calabrel's). I'm not, however, planning to do any sort of stage replacements to keep my build acceptable for most small and mid-sized tournaments.

I'd like to give you guys a few videos as previews of what I've managed to find room for in my build. I hope this gets you to look forward to it. I hope you try out my build. If you haven't tried Calabrel's build and you have an extra SD card, I suggest you try that out as well.

 The human minds can remember everything they have seen, heard, smelled, or ever experienced. It's an amazing fact, actually. Our ability to recall differs from person to person. But imagine what it will be like when you can finally recall everything you have ever done. Like when you were born kicking and screaming and still covered in the liquid from your mother's womb. Not knowing what was going on, just screaming in anger and sadness because you weren't comfortable where you were. The air may have been too cold or too hot.

What about the first outfit your mother or father ever put on you. You didn't know what color it was. You didn't associate any sounds or names with what you saw or knew. Talking and making sounds like the others around you was so desirable. If only you could tell them what you were feeling or what you wanted. Until then you scream and yell until your discomfort was handled.

When you said your first words, your parents put it into memory. You weren't concerned with it at all. Did you have fun pretending to recall when you said your first words whenever your parents told you what they were? If you take all of that time, it would equate to about an hour of pretending time.

The truth is, most of us cannot recall anything out of what has been mentioned. It's unfortunate. It would be easier to learn from past mistakes if we could recall anything that we have heard or read or did. History class would be a lot easier. Where is our dedication to remembering? We throw away our memories like candy wrappers for someone else to scoff at.

When did you first pretend or make believe or convince yourself that something was real? I bet you felt completely foolish thinking back on it. Especially if the first pretend idea you had was a boyfriend or girlfriend.

Fast forward through your years and recognize all of your firsts. Oh how so many of them seem so insignificant compared to what you have accomplished. Your first bike, first ride sans training wheels, first game or video game, first phone or cell phone, first graduation. Your parents likely held a plethora of pictures to perpetuate the memories of all of your achievements which now seem like such small stuff. You're on to bigger and better things. Cars, movies, social links, jobs, work, having your own money and being your own person.

If you can recall all of this, it is likely that you have eidetic memory. Or it could just be the knife in your back. 




 I saw a post earlier saying a 3.02 patch was released and that it fixed a couple game-breaking bugs. Now, when I try to download a set, it doesn't download. It just takes me back to the Projectmgame.com homepage. Are the downloads offline right now?

~~If 3.02 is reality, what files do~~ I ~~need to patch over to avoid~~ [have] to redo 4 hours of modding.

IT'S REAL:

CHANGES

 Kirby's Aura Sphere storage bug is fixed.

 Roy's Final Smash will no longer clank

 Flaco's forward smash will now sparkle around his legs instead of his arms.

 Names on the Character Selection Screen have been moved down to their original positions 




 Okay, let's stop it with clogging up this subreddit with alternate costume ideas. I'm pretty sure a lot of us are getting very bored with them. Just post them in here.

(You're welcome)

MAJOR EDIT:

Seriously, guys, be realistic at least. The PMBR says that they are not going to add in any alternate costumes that change who the character is. Butterfly metaknight is still Metaknight. Dr. Mario is still Mario. Mr L is still Luigi. Shadow Peach is still Peach. And so on. Stuff like Skull Kid over Toon Link or Master Chief over Samus is simply not going to happen.

THE PMBR ALSO SAID that they are NOT going to do megaevolutions for Pokemon. Those suggestions are getting very old. Remember that every reply to this is going into my inbox.

 This is for all of the Yugioh players who think activating any sort of effect means that you are "chaining". I want to clarify this to hopefully end the ruthless onslaught of (necessary) comments explaining this.

How often have you seen the following (or something similar) in a post or comment?

 My opponent summoned *XXX monster*. Can I chain *XXX card* to that summon?

The answer is no. You cannot chain to that summon. Chaining to a summon simply doesn't exist in the game. And here's why.

**[Read this if you don't know what a chain is or are not aware that they resolve backwards.](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Chain)**

**Starting a Chain**

Summons don't start a chain. Special summoning as a result of an effect doesn't start a chain either. it's only the result of an effect.

After summon, two windows pass: summon negation then summon response. The first window doesn't pass if the summon was the result of an effect. The second one can if it was the last thing to resolve. Activating an effect in either window starts a chain. Adding another chain link on top of that is considered "chaining".

**What Chaining Really Is**

Chaining ONLY happens after a chain link is already started. For example, if my opponent activated a Spell/Trap or Monster Effect, I can chain to that. If my opponent summoned a monster, I cannot chain to that. But I can start a chain. After I start a chain, my opponent can chain to that. In short, chaining is "adding a chain to a chain that already exists". Responding to a summon is not chaining.

**Summons don't start a chain**

Summons don't start a chain. Effects start a chain. Even if a monster is special summoned by an effect, it doesn't start a chain. The Special Summon is only a result of that chain link resolving. It does not start a new chain or add to the current chain link.

Non-Inherent special summons are often called "summons that start a chain". This is misleading and I believe is the case for players thinking that chaining to a summon is possible. These summons don't start a chain, an effect in a chain resulted in the special summon of a monster. For these summons, there is no summon negation window, which is why *Thunder King Rai-Oh* cannot negate the effects of *Geartown* or *Blaster, Dragon Ruler of Infernos*.

**Pseudo-inherent Normal/Special Summons**

Some special summons happen from applying an effect of a continuous card. Continuous cards act like lingering effects that are applied as long as the card is face-up. Unless the effect has a **:** or **;**, the effect does not start a chain. This is true for cards like *Fire Formation - Tensu* and *Hazy Pillar*. Therefore, a player need not declare the card effect's activation and wait for a response. It is however common courtesy to say why the monster was normal or special summoned.

**So what did we learn today?/Summary for the Stupid**

* Summons do not start a chain
* Starting a chain is not the same as Chaining
* Chaining refers to adding a chain to a pre-existing chain, not starting a chain
* Summons don't start a chain, effects do.

^(Some of this may be wrong due to tricky wording in how game mechanics work for continuous effects. A more experienced judge may please correct this.)

Edit: added some examples. Thanks Ultimate_spaghetti. Also italicized card names.

Edit2: Trimmed the fat.

EDIT3: A couple important side-notes courtesy of Krylife

Cards activating and effect activating are different. There are spells/traps that have effects that activate separately from the card's activation. Best example is *Grand Spellbook Tower*.

Chaining refers to the activation of a card or effect. Resolving happens backward after the chain is built, and new chains cannot be added during resolution.

Chains don't special summon a monster. An effect that resolves can summon a monster.

**Notes:**

Please, this is a budget deck^1. It's also a fun deck. If I could easily afford and pull wolfbarks like everybody else instead of being a shit-pull magnet, I'd easily have Wolfbark in this.

I tried Hazy Flame Sphynx paired with Plaguespreader Zombie. It wasn't consistent enough to work. Pleaguespreader was too hard to have in the Grave reliably. Sphynx was often absent when the right time came around.

When Hazy Flame Hydra comes out, it will most likely wholeheartedly replace Hazy Flame Hyppogrif. I feel at 2 would be just fine since it puts the deck at 5 L6 Rekindling summonables. It's also stronger and works with Basiltrice to make a 5M Basiltrice much easier.

I had considered taking Blaster out. But, he's still very good in this deck at 1. He gives me Star Eater^1 plays about once every 10-15 duels. I won't get rid of Ptolemy^1 unless I pick up constellars again. 

Yes 2 cowboy. There have been times where I wish I had that 2nd cowboy to do a 2nd rekindling into another cowboy for that last 800 for game.

Thanks to 2 Tenki, that's right just two, I am theoretically guaranteed to open with a monster, and I have better top decks. Makes 3 Onslaughts less necessary.

I know I ask for a lot of help with this deck, but since this is the most agressive and spamfilled deck I run, I'm not experienced with building it that way. I always end up trying to make some sort of control deck to better fit my more comfortable playstyle. Once in a while I OTK, but I kinda get lucky and go for obvious ones. Rekindling's not hard to OTK with in the right decks, and it probably should go down to 1 or even 0 if the right decks takes advantage of it too much.

^(1. Star Eater and Ptolemy were both gifts from my girlfriend /u/Lily247 so giving those up simply isn't an option. Shoutout to my girl.)

EDIT: Heroes aren't the problem with stratos, and hero players whining over it need to stop complaining. It was part of an FTK that also involved divine wind. My GF told me about that so I don't have all the details. Stratos was also used in teledad as I understand and players trying to bring it back after certain cards were back up to 3 also didn't help stratos stay out of the forbidden section. 









 Well, everyone's hyped, and now there's more people than ever on this iconic day asking so many questions. (So I'll probably be adding more questions and their answers to this)

---



**Q: What time is it being released?**

*A*: Nobody knows. I'm not even sure the PMBR knows exactly when. Their site is down, and they will need time to finalize the demo, export it for all methods of loading, and fix their site. Not to mention, UPLOADING the hack.

**Q: How big is the new update? And/or Do I need a bigger SD card?**

*A*: It was said by a backroom member that it will still fit on a 512mb SD card. We would all still recommend at least 1GB so you can add as much custom goodies as you want.

**Q: Will stage x or feature y be introduced?**

*A*: If you don't know, or haven't seen it in a stream, default this answer to no.

**Q: Does anybody know what they did to character x?**

*A*: Please assume nobody knows. You'll know in less than 24 hours.

**Q: Will my custom content still work with P:M?**

*A*: If it's music or a simple texture or stage replacement, it should still work. If it's something fancy like a stage selection screen or weird code-set that adds more stages (dot dot dot), assume it won't be able to be carried over. Huge fancy mods to P:M (which is already a mod) should be reimplemented to plant bugs.

**Q: What's the first thing you're gonna do?**

*A*: Slay the magic dragon :P what do you think? My assumption is that most players will be trying either new characters, new costumes, and/or turbo mode. I will also assume that most people will be making sure their custom content works. ^(Some people may be trying 1P mode)

**Q: why do ppl even use their own custom stuff? it just adds to the loading and cause problems, nd they dont often look that good either** -SuperBARN

*A*: People like to have fun. Even the backroom members and testers had some fun with some custom costumes and music.

**Q: Question for [OP] because I feel like it. What's your favorite alt so far?** -Nyan_Ryan

*A*: It was teased in the alt costume release, so I'm hoping that Jigglypuff's crown is really back. Puff is one of my more fun mains.

**Q: Will the patch notes be released soon? :] On a side note, if they release a mega lucario alt, my hype will transcend reality** -Caketastic

*A*: The PMBR probably has a lot of patch notes compared to 2.6b. So far, what we know about the patch notes is the following: Yoshi, Kirby, Samus, Ice Climbers, Olimar, Roy, and Mewtwo added to the roster. Samus has new ice beam mode and morph ball crawl. Turbo mode added. Curry changed to Turbo item. Alternate costumes added. Stage X replaced with Peache's Castle. Wifi Waiting room now available to play on.

As far as in depth patch notes go, it could be another week and a half before they can gather up every change they have implemented.

**Q: Will all these alts come with the download or do I need to get them separately?** -Clayton_11

*A*: It's safe to assume that anything that is officially part of Project M will always come with the download. So, if the Project M BR announced that it will be a part of the next set, you will not need to download it separately.

**Q: I'm emulating P:M, how exactly do I change from 2.6 to 3.0?** -Skintay12

*A*: It should be as simple as setting up 3.0 the same way you set up 2.6. So remember to take out that virtual SD card and make a new one with 3.0 in it instead of 2.6.

**Q: Do you think they're more prepared for the amount of people wanting to grab the download this time around? Site's been down all day and it feels like there's 10x as many people that are awaiting the results.** -Rawkobo

*A*: hard to say without proper knowledge of networking or what the PMBR is doing to prepare (if anything). If they are doing anything in anticipation of huge download traffic, things should be just fine. And if not, some of us will just have to be patient.

**Q: Does anybody know how turbo mode works yet? As in, how do I cancel my attacks?** -PlaptheAwesome

*A*: I don't know the inner workings of  how Turbo mode is made possible, but it allows you to cancel any successful attack into another attack. There's no sequence or button to press to cancel an attack, just perform another.

**Q: So all we will need to do is put this on an ad card and pop it in and 3.0 will work hackless?** -Andy-J

*A*: Not quite. There are a lot of video tutorials on how to do this. Start up brawl regularly. Then insert your SD card. Wait a few seconds for it to load. Then load the stage builder. Some scary stuff will happen, but then you'll see a menu with the option "start game". From there, you start the game, and clever programming takes care of the rest.

With all the hype, I just wanted the subreddit to not get a whole bunch of threads asking the same thing. Ask away, and backroom member, feel free to correct anything or answer any questions that are found in the comments. 









 I'm here to promote my first self-published book. Am I really resorting to using reddit to shamelessly promote my story? Of course. I wouldn't blame anybody else for doing it. We all need a little help.

**Last Note**

If you do decide to read (or even just read the previews), it would be greatly appreciated that you rate my product and give an honest review. 




 Well, I recently got criticizes for taking ideas from a Gravekeeper's deck that went top 8 in a reigional. This wasn't a deck full of meta calls. The recent winning geargia deck was pretty risky and fascinating to see what he was doing. Calling that he would be seeing more Elemental Dragons than any other deck was a pretty smart call, although unfortunate that he supposedly had a rough time against Evilswarm.

But why are so many people dismissing it as luck? Or some fortunate meta-call? This was a smart move on the player's part. He wasn't some no-life who came from nowhere. He'd been part of the scene for a long time apparently and knew about what playing smart really means.

So all I'm trying to say is that when something that's not tier-1 (or meta) wins, don't rush to stupid conclusions.  In the end, mediocre decks will perform as such, even with their better hands. I know this from playing Hazy Kings in a few tournaments. Each player gets where they get for a reason, whether it be playing the top deck or playing against the top deck.

**Side 1:** It's just a lucky Metacall

**Side 2:** It's a mediocre deck that got lucky

Although Side 1 is closer, I can't stand people dismissing anything that's not a tier 1 win as pure luck. It would be a lot nicer if, when someone gets a little smart or creative, we don't start slitting eachothers' throats online because it's different. 




 **Intro**

I've been continuing to test Gravekeeper's and figure out where this deck lacks and what decks this deck doesn't stand up too well against. In my testing, my side-deck has shifted quite a bit. I'm still finding Penguin Soldiers a little more useful (and a lot cheaper) than Fossile Dyna. Didn't run into enough burn decks to justify running Des Wombat. I'd save that card for a local meta call. Even with EEV, decks heavy with back-row are a scary thing to go up against. I'm looking at you Fire Fists. So without further ado, here's my updated list.

[Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/pddkshD.png)

[Text List](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/65160123/trading/decklist.txt)

**FAQ**:

Q: 2 Upstart Goblin?

A: Yes. 2 Upstart Goblins. They speed up the deck considerably in game one and can always be sided out for something faster or more needed considering what you get.

Q: No Daimond Dire Wolf?

A: I've been thinking about it and considering it thanks to the reprint. There has been times where I seriously need to get rid of a problem monster.

Q: What decks are you still having trouble against?

A: I'm still tanking it again Vampires and Fire Fists. Fire Fists just keep that backrow coming and somehow have an answer to everything I do. And Vampires have their stupid-as-hell field card (which conveniently gets rid of necrovalley.

Q: Why the change to 2 MST and 2 Forbidden Dress?

A: Partly Frogs. The rest is other decks with similar back-row line-ups and even no line-ups. It's comforting knowing I can use two of my cards just just to save an important card but allow my opponent to waste their card in the process (if I do it right).

**Cost**

Main Deck: Around $120 but as low as $80 if you keep your rarities low.

Side Deck: Should be anywhere from $40 to $50 as long as you don't go bat crazy on EEV.

Extra Deck: Around $25 for the essentials. Around. $55 for the full thing.

**New Support**

Shut up about them. I'm not building this for the future. I'm building this for the current format. 














 For me, I can't help but put [Other M's version of Ridley](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fje8t9Jyy-o) on a Metroid Stage (Norfair being the fitting one). 




 http://imgur.com/a/zBoDx#0

My album of High Resolution scans which I will do my best to update every once in a while. I got a lot of requests that I simply couldn't fulfill, but I did as much as I could. My apologies if I didn't get to your request, but I either don't have the card or couldn't find a friend to let me borrow it. 














 In Project M 3.0, we're getting a full cast of characters and then some, and we're all ready and excited to try out the new characters (most of us for Roy and Mewtwo, but who really cares?).

Since all of these characters that we've missed are finally coming together for Project M 3.0, will the single player modes finally be stable to play? I've had problems in stadiums, Classic, and SSE when non-selectable characters showed up. Only non-problem was Home-run contest for obvious reasons.

Also, was wondering about stadium records for Roy and Mewtwo. Will they actually be able to store their own records for Break the Targets and Home Run Contest etc?

A simple response from a PMBR should suffice. 




 I'm looking to get rid of **[this mat](http://client-cdn.crystalcommerce.com/photo/ideal808/file/d0e62ab7c408b464c63e265ccf1c2f0e/large/ycs%20san%20diego%202013%20playmat.jpg)** that I'm seriously not going to use anymore. It's going for 40 dollars on ebay, but I'm willing to go as low as 30 dollars wish included shipping. If you're outside the US, I'll have to charge more to cover the added insane shipping costs.

I also have plenty of miscellaneous bulk from Shadow Specters. Willing to sell it for super super low. (5+shipping).

 Ask some bullshit ruling question. Make up shit. Whatever the fuck you want. Keep it random and entertaining. Keep in mind this thread isn't for actual rulings. It's for fun.

**EXAMPLE POST**

If my opponent attacks with his pancake stack and the pad of butter hits one of my cards, does the sleeve's effect protect it from being destroyed?

---

There you go! Have fun! I also forgot to mention that you are allowed to post fake rulings in response to other's entries. Go bat shit crazy y'all.

Edit: I'll send the user who posts the most entertaining post on this thread some cards from my recent pulls. 




 Keep them requests coming. Lol. Of course, I don't have an infinite amount of cards, not do I come close to having every card imaginable. But I can always try to borrow what I need. So here it is, 600dpi scan of Gagaga Cowboy. 1388x2044

**[Link to Image](http://i.imgur.com/MzhbWgc.jpg)** 









 Special thanks to Lily247 for letting me scan one of her favorite cards, and what's probably her favorite ghost rare. And, we all know this is her favorite ritual monster! IT'S A FAIRY!

Shout out to you!

**[Link to Image](http://i.imgur.com/ikR5gQ3.jpg)** 




 I had a scanner and a Royal Tribute available. Naturally, I got bored. So I decided to see if these scans I find on the internet were really as high quality as they get. Turns out, 500x500 card art at its max is pretty shit. There aren't people scanning at 600 DPI like I do. Just the art for the card came out to 1000x1000. I'm tempted to make a Royal Tribute mat out of this.

Note, the image of the quality good be better. But it's not the most high quality scanner.

**[Link to high quality image of Royal Tribute](http://i.imgur.com/fb7LOgq.jpg)** 




 I'm back with another game-ish thread. Everyone likes to be theoretical. I mean, why not? It's always fun to think about the what-ifs. Even as serious players, it's great to take a break and have a little fun with out brains.

---

So, to get us going, here's my question for today...

**What if Konami changed the rules so that any normal monster need not be tributed to be normal summoned?**

How would this effect your deck? How would this effect other decks? Would normal monsters get more support? Is there anything they would need to add to this rule to keep it balanced? Assume Gemini and similar cards do not count. The monster card must be yellow, not brown, for this rule to apply.

---

For me? I would probably run a huge beatstick deck that featured huge normal-monster beaters and skill drain. Of course, I'd probably still use Malefics in it, but it would be awesome to see what kind of cool new decks could be derived from here. Hell, I wonder if this would get any cards on the banlist. 









 I'm not going to make anybody pay. I have some free time though, and I wanted to make some playmats. But I need some ideas. So why doesn't everyone submit an idea so I can see what I can do?

 I had a gif saved on an old account I threw away. the title was something similar to

"when I'm feeling down, I always look at this gif. It never makes me feel any better."

It had a pot-selling pony holding out her hoof and the words "eat a d*ck" appearing after sparkling in the BG. I wasn't able to find it, and I'm out of search ideas.

Just asking if somepony can help me find it so I can re-save it on this user account. 









 Let's play another Yugioh Based Creativity Game!

Did you miss my first game where we made small tweaks to archetypes to make them tier 1 matierial (pun intended, hence the mispelling)? Well, fret not, I'm back with another game.

---

**Archetype Popcorn Game**

Here are the rules:

* You post ONE card in an archetype you make up.
* Let others reply to that post adding to that archetype.
* No replying to add more to your own archetype.
* Leave your archetype name in *italics* and the card name in *bold*.

That's all there is to it. But, please, don't just break the archetypes. Be respectful, not a douche.

---

I'll be leaving my submission in the comments. 




 So I have a friend who wants to build ghostricks. She went to the sneak peek and pulled quite a few. But the kicker is, she pulled a Bujin Kasauchi (i forget it's exact name). You know, the one going for 30 dollars. Of course, she could have sold it and finished her current deck.

And she knows I wanted bujins. She knows I would have just loved to have one meaningful bujin in my life.

She fucking traded it for a one dollar ghostrick lantern.

Never again will I let her go alone without telling her to check every fucking price she can. She called the excuse that she didn't know the price. She had her phone on her the whole time. She could have checked. Ebay and Yugiohprices.com are a thing.

I'm sorry, I'm just fucking pissed she had to spend 20 dollars, get a great card, and give it away like table scraps when she needed the money for her deck. 




 Day 6

I woke up with a migrane. The same migrane I've been having every day when I wake up and every night before I go to sleep. I was hungry. Of course I was. Who isn't hungry when they wake up? There was hardly anything to eat other than the cereal in the corner pantry which never seems to run out. I shouldn't even be eating this cereal because of my alergies, but it keeps my stomach full. What's a rash on my arms compared to days starvation?

I put the milk back in the mini fridge in the corner. The only other room I have access to is the restroom. It's been getting more and more empty every day. Today, after I ate my breakfast, I went to brush my teeth and noticed my toothbrush was gone. I at least used mouth wash to help my mouth feel fresh.

Then I got to doing the only thing I know that takes the migrane away. Playing games. I have at least a dozen board games to play with and even a bunch of video games from the 1990s. I had plenty to keep myself busy and entertained. What sort of game will I have to resort to when I'm done with all of these? Whoever put me here already thought of that. The games are very replayable.

So I went to a board game today. I pretend there are four other players there. I roll play them. Their names are Dan, Nathan, and Felix. They play with me. We're all psychic. Only with each other. It makes Clue no fun. I'm just waiting for that to disappear so I don't have to look at it any more.

Today I found this journal and a pensil. I think they want me to write in it, so I am. I can use it to keep notes for myself about what I've been playing them. Soon I'll hear the knocking. That's when I have to go to sleep. The knocking just keeps hapenning if I don't. I can't open the door. I'm not allowed.

---

Day 7

I woke up with a migrane. The same migrane I've been having every day when I wake up and every night before I go to sleep. I was hungry. Of course I was. It was the same thing yesterday and it's going to be the same thing today. What's a rash on my arms compared to days starvation? I keep telling myself so I can put up with the symptoms.

Today, after I ate my breakfast, I went to brush my teeth and remembered that my toothbrush had disappeared. The mouth wash was gone too, as if it had vanished. I couldn't do anything but leave my mouth rinsed with hot water. I was prepared to take a shower today, but the shower curtain disappeared as well as the showerhead.

I got back to playing games again. What sort of games will I be here to when I'm done with all of these? Whoever put me here already thought of that. The games are very replayable. I'm rewriting this to remind myself that the games are worth it. They're worth it over laying all day with a head-ache. I can't sleep as long as the light is kept on.

So I went to a board game today. I pretend there are four other players there. I roll play them. Their names are Dan, Nathan, and Felix. They play with me. We're all psychic. Only with each other. It makes Clue no fun. I'm just waiting for that to disappear so I don't have to look at it any more.

I figured out why I can't use this journal to take notes on my games. They took the pages of yesterday's journal. I'm going to test to see if they take these pages too. It's almost time for me to get to sleep. With a migrane of course.

---

Day 8

I'm still waking up with a migrane. It's still not changing. The migrane I bear while I'm not playing. I'm beginning to smell. Is this waht they want? For me not to be able to do what I want? The cereal changed, but I'm still alergic to it. The rash is still just as bad from this one as it was from the last.

I'm getting a bit sick of the board games. Some of them are missing. I won't be able to finish the game of Life I started yesterday. It was a 1 vs 1 match between Dan and me. I'm digging into the video games now. One system, one controller, one TV. All in my one little room. You know, if you don't count the restroom. i don't even count it as a room anymore. Nothing but a couples towest and toilet paper.

I kept myself entertained for the entire day. Not very hard. I got through three simple games. My head didn't feel too great while switching, but a few minutes at a time isn't nearly as bad as the hours I spend waking up and going to sleep.

My last pages were missing. I'm wondering why you're taking them. Why do you want my random thoughts? What the fuck is this going to prove? I don't even know where I am.

---

Day 9

I still don't have a goddamn clue. What the hell do you want? Stop taking my pages. I just want to be able to re-read them once. Why are you making them disappear? What else are you going to make disappear? I'm out of food. What more can you take away from me.

You can't possibly think I'd rather be hungry than have a rash. I'm getting sick from the hunger. It's almost worst than the pain in my head. Is this the kind of notes you want?

The games are still keeping me entertained. They're keeping the headache away while they can. The ones I played yesterday are gone. If I'm not allowed to play games more than once, I'll eventually be left with nothing but a headache.

---

Day 10

Bastards. The first thing to go was my bed. Then the chairs. Then the table. Eventually, everything else. What good is a game without the controller? What good is this last board game without others? Without friends? Without companionship? Worthless. This experiment is worthless. What you're doing is worthless. You're worthless.

Am I worthless? Is that it? Am I just a worthless mouse to you? I'll break through this door eventually. It has to break some time.

---

Day 11

FUCK YOU 




 **Calling all fellow Gravekeeper's players.**

So a lot of us have a great time building up a main deck but don't quite get the hang of building side-decks.

I can already hear you saying, "Every deck needs sides based on its own meta and where it's going to be used. Just adjust it to your locals. You're a faggot. Get off Reddit. Fuck you."

Of course, we all have out meta-specific and locals-specific sides. But leave that aside. What cards are you siding and why do you think they're worth siding in Gravekeeper's?

* Penguin Soldier: Flip-activated Compulsory on crack, or a Spy Bluff. If you're opponent knows GK's, they're going to destroy your facedowns, not attack them.
* Imperial Iron Wall: Works against plenty of decks, especially the big daddy of them all, Dragon Rulers.
* Dimensional ~~Prison~~ Fissure: Helps against Mermails. Gravekeeper's can fill up their grave by using Xyz based plays to avoid dead Stele.
* Thunder King Rai-Oh: Heavy Stun. Enough said.
* Maxx "C": Opponent spamming the summons? Let's fix that.
* Veiler: Because there are those problematic effects we just need to stop for one turn.
* Gozen Match: All Dark Monsters except for 1 Earth that normally never hits the field anyways. Penguin Soldier still possible to set.
* Rivalry of the Warlord: Huge ammount of Spellcasters. So why not?
* Deck Devistation Virus: Usable with Descendant or Assailant while Necrovalley is on the field.
* Eradicator Epidemic Virus: Usable with Malefic Stardust Dragon, Malefic Cyber End Dragon, and Master Key Beetle.

What sides did I miss? What reasons do you run your specific sides?

Edit: fixed mistake found by DiskJockey13 




 Okay everybody, here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to help us get a little creative about what we think of our favorite archetypes and what we really want from them. If this gets some good reaction and discussion going, I'll be happy to continue to post these kinds of games on here.

---

**Ground Rules**

* *DON'T MOD THE BAN LIST. This is a game for creativity, not posting your ban-list wish list.*
* Don't create new cards for the main deck. Limit extra deck cards to 1 if you can.
* Don't completely change their design. Just tweak it to make it more competitive.
* Don't aim to break your archetype. That's boring. We just want to compete.
* Do have some fun. It's a game.
* Do discuss other's changes and respond to others changing yours.

---

**My Submission**: Gravekeeper's

I love Gravekeeper's. They're slow. They're controlling. But, terribly inconsistent for most people. They're big disadvantage is not being able to recycle Necrovalley, being relatively weak without it, and resorting to Malefics to handle big beaters. Regardless, since Royal Tribute is so busted, they don't need many cards to be reworked. So here's my tweaks.

* Gravekeeper's Guard: Flip; Return 1 monster on the field to the controller's hand, and if you do, you can special summon 1 level 4 or lower Gravekeeper's monster from your graveyard. This effect cannot be negated by "Necrovalley".
* Gravekeeper's Commandant: You can discard this card to the Graveyard; add 1 "Necrovalley" from your Deck or Graveyard to your hand.
* Gravekeeper's Stele: Target 2 "Gravekeeper's" monsters in your graveyard and/or Banished; add those targets to your hand.
* You can Tribute 1 other face-up "Gravekeeper's" monster to target 1 card your opponent controls; destroy that target. If a card effect activates that would negate this monster's effect: you can normal summon 1 Level 4 "Gravekeeper's" monster from your hand in addition to your normal summon or set.

What these tweaks take care of:

* Gravekeeper's now have a way to SS from the grave without it being a +0/-0 trap.
* Gravekeeper's can now Recycle Necrovalley if need be.
* Gravekeeper's no longer tremble at bottomless trap hole.
* Gravekeeper's can set up an Xyz play in case their main play doesn't work out. Makes Key beetle more consistent. 




 We're looking for ideas for bots that could help spruce up /r/YGOSales and make it more interesting. The same goes for anything else. If you have an idea to make /r/YGOSales a better place, don't hesitate to leave a comment here or message the moderators.

I am welcoming feedback. If you think you have an idea to make this deck more consistent or faster than it already is, please let me know. Do you think I should be running some weird unknown tech? Just let me know. 









 I made a new account since my Rifall nickname is wearing off. My friends call me reiden, and Rifall is getting hard to remember, and it's no fun to keep correcting people on the pronounciation. I even have friends who call me refill.

I'll still be here moderating. Just with a new name. 
























 They never use it because the company purposely clocks them at lower speeds by forcing them to be slower than what they paid for.  




 Use more tha. One devise at the same time (think a family full of iPhones abd/or laptops), any decent gaming, browsing that loads a page in I see a minute. Etcetera.  




 Dear AT T: 

It's because you fucking suck.  




 Because motion controls and a mirror world made it different, no naturally, gamers didn't like it.  




 That still happened. Priest Seto and Atem were rivals in competition. Step was loyal to Atem.  




 *facepalm* 




 /r/nosleep. The rules say that the stories must be real. I don't know why the discord posts here say no sleep is full of fiction.  




 It would use a comma, not a colon or semicolon. the effect is continuous and does not start a chain at any point. 




 How? Apple said they cannot decrypt the data. 




 I think burning down some major ISP buildings (at a time when nobody is there of corse) might be what we need to send a fucking message. Let's turn the buildings of ISPs into parking lots. We're better off like that anyway. 




 Some networks got huge upgrades rolled out... but companies are still using the old technology. They literally refuse to give us better service. 




 So, because they will no longer be allowed to throttle any data whatsoever, they wont be able to improve their service? BULLSHIT. They're already bleeding money trying to bribe congress to get what they want.

Did i mention Wolf-pac.com? 




 So, basically, any time priority is opened to a player, PPP takes place to check if anything was triggered. Is this correct? 




 It depends on the game. Smash bros an amiibo can put a fighter in the game that learns based on the play styles of those who play against it. Mario Kart, the same amiibo could unlock a costume for your mii racer. Some amiibo are not compatible with certain games, but beside that point, a single amiibo can count more than once while a single DLC purchase is a one and done deal.  




 My best guess is because Enter play didn't see a need for a side-board. 




 I've been reading up on priority and pre priority processing. I still don't fully get it the way enter play explains it. Could someone explain it in a way that will make a Yugioh player understand? 

In yugioh, we have what is called an open game state where turn player has first priority to do something. Non-turn player wait to respond. When an action takes place, the game looks for triggered effects, then for either player to start or continue a chain of effects. If nothing, then the game state goes back to open. If an effect is activated, a chain is built, resolved, then the game goes back to checking for triggered effects.

How does our priority compare in this context?  




 You're welcome. 




 The fact that the PS4 and Xbox One have almost identical libraries with little to no true-must-have games on their exclusive line-ups is a big deal. Especially when you look at the Library for the Wii U which has had plenty of exclusives that you simply cannot play anywhere else. The Wii U may not be as powerful on paper, but the games are built around fun instead of built around pushing graphical boundaries. 

Seriously, almost anything that is on PS4 or XBox One that isn't exclusive is also for PC, so why even buy one of those consoles when a general computer could run them and be useful for far more than gaming? The Wii U at least has exclusives that aren't just highly rated, but they are fun and widely loved by those who play the games.

You can probably use the great scores that Wii U games have been getting to back up some of your arguments.  




 I think another idea would be that pressing L + R + Z while hovering over a name would open the controls for that tag. And if you just press Z, it can toggle tap jump. Faster way to access controls. Would definitely save time in the long run.  




 I stopped after the first paragraph. Couldn't take it seriously.  




 That would only work for people who have tap jump off with no other custom controls. Also, it cannot be chosen by multiple people  which easily becomes a problem.  




 Antivirus isn't a big issue. Some people install it just for safe measure. I sometimes install one temporarily just to make sure I'm not spreading windows viruses to my friends. 

For the first time on a battery's usage, it is good for the battery to be fully drained, then fully charged without being used. After doing this two or three times, it is pretty safe for the battery to charge and use whenever. Constantly using the battery isn't horrendously bad for it, but constantly turning it on or off or plugging and unplugging a charger could take a toll on the battery life. It's not constant use that takes a toll but constant change in which way the power is flowing to or from the battery.  




 Nobody is even going to read the post unless it is properly formatted.  




 I'm not counting on Nintendo actually going through with putting emulators on mobile phones. They probably just want to make sure they can get anybody else who does it to stop by threatening a lawsuit.  









 I'm willing to go as low as 21. 




 I'll admit, I'm curious as to how Sonic would turn out if transferred whole-heartedly to Nintendo's methods and staff. 




 I went on ebay and matched the lowest prices

* Gaia Dragon $8.00
* Star Eater $5.95
* Baxia $3.50
* Blade Armor Ninja $1.36
* Crane Crane $1.00
* Kerykeion $1.63
* 2 Summoner Monk $1.87 each

The total technically comes out to $25.18. But, hell, it's the Christmas Season, and I need to sell soon. How does $23.00 sound for the lot? 




 If you use a USB loader, make sure you update the code file that the USB loader uses. The launcher will not update that for you.  




 I think either one would be a good machine. The air is definitely more of a first time buyer kind of thing, but the Pro would be more future proof and have more I/O. And since you plan on playing WOW and using it for school, I think the extra i/o and bit more juice behind it might be much more worth it in the longer run.  




 Three things

* That's genius
* That's Devious
* That's awesome! 




 Memes with typos shouldn't get upvotes.

 I felt it would have been fine to just need up the cool-down time on the teleport so teleport - attack isn't so fast as to catch people off guard. 




 Is thee anything else you can take off my hands? Either for a friend or as trade-bait? 




 Dude, I seriousely fucking doubt she *only* uses it for email. 




 When are people going to realize that Black Friday deals happen because they ship crappy , malfunctioning, or ill-built devices to be sold for Black Friday. Manufactures literally stow the shit away so they can make profit from it.

Good stuff isn't cheap.  
Cheap stuff isn't good. 




 If that's a strain on the network, then American companies seriously need some freakin updates. Other countries have better networks than we do at half the price. And somehow, everyone seems to be dodging that fact to make sure American providers get what they want. 




 I have a Cyber Dragon Deck which I'm taking apart and selling. I really need the money right now as I struggle to find a job and pay college loans.

I'm not leaving the game by any means (I'm using a budget deck right now). I'm moving on to a different deck after Cyber Dragons anyways.

I'll accept reasonable offers on big bundles. I have a few more cards to sell that I will be putting here at a later time.

In the mean time, [Here's a link](http://imgur.com/a/ePOJs) to what's for sale. Just ask about price/rarity.

I'm not trading, nor can I buy right now.

 If it was an option to move them to the bottom, that'd seem pretty okay.

But, there are things that pop up in certain apps that would intrude on pressing buttons at the bottom which would be a problem. 




 Seriously, sometimes I wish a Pokemon game would just Bomb so Nintendo would at least consider stopping it. I think we have plenty of Pokemon games. More than enough to satisfy. My friend Dicen plays during all of his free time and still wasn't even half done with X or Y. (Obviously he beat the game, but he hadn't done everything he wanted to do with them.)

It seems like Nintendo depends on this franchise to take in money while they continue to freely risk failure in many other pursuits. At its bare bones, Pokemon is the definition of the same game over and over. It's truly different than any other RPG due to team building and competitive aspects, but there are enough Pikemon games for us to be entertained for years to come. Can they please not release one or even think about announcing one until 2016? 




 Two movies or three-four episodes of a tv show, there ARE people who do this. We use our devices more than we think. 




 How much more to I need to cut it? One person on this thread stated he easily hits 700GB each month. How it purposing a 2TB extreme for heavy Internet users insane? Whether it's 400GB over or 1TB over, it's an ugly number that users should not have to pay for because one company insisted we'll love being told how much we can use our internet. 




 I did the math for this.

 Let me just start off that nobody will be constantly clicking links for a full 30 month day. Take into account that we spend 1/3 of our lives asleep. That's shortens it to 20 days (480 hours, 28,800 minutes, 1,728,000 seconds) which accounts for 10.8 million megabytes. That's about 10,800 Gigabytes. Now, if that's from one device from one person who also spends half of his awake time away at a job, that cuts it to 5,400GB. Now let's say he only spends half of his home time clicking links (and keeping the line busy). That's down to 2,700GB. I've cut it time after time after time.

 Shoot, far over the 300GB cap that Comcast insists that we will love and I've made some generous deductions. And, by OP's overage fees, that's 48 fees equating to $480 just to use internet how we've always been using it.

TL:DR, average person watching a few movies on Netflix every day, surfing the web now and then, and doing the occasional download could easily take a terabyte in less than a month. 




 I did the math accounting for sleep time and a 9-5 job. It still comes around to about 5 terabytes of data usage if you're always on the internet at home. That's just one person. Obviously homes that make constant use of streaming services or have multiple people with multiple devices could get a a lot higher. 




 From my own comment:

Assuming sleep time and a 9-5 job, that's 8 hours at home using the network. We'll also assume it's in constant use at full potential. That's 1,440,000 megabits per day, divide by 8 for megabytes which is 180,000 megabytes per day. Multiply that by 30 days for 5.4 million megabytes or 5,400 gigabytes. That's 18x the cap that Comcasts assume you'll love. I could understand a 5,000 gigabyte cap, but not a miserable 300.

That's not as bad as a friend I know. The only service is AT T. Because of that, AT T will only offer them up to 6mbps. And they were capped at 80GB for the month. But, they also had the option to remove the cap... by signing up for the business plan for almost twice as much with no speed increase.

How the fuck is this legal?

Internet should be just internet. Shouldn't have to pay to be faster. It isn't like service providers build all of these websites and upgrade/maintain the servers for all of these sites. They just give us access to wires and tubes. Why should we be charged so much for that?

After all, I don't have to pay extra just to use LTE on my phone. If my phone has LTE, god dammit, it will use LTE. The provider never throttles my speed just because I don't pay for it. For fuck's sake, it's purely based on usage. And it's because they're pretty much forced to treat my data as only data, not data moving at a certain speed. 




 "None of my business" states a few dodgy facts.

"that's just my opinion" obviously is about someone opinion about an observation.

Similar, Yes. Ripoff, No. 




 I might just employ you to make an 'add-on' for my custom build. I wouldn't feel like going through all this. 




 Amusing yes. Still, a business card shouldn't abbreviate what the person's title is unless the abbreviation is widely known. I can't think of any right now. Maybe it's just me because I work in visual communications. (Notice, I didn't abbreviate it to viscom like some of my peers insist on doing.) 




 **Quick-Compose**. A button in notification center or control center that allows you to choose recipients, then compose a message to them and send it without opening the messages app. As it stands right now, you need an "unread" message from someone you want to send a message to just to start a quick-compose.

**Rebindable buttons** on the bottom row of Control Center. Seriously, not everyone uses calculator, camera, or clock more than any other apps. Saying that we do when we know we don't kind of sucks. I mean, it's a phone. Wouldn't messages and phone app make sense there?

**Safari Search**. Why can we still not search for a word on a page on our mobile phones? If you're at the top of the page, it could be as simple as pulling the page down to reveal a search bar. Enter what you want to find, then have a list of matches pop up.

**Hide apps**. We all have those apps we don't want to see. If we hit that (X) on a default app, it should ask if we want to "hide" the app. Then, if we need it later, it can be unhidden using the settings.

**Nested Folders**. Users can handle it. I guarantee it.

And for Apple to **STOP INSISTING THAT TRANSLUCENCY MAKES FLAT DESIGN 'GOOD' BY DEFAULT**. By god, I can't stand so many parts in iOS 7+ and the new OS X because of their fucking indulgence in translucency like it's free candy. 




 Step 1: Download Netflix (with this feature)

Step 2: Jailbreak phone

Step 3: Download movie to offline queue

Step 4: Transfer movie file from phone to computer

Step 5: repeat steps 3 and 4.

Step 6: ???

Step 7: Eat a cookie 




 Just don't put the acronym on the card. Spell it out. This will allow more people to easily know who you are and those who point it out are likely too immature to be worth your time. 




 I was probably going to do my own version of the announcer. So if anybody likes it, I volunteer. 




 What did they expect? They launched it too many months after it's other versions. MONTHS after the other versions. This coming from the scumbag company that thought Raymand Legends should be released on all platforms at the same time.

* The hype already died
* Everyone already thought the game was terrible
* This was the last version to be released
* The DLC allegedly wasn't coming to this port

Ubisoft was great up until the 8th generation. Now they're nothing more than another scumbag game developer. 




 I'm hoping they can fix a problem I'm having. Every time I open Safari or Youtube, it feels the need to tell me that Cellular data cannot be used with the app and I can change it in settings. Even if I'm on Wifi, it feels the f *(ing need to tell me this. And I don't have the option to turn these alerts off.

If anyone knows what I'm talking about, make sure to log this complaint as well. 




 Smash. 




 Yes it is. It was pretty much doomed to be that way. This is the first mobile OS apple made that allowed apps to talk to each other and use each other. Not to mention, they just added so darn much to the inner workings of this thing. And it pretty much supported more devices than any iOS before it. Especially all of the features that are dependent on communication with other apps and/or devices.

Yeah, I'm a little down that safari crashes more often that it used to (not like I should be browsing that much on my phone anyway). I'm also a little bummed that airplay or airdrop simply don't see other devices with these enabled sometimes. Such a shame. I'm also disappointed that the wifi simply cuts out sometimes in places where it didn't before iOS 8.

Nevertheless, the least we can do to help is go to Apple's feedback page and leave feeedback. Don't sit here complaining fruitlessly if you have an issue. Report everything to Apple. They need to hear the same complaints over and over from different users so they know that each issue IS an actual issue. 




 The subject of the speech is about feeling like an outcast. The people that pay me prevent me from saying too much since I can't risk giving away the entire lecture. But, it has to do with my life story being more relocatable to others' lives than they really think. I start with turning "everyone's unique" into a double edge sword.

Sometimes I second-guess my own lectures and life seeing how ending up about as alone as a person can get isn't exactly relate-able to the entire human population. Especially because hardly anyone else just happened to meet a girl who was pregnant with four kids. I haven't met a single other person whose even started dating a girl who just happened to be pregnant with one child, let alone four. 




 My name is Blaine. Well, I have my next motivation speech in just a few days and I honestly don't know how I'm going to handle it. I want to just dump the script and leave all my thoughts and feelings on random strangers, but I'm not sure what good that will do.

My mom passed away about a month ago leaving half of her money and property to me and the other half to my younger sister. I gave half of my half to my younger sister since she definitely needs it more than I do. I thought that before my ex-girlfriend, Winter, broke up with me a week later. She says she didn't fall out of love with me, but that she realized she only ever loved what I did for her.

My friend Luke just broke up with his girlfriend too. Although, for them, it was a clean break. They agreed that they were going different ways and decided to break it off. And now, he's moving to New York to seek a career playing brass instruments live for plays. Good for him.

I would have started this AMA sooner had I not been in tears last night. I was simply too emotional to care.

I hope I don't look like I'm dumping my entire agenda on you. I just need to get out these feelings so they don't come out during my job. 




 Sure, Google, Youtube, and Netflix may be able to afford fastlanes since they make a lot of money. But, there are many sights that run out of their owner's pocket or by visitor support. So if you frequently visit those sights that cannot afford to use Comcast's or Verizon's "fast lanes", then there'd be no point in paying for high-speed internet since everything would run at the throttled speed Comcast or Verizon would want them to run at.

And that is a load of bullshit.

P.S. My dad has a business of selling his own original spice blends online. He'll NEVER be able to afford internet fast-lanes. But if Comcast or Verizon want to throttle his website to 1mbps because he can't pay up, nobody would ever find it reasonable to buy from him due to how slowly his sight would load. 





























 Will replays work?

Seriously, that would be the best thing evar!!! 









 Yes, we all have our custom builds and what-not, but lets be mindful to what vanilla 3.5 will have to offer. I feel like we can never truly appreciate what the PMDT went through and especially what they put into the look and feel of each aesthetic change unless we take just an hour or two to play the mod without any of our arbitrary changes.

By the way, you can all expect my custom build in January. My friends and I (along with feedback from my previous builds) will be working hard on it once we've truly enjoyed this new taste of PM. 









 Mr Krabs has let Spongebob use Krabs's bank card, so they definitely exist. But not used at the Krusty Krab. 














 Is Apple trying to tell us they don't want feedback? Take a look at [this screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/3i2vSMn.png). I was trying to submit feedback to apple. I even read their policy on unsolicited ideas like they asked and found the submit page again. Still, there seems to be no sign of a submit button anywhere.

This is a real problem. iOS 8 has bugs and users have feedback, but it seems Apple simply doesn't want to hear it.

 (Names have been changed to protect the innocent)

So, a short while ago I received two notes on my apartment door. One was from the apartment staff telling my (former) roommate and I that the keys and electronics were stolen from the office and that they would replace everything including the locks. After my lock was replaced, we got another note on our door that said "try again". This was was hand-written. After that, I replaced the lock myself with my own lock and installed a latch lock as well. While on skype with a potential roommate a few days later, I noticed a draft I did not make in my email account that also said "try again".

My old roommate just moved out yesterday into his girlfriend's house. Lucky him, he has someone else to move in with. He admitted that the notes we received taped to our door both spooked him and made him fear for his stuff. Yeah, his stuff. He doesn't want his stuff to be stolen. That's his biggest concern. While he was packing up yesterday morning with his girlfriend, I begged them to move quickly since I had a potential roommate to interview later. I was busy calling the apartment staff to get him off the lease since he failed to do it before-hand when it should have been his responsibility. Again, I got a lot of back-talk from the staff. This time I was accused of trying to lower the rent a week before rent is due. They didn't notice that rent is over 12 days away, plenty of days over a week.

Other long story short, he tried to take my 42" flat-screen with him that I had payed for. He was yelling and acting as if he was going to take a swing at me. Thank my lucky stars he didn't. He left bitching and screaming about how I was too cheap to buy my own TV. Yes, he's one of those guys, and I'm fucking glad he's moving out now.

Eric, my new potential roommate, arrived plenty after the other guy was done moving out. Another lucky break. After he was done apologizing for being late I had to tell him it was actually very fortunate. So, first I got his permission to record the interview so I can look back and review it later. He agreed. I took the time to transcribe the interview. Here it is for you guys:

---

**Me:** So, let's start first with something important.

**Eric:** Okay.

**Me:** How soon can you move in?

**Eric:** (slight groan)

**Me:** No rush or anything, It's just that rent is due in just under two weeks and I can take a lot of it, but I can't handle it all.

**Eric:** It's not a big deal. I've been looking to move out for a while, as soon as possible actually. I had a few other people ask me, but they later decided their girlfriend, boyfriend, or who the fuck ever was more important.

**Me:** I understand that. So what are some things you'll be up to if you move in?

**Eric:** Other than work, I'll mostly just be playing music and video games. Maybe invite a friend over every once in a while.

**Me:** Just to let you know, if you're going to do anything sexual just keep it to yourself or make sure I'm going to be out-

**Eric:** Oh no, you don't have to worry about that. I don't have a girlfriend or anything. I don't even want to get married, like, ever, dude.

**Me:** Oh, of course, but some people just like to pair up and do whatever.

**Eric:** Oh, you're talking about swinger people, I get ya.

**Me:** It's whatever, don't worry about it.

**Eric:** Yeah, most people don't like hearing that I don't want a relationship.

**Me:** How come?

**Eric:** Everyone wants me to have someone to keep me out of the house or a reason to move out when I want or some other bullshit reason. I just want to enjoy life alone, really. I'm not working on getting a girlfriend just to move out, and I don't need a house. A house is for families.

**Me:** I've never actually heard that logic before.

**Eric:** What logic?

**Me:** Houses are for families, because a lot of people dream of owning a house just for the space.

**Eric:** How much space does one person need? A room and a kitchen, that's it.

**Me:** Cool. So, you said on skype that you like loud rock music. What sort of bands would you be-

**Eric:** Oh, the greats. You know, like: The Beetles; Jimmy Hendrix; Joe Satriani; bit of Coldplay here and there. And I know most people hate them, but a hint of Nickelback every so often.

**Me:** Eh, I don't think they're that bad. 

**Eric:** Oh, wonderful.

**Me:** Just keep in mind, these are apartments. So, after dark, keep it quiet.

**Eric:** Oh of course, last thing I need is to be kicked out and live like a homeless fuck, ya-know?

**Me:** Don't let the friends of homeless here you on that, they might take offense to that.

**Eric:** Oh, I'm sorry, was that over the line?

**Me:** Not for me, just be respectful while you're here.

**Eric:** Oh, question?

**Me:** Shoot.

**Eric:** Is the pool here free of charge?

**Me:** Yeah, you just need a key. I never use the pool, so I don't know how good it is, how deep it is, I've never looked.

**Eric:** That's not a problem.

**Me:** Any more questions you have for me?

**Eric:** Ummmm, hmm (Long pause). Would you be cool with me moving in this weekend?

**Me:** If that's how it has to be, then fine. I can't guarantee anything though.

**Eric:** Perfectly understandable.

---

After that, we got up, shook hands, and he left (but not without offering to take me out for a drink). I cannot wrap my head around this guy. Whether he was trying his hardest to impress or not, the "too good to be true" regime kept my heart pounding. I kept waiting for him to say something suspicious, or even "try again". I was tempted to bring it up, but if he really was anything to worry about, it may have set him off and put me in more danger.

I think I'll let him move in at least on a trial basis. I searched my apartment this morning for anything suspicious or anything missing. Nothing seemed particularly wrong until I saw that the latch wasn't.. well, latched. I couldn't remember if I had locked it up or not before I went to bed. The other lock was still locked, but that couldn't really indicate anything. After doing a second inspection of the apartment, I continued not to find anything.

I have my email open right now so I can email Eric. The draft is gone. I deleted it, and it hasn't come back. I'm worried about if I'm even going to be able to sleep tonight.

If anyone has any thoughts on this interview or something that could help me sleep, that would be wonderful. I really just need to talk to a few more sane people. 




 Okay, two points to make off the top:

1. Yes this is a fun deck

2. I still want this deck to be as good as it can be

This is why I'm here.  I've been working on this experiment for a bit over a format's time. It's held up pretty well to many modern decks.

I'm willing to spend as much time as necessary to complete this deck since my Cyber Dragons are done outside of a Foolish Burial. Now for the cards.

---

**Monsters** (25)

* 3 Hazy Flame Hydra
* 3 Hazy Flame Cerberus
* 3 Hazy Flame Peryton
* 3 Swap Frog
* 3 Treeborn Frog
* 2 Ronintoadin

Here is the core. 3 Hydra keeps Peryton - Solda plays as live as possible. This keeps drawing 1 Peryton and 1 Hydra from being a problem. Odly enough, I don't feel that Hazy filled hands are dead since Cerbereus can be used to float itself and other Hazies out of the deck. Just one frog is enough to get this going since Swap Frog puts Treeborn in the grave, Treeborn dying puts Treeborn in the Grave, and Ronin has a big defensive butt.

* 3 Battle Fader
* 1 Gorz, the Emissary of Darkness

Two points to these. First one is to stall. The other one is to give me something to tribute for a Hazy Flame.

* 2 Maxx "C"
* 2 Effect Veiler

Very good hand traps. Not sure about veilers lately. Maxx "C" is a double for stall and drawing. This deck needs to draw. Veiler helps handle my opponent's monster effects on their turn. Breakthrough Skill wasn't quite usable in this deck.

**Spells** (15)

* 3 Upstart Goblin

This decks needs to draw

* 2 Mystical Space Typhoon
* 2 Forbidden Lance

A good amount of back-row hate/protection without clogging up so bad that I cannot start my combos.

* 3 Enemy Controller

Paired with Treeborn Frog, I can take my opponent's monsters to use as I please.

* 2 Soul Exchange

Tribute my opponent's monsters for my many monsters I can tribute summon. Huge drawback is no battle phase. Not too much better than Soul Charge when you think about it. Tributing my opponent's problem monsters is sometimes the best way to get rid of them. Soul Charge cannot do that.

* 2 Creature Swap

Major troll card. I love using this to exchange my little Treeborn Frog for my opponent's lone beater. And it's for keeps too.

* 1 Rekindling

Ironically incredible in this deck. Even at first turn, Peryton and Cerbereus put in the work to dump Rekindling fodder into the Graveyard.

**Extra Deck** (11 Xyz, 4 Synchro)

* 2 Slacker Magician
* 1 Gachi Gachi Gantetsu

These are pretty good stall cards. As well, Gachi can boost my already big monsters to even bigger. Even brings Hydra to 2700 which is enough to beat over an Ophion. Yes, I've done it before.

* 1 Daigusto Phoenix

Can attack twice or allow Gaia Dragon the Thunder Charger to attack twice. Either way, a valuable asset to have and is very easy to make.

* 3 Hazy Flame Basiltrice

Didn't you read the core of the deck? You don't just run Hazy Flames and not run at least two of these. Two of them are often delt with easily since not all Basiltrice's have 5 Materials. But when one's in the Grave and you use Hydras to Xyz summon, you can attach some basiltrice to your Xyz monster.

* 2 Evolzar Solda

In a way, this is my Vanity's Emptiness. This deck absolutely lost to my friend's Gladiator Beasts until I finally got a hold of a physical copy of this card. Damn was Ren so goddamn mad that he couldn't deal with this card. He couldn't keep a Gladiator beast on the board long enough.

* 1 Constellar Ptolemy M7

Not only putting my girlfriend's gift to me to work, but is stupid use for those monsters who "cannot be destroyed by battle or card effects." I'm looking at you, beelze.

* 1 Gaia Dragon the Thunder Charger

For those pesky defense position monsters trying to protect those lifepoints that I want to destroy oh so much. Paired with Daigusto Phoenix, this card can be pretty darn useful. Especially when any of my Xyz monsters run out of material (heaven forbid).

* 1 Formula Synchron

The deck needs to draw

* 1 Black Rose Dragon

Awesome Field Wiping Ability

* 1 Stardust Dragon

Decent Protection

* 1 Scrap Dragon

Pair this with that Treeborn frog that just keeps coming back for hilarity. Not to mention, choose your targets, then chain Enemy Controller to deal with 2 of your opponent's cards at once.

---

I love my Hazy Flames. And I really love Hydra. I really love being able to use my collection and showing off what they can do. And this is hands down the most consistent build I've ever come up with. I no longer lose to that oh so common MST destroying a Hazy Pillar. Hazy Pillar is temporary, but Treeborn frog is practically forever.

I just feel that this has room for improvement. So help me with this experiment. 




 In case you haven't already heard, after my apartments having their keys stolen and having to replace the locks, I received a handwritten note scotch taped to my door saying "try again".

For those of you who don't know (long story short), this is what the first letter from the apartments said:

 At some time after 1:00pm on Monday, the... office was broken into. Computers, monitors, and phones were stolen. Also taken were some of the apartment keys. The good news is that all keys are on a key tracking system and none of the keys have actual apartment numbers on them.

 We are telling you this so you can be extra cautious and if you see any unusual activity, please dial 911. Additionally, we will have extended ours for our courtesy patrol.

 That being said we are implementing a new key system and will be installing brand new apartment locks as well as new mailbox locks. This project will begin on Wednesday.

That note was stuck to the door with two pieces of duct tape like the apartment staff always does. But the handwritten "try again" note was attached with scotch tape.

---

Thanks to suggestions from the /r/nosleep community, I was doing well to feel safer. My apartment complex didn't want me changing the locks to the front door because they have their keys on a system and they would need to be able to get in if I moved out. I thought it was complete crap and stated again that I was being targeted by someone or something, and they dismissed it. One lady even accused me of making the whole thing up.

I changed the locks anyways. I also installed a latch. I have the only key. My roommate couldn't care less since he's home all the time lately. A different long story short: he lost his job and he is planning to move in with his girlfriend next month.

Now I've been looking for a new roommate. I'm hesitant to invite anyone in given that I have no idea who could have left the note or why they even left the note in the first place. I'm still hoping someone will surprise me on live TV telling me it was all a prank. (Right, a harmless prank that cost me roughly 50 dollars is new locks, 30 minutes of installation time, and many nights of sleep.)

For the past few days, I've been emailing my friends, family, employer, anyone I can think of about my situation and need for a roommate that could pay his end of the rent next month.

One seemingly trustworthy person has contacted me for a roommate interview which will be tomorrow. We chatted over Skype the past three days and he seems like an okay guy. He's roughly my height with a beard, likes action movies, and loud rock music as far as I've heard from him so far. He even promised to keep the music down or use headphones when I'm home.

After we set up the meeting, I wanted to email him directions to the place. I had one tab open with google maps and one tab open with my email. Between switching tabs to grab directions, the number of drafts I had went from zero to one. That's right, I was looking at my email tab which had 0 drafts, and after looking at the google maps tab and heading back over, the number of drafts went to 1. This was bizarre.

Quick gmail tip, Gmail automatically saves a newly started email as a draft, but not until a few moments after you opened it. I didn't have compose new email window open yet, but somehow I had a draft.

The draft had no recipients and said "try again". 




 So here's the rule:

* If you Special Summon a monster, it cannot attack that turn unless it is an Xyz, Synchro, or Fusion Monster. 




 Let me give you an example of *that* guy.

I have a co-player at my locals who also happens to be a vendor worker at Frank and Sons. Translated, he thinks he can get away with vendor pricing while he himself is a customer. Most he would pay me for a Wiretap or Breakthrough Skill is $2. Why? Because he buys them for $2 while he's working at Frank and Sons. When I pulled a Dracossack from a tin, he was trying to get it from me for less than $15 (trades or cash, doesn't matter, makes no difference to him.) I just don't see how he would value my freshly pulled card for half of what he would value it at if it were his.

I respect that he is a vendor, but while he is at locals, he doesn't work for the card shop nor is his own shop even open.

Is it really fair for him to expect people to put up with this? Or should he cut the bullshit and act like a customer like the rest of us there?

So what person at locals do you have that's "that guy". 




 We all cancel, learn to live without internet for a few weeks (or just tether onto our phones which may even be cheaper), and they all tumble down and are forced to be fair. Too bad we're all too dependent on the Internet (myself included) to be able to do this. 




 Seriously, this should be a fucking default. This could be the funniest and most random subreddit ever.

Poodles are also stupid as fuck, just saying. 









 I am hoping to get some inexpensive samples from Delano. I'm strongly considering them as the manufacturer. If I do get samples, I'll have concrete game pieces to use to demonstrate the game in a proper "How To Play" explanation video.

Keep your fingers crossed. 









 I made this mat with this image for a friend. I had to remove a lot of big lettering but decided to keep the letters saying Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack. Also, I put a Big-Eye in the reflection of Dracossack's eye and branded the Dracossack making it personal for him.

The picture ended up being very small, and John wanted a border around it, so I quickly put in a sloppy metal-and-bolts border. He's not going to be too picky. It was partly to keep the image small enough to that the quality wouldn't be completely shot.

Note: I misplaced an eyebrow and blurred the name to make using this for yourself a hassle.

 I received a production quote from http://www.delanoservice.com/. I had quotes for 500, 1500, 2500, and 5000 cards. This would equate to anywhere from 10 to 108 starter decks. That's not a lot, but it still costs quite a pretty penny. Here's what the numbers look like

| Quantity | Cost |
|----:|:-------------|
| 500 | $4,050 |
| 1500 | $5,025 |
| 2500 | $6,219 |
| 5000 | $7,913 |

Hardly seems worth the money we might put into it. But, here's the kicker. This is quantity per deck. After other costs, I'm told that production would equate to around $3 per deck. Here is what they had to say:

 This price does not include shipping of the product or proofs, storage and/or fulfillment, or costs related due to changes in the art or product specifications. Industry standard overrun is 10% of the total ordered. Shipping costs, overruns and any other fees will be invoiced once production is complete. (Shipping is invoiced separately after DeLano Service is billed by the shipping company).

**This is difficult**

I am still in touch with the manufacturer hoping they can help me crush more numbers.. I'll keep you updated. 









 I have French lances, and I would love to get more French cards, especially in halo. Mega-tin seems like a good way to do this. Any way I can get one for a reasonable price?

 **Apologies**

I am extremely sorry that I have not been able to set up users lately. I will get to them later today. If in a few days you set up a thread but still do not have flair or a link on the list of traders, then PM me with the link to your feedback thread.

**Update**

I believe I am caught up in setting up and updating feedback threads. If I didn't set you up, it is because there is one or more problems with the feedback thread. I will have alerted any users of these problems. Just set up a new thread and this time, read all of the instructions and follow them correctly.

**Please read before setting up**

[Rules and Regulations V3 - READ BEFORE SUBMITTING](http://www.reddit.com/r/YGOFeedback/comments/20dtie/rules_and_regulations_v3_read_before_submitting/) 




 So we've all seen that "balance a card you think is OP" post. Let's do something a bit different. Take those cards that you have all the goddamn salt in the world for and obliterate them. Or change them suddenly. You can give Change of Heart an effect where your opponent gains a token if you want. I really don't care.

LET THE SALT RUN FREE! 




 Restricting cards is a diverse topic and one we haven't spent much time discussing. We are 0% sure what we are going to do with this. My team often doesn't see themselves as a part of creating the game even though I've tried to make them feel like co-creators or co-handlers of the game. So, I'm looking deeply for feedback. Keep in mind that we may test any of these out at any given time.

**Restrictions**

Default card limits have been at two, four, and three. I even once had a system where characters were limited to four and items were limited to two. At that time, the way items worked was pretty game-breaking. Yet again, that was also a time when items could be picked up on the field and cards had/used up to 4 slots. (The game also had a rank-up system, but I won't go into that.)

Now, the limit for any card in the deck is at 5. This means that with a 45 card deck and a commander, you will have at least 10 different cards. The main deck can be made up of 5 copies each of 9 different cards. The 10th card comes from the commander. This partially came from rushing out test decks. It ended up being a good system, although in the future, we may bring it down to 4 if we feel the desire for more diverse decks or if interested parties show a demand.

Commanders are strictly limited to existing only in the commander position (stacked on top of the Life Pile). Despite being a type of character, commanders will never be allowed in the main deck. *Note: Commanders are allowed to be changed between games. I will cover this more in the rules as the develop.*

**Artificial Restrictions**

There are a few options we could do here. The first list of options is assuming the default limit for any card (outside of commanders) is 5.

* Option 1: Have 6 levels of restrictions. In this plan, a card may be artificially restricted to 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. The default limit remains at 5 for cards without these restrictions.

* Option 2: Have 4 levels of restrictions. In this plan, a card may be artificially restricted to 0, 1, or 3. The default limit remains at 5 for cards without these restrictions.

* Option 3: Either a card is banned or it isn't.

This second list of options is assuming the default limit for any card (outside of commanders) is 4.

* Option 1: Have 5 levels of restrictions. In this plan, a card may be artificially restricted to 0, 1, 2, or 3. The default limit remains at 4 for cards without these restrictions.

* Option 2: Have 3 levels of restriction. In this plan, a card may be artificially restricted to 0 or 2. The default limit remains at 4 for cards without these restrictions.

* Option 3: Either a card is banned or it isn't.

**Notes**

Of course, any players picking it up without tournament play in mind can play however they want. We don't intend on limiting anything for casual play that disregards tournament regulation. Reason: It's impossible. Players will end up playing how they want to play and we have no problem with them having fun.

**Feedback**

Please tell us which of these options is most appealing to you. This will help us finish up the planning for our first starter decks. 









 **Card games... they have their qwircks**

In all honesty... we don't have any definite plans since we are still pursuing the right manufacturer. I will depend on their capabilities combined with out designs and ideas. But, the topic has been brought up among the team (by me, admittedly) that the games will never be 100% balanced unless every player had access to any card they wanted. And, as time goes on, creating more and more cards would just upset any balances previously put into place.

I say "good". We never intended this to be 100% balanced. Chance is going to take place on and off the battlefield. I have recently started watching a series on the science of good and bad elements in gaming and came across [this very good explanation on the effect of chance in competitive games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9ZI9kMsvRQ). Yes, it talks mainly about e-sports and video games, but it applies fully for trading card games as well. We're not going to be able to completely take out the random factors in the game. Not unless we can let you choose what card you draw each turn which simply wouldn't be healthy for any TCG.

To set up an example, when I was playing Yugioh on Duelingnetwork.com a few days ago, I came across a situation where I had 1 card in my hand that would allow me to win as long as I drew a Spell Card. That's exactly what I did. But, would I have won without that chance? the chance would have fallen to near 0 for most other possibilities. These situations are hard to control, and we have no interest in drawing from these experiences to influence our card design.

There are factors we can control and have interest in controlling. In Magic: The Gathering, there are over 200 possible cards you can receive from a core set. In Yugioh, sets range from 100 to 300 cards. Most sets are 99 cards. They even take it a step further in making many cards hard to get. In MTG, you may find it hard to come by a card you need if it's a mythic rare. In Yugioh, the same applies to secret rare, ultimate rare, and ghost rare. These drive up prices for a lot of these cards putting skilled, yet poorer, contestants at a disadvantage.

**So what do we plan to do about this?**

Well, one thing We've decided to do is lower the set amounts. We're not interested in bulking out 100 card sets multiple times a year with little opportunity for re-prints in the future. We think 80 is a reasonable number to keep sets minimal but somewhat profitable. Please understand that without profit, this game would fail. Some cards will be more rare than others, but these will likely be key cards and commanders that make some decks work.

But, what about reprints for those who cannot afford the first print? I myself am not a fan of that. After waiting months for Constellar Ptolemy M7 (Yugioh Card) to become affordable again, I finally got a hold of a key component of one of my decks. It felt good. The poor players with patients should be rewarded. I know many Yugioh players are still waiting for Evilswarm Exciton Knight to be less than 60 dollars to purchase reasonable. 60 dollars. That's the price of a modern video game (or a very rare retro video game).

To keep that price cap, we may occasionally release sets that simply aim to control costs of absurdly expensive cards. Especially cards we might not be printing any more.

Keep in mind that these plans are not set in stone. We still want to see how many cards we want in each pack. 8 seems likely, but again, it may not be up to us.

**Feedback is Welcome**

*I'll be continuing to make these posts so long as I have something to talk about. Please be sure to ask questions and leave feedback and suggestions.* 




 **Our goal for balance**

We've studied other card games to see how balance is handled. What we concluded is that we couldn't exactly conclude anything. All of these other games (Yu-Gi-Oh!, Magic: The Gathering, Cardfight Vanguard, My Little Pony CCG, etc.) seemed to have their guidelines change for what is balanced and healthy for the game over time.

So we are not aiming for an environment that is inherently perfectly balanced: Instead, we're aiming for the same asymmetrical aspects of the game that keep all other TCGs fun. However, we still want to keep every deck playable and fun for each player that decides to play them.

Yes, there will definitely be intentional imbalances between decks. This shouldn't come from one deck simply having better tools and statistics but from certain decks having tools that counteract other parts of the game.

**Guidelines for creating cards**

Each of these guidelines will be tested and adjusted and even disobeyed on a card-by-card or a deck-by-deck basis. These are just some of the guidelines that we have come up with to keep anything from starting out over-powered.

* Nothing is free. Everything that could give the player some sort of advantage should come at some sort of cost to keep anything from being abusable. This hopefully will emphesize a pro-con style of thinking in each turn from the beginning to end of each game.
* Decks should never become too fast without a price. Pretty simply, if a deck becomes too fast in testing, we may weaken some characters or nerf a deck's commander(s) to balance something out.
* Commanders are used as come-back tools, not game-breaking tools. In this aspect, if a leader ever becomes game-breaking, we will try to take away what makes it game-breaking. But if it would would require too much, we may simply ban the commander from play and design a new one that is more balanced for that deck.
* Slots: This was one of the very first things we decided on. We wanted all characters to be useful. More powerful items require more slots, so we restricted them to being used by characters who have less inherent fire-power. Therefore, any character with a trait other than "Normal", or any character with an effect will have only 1 slot. The only exception to this are commanders who will always have 3 slots. Characters with 2 slots will always have a trait of "Normal" with no effect. *Note: Thanks to this, we always do out best to make sure that whatever effect or trait is given to a character makes that effect or trait worth while to the player.*

**Feedback**

These are just a few things that we will be doing to make sure this game is completely fun for everyone. Picking up weaker decks (as long as they are well constructed) shouldn't be a chore or burden but feel more like a challenge. I have been testing with weaker decks letting my opponent use the stronger decks. And the mechanics have proven to reenforce the balance of the game.

If you have any suggestions, questions, or concerns, please post about them here. I'll be trying to post often about what we're doing.

 I run a self.post only subreddit which strictly forbids linking to ebay for sales outside of our ebay thread. I have tried to automatically remove posts with "ebay.com" in the content, but if it's linked [using this method](http://www.reddit.com), automoderator completely skips over it.

I can't remove posts that simply mention ebay because users are constantly messaging me that their posts are removed because they said something like "I sell 10% off ebay's lowest price".

**If this is already possible, someone please make it clear how to do it. I looked in Automods guides and didn't find a fucking thing. To be honest, it doesn't make very much clear for novice users.** 




 [remove this post](http://www.ebay.com) 




 In /r/ygosales, it would be nice if I could have the audomoderator do two things for me.

1. When a post reaches 10 minutes old, if it doesn't have flair, comment on the post "Your post does not have flair. Please add flair to your post."

2. When a post reaches 10 minutes old, if it doesn't have flair, remove the post and message the user, "Your post has been removed because you did not assign flair within the time span allowed. If you cannot assign flair, visit the desktop version of the site."

PLUS: THERE NEEDS TO BE A SIMPLE PAGE EXPLAINING HOW TO WRITE AN EXPRESSION. The guides seem to leave the users to figure it out based on examples. 




 My friend H2Overdrive picked up ice clovers and has pretty much mastered ~~f-throw~~ down-throw dair re-grab to a point where he can carry me across the stage and fair me to death. I really don't know how the hell to get out of it. It makes his climbers unfair to play against. I can't learn the matchup if his character doesn't let me play.

My Main is Ness, and the PK shenanigans are turning out to not be enough. Even my Pit (who is surpassing my Ness if you ask my other smash buddies) is finding this to be a stupidly frustrating matchup.

All of a sudden, I decided to screw around and challenge his climbers with Yoshi; A character I never thought I would pick up. But his climbers became easier to get off the edge and convert to a KO. What the hell?

So in other news:

* Any Yoshi tips?
* What can I do to avoid getting carried to my death by ICs?

EDIT: Downvote hell hu? I thought admitting what I don't know and asking for help would garner some discussion. Guess people just hate me. 




 Please do not use abbreviations unless you have explicitly described in the post what that abbreviation means. They are a pain to everyone who doesn't know what they mean. Even with MST (Mystical Space Typhoon), probably the most known abbreviation in Yu-Gi-Oh!, not everyone automatically knows what it means.

**TL:DR** Spell out your cards' names. 




 Shadolls can kiss my ass. On the bright side, no more drawing on first turn! 




 There's a subreddit where you can complain about anything you want all day and nobody can tell you to stop complaining.

I think everyone should give it a gander. It's called /r/complainaboutanything and there really are no rules as long as your complaining about something and you're not hurting anyone else. 




 I wanted to address the differences in the rules that are enforced here and on YGOBinders. And there's one big difference that has raised a bit of confusion. So let me clear it up.

**YGOSales is a much different subreddit than YGOBinders**

YGOSales is purely for buying and selling to get or get rid of Yu-Gi-Oh! merchandise. Whether it's cards, manga, DVDs, duel disks, even top-loaders. Sales get huge. Listings here go for up to 300 or even 500 dollars with users trying to sell decks. (These are removed due to exceeding the $80 price cap.)

We don't need users frequently arguing over scams because an envelope with 30 or more dollars was lost or even stolen when going through the mail. It happens a lot because, put bluntly, some greedy fucks work there waiting for those envelopes so they can steal for their own gain. YGOSales would be putting money through the mail very frequently if it wasn't for this rule.

**Cards with a dollar or two**

Using a dollar bill or two to even out a trade is not as risky as sending a straight 10 dollars through the mail. It's a reason I hold a preference of NEVER accepting concealed cash as a full payment on YGOBinders. A dollar or two to even out a trade is always okay in my book. Prohibiting concealed cash on YGOBinders would also prohibit this practice, and is rather unfair to those who take part in it.

Of course, tracking and insurance always helps, but is it really worth 10-20 dollars to track and insure sending 20-30 dollars in cold hard cash just to get it through the mail? Even then, if it fails, it was a waste of your money and every user's time.

**Lack of Price Caps**

There's no price cap over on YGOBinders. Why? Because tracking and insuring a deck through parcel mail is far less risky than putting a 20 dollar bill through an envelope. Sending decks has proved far less risky when proper care is taken (bubble mailer and tracking).

Price caps are enforced on YGOSales because buyers and sellers should never have a bad experience because (for whatever god-awful reason) a deck went missing in the mail. Paypal doesn't have a very sophisticated resolution center. Ebay's is far more evolved. That's why we have an Ebay thread which you can access from the header at any time.

Buying from Ebay is far less risky because of their great resolution center.

**Wrap Up**

I hope you enjoyed this quick explanation on why YGOBinders and YGOSales don't share all of the sames rules. Now please, be safe and stay honest.

*wants*

Here's something unusual. There's a few things I need to make a deck I'm working on playable. It needs testing to be blunt. So here's what I'm looking for:

* 3 Treeborn Frog  
* 3 Swap Frog  
* 1 Roanintoadin  

I would prefer to get all the frogs at once and in good condition.

Here's a couple other things I'll need for the deck:

* 2 Battle Fader
* 1 Evolzar Solda (ultimate rare preferred)  
* 2 Maxx "C"
* 1 creature Swap (ultra to match my current one)

Yes. I know. It's pretty Bizzar. Now this last group is something I was just because bunnies:

* 2 ^Ultra ^Rare Elemental Hero Stratos

 Could there really be a did inutile combination of these? I've tried to do it, but some of this coding and placing and file modding seems to be going over my head.

Someone should release a code set with a set of tools to let us all build cool builds that combine multiples of these. Plus, it would make for some awesome builds and interesting reviews.

Wouldn't you like something like this? 




 Breakthrough skill just got confirmed as a card in the Lightsworn structure deck. Would selling now be worth it? Mine are ultra and ultimate, so 17 and 25. If those fall too much, I'd like to profit from it. 














 Here's a game we do often at /r/Yugioh. We would take a card and add or subtract just a few words from the text to make the card OP.

So I challenge you all, make one minimal change to a character that you think would make that character OP. It could be giving Jogglypuff instant damage-to-zero on every rest or making Ganondorf's warlock punch only take half a second to do. (Nothing like 100% on a move or 15x knock back growth on a move. Those are boring, obvious, and uncreative.)

This will allow us all to see how delicate balancing the game really is and probably even peek into the mind of bored PMBR devs. But moreover, I think this will be fun for everyone. 




 So I was buying Hazy Flame cards on /r/ygosales and wanted to buy any amount of alternate art Hazy Flames. Naturally, I got a response. A bit of negotiating and a few weeks later, HERE THEY ARE!

http://imgur.com/0Zb0bKu

These are awesome, and at only 5 dollars a card, it felt really good.

Remember, that's sam90fox who made these. 




 I think this imgur album explains the problem:

http://imgur.com/a/RRQVN

I got a common5.pac file and started making a lot of changes. All of them going stable and keeping the size small enough so that P:M won't crash. BUT, when I try to replace bg_icon on the stage select screen, it gives me an error. If I try to make another change and save the file, brawlbox crashes without saving and I must make those changes over again.

I'm using brawlbox 0.71 for reference.

I'm trying to replace sc_selmap_en  MiscData[20]  textures  bg_icon 




 **[Project M! 3.02 - My Main Characters ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlezjvo-BXk)**

I have gone on record saying that Ness is my best. But, I wanted the community's opinion. I took the 3 mains I've been putting the most time into, Pokemon Stadium 2, and all three spacies to give you an idea on my skill level with each one.

Each of these are the first and only recording of each set. There weren't any resets to make sure I looked good. All of these sets were played one after the other in the order shown (Lucas, Ness, Pit).

**So I ask**

1. Who is my best character? Lucas, Ness, or Pit?

2. What can I work on across my characters? For each character individually?

Fun fact: I captured the main cap with an iPhone 5s and the face-cam with an iPhone 5. I edited it together entirely on the iPhone 5s using iMovie. 




 I'm buying Hazy Flames, and I'd prefer to buy them at least 4 at a time. I'm willing to pay 50 cents for each card. (35 cents for extra huge bundles.) Here is what I am looking for:

* Any amount of extended art Hazy Flames
* ~~2 Hazy Flame Peryton~~
* ~~5~~ 3 Hazy Flame Hyppogrif
* 16 Hazy Flame Hydra
* ~~5 Hazy Flame Cerbereus~~
* ~~9~~ 3 Hazy Flame Manticore
* ~~7 Hazy Flame Sphynx~~
* ~~9 Hazy Glory~~

 **Brawl Vault Links please**

So I just got a code set and common5 and mu_menumain ready to build a 6 stage expansion. But now the problem is I don't know what I want to add.

So I was wondering what stages the community here likes to use for some good hard Project M goodness. 

^(in case anyone's wondering, I doubt it, these May or May not be part of my next build. And my next music pack is about to start production.)

Thanks everyone. You guys are awesome. And you've helped others find cool balanced-ish stages to add. 
























 I wish I could buy a copy of the 3DS version by that time. Doesn't look like that will happen. 




 My friends can attest to me being an Apple Fanboy. When I hear android, I normally cringe. It's mostly from every android device being different to the point where I hardly even consider them all using a singular OS. (This is different compared to looking at 2 Windows machines and knowing for sure they're windows despite different companies changing the system around in their own way.)

But, to the point of the thread, I've had custom keyboards crash themselves and default to the iOS keyboard. I've also had apps crash from trying to pull up a 3rd party keyboard as I open it from the app switcher. And sometimes, when I tap a box to start typing, whatever 3rd party keyboard I use at the time doesn't show up. And I'm pretty sure the nature of the keyboards and the 3rd party devs have little to do with it and there's only so much they can do to prevent it.

I am very disappointed that it wasn't as smooth or seemless or bug-free as Android users had with 3rd party keyboards. 




 Then keep it open for a few minutes to let it cool. It's not a problem. 




 The point is 100 emails detailing a problem sends a message 1000x stronger than one person detailing the problem one time. Scale that to millions of customers submitting feedback about a problem instead of just a few ten thousand. 




 In this case, the buggy release of iOS 8 has to do with so many things being added under the hood. It was quite the ambitious thing to do to add so many features for an OS that was going to be used across so many devices. What Apple can do now is make sure that iOS 9 isn't about the latest and greatest features but improvements and slimming down of existing features much like Snow-Leopard did for Leopard. If we went straight from iOS 6 to something like iOS 8, then we would have had so much of a flipped up mess of software on the hands of too many angry consumers. At least Apple seems paced while some other companies seem to want to release new products at any given moment to make another buck. 




 You know, I find it kind of funny that before writing about "declining quality" of Apple's software, they could only write about how new features are coming too slow and how unbearably gated (it's not that gated people) the ecosystem is. Now that it's actually branched out with Macs that work well in Windows environments, iPhones with applications that communicate with each other, and new features are coming faster than ever, people completely back off on writing anything good and rush to write how Mac is still *behind* and *doomed* and *far behind Google or Microsoft*.

Tim Cook is doing his best to try to live up to the name that came before him. Let's face it, I don't think anyone is going to let him have any credit compared to Steve Jobs even if Tim Cook is doing a better and far more progressively paced job. 









 Really? Cause I just go to "my computer", open up the drive for my iPhone, then drag and drop all of my photos. 




 At least you can unload your phone's memory onto a computer with the cable that comes with the phone. I'm talking regardless of phone. You can unload most phones right onto a computer if you want. And cloud services are aiming to do that for us so we can delete happily to make room for new files. So why should this be a problem? 




 After two years, you wouldn't want to update your phone?... At all? 




 Wouldn't you want to get a new phone at that point instead of just a new battery? 




 The cycle is already at 3 years. 




 So if Windows 10 is a few gigabytes larger than Windows 8, should we all sue Microsoft for "shrinking" the storage space on the computers we willingly choose to upgrade? 




 And in the meantime, they should also be forced to count Gigabytes the same way a computer does, (per 1.024 megabytes, not 1,000 megabytes). Then maybe we can get a 16GB phone with 16GB instead of a 16GB phone that actually only has 14.9 GB of storage space.

That bullshit is absurd. 




 So I guess we should all sue Microsoft because they're OS takes up so much space that a computer with 500GB of space really only had 485 GB of space.

Here is where my collection stands. If you'd like to make an offer, I'll hear you out. I'm still in the holiday spirit, so I'm willing to make a good deal since I need to unload on extra cards and pay some bills. 




 Based on the solid coding MM had from being an improved engine from OOT, There's something to say about how badly it's been chiseled down from four hours to less than two. And who's to say MM won't somehow be just as torn apart as OOT soon? 




 Meanwhile, in Iraq:

Habib, "We don't have to blow them up. Their cell phones will do it for them!"

Bajejsh, "That's right. Cell phones and gas stations go boom! Thanks Apple Pay"! 




 Ocarina of Time? Try a bit of Majora's Mask. Pretty much the only things we seem to be unable to figure out is skipping New Wave Bassa Nova and Song of Awakening, or warping straight to the moon.

But, by God does the infinite sword glitch simply break that game. It does that by making Bomb hovering possible. In case anybody doesn't know, bomb hovering is possible in Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask by the way the sword functions. Link cannot fall or slip off an edge if his sword's hitboxes are active, so infinite sword glitch combined with block an explosion in the air will cause link to hover. You get off the air by back flipping.

This allows for stupidly crazy stuff. 




 It's Pinkie Pie on a mug. I'm instantly jealous. 




 imgur.com is one popular option. (Downside, since it's popular, there will be rare moments where images won't load on poor connections. Still, it's the most reliable.) 




 You don't upload to reddit. You upload to anywhere else then link to it on reddit. 




 Yep. It will come pre-damaged by water to save you the trouble of waiting for it to break. 




 Yeah, if I ever had a game with such a redo loud amount of DLC, I'd probably make the mundane DLC 29 cents each. Think about it: way more people will be inclibed to buy it and spend a bit more thinking they're gettibg bang for the buck and it could potentially make a lot more cash than suits/skins that cost 2 to 5 dollars a piece. 




 I'd like for shooters to stop trying to depict historic wars and for Zombie games to stop trying to imitate the walking dead or the last of us by trying to push sad stories on you. 




 Technically, the suction on most vacuums don't extend the full width of the base. It's actually about an inch wide at a spot where the tube would supposedly suck it up. The bristles actually end up spitting dirt and grit back out and hiding it under the visible layer of carpet. Plus, the longer the hose, the less powerful the suction. The only Vacuums designed to properly lift dirt and seal it away are those made by Kirby. They're expensive, yes, but even Kirby vacuums that are 5 years or even 15 years old work better than any modern vacuum from any other company.

Turn your vacuum upside down, turn it on, and put tiny pieces of paper in at the edges and everywhere in between. If it doesn't go directly into the hose, it's spit back out. On the floor, it would have split it right back through the carpet. So if you don't have a proper vacuum, you're literally wanking on sand and grit when you wank through your carpets. That's why some home owners replace all the carpet with hard floors. That's why apartments replace the carpets between leases. 




 This was an awesome read. Girlfriend loved it too. So NZA, where do you think Ness stands now? 




 Your opponents cards will never go to your grave yard. Likewise, your cards will never go to your opponent's graveyard. 




 But I'm not better. 




 I'm just putting it into perspective. I've pretty much ran out of gift ideas for anyone. Truthfully, I suck at gift giving unless I know an explicit item. Otherwise I end up buying a gift card and making a card. 




 I thought *I* was a good boyfriend, but that definitely tops me getting my girlfriend a Gold N64 (with matching OOT And MM games, matching controller), and a 3DS for her birthday a few years ago. 




 Of course not for free. If you were going to give them out for free, you would have donated them to some children's home or something. I just know that he loves yugioh, always likes having more cards, lives in Austrailia, and I figured I'd get you in touch with him. 




 I have a friend who lives in Australia. He'd gladly take those off your hands. PM me maybe. 




 This is definitely the right sub. I made this sub to be an environment for all questions Yu-Gi-Oh! related in a shame-free environment. 




 I got my girlfriend a preorder of that the year it was announced. I guess I'm better! Lol. That's great for you. It's a good read. Hope you enjoy. 




 Five years for me 




 I downloaded a stage expansion from http://smashboards.com/threads/stage-expansion-template-for-pm-3-5-36-16-and-12-stage-versions.345936/. I have modified it to only adds 3 stages to the end of the second page. There is an unfortunate side-effect of using this template though.

Although the stages are placed very nicely, the information that's supposed to hang to the right of the preview now dobbles to the left. If you need an example, see [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/IEVSEUg.png). The information here has been moved around heavily to accommodate for the extra stages that would take the right half of the screen. However, I don't have any stages there, so I need everything back where it used to be.

I have a theory that this has to do with the common5.pac of Project M. If anyone can help me with this, I can link you to a download of any files that may be the problem. 




 You *can* edit the original instead of amending it with comments.

 Okay, so for the basics, this isn't like other fighting games. A button sequence will not trigger any hidden or special moves. There are only A and B and combining A and B with a direction on the joystick. (I seriously which my friends would fucking grasp this concept. They might actually get good.) A attacks are considered jabs, tilts, and smashes. B attacks are considered specials. Also, for A attacks, holding a direction and pressing A afterwards is a different attack from pressing that direction and the A button at the same time. These are tilts and smashes respectfully.

Now that those are out of the way, when playing Ness, you'll want to keep in mind that using an aerial attack while double jumping will cause you to fall unless you are still holding a jump button. (Aerials only refer to A attacks in the air. B attacks in the air and still considered specials.) You can do a lot of cool things with this. So, master this concept. Get used to using it to move around he stage in fancy ways and throwing out fancy looking attacks.

Now, when it comes to recovering, Up and B works as another recover move. With Ness, it is quite different. Up and B throws out a PK Thunder that you must hit yourself with. It will launch Ness in the direction opposite of where he was hit. Master this recovery. 




 I downloaded a stage expansion from http://smashboards.com/threads/stage-expansion-template-for-pm-3-5-36-16-and-12-stage-versions.345936/. I have modified it to only add 6 stages on the second page. There are some stupid and nasty side-effects of this though.

For one, the stage name and emblem are still placed as if I were using [this](http://i.imgur.com/IEVSEUg.png). I haven't a bloody clue on how to move it or what I'm doing since Brawlbox's previews for the menu look like a jumped mess of crap.

Also, "- Page 1" icon's position doesn't match up for "Page 2 -" icon. The pages don't exactly match up in the first place, but this is extra annoying.

If anyone can help me with this, I can link you to a download of any files that may be the problem.

EDIT: http://www.lakora.us/brawl/ssseditor/ This helped me get a code that made the stage layouts look nicer. But, the name of the stages are still appearing way off (as if it had to make room for a dozen stages to the right of the preview). 




 BULLSHIT 




 Hey everyone. Yes, you. The one bitching about how Patrick Hoban aparently doesn't know anything. I just wanted us all to remember something.

**Patrick Hoban** is at the top of the tournaments. And **we aren't**. 




 Yet, he's the guy winning tournaments, and we aren't. 




 The point rather wasn't that the 1,000 LP isn't too far is it isn't too much. What monster are you honestly going to take? Tellarknights wouldn't benefit from anything other than a level 4. BA? Level 3. If you're planning to take a tuner and just sync for whatever, you're going to need a varied extra deck to take advantage of the multiple levels you might take control of.

In the end, Snatch steel is still one card from your hand. If your opponent MSTs it, then it's a 1 for 1. If you take your opponent's monster and tribute it, it's a 1 for 1. Stronger duelists don't settle for something that not only requires set-up but is a 1 for 1 at its strongest. If you could get YOUR OWN monster on the field for virtually free (ala graveyard effect or effect of a monster on field, whatever it is) then you've pretty much got something better than snatch steel. In that set-up, not only have you put a monster there, but an MST isn't an out to it in most cases. Furthermore, it will be your monster whose effect you can take advantage of.

In a format where Snatch Steel is in your main deck, you better hope your opponent's monsters have generic ignition effects that you can take advantage of to turn Snatch Steel into more than a 1 for 1. Hoban pretty much has it right. No deck should be relying on Snatch Steel as an explosive strategy. Especially in a format where the monsters vary greatly in level. Not to mention, when you take your opponent's monster and put it in the graveyard, you better consider the potential downside you could be giving your opponent. You'd be taking something worse than a 1 for 1 if you took a Burning Abyss monster and tributed it for something. Even if you Xyz with it, later, it *will* hit the graveyard and boost your opponent's position.

So quite honestly, this isn't a "make me win" card. It's a "win slightly more" card in some matchups and a "definite side-out" in other match-ups. A card like that won't be in a high-level player's main deck. And I'm calling right now that running Snatch Steel at all for tournaments is going to be the minority. (And no, I don't mean local tournaments where everyone will ride whatever hype train Yu-Gi-Oh! is on. Significant tournaments.)

 Just like last gen was pretty much, "Make it a call of duty clone, of at least a first person shooter."  




 Prime 2 must have been a real problem, then. 




 OH MY GOD, YES!

Except if it goes the Dead Space route. Nothing is further from horror than nonstop action with monsters that practically beg for screen time. 




 You would get Zero's effect after the summon goes through. Nothing interrupts a synchro summon, and a synchro summon does not start a chain.  




 Of that move would send you straight toward the corner of two blast zones, then DI would actually risk getting closer to the blast zones. That is when you don't want to DI. A 45 degree angle may not be best if you're on the left edge of a stage being hit toward the right. Your path is more toward a ceiling than toward a corner, so slightly down may be better than no DI.  




 Some people do to make sure it's a good read.  




 May not be creepy for you. But don't ruin it for other people. Most of what I've been reading are the cliches along the lines of 'person ended up being a murderer' or 'narrator is actually dead' or 'narrator is the murderer' (that one's the worst). 




 I think it started out as a minor kink. At night, I would set up a camera and record my wife, Kaley, and I as we slept. When I went to watch it, it would be in short segments. There were times I would find something unusual happening. For example, if she starts blatantly hogging the blanket, I'll rewind and watch it without fast-forward. She knows I do it too. She will even watch with me sometimes.

I don't do anything inappropriate to it. There is no purpose of sexual arousal during any of this. It's just something I like to do. I can't say the same for her, though. I don't usually keep track of what she does 24/7. So let me tell you about some of the funny things I have seen. Don't worry, she and I have both watched all of these parts and agreed to share these.

One time, I rolled right off the bed. But her, being my good loving wife actually picked me up and put me back on the bed. If she wasn't such a light sleeper, I would have woken up on the floor. And we wouldn't have heard me snore on tape. Apparently, I snore sometimes.

Other times, I talk in my sleep. She told me to go over a certain point while watching one night. If only she hadn't heard it. I said stupid phrases like, "I am a cowboy. You better listen to the law." On second thought, I think the stupidest phrase I said all night was, "Bring the fairies in for questioning about the bite of '87." I don't even know what that was talking about.

There was a night when we thought we heard her moaning. Turns out, she was having a dream that night about being with a celebrity. His name was something like Ryan Hanger or something. It was some guitarist she saw on comedy central a long time ago. She wasn't touching herself or anything, but she was making noises. I'm surprised she didn't wake me up.

So talk about wet dreams, there actually was a night when my wife asked me about why I got up in the middle of the night. I had to use the restroom. I did take my sweet time in there. What? I was having a nice long sit. She told me that I must have some talent to get in and out of bed without waking her up. That particular taping began to degrade the resolution.

I always tape over the same video tape. When it gets worn out, I take the tape, burn it in a fire, go down to the basement to get a fresh tape, and put the tape back in the camera. Once I make sure the recording works fine, I leave the camera in position on my dresser next to Kaley's death certificate. 




 That's a question for /r/yugioheconomy 




 Why was he looking forward to spamming limiter removal? 




 **Super-Polymerization**: Banned

I didn't know this card was such a problem. In fact, I've hardly been paying too much attention to Shadoll decks since Burning Abyss have been the top dogs for this format. Not sure if this was actually necessary for current meta or thought to be necessary for future meta.

**Artifact Morltach**: Limited

I feel as though this is completely unjustified. Even if most of my losses have been against Moraltach lately. It just doesn't seem that significant since the engine makes certain back decks better, but it also just makes good decks worse.

**Dark Strike Fighter**: Limited

Supposedly came back because it has new text. So be it, never knew why it was banned. Don't really care.

**Snatch Steel**: Limited

I'm going to have fun with this. I stopped playing when Snatch Steel was still legal and Upperdeck was supposedly still involved in Yugioh. Came back during Macro Rabbit format, and finding it banned was a shock. But I could understand why. But now that it may not exactly be a significant threat, I'm going to have serious fun with it. And so will monarch decks. Just saying.

**Honest**: Semi-Limited

My girlfriend, /u/lily247, freaked. She plays agents and any other LIGHT deck she possibly can. Damage step domination is supposedly not going to play as significant a role as it did in previous formats.

**Goyo Guardian**: Semi-limited

Oh god no. This shit is just stupid. When a fucking noob deck won because of a combination of your own misplay and their reliance on this piece of shit, the game gets more annoying than I care to handle.

**Dark Hole**: Semi-Limited

I'm going to have fun with this. I play Fire Kings from time to time. Not to mention, Burning Abyss can use it to clear opponent's filed and get some searches. Qliphorts can just pendulum themselves back, so I'm gonna have fun with that too. Although, this card will probably be mained at 1 with 1 more in the side.

**NO LONGER ON THE LIST**

* Blackwing - Gale the Whirlwhind

A costless self-summoner that gives you a synchro monster and depletes the power of one of your monster. Who the fuck thought this was a good idea? Brace yourselves, the blackwing players are coming.

* Mermail Abyssgunde

Meh

* Reborn Tengu

I'll probably test this in Hazy Fists

* Reasoning

By freaking god, I'm going to test this in everything I can.

* The transmigration prophecy

Meh. I really didn't think this card was that good when I read it. Glad it's off the list.

**Footnote**

Skill Drain still didn't get hit. BOO FUCKING HOO. Get over it. It doesn't need a hit. Soul Drain is at 1 because Dimensional Fissure and Macro Cosmos fill the same purpose which puts grave floodgates at 3 total. Skill Drain puts the field floodgate at 3 total (not counting anything specific). So fuck you, Skill Drain doesn't need a hit.

Vanity's couldn't at least come down to 2? I guess we're going to continue seeing tournaments decided by who drew the most Vanity's. 




 Microsoft apparently wanted the mac versions to be more like the PC versions which I guess is why Word got that horrible ribbon-like toolbar full of things that menus do for you anyway. Not to mention, they are indeed unstable on newer operating system and base-system macs that weren't bought with the bells and whistles.

In the meantime, I would recommend either trying out iWork or the Mac version of OpenOffice. They're very compatible with .doc formats and don't require much relearning of anything. 




 They will assume you have permission. If you are not selling the sleeves at some sort of profit, you cannot get in trouble. 




 To us. What cards do you have? Post them on /r/ygosales. I might buy them. 




  but they are banking on that most people are too invested in the platform to actually take their business to a competing service

Yeah, I doubt one title will ever be worth switching services. So, good on Valve. At least if Valve said it's because of controversy, a few more people might understand (at the sake of thousands more getting mad that controversy was the reason). 




 I could imagine that for a while, some of that DRM made certain music files unable to be put into iTunes or onto an iPod. I would imagine it's like a site that sells OGG music files trying to sue Apple for iTunes not playing OGG format. 




 I'll tell you know, it sets yourself apart from most combo videos that don't both to do anything more than choose the worst techno song they can find and mute all of the combos. 




 That editing. Definitely a lot more creative than a lot of other combo videos I've seen (which just put shitty metal or shitty techno over muted combo vids). Adding in those sound effects when you did really set this apart. Very good watch. 




 Nope, I never complained about it either. As far as I knew, Apple was trying to make sure you only listened to what you paid for instead of receiving a lot of music files from friends and online sharing sites. 




 Don't really care for the reason, and not a fan of Hatred. But, it does suck when a game with so much support and desire from preliminary fans is rejected for no apparent reason other than Valve said no. 




 I would love to get this amiibo, not for me but my girlfriend and her nephew. It would simply make their year. They are basically having to live with two families in the same apartment which gets cramped quick. It isn't fun. 




 It's hard to feel like we can help you. When you're in danger, you may want to leave out extraneous details. Like "It had rotted *from being in the heat from a metal box*". It had rotted would have sufficed. Also, Nan's personal information was a bit much. It's like you're writing down everything that happens to you because you want us to feel it as vividly as you did.

I feel like this update and the read in general could have been a lot shorter and clearer. With so many details, it's hard to think of any helpful advice. 




 It would take more room on the cartridge and honestly wouldn't make the game feel much different. In fact, when I listen to how some song sound orchestrated from Zelda Reorchestrated, some of it simply sounds off. Some examples are the mini boss music, deku palace, milk bar, and terminus field.  




 Of course it will. If I'm a console gamer with a dozen PC gamer friends who all get their games on PC, I'm not about to buy a console that cannot play with my friends online while another consoles around the same price can.

But of course MS doesn't want to push PC's playing with their console. They want to sell both. And they're trying to use Windows 10 to sell Xbox systems. They don't exactly make money on hardware that Windows sells on. Of course, they'd love to sell a PC to every person in the world, but if everyone got a PC AND an Xbox (because exclusives and non-cross play), they'd be even happier. 









 Time to drop that brand of phone and go with something else.  




 This is driving advice for any time of year. Not just winter. 




 I think that's quite wise of Sakurai. By the time they've got everything working smoothly online with Smash 4, there may be enough competitive results to balance the game more easily (if they decide to balance it). The game definitely has some balance issues. Ganondorf, for instance, is simply too slow to be viable in a tournament setting. He might be able to get away with throwing around items in casual play, but other than that, he's simply too slow to do anything against the faster characters like Shiek and Ditty Kong. 




 I don't run Sphynx. In fact, my current build only runs Peryton and Hydra. 




 I don't get it. The only results were more pictures of chocolate chip muffins and cookies. 




 I very much agree with this article. As a P:M build maker (Add-on builder if you want to call it that), I've been thinking of different ways to label the stages so that every TO can potentially use it instead of just a few who agree with my decisions (or possibly none).

Instead of people making builds that label everything "Starter," "Counterpick," and "Banned" with sub-labels of "Singles-only" and "Doubles-only," we could have two labels instead. One of these labels would be "Tournament Approved" which would be stages widely accepted to be suitable for tournament. The other would be "Casual" which would simply be anything that isn't tournament approved.

There's just about no more doubles-only stages. Those stages have been tweaked to be suitable enough for singles and may be stricken more often than not if someone is playing against a campy character anyhow. So the only sub-label needed would be "Singles Only" for those 1 or 2 stages that are simply too small to hold the chaos together.

And having 13 legal starters instead of 7 (like most tournaments) itsn't that much of a change. The polarizing stage choices will be stricken very quickly. Not much thinking. And those of you saying it would make tournaments much longer... NOT IT WON'T. It's just for the first game of every match, and it will not magically make matches last an extra two minutes. Stage striking takes less than 30 seconds between educated players. An extra 20 seconds wouldn't hurt you, and it would likely increase the variety of stages we see played as starters making tournaments more fair AND more fun to watch. 




 Nope. 




 Nope. 




 I guess the rules will have some tweaking. I'm not thinking of allowing any FTK deck. 




 I was thinking about the many decks that have been called tier 0 or were predicted to be tier 0. I always wondered how these decks would do against each other. So I was thinking of hosting a small online tournament for those decks. Everyone involved would have the choice to run certain decks. Among these would be Dragon Rulers w/ babies, Airblade Turbo, Goat Control, Perfect Circle and a few more.

Special rule: main deck cards would be limited to what was printed while extra deck can use anything out today.

Which decks would you want to see represented in this tournament? How interested would you be in participating?

Edit: Okay, so I'm thinking of rebranding it into a "Full Power" tournament. Choose any deck (sans FTK) that was top in its format and run it with any modern extra deck cards. 




 Meanwhile, on /r/yugioh101

We're happy to answer any questions there. 




 Use two monsters to make a 4 material XYZ monster. 




 Use two monsters to make a 4 material rank 6. 




 If you want, bring paper and pencil to track life points and write down each change in points and cause of change. (Simple as attack or effect would suffice). You're technically not allowed to take notes on complicated things, so keep things simple.

Also, if you suspect you'll need counters or tokens, have them ready beforehand. A token can be any object other than a Yugioh card (unless it's a token card or a card modified to be a token) as long as you can tell whether the token is in ATK or DEF position. Counters can be any object as well such as pieces of paper or tiny pieces of cardboard or dice placed on the card that keep track of the number of counters.

If you're running tokens that often vary in effect, write down the stats of the token on a piece of extra paper or sleeve it with use dry erase marker so you can change it as necessary. Example would be a racoon deck.

This is pretty basic stuff that most duelists understand if they regularly attend tournaments.

Remember to call a judge if you're unsure about something (tournament matches only). Don't take your opponent's word for it especially if they get mad that you don't believe them. Sometimes they are right and just mad that you don't believe them, but other times, they are wrong and are mad that you don't believe them. But remember, Judges are not there answer questions that start with "can I do this.." or "if I did this, could he do...". Judges are to clarify what is happening, not give advice about what you can/cannot/should/shouldn't do. 




 It's one of the reasons I play as Bowser from time to time. 




 When you activate an effect, announce it. I can't believe how many duelists don't understand this. Especially online. You can't just say you're activating an effect. Announce the card whose effect you're activating, which one you're activating, and pay cost BEFORE asking your opponent if they have a response.

If you're entering without a deck that is meant to be competitive in a competitive and complete state, then don't expect to be lucky. I'd advise to just have fun and see how you do and learn from other duelists. It's a learning experience.

Write down the cards you see most often. Specifically, the ones you don't know. If you don't know a ruling for a card, write down the card and ruling and get it confirmed somehow. Writing things down helps retain information, and hopefully, in one day, you'll learn a good portion of the most real-life meta rulings. 




 Dragon Ravine to 1. Possibly. Not because I want it back, fuck dragunity rulers. But I think it still wouldn't be a problem with Burning Abyss and Qliphorts running around.

~~Stratos to 1~~ Or not. I really don't fucking care.

---

Now with the obligatory stuff out of the way. I can get into what I think could happen vs what I think should happen.

**Vanity's Emptiness**

Should go to 1 | Might go to 1 or stay at 3

I think it's rather bullshity that many decks may sometimes just need that one special summon (no more, just one) to get what they need. But this card completely denies it if the opponent doesn't immediately have a mystical space typhoon ready. 5Ds has made its money. Vanity's is still absurdly hard to find, and afterwards buy. It literally defined a format.

**Skill Drain**

Should stay at 3 | Might go to 2 or 1

I really can't say. Even with Skill Drain builds of Qliphorts, Burning Abyss has been handling the hell out of them. Yeah, it still sucks when you don't have an MST and there's none in sight, but let's be honest, how many decks actually main this card? How many of those decks are meta? About 1. And it hurts one of their own monsters. This is where having a deck with graveyard effects or doesn't completely rely on monster effects comes in handy. This is where a grind portion of your deck, a portion that can hold out until you have removal, is important in a format without Heavy Storm.

I really don't want my favorite trap card to be hit.

**Heavy Storm**

Should stay at 0 | Might stay at 0 or go to 1

Why do I say this? Because if Burning Abyss is finally scraped a bit for the sake of promoting new cards, then I don't see how Pendulums can stop being a problem. I think it definitely should stay at 0 since it first and foremost is an OTK enabler. Not only does it enable OTK decks, but entire OTK formats. We have other cards to deal with face-up spells and traps, even multiple ones at a time. It's closed-minded players who see Heavy Storm as the only good way of countering Pendulum decks.

**Wind-up Carrier Zenmaighty**

Should go to 1 | Might stay at 0 or go to 1

Call it by it's real name, people. Please. You're not being clever by calling it "party boat", and newer players are left clueless. Seriously, this card at 1 with the other Wind-up hits might make for just a mediocre troll-deck at best.

**Rekindling**

Should go to 2 | Might stay at 1

I just don't think Rekindling is all that good. The decks that use it right now aren't that good. It not only requires set-up, but banishes anything you don't get rid of which forces you to choose your xyz play immediately. Not to mention cards like Vanity's Emptiness and Solemn Warning are huge right now.

**Torrential Tribute**

Should go to 2 | Might stay at 1

I just think if Pendulums are going to turn into a problem, we should have multiple solutions to reoccurring summons. This wouldn't fix anything, but would certainly help. It would also help Fire King and Chain Beat players a lot. Let's face it, those decks aren't that good. 




 This shit has been on the front page five times already. Stop up voting blatant reposts. 




 I suppose Bowser shouldn't shake the screen either. 




 I got it. You fucking prick. I knew what you meant. I thought the joke was just telling me I should get my wording right. Now fuck off. 




 10 tellarknights, 10 traps.

Or, failing that, 3 Cyber Dragons, 2 Dyber Dragon Core, 2 Cyber Repair Plant, 2 trap stun, 11 draw cards. 




 Yeah, I'm pretty sure Aonuma has learned his lesson about large worlds. He's made quite a few, the best in my opinion being The Windwaker. (Wow, have I plugged so many hours into that game with a single file.)

Besides, Skyward Sword's world didn't seem big to me. The loftwing got you from one side to the other in five minutes. As far as exploration goes, I didn't do much because of the lack of incentive to do so. Zelda U, I hope, will increase that incentive if Aonuma does as promised. 




 I don't see the word "3DS" or even "DS" anywhere in this page. 




 He's working on Majora's Mask 3D which is more than probably going to influence his decisions and ideas on Zelda U. Especially if Miyamoto has something to say about it. 




 His wife's children aren't his. 




 Apparently, they expect you to have been doing work for free for 2 years before getting paid for it. I'm sorry, but isn't practicing my skill while learning it experience enough to get started doing it? Don't you want to be able to mold me and brainwash me instead of having the ideas/ideals of different companies when you hire me? 




 I've seen this on five fucking memes now. Can we NOT upvote this shit to the front page every time someone posts it? 




 Seriously, maybe the new puzzles are figuring out HOW to get to where you want to go. A page from the book written by Metroid. Sure, sometimes you know where to go or have a map, but getting from point A to point B may not be as simple as walking the straightest line. 




 My personal favorite boss from SS was Tentalus. Not so much for gameplay or difficulty, but it was an epic fight started with the epic escape that the boss made necessary. I hope more of that creativity comes into introducing bosses. "Oh, boss door, let's go in, and..." small custscene, boss shows himself off, start boss fight.

Am I right? 




 This game *is* coming from Aonuma. This is pretty much the guy who brought us a living, breathing, almost sentient-feeling world of Majora's Mask. I'm pretty sure he isn't going to completely screw up in the living breathing world portion of the game. 




 I got bored of Skyrim after seeing a friend try to show me the "awesome things" about it. He spent 20 minutes in a menu doing almost nothing. I said, "fuck that". No game where you spend more time in a menu than playing is worth it.

Then cue him doing a 20 minute dungeon for the same amount of gold that the loot from a single enemy could give him. Oh, and a potion. Don't forget that 1 potion. 




 Hard to improve on that. WWHD gyro was pretty damn awesome. Only thing they could really do is have an option to adjust the sensitivity. 




 That the main quest doesn't make you want to complete it. That side-quests will be more fun, more engaging, and actually be the bigger reason for logging in long hours than the main quest. The big fear that all these side-quests and mini-quests will be nothing but trivial and repetitive leaning no desire to get 100% on the game.

Basically, that's it becomes Skyrim with a Zelda skin.

I really don't think this fear that the world will just be open and bland with no villages, NPCs or things to do in it is justified. They have almost a year to fill this world in. Let's give them a chance to do so before just saying "bland and boring is this world". 




 The hilarious, yet sad, thing about this is that it happens. My friend, let's call him Dillin, has a wife and 3 kids. None of them are from the same dad, and none of them are his. 




 Depends on how easy it will be to get a PGLD one and how many people want the PGLD one instead of the original or tin prints.

PGLD Extremely easy to get? A lot of people want it? Other prints could drop 5-6 dollars.

PGLD Very hard to get? Not a lot of people want it? Other prints might drop 1-3 dollars.

PGLD Very hard to get? A lot of people want it? Other prints could drop between 1-6 dollars.

A lot of this depends on who wants it though. If the people who want it are selling their old ones, that could in turn raise the supply of old ones while their demands go down. Lower prices for old prints. 




 She *could*, but that's not the point. 









 My family still assumes that I'm as immature as a 6-year old. That started when my girlfriend gave me a rainbow-dash shirt during my first Christmas as a brony. They couldn't believe that I would watch the show. They've never seen it, and have never given it a chance because of their impressions on the previous renditions of the franchise. To make it worse, my eldest brother sees it as *another* reason to call me gay. My mom continues to question my interest and sexuality and taste in shows because my oldest sister watched three minutes of generation 1 and gave up on it.

It's bucking annoying. In my family, you can joke about killing each other, beat each other up, give gag gifts, and even watch extremely violent and/or satanic shows for a laugh. But watch an episode of My Little Pony and everyone starts questioning everything about you.

My girlfriend's family is a lot more accepting it, and every day, I like start to like them more than my own family. Not all of my girlfriend's family doesn't all watch, but they are much more understanding of why we like the show.

I can handle some stranger on the internet or passer-by assuming I masturbate to cattle or horses, but my family simply not giving it a chance or hearing me out on why I like it just makes me wish I had a different family.

I don't necessarily watch The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, Glee, or Breaking Bad. But my family spans all of those and I at least respect them. I don't call my sister a geek or loser or assume she's a talent-less wannabe for watching Glee, nor do I think my eldest brother is a meth-head or accuse him of being a marijuana junkie for watching Breaking Bad. But I respect what they watch.

I'll be glad once I get my own place, since then I'll finally be surrounded by fellow bronies.

(Wow, I just realized that Bronies act more accepting than my fully Christian family. Seriously, the only family I can think of that hasn't been judgmental about it is my brother-in-law who is a pastor.) 




 _ PMDT DOESN'T OWE US SHIT _ 




 Because of high rates, not something that would be worth it for either of us. 




 It's not a quick effects. You can only activate it during your own main phase.

Destroying a spell/trap does not negate the effect of the spell/trap. The only exception is destroying continuous spells and traps which must be on the field to resolve. 









 Yeah, all 14 ounces. 




 This is a load of bullshit. Those cops aren't doing their duty. If there's cops to talk to, then obviously, there's SOMEONE free enough to approach a house, knock on a door, and demand a stolen phone back and possibly make arrests for theft and any other illegal activity that household has been up to.

Tell the cops you tried to ask for the phone back but they shot a gun at you. Then they'll have no choice but to investigate. If that doesn't work, tell them you just shot them and got your phone back yourself. That will surely get their attention.

Or, you could keep recording (on video) evidence that they definitely have your stolen iPhone, report it to the news, threaten your city council rep and mayor that you'll vote against them if your tax dollars refuse to protect you from theft, and capture the world's attention if you can. A country or county's cops are a piece of shit if they pick and choose who they help. 




 I have a Cyber Dragon Deck which I'm taking apart and selling. I really need the money right now as I struggle to find a job and pay college loans.

I'm not leaving the game by any means (I'm using a budget deck right now). I'm moving on to a different deck after Cyber Dragons anyways.

I'll accept reasonable offers on big bundles. I have a few more cards to sell that I will be putting here at a later time.

In the mean time, [Here's a link](http://imgur.com/a/ePOJs) to what's for sale. Just ask about price/rarity.

I'm not trading, nor can I buy right now.

**[What's for sale?](http://imgur.com/a/ePOJs)** 




 My friend got top 8 in his locals with Agents and he was the only one in top 8 not playing Qliphorts. I found that rather mind-blowing. 




 I just tested this out in Devpro. It actually works. The techs work. The choices work. It all works, and it makes the deck more flexible than most tellarknight decks. 




 Constellation Kause becomes once per turn.

Satellarknight Deneb cannot search for a Tellarknight monster you control.

Hazy Flame Pillar doesn't allow non-tribute normal summons.

Dante cannot mill more than one.

Mermails changed types around and worded so only discarding for the big summons gets any effects from discarding. (Okay, not so subtle, but would hinder them slow unless they drew just the right hand). 




 It's a first look. Why would you reveal anything spectacular on a first look? It's a few small parts of the over world. They haven't even scratched the surface. Why the fuck is everyone so skeptical? 




 I'd rather play this than Skyrim. 




 Hitting the mark is miles better than $60 beta testing programs and day 1 patches. 




 I think we should all stop being skeptical. One of the fun parts of Skyward Sword was that environment was turned into a puzzle. This looks like it can bring similar yet more subtle experience. It's taking a part of Metroid's formula of turning the simplicity of point A to Point B into something that you need to figure out. Plus, a world this eerily detailed has the potential to hide the most subtle secrets for small but rewarding returns (unlike Skyrim where you might do a whole dungeon for a small amount of gold and a dirt cheap potion).

Plus, I bet, that this world to turn out just as beautiful if not more beautiful as anything Bethesda has tried to do. And they likely didn't put nearly as much effort into just making sure every object's every last wrinkle can be seen. 




 "I can get it for five dollars at Franks".

"yugioh prices is always wrong".

 So... what's the minimum quantity? 




 Do you have a minimum quantity? 




 This would be an extremely handy feature. In a subreddit where flair is not mandatory, it could be a savior.

On /r/vine, there's a flair for unusually loud vines. But if the poster refuses to flair it properly, and a moderator never checks it, users could keep falling victim to a loud vine raping their ears.

So what if a comment that said

 \#tooloud

could get automoderator to automatically flair the post or tell the moderators that the post needs flair? 




 Could you elaborate on sales collateral? I'm interested, but I'm not sure if that's a term I just haven't heard or something I actually wouldn't be able to do.

 Because with cable, you're paying for a services that presses a switch and let's you access their channels. The money you pay doesn't go to the companies who host their channels. The companies need money to maintain those channels and to maintain their slot on the sevice of the providers. The only way they can do this is for advertisers to give them money to also be on that channel.

Netflix: you pay for Internet, and you pay for content to keep Netflix funded.

Cable: you pay for cable, and advertisers pay to keep content funded.

The cable company does not put ads on each channels. They rent channels to content providers. Unless you want to donate millions of dollars to a channel's content providers to keep content ad free, you cannot complain. 




 Negating and destroying are two different mechanics. An effect, when activated, is not attached to the card. The best way I can put it is as follows.

Imagine each zone has a su zone that effects go into when a card is activated in that space. Even though the card may be removed or destroyed, it's separate from the effect and the effect is not influenced by what happens to the card. (The ONLY difference is continuous effects. Those cannot apply unless the card is resolved, face-up on the field, and hasn't been destroyed.)

So, to negate an effect, a card effect must specifically go after the effect to affect it. Therefor, cards that only destroy a card do not affect the effects of the cards that are activated. 




 Someone *did* figure it out though.

User karma uses color:gray... while other grays on the subreddit uses a different grey (#C6C6C6). For a bit of consistency, and easier to see user karma in header-bottom-right, changing that to #C6C6C6 would be nice too. 




 Oh god, thank you. Now I know she heard me. 




 It's actually a 22.4% grey. That's considered a light grey (below the 40-60 range). 




 Also, So the div.score.unvoted is at #C6C6C6 right now. That's roughly 22.4% on the grey meter. I'd recommend, if a change is implemented, raising it only slightly. Maybe to #D7D7D7 (~16%). I tested it using inspect element. It looks pretty good.

The same applies for comment karma as well. tried it out, looked fine. Althrough, I don't see a problem either way.

 Emulation is typically used to play old, rare, and out-of-print games whose developers no longer make any money on. It is still technically illegal if you don't own the game, but for those who have the game but have ruined discs or their PS1 no longer works, it's not exactly the devil's work. Meanwhile, piracy in this day is more associated with obtaining recently released media for free through means other than borrowing or getting as a gift. Basically, stealing. Since the media (be it game, movie, or song) is new and still actively makes money for the publisher, it has a more significant impact on publishers. 




 Hence, 

 Half way there

 First it will roll out in al paso texes. And then to almost main 2 years later. And people just out of reach will make memes about how sad they are not having it. 




 You missed the point. What goes in the header is not by default or by some rule supposed to be filled with relevant characters. It was voted on by users. Not all entries just plastered modern cards into the header, and the winner could very well be a blank white hole. 




 Having a regular phone isn't a tragedy. The point is, NOT everybody can get and have a working smartphone with service. It's NOT as affordable as the original comment said. 




 I think it's worth watching. There are definitely some intense and rule-bending duels that end up being very epic. Not to mention one of Yugi's duels is simply the definition of SACK!

 After she complained, she probably got bribed by large corporations to keep wages the same. Then she said okay and decided to drop the issue in favor of making herself rich through corporations' so-called "contributions".

Ads were around this way before they were used for revenue. Companies to not get revenue from ads in a DVD and it is easy to skip them.

To start expecting that all paid services and products should come without ads just because that's the norm digitally is flawed logic. 




 My friends only like Brawl because I don't practice it, so it's the only way they have a remote chance against me (as if). 




 Was just weirded out that someone who likes Brawl as is would be trying mods. Nothing against those who do, just didn't make sense.

Thanks for clarifying the sarcasm.

Speaking of sarcasm, Nana is so tier 0 in 3.5. 




 Because we love Project M. I can't imagine why people who thinks Brawl's gameplay is perfect would feel the need to try its mods when the main purpose of the mods is to change the gameplay. 




 Then why are you here? 




 I actually must disagree. I see many more characters competing with Fox/Falco/C.Falcon etc. It's just easy for Melee players to Pop over, default to fox, and make it feel like Melee+. After all, I barely see fox even win a tournament for Project M. Most of the time it's not even a Melee top tier.

Fox and Falco were not immune to nerfs in their development. I seem to remember reading that they no longer have any frames of invincibility during Shine startup and Fox's Up-smash was nerfed in 3.5. Not to mention, Falco's recovery is still noticeably worse than Melee. And as I recall, everyone thought puff was simply unviable in 3.02 because everyone's recovery was too good. But since everyone's nerfed, puff magically seems better (even though she's not any better than before). 




 That's assuming 100% of Wii's were sold to people who knew it was backwards compatibility AND bought it as a GameCube. I'd imagine that 70 million people who never played video games before bought a Wii because it was also a GameCube (not really). We cannot assume that anybody bought it for that soul reason since it seems only 30 million of past customers even wanted a GameCube. 




 The Wii didn't sell 100 million consoles because it was a GameCube. With that logic, the Gamecube should have also sold 100 million units. 




 start banning only cards that come a dime a dozen so that card prices never go down. 




 They can, but that doesn't mean they will. We have to assume that consoles that had larger install bases will have larger fanbases and more fans who want to play those games again. So, let's count how many gamecubes were sold. Now let's count how many Wiis were sold.

I thought so.

 Then, you just need to not get rid of it on your own. That's what makes Imperior order a bunch of bull. You can just choose not to pay for it then use all the spells you want having still denied your opponent any on his last turn. 




 Fuckers ran off with my lightbulbs as soon as they got the chance. 




 Didn't OSX start requiring 2GB 10.7? If so, then the RAM requirement hasn't actually changed since then. Why are people suddenly finding their macs running badly? 




 I could not give any solid reason as to why I think they will have a better time or even a more successful launch. As it is, it really is just an expensive accessory to an already expensive phone. Well, if you want to get all of its features, you need an expensive phone. But, I think there are reasons for both Apple doing better and Apple doing worse.

Apple will likely have much better marketing. Let's face it, you would be hard pressed to find any proof of other smarteatches being marketed to consumers through consumer channels. I talk about Tv and non-tech internet sights. It will probably boast things the consumer may find useful straight to the consumer and really put it in there face. Not to mention, even non-savy consumers can follow what Apple is doing by watching events on YouTube and following places like /r/Apple. So, much more people may know about it in the first place. Regular consumers like that don't have an easy time following Samsung or Sony with their individual releases. 

The. Again, Apple's watch is not much different from other smart watches feature-wise. And despite this particular watch having a dial, tracking your heart-rate, and being able to switch straps, it doesn't sound too much more intriguing than any other smart watch. Call it what you want, it is still a watch that much stay bound to your wrist out in the open to use its core features.

These are both coming from a hardcore Apple fan who would easily have all of Apple's latest gear if he could afford them.

 In my opinion, the card would simply be more balanced if it didn't allow you to keep a myriad of OP special summoned monsters while denying your opponent any kind of play. 




 Well, Project M has neen recognized as its own separate smash game garnering it's own fan base and competitive scene. It's a Smash game, and it's played on Wii. It's a Wii game. My friends and I are barely aware anymore that Brawl exists. 




 I'm not trying to play against them. I want to learn how to play ICs. 




 He and I are pretty equal. He can only beat me easily with ice climbers, so I have counters for that which prevent him from doing so. I want to learn them to show he's not the only one skilled enough to do so and that I can beat all his characters easily including his counters.

And I love how everyone is just questioning my motives instead of pointing me to a tutorial. Really fucking helpful. 




 I'm not planning to just do dittos. That'd be fucking retarded. Even if we did do dittos, it's obvious that you can't just play it like other match-ups. I want to ruin people's day against their other characters. 




 Because I love ruining people's day. 




 **Supressed "C"**

Level 3 EARTH Insect-type

When your opponent special summons a monster, you can special summon this monster to your opponent's side of the field. This card cannot be used as Xyz or Synchro material. The controller of this card cannot attack with other monsters.

ATK/800 DEF/500

**Pendulum Veiler**

Pendulum Scale 9 | 9

*Spell Effect*

When this card is activated: your opponent can choose 1 Pendulum card in their Extra Deck and shuffle it into their Main Deck. If they don't, this card's Pendulum Scale becomes 1.

*Monster Stats*

Level 2 LIGHT Fairy-type monster

During either player's turn, you can discard this card: Your opponent cannot Pendulum summon this turn. Also, any Pendulum card that would be sent to the Extra Deck is Banished instead until the End Phase.

ATK/0 DEF/0 




 I wish my girlfriend would do the same every time I watched Frozen with her.

 Banish the top card of your deck. Destroy one monster your opponent controls. Monster effects cannot be activated on the same chain as this card.

* Destroys a monster
* Minimal cost
* Prevent bullshit like Shi-en
* Cannot chain the monster effects
* Doesn't target 




 As if Project M was the only good smash bros. game. I'm still looking forward to the other smash tournaments (except Brawl). If SSB, Melee, and Smash 4 are all there, I'll definitely watch those when I can. If not, I'll tune in to see them on Youtube.

This isn't the end of Project M tournaments. They'll still be around. In the mean time, we really should show Nintendo our love for the series by at least trying Smash 4 if we haven't played it already. It gets so many things right where Brawl simply got everything wrong. Really, the only thing I can say I don't like about Smash 4 is the stupid-as-hell Up+B auto-sweet-spot.

Shoutouts the Project M DT for making this awesome game for our enjoyment out of their own free time. 




 Oh god, I really hope Nintendo doesn't try to shut this effort down.

 Yeah, z-indexes are finicky sometimes. I hate fixing something in the z-index, put in a solution that should work and have it have absolutely no effect. Thank goodness this worked without fuss. 




 I see you figured out the problem with the dropdown menus. About time too. I was just about to send a solution. But, the banner ad is still appearing above the actual menu. 




 This should be considered the proper thing to do when people over glorify their kids like that. 




 I think that is why Nintendo wouldn't do it on the current generation. I'd bet that they're quietly working on closing the gap between the power of the home/mobile hardware to be affordable. Basically, it's so you wouldn't *have* to buy both the home console and mobile hardware. If you prefer one over the other, you could just pick on and stick with it.

Nobody wants to see a cross-platform release limit their game. It sucks. 




 Give them a max resolution, and everyone will take advantage of it (if they don't know about design and UI). Not everyone will have ads disabled, and regardless of adblockplus existing, every detail must be taken into account. I have Adblockplus and it doesn't block reddit's ads because (the way reddit's default does it), they are nonintrusive and labeled as ads in a stand-out way so people don't confuse it with an unsponsored link.

The sidebar doesn't need to pop. It's something that regular redditors know is there, and it's not going to change drastically between subreddits.

Don't have to tell me how easy opacity is. This is the stuff I went to school to learn. I have the degree to show for it, too. Now that I'm done tooting my own horn, I'm thinking of possible solutions I think might work. I'll need some time to test them. I might just cheat and look at how Konami did it in the first place. Haha. 




 [](/pinkamina) Mayyybeee. 




 ^^Someone ^^knows ^^Pinkie ^^Pie ^^is ^^my ^^favorite ^^pony 




 I, or any other Konami judge, know how. Feel free to PM if you can't find anyone locally. 




 And you would. But mobile versions of the and games would also be available on a mobile platform. 




 Just read a few things on PSCT and try a few times. Then ask someone who knows how to write in PSCT to proofread. 




 It seems Colin knows to block his name when he mentions his name but not when the other person says it. 




 Melee top tiers exempt from nerfs? Far from it. In Melee, Fox and Falco had a frame of invincibility on the startup of their shines which has been removed on each one. Fox's up smash was drastically reduced so that light characters don't die to him at 50% anymore on average stages. Falco's recovery sucks. That may be a part of brawl they decided to keep for one reason or another but the point still stands. Sheik's combos have been cut down from version 1.0. Marty has had tiny little changes to warrant a different playstyle. Puff, pretty much the same except with some higher knock back on some moves making her combo game much weirder to pull off if ever.

Melee top tiers are not immune to nerfs. But they're designs are bound to their Melee playstyle.

I really think that what PMDT is trying to do is use the Melee top tiers as a guidelines. If PNDT thinks all characters can be as good as Fox and Falco, then at least they should be worth a try. Heck, Hungry Box is even playing puff again. Wiz robe still plays sonic. PK Fire in shield was removed and PK flash doesn't seem to have the same power, but NZA (I take it from him since he's the best Ness I've seen) thinks Ness has actually improved overall.

Just because a character is needed one way does not mean that they are worse. All changes to a character should be taken into account. Everyone can basically live longer against Melee top tiers despite their needed recoveries. 




 This time, can we seriously cut down on the banner height? I'm on a 1080p screen and the banner and the somewhat tall menu take up the first 40% of the screen. Reddit's defaults only take up the first 20%.

And, instead of having alternating themes/banners, runner-ups can be used in the other subreddits such as /r/ygosales and /r/ygobinders and /r/yugiohfeedback. That way we get representation from more than just 1 designer.

Also, still seriously not liking the side-bar. Colors make sense, except for yellow on white which is hard to read. But buttons are simply much bigger than usual buttons and I seems to notice a high reliance on shadows for depth effects. Not exactly an element that Konami uses if we're trying to emulate their look and feel.

The dropdowns on the dropdown menus also seem to have a bit too much transparency. (same goes for the tabmenu.) On pages like these with a lot of text near the menus, the words will be painful to look at. That background making the arrow pointing right should also have a hover property so it looks like it's a complete element. Otherwise, it looks incomplete, or even like an oversight.

(Yes, I'm really going to make a fuss over the UI of this place.)

[Image](http://i.imgur.com/DgdX1rT.png) In here, after the banner ad, half of my screen is taken up. Good UI gets the information to the user and gets out of the way without intruding significantly on the experience. Default reddit CSS doesn't take up nearly as much space (even with the banner ad, it takes up less space than our header alone).

 And that's an awesome thing. Let me get this straight. It's awesome that these were reported for Apple to fix and spend time on instead of being abused by the finders. An operating system has to harbor a huge deal of running software, so I would expect operating systems to have more bugs and vulnerabilities than anything else.

But now instead of hearing that vulnerabilities are being attacked, they are being reported and addressed. And Lettie honest. We would all rather the next big update will be closing up these holes as well as performance improvements instead of mindless additions of new features adding more bugs to the list. 




 That would be so cool if it worked the way it were supposed to.

 Deck size according to the official rules.

The size of your main deck should be anywhere from 40 to 60. Your extra deck should be between 0 and 15 cards. Your side deck should be between 0 and 15 cards.

People who tell you it *has* to be 40 are likely just suggesting that 40 is optimal.

I'll definitely give her credit. She's braver than I am. Insane actually. She's staying overnight in the hospital while the doctors tend to her stab wonds. Just inches away from the heart.

She found my bookmark while I was away at therapy. Im doing much better by the way, thanks for wondering. It was yesterday at therapy she invaded my bookmarks and found it. She could see it clear as day. At least according to her. When I try to see it again, I get another 404 error message. As if the page isn't found or doesn't want to be. Or it's pretending to be hidden. Here's the bookmark link I told you about:

cipherthecipherfor.schl.com/hotline/cipher#underground.

Go ahead, try it yourself. I wouldn't recommend it to be brutally honest.

Early this morning, she told me at the hospital how happy she was feeling to know people cared. When I asked her to go on, she shifted to a story about her friend who had hung herself last Thanksgiving.

She was convinced by the cipher that she could reach her dead friend with the cipher. Then, a bit more quickly than I was, she was convinced that suicide was the path to her friend. As she stabbed herself, she supposedly thought of the wound as a reunion wound. Sound cheesy? It's my little sister. I don't understand half of the things that come out of her.

I cant imagine how she and I could have such poor judgment. The human mind is a sick thing, and some great minds may think alike, but it almost seems like a coinsidence. I deleted that bookmark and even deleted my entire browser history to make sure I never find this cipher again. At least not on accident. I already regret leaving it here.

Although, I do feel a thirst to know a bit more. But, I'm hoping it will all work out in therapy. 




 Yeah. I do. Funny you should reply today. I was about to post an update. 









 Imagine having hype even though there were only 14 characters. It was still rather awesome. The game feels so much better compared to then.

 Well, this is a strange question to answer. Japanese cards are for the OCG, while most other languages are part of the TCG. Now, you may use foreign cards as long as you have a separate copy of the card (outside of your deck). This offers an immediate credible translation to prevent cheating or dishonesty.

However, if you're in the TCG, you CANNOT use OCG cards in your deck under any circumstances. This goes both ways. If Japanese cards were allowed in the TCG, they would probably be a lot more.

These are the rules for large sanctioned events. Your locals may handle it differently depending on a number of factors. I would first ask your judges, then make sure any opponents you face don't mind. But, always have an English copy ready. 




 Thanks. Don't be surprised if you get something tomorrow. I have been talking with the same people for way too long. It's driving me back up a wall. 




 Holy shit. Way to go Kaspersky. 




 It's actually not mechanically impossible. Two monsters with the same attack battling doesn't ebd in 0 damage, it sends in no damage. It's a weird concept.

Think of it this way, damage has to be felt in a value. The value of 0 cannot be delt. When we say no damage, it means there technically is no value to deal to either player.

Two more interesting bits is that a direct attack if 0 atk also doesn't set a value for damage. Also, two monsters attacking with 0 atk doesn't destroy either monster. 




 ... I'm not kidding. My friends actually believe Nintendo bought P:M. 




 There's a rumor in my small community that Nintendo bought Project M and is halting its development and that no new versions will ever come out. How the hell did this rumor happen? I immediately checked here and on the game's page and found nothing hinting that it was true.

I even had one guy tell me since no new versions were coming that he wanted his money back (that was used to buy a flash drive and SD card, I didn't sell him P:M) because no new versions were coming out.

Where the hell could this rumor be coming from? 




  "When I first showed off the new Zelda game on the Wii U, it seemed everyone was very excited and started proclaiming that a Zelda game had at last become open world! Zelda games have always allowed you to roam and explore a huge world.

 "What's changed now is that the hardware has progressed to the point that you can now explore this vast world seamlessly; the underpinning of the game hasn't changed."

I can't wait for people to misinterpret this and say stuff like, "Oh, that means we're not getting the game we wanted. We're getting the same shitty linear game from last time." 




 Gerudo Desert in TP didn't have a lot in it. And never a lot of things at the same time. 




 Hair cleaner is sort of the same way. Most of this "cleaner" shit that promises better looking skin or hair is actually mostly comprised of stuff that can't actually do anything for us. 




 I really wish "leaks" would finally just be seen as a fucking joke on the internet. Isn't there anyone else who never takes a leak seriously? 




 Okay. Just making sure I understood!

 Have you ever heard of a slow news day? I attempted suicide and told the story a few days ago, there's the link to it in case you want to read about that.

http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/2vnyia/i_attempted_suicide/

Now my local news station is hooked on my suicide attempt. Local channels have been buzzing the feed with how I starved for twelve days. How will people treat me when I leave my house? Will they see me the same? In one hand, I hold anticipation of the pity and uplifting comments I might get. The other simply holds dread for the ones that will look at me differently. As if I'm a freak that don't belong.

But I sort of feel that way. The last thing I need is for people to treat me like a complete satanist. If you couldn't tell, the town is highly superstitious. It makes me more than just glad that they didn't tell the town my reasoning for attempting. I faked the answer anyway. The real reason would sound absurd to them.

My chosen method of deteriorating my inner being was supposedly the biggest reason they are covering this. Supposedly nobody else tries to starve themselves to death. Please, do not call me asking if you can order me a pizza.

My friends are throwing an "alive party" for me next weekend. Kind of can't wait for that. Then again, I sort of don't want to go. I dread the possible mockery and a huge buffet of food being shoved down my throat through a funnel.

My therapist is calling me every four hours to make sure I have something to eat. My parents have been cooking every day now. Sure, eating sodium noodles is better than nothing, but I almost died of starvation. They don't want me dying from what I eat. How ironic that would be. Am I using that word right?

So I started looking at that cipher again. Yeah, I wouldn't be posting here if this wasn't about something weird going on. Let me correct myself. I tried looking at the cipher. The url I found it out doesn't work anymore. It worked the entire time I was suicidal. Can anyone else see if it works? Just as a warning, if you're afraid of the stranger parts of the web, I wouldn't want you to look.

cipherthecipherfor.schl.com/hotline/cipher#underground.

I took it straight from my bookmarks, so It should be correct. I even tried adding http://www. before it.

I'm just wondering if its just me of it its being taken down. 




 dank? 




 I don't doubt it. I have a friend with an LG TV. Probably the sexiest definition I've ever seen. 




 1. Make good vines. Don't skimp out on the production quality. There are many tiny things you can do to make your vine look a little better. If you're doing a voice-over in particular, don't do it in a setting where you see black bars running up and down the screen. Get a good view of the screen and don't make it sound like you're afraid of waking people up. If someone screams, make them scream instead of a fucking little whisper scream.

  There's a particular voiceover I've watched probably more than 100 times myself.

2. Make vines that do loop. This sounds obvious, but it's actually a really good method. I've probably put in more than 40 loops in the "What's that" "Amnesia Spray" vine I saw. It's a simple loop, but it works.

3. Follow others. This sounds like a cheap tactic, but people do look into the following list of funny viners to see who they think is also funny and/or talented. And they look in the followed by list to see others that are into the same type of vines. So follow people who do vines similar to yours. Every once in a while, you can unfollow and refollow to put yourself at the top of the list for more exposure. It's not illegal, it's not hacking, and it's much more ethical than following channels that follow you just because you're following them (follow 4 follow channels).

4. If you cheat and use Vine Client or some other method of uploading edited vines, use a better camera than your phone. And learn/obtain better editing software if you can. It's simple, but it goes a long way.

5. Send your vines to your friends. Yeah, I'm serious. I have friends who skip my vines unless I tell them that I uploaded a new one. And most of the time, your friends' followers are your followers. So make sure they revine any vines that they really like from your page. 




 Well, if LG rolled with the good ideas and implemented them in their own unique and innovative way, that would be awesome. Sadly, it's less likely to happen. 




 You sound like an elitist piece of shit too. I've never fucking played the game. But I never will. I'll never fucking play a game that conditions me to want to play all day and tells me I'm not allowed to. That's pretty much the definition of shitty business practices. 




 I'm guessing Apple is tired of Samsung's shit. 




 Forgive me, but I've never heard of a game of solitaire that costs you extra money to play more than 3 times in 1 day. And solitaire decides where all cards are at the start instead of deciding what card is which as you reveal them. Yeah, solitaire is Unwinnable sometimes, but that isn't the creator's fault. That's more of a fault of the game's design that cannot be changed. But Candy Shit Does have a design than can be changed. They COULD make it so the game could detect un-winnable boards and tweak the RNG. But they don't. They would fucking love for you to get 10 unwinnable boards so you decide to pay 5 dollars to play an extra round that day. 




 And if I remember, the game market crashed once partly due to advertising and box art that were way too realistic and far beyond what the games actually looked like. People became so fucking tired of ads and box arts lying to them. 




 This is just pathetic. It's a ducking RNG puzzle that sometimes might not even spawn a winnable state. It just preys on poor pathetic loser phone owners who really have nothing better to do than be too frustrated with RN-Jesus to even care about their wallet. 




 The shape and size of the port is standardized. What's in the cord technically isn't. 




 I don't really support the micro USB being a standard thing. Not all cords are created equal. And, unfortunately, when you mix and match cords to devices, you could end up with cords that don't work any more or too much power being related to a device causing potential harm. This is likely more to do with Nintendo protecting their system. Believe it or not, I've lost electronic devices to using cords from 3rd parties or other devices. 




 How much do you want for it? 




 How much did you get that for? And how much do you want for it? 




 Luckily, I have more than 6 SD cards. So I can just install this on a spare. Wish me luck. 




 That's nice. I've been at this for since Melee. And even I haven't achieved a 100% L-cancel rate. 




 Please read the rules. 




 As supposed to Super Mario Bros where you went right and jumped over obstacles? It doesn't get much more linear than that. 




 She saved kittens. This is now my favorite good girl Gina meme. 




 The seller has informed us that you started demanding progress on the card only 12 hours after you paid. Users sending out over the weekend is a common thing. Sellers taking 1-2 days to send is also a common thing. Active traders often make as many deals as they can in those days so they can make a single trip to the post office.

If you needed your card(s) urgently, you should have made that clear beforehand and have been willing to cover for shipping.

I'm sorry, but your feedback is void. /u/hgxarcher will not be held accountable. 




 Every character already has Powershielding which provides a way to counter something providing 0 shield stun. Yeah, powershielding is rarely used and is frame perfect, but Smash is filled with rare events and frame-tight abilities.

And I'm not quick to put "gimmick" onto something. I know I get frustrated whenever any character is given something cool, everyone rushes to call it some sort of game-ruining gimmick or some sort of gimmick the character relies on. So far, I have yet to see anyone actually rely on a character's new ability.

Now, despite all of that, this mechanic looks extremely defensive and seems to encourage defensive gameplay. Part of the goal of Project M is to create a game where offensive is more favorable than defensive. I don't see how this parry being implemented across the cast would favor the game becoming a fast-based offensive game. 




 If it were true, then the scalpers win. 




 I assume either one of them got caught cheating, or one of them doesn't trust the other not to cheat. In either case. that relationship is heading to a halt. 




 Some of you will know me for the post that almost nobody could read. Here's a link in case you don't know what I'm talking about.

http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/2u6af1/i_was_told_posting_this_somewhere_public_was_the/

Don't worry, I'm not posting anything like that again. I've learned my lesson, and it drove me near to death's cold hand.

I tried starving myself to death. Alone, isolated, and hungry, I collapsed from hunger 12 days into the fast. I was absolutely prepared to die, but I woke up mere hours later in the hospital. I gave my family an extreme heart attack. They asked why I did it, and I told them the whole story.

A few weeks ago, I met a girl online. It was through her older sister. On YouTube, she left a comment on one of my videos saying it made her day and that she had been contemplating suicide as well. Two days later, she decided against it.

It wasn't just chatting with me. She liked the company she had at home which also convinced her, and it included her sister. When the girl and I were talking on Skype, she had to step away. Her little sister filled in for her. She and I shared pictures and decided to be boyfriend and girlfriend after just an hour of chatting.

She stayed on social media for as long as she could just to see if I would log on. I would go on just to talk to her. But, suddenly, she just vanished from social media. Her older sister said she had committed suicide herself. A knife through the stomach. Bled to death.

Despite telling my family all of this, I conveniently left out the part about writing a cipher and trying to reach her through a public message. Who the hell would believe that? I don't even believe she heard me anymore.

I was told all my life that people who commit suicide neither go to heaven nor hell. Somewhere different. A special limbo of unforgiving nothingness I guess. I wanted to say a proper goodbye.

I found a cipher online. If I encrypted a letter to her and posted it somewhere public, she would get the message as soon as someone could decipher it. The rules were simple. People had to see it publicly and I couldn't tell anyone is was a cipher, I couldn't tell anyone to decipher it, and I couldn't give anyone the solution. The last rule is I could only post it to one website and only once on that website.

I posted to reddit. Other sites were no good since I had no friends to see it, and they wouldn't care. And then they would know about my online relationship. The creepypasta subreddit was perfect. I would have someone decipher it and not think I was serious.

But I still wanted to see her. My poor logic clouded my better judgment. The foggy road led to one place for all suicides. All suicides lead to Rome? If I was dead, I was going to see her. That's how it worked in the way I thought about it. But I'm not brave enough to plunge a knife through my heart or jump off a building.

And now my memory of the cipher feels fuzzy. Everytime I think about it, I seem to remember it less, and it causes me to feel desperate to see her. Ill be in therapy for a while to get over this. This bottle inside me needed to be open. 









 That's what you get when you try to upscale from 240p to 5k. 




 Unless it was your unmarried virgin uncle. 




 Jigglypuff. They never took puff seriously until I started playing with her. Heck, I even have a few friends that still don't take her seriously and just think I'm showing off by winning with a "trash character". The more they practice, the more they get frustrated that they somehow cannot beat me even when I use what they think is a bad character.

It kind of helps that one of them is so predictable, I can always call when he's about to dash attack. 




 Hazy Flame Ghostrick Frogs 




 Why? to announce another fetch-quest filled free-world RPG? 




 All is fair in love and war. And this is a competition between those who are accepted to compete. And if you bring the best deck, are the best player, and played the best that day, then you haven't done anything unfair.

If you'd really like to make some of them feel better, just help them when they ask for it. Give advice, hand out some cards you don't want/need, and just get along with them all around.

If my locals was full of shit players, you'd bet I'd be doing this. 




 It's just regular headphones with a cheaply manufactured chip that runs sound through the equalizer. Headphones are hardware. Beats isn't. 




 Well, I knew quite a few of these. Pretty much the only one I didn't know what effect of Fire arrows on gossip stones. 




 They own beats. Which isn't a hardware technology. Beats is a proprietary equalizer setting. That's right, an equalizer setting. So, if you knew the settings it used, you could go into the equalizer of any music player and have it for free. But nobody will know because it's hidden away by dr dre. 




 They basically admitted to doing what we all thought Kinnect on Xbox one was going to do. 




 There used to be something like that implemented at /r/YGOSales. It was combined with the eBay thread. Suffice to say, the quick-trade feature was never taken advantage of. Would be doubtful that any more than you would want to take advantage of it on /r/YGOBinders. 




 Well, make it hard to get out, but easy to deal with. So let's say it was a level 5. This basically means most search cards will not be able to grab it. Not to mention it needs to be tribute summoned or special summoned by a different card's effect.

Now let's assume this card has to be balanced around the assumption that your opponent has no hand traps. What's the most born damage you see a burn player deal on the first hand. It's around 2000. But, if you assume this player will be abusing equip cards, you have to factor Mage power and United we stand which could potentially give this card about 1500 attack on the first turn on a good first hand. Or a lot more if you play lavals and rekindling. (On that note, don't make this a FIRE monster with 200 DEF.)

So if you take that 2000 and take away the 1500, I'd say it would have to have 500 or less attack. 




 I see way too many people make this mistake. If you're going to take the time to write a story or tell a story, make sure you don't give away any twists, especially the ending, in your title. You want to draw people in, not essentially tell them what's up so they can move on. You lose views and upvotes this way.

**Examples**

Title: I Live Along

The Twist: There's someone or something living with the author that he or she's afraid of.

Title: I Looked In The Mirror

The Twist: something involving a mirror world

Title: I Keep Getting Called

The Twist: The caller is someone he knows or knew from the afterlife or just someone torturing him for no good reason.

Title: This is a True Story

The Twist: It's not.

What other poor examples have you seen of titles in creepypastas? 




 Good. They don't deserve that money with the way they do their fucked up business. 




 That design is wrong. Go look at the file used in game. There is no line there. 




 The extra white line over "project" shouldn't be there. Change it, and promise that we can get proceeds to PMDT, and I'll buy some.

 Okay, I had been trying to defend it saying that it's an easy way of getting videos monetized since it's almost impossible through Google unless you have documents proving it's your video.

But this is just leaps and bounds over that line from questionable to bullshit. 




 Last time I did on this subreddit, everyone accused me of being a dick to the community. 




 In Smash 4, that would have done 18%. Lol. 




 Throw them off a boat. 




 Mango entered a 3.5 PM tourney? Which tourney? I'd like to see that. 




 My girlfriend plays Zelda. Pretty damn good too. She spent hours just trying to get down her tricks in 3.02. And yet, she's the only one I don't see whining about her new tools. 




 Edgeguard better maybe. 




 A lot of people say it is bad for P:M because it supposedly nerfed everyone to the point that only the Melee top tiers are viable. I simply don't see it. When characters win and top multiple tournaments, there's two factors going into it. The first is how good the character actually is compared to the rest of the cast. The other is the high amount of representation that these "Melee top tiers" get just because the playstyle from Melee somewhat transfers over well. This would be true for Fox, C. Falcon... and nobody else. I can't think of another Melee top tier that I see dominating tournaments.

Think about it. Nobody really knew how good Mewtwo was in 3.02 until EmuKiller showed everyone how far Mewtwo's new design could be developed. Until then, Mewtwo was severely lacking in representation. Afterwards, Mewtwo flocked all over with Mewtwo making headway in many tournaments.

People love to cry out that the spacies and other top tiers are immune to nerfs. But if you, just for one example, f***ing read Fox's change log, his upsmash was severely reduced, likely leaving Pikachu to have the absolute best upsmash out of the Melee veterans.

But a whole lot of changes, not necessarily nerfs, were done to each character so that ONLY PEOPLE WITH IN DEPTH KNOWLEDGE of the game would pull off combos above 3-4 hits. But guess what, the people who know their characters the most and in the most numbers just happen to be f***ing Melee top tiers. They already have an intimate knowledge of how their character can generally pull off combos while the rest of the cast has to play catch up with their combo game. In 3.02, there were a lot of changes to make sure that certain moves easily converted into other moves for semi-easy combos. Now, all of that work has basically been reversed along with universal standards that ended up nerfing every character.

This is the first patch where characters weren't developed in a vaccuum but all studied and tweaked until they all  met the project goal. And since that included nerfs, everyone just wants to fucking cry that Melee top tiers are good because they're immune to nerfs. But they're not immune to nerfs. They simply already fit inside a Melee environment by fitting every point of the project goal.

This isn't a game meant to make the Melee veterans suck. So forget it if that's what you're expecting (that goes for anyone). Project M 3.5 is a great patch. If you want to whine that you can no longer beat your friend who keeps playing that spacie, get the f*** over it. Get better. And to quote Isai, "Don't get hit." 




 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Is Apple trying to be google? Does Apple want google's action? 




 Let's do it America. I'd totally put bacon on my money! 




 You mind posting screenshots showing the refund *and* that you told him that before he left the feedback? 




 It's be quite a bit for shipping. You cool with that? 




 Can you explain your behavior pretending you know nothing about feedback? Care to explain why we don't seem to have any request to verify your thread? You have 24 hours to respond. 




 Gasp, a brony that watches spongebob. 




 Wasn't this common for too long? Companies able to pay Adblock, and if Adblock sees that the ads don't harm or intrude on the experience in the website then Asblock would block those?

I thought this was already a thing. 




 I'm really trying to get rid of as much as possible at the same time. 




 Wait, so they have the best running back at 1 yard away. Wouldn't running it seem like the obvious choice? When it comes to trying to work around what your opponent is doing, would t passing it in seem like a clever idea? 




 I couldn't imagine every character getting this. It looks so gimmicky, and the game is already a crouch-cancelling war at low %. I do think Yoshi would be a great candidate for this, especially since it also adds air-parrying. I would love to see how that affects Yoshi as a character. 




 That sounds right up my ally. 




 And? The total value of this stuff comes out to ~$115, and I won't charge the WHOLE value of shipping. I never do. 




 Easy mode? I don't see you learning 40 matchups. 




 [Here's what's for sale](http://imgur.com/a/ePOJs)

Shipping would be charged AFTER I shipped and have a receipt showing how much it costs. You would only pay $80 up front. If you want, I can send 1 portion for $50, then the rest for $30 after, then we'll see how much shipping was after.

But, seriously, I need the money, and I don't need these cards anymore. 




 Wait, so you had to post this because you probably couldn't get to a computer. Yet, this is being documented and posted supposedly after you've had therapy sessions and police search through your room. You must have had access to a computer between then and now somehow. And you have a smartphone. Couldn't you have posted this with that?

Anyway, never minding the somewhat apparent logical error, I hope you figure out what's going on as safely as possible. Can you hire a private investigator? 




 Okay, let's get another point out of the way, because many users here don't seem to have a certain concept through their thick-ass skulls.

KONAMI PREFERS TO SLIM DOWN THEIR BANLIST, NOT MAKE IT BIGGER!!!

So if keeping one card banned (broken or not) allows us to keep 2 or more cards that are much more generic and less powerful completely off the banlist, KONAMI will do that.

Stratos being banned allows so many other cards to be at 3.

So combined with the fact that HEROs have enough search, your argument that "you can't summon him more than once" is shit, because you can summon him about as many ways as you can summon Deneb.

And Stratos has exceptionally high attack power for being so damn powerful in his effects. 




 If it turns out it's a text message, I would offer them an ultimatum. If they don't want to hand over their phone, they must read the last 15 messages in the conversation.

If they're receiving a call, they can put it to speaker phone so we can all hear what's too important to wait until after class, or they hand it over.

Yes, I would be the hugest dick as a teacher. 




 Because maybe some people don't like to be public or whore out for attention when they donate to charity. 
























 I actually agree with this guy somewhat about the cards he says is bad. The build he posted is pretty good. But it would need some updating since that deck was pretty much built for a year ago. 




 Cyber Dragon Zwei sucks. You don't need it. 3 CD, 3 Core, and 3 drei is all I've ever needed as Cyber Dragons go. So remove the Zweis, the Jinzos, and whatever that last monster is at the end. You just don't need them. 




 Remind me again where I can get a build with Ridley added in! 




 If we never listened to music, we'd probably never have volume levels dawg. 









 "I'd just like to take a moment to say I shouldn't be on the jury because I'm sleeping with the defendant, Drew Carey." 




 "Introducing Tyler Perry's..." *rips up paper* "Let's be honest. It doesn't matter what we put here. It's gonna suck." 




 If it was a dragon, then it'd be easy to integrate. But one deck having better use for red-eyes because it's a dragon type doesn't automatically mean red-eyes would be an inherently worse card. In fact, Dragon Rulers with Red-eyes would be even worse than a dragon-ruler deck without red-eyes. You know, when you're actually building it with the purpose of trying to build the strongest deck possible.

Quite frankly, your point is invalid since Dragon Rulers wouldn't want red-eyes in their deck anyway. 




  The whole reason I didn't get MM3D is because my N64 copy still works fine

So does mine. But I still got MM3D. The new game is amazing. The bosses were revamped, there are two new fishing holes, and a few items were changed around. Also, there are 7 bottles, improved design choices, and more often than not, we got what is in the Japanese N64 version instead of the USA N64 version. 




 Because Evolve claimed to be so much more than it was, costs $60 to play a game developed for freemium format, and has over $200 in DLC AFTER you buy the game. 




 I probably would. There would probably be a lot of decks that would benefit from something like this. Plus, it would obsolete all normal monsters with 5 or more stars with less than that much attack. I.E. Red-eyes Black Dragon.

 Replace the marketing team with one that will focus toward avid gamers in the making sure people know the Wii U is not just a tablet or accessory.

 Will this work with off-brand adapters in the near future? 




 So... if this was able to support the off-brand 3rd party ones, the ones that try to look like the official one, that would be great. I tried just to see if it would work with my girlfriend's adapter. (Her parents did the buying, which was a stupid decision since they don't have a fucking clue when it comes to electronics.) 




 Said the person resorting to insults.

I'd really like to see anybody here complaining about the size make the same OS with all the same 1:1 features and have it be significantly smaller than what iOS right now. Really, if they can do it, go ahead. I know I can't do it, but if I really wanted to complain, it would be to Apple's feedback page, not to strangers on a place where insulting me gets you nowhere, points don't matter, and nothing productive gets done.

iOS 9 is rumored to be a stability and slimming down of the operating system, so let's hope that's true. If the code really is sloppy, maybe a huge stability update will deal with it.

In the mean time, you can stop trying to prove that you're intelligent to people don't fucking know or care about you. 




 I wouldn't say this set is that good. It's mostly fox doing the same old same old fox stuff on a Lucario that sort of gets a decent string every now and then. (I'll admit, better strings than I could pull off on Lucario, but not the best strings I've seen.)

Very last game was a bit intense, but outside of that, nothing I found too extraordinary. 




 Might want to work on the UI. Maybe it makes sense when you touch things and get the hang of things, but right now, just at a glimpse, it doesn't make sense.

The one I'm using right now on iOS, [MLP CCG Assistant](http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/dd/be/e7/ddbee787-03d0-db4a-6fb2-0a3d28d992a2/screen406x722.jpeg) takes care of both players. It's clear, it's concise, and there was no confusion in learning how to use it. And starting a turn even gives the turn player the proper amount of AT depending on the winning player's score. 




 "Honey, please, I'm in the middle of teaching Sex Ed." 




 Combine a lot of megabytes, you get a gigabyte. That's kind of how it works. There's a virtually uncountable list of features in a lot of these operating systems. We're getting to the point that anything you can do on a computer, you can do on your phone. So why do we expect the OS to be smaller just because it's on a smaller form factor? That's completely absurd.

And operating system is an operating system. And they are all just tools to move files and manage/use applications. In that respect, Windows and OS X are just the same with different skins. Well, each with their own unique file handling/productivity enhancing features, but that's beside the point. So how do you assume I don't know shit if I'm comparing operating systems? Check the fucking mirror. 




 Long story short: My girlfriend attempted suicide. I found a cipher online that convinced me I could reach her by posting my message publicly and having someone decipher it. I attempt suicide shortly after. My sister goes through something similar. We land on the local small town news. Other suicides around town follow shortly after. I go to console one of the families and see the cipher in a painting on the wall. I want to take it away, but the deceased's mother wanted to keep it because it was the last painting he did.

So now I'm here, writing what will be my final warning to you.

The mother that held on to her sons painting posted on one of her social media accounts yesterday. She committed suicide shortly after. This is what her post contained.

 Nz Tup, O'n dunoph vu tii zua.

 Vjiz xupv cimoiwi ni, cav O lpux Omm tii zua. atv ci qevoipv. Zuas qeopvoph nelit ni nott zua nusi epf nusi. Xjev ot ov Ovt tu cieavogam. Omm etl zua eheop xjip O hiv vjisi.

 Tov vohjv txiivjiesv.

I put it through a reverse cipher thanks to a few online tools. Here is what it actually said.

 My Son, I'm coming to see you.

 They wont believe me, but I know Ill see you. Just be patient. Your painting makes me miss you more and more. What is it? Its so beautiful. Ill ask you again when I get there.

 Sit tight sweetheart.

When I visited the house, I passed myself off as family just to see the inside. An investigator told me that she had bashed her own head against the painting her son had made. When a shard flew off, she picked it up and jammed it in her throat.

No sign of forced entry or struggle. A suicide by anybody's analysis. I couldn't believe it. But, I fucking knew it. This is how suicide spreads. A fucking demon gets into our head and makes us believe that we can reach that person again. It's a siren's song.

Dont seek the suicide cipher. 




 Guys, there are rich bastards out there already spending this amount of money on watches and jewelry that don't do anything.

You don't have to spend 10k on it. You don't have to buy it at all. But if you really want one, they'll be as low as $350. So really, people, stop losing your shit over something you don't actually care about. 




 Because there are apps included with the OS and features that become universal such as copy/paste, typing, highlighting, showing the time and status bar. That's like asking why is OSX or Windows 7 so huge when it's just a finder to get to applications. 




 I suppose there should also be lawsuits about storage devices promising a certain amount, and you figure out that what you got is actually only 98% of the advertised amount.

No, really. I'm tired of people complaining that their 8 GB drive doesn't hold their 7.5 GB file because there's actually only 6.9 GB on the drive. My 500 GB hard drive doesn't even have 500GB. It's actually around 490 GB. It's frustrating.

In case these companies haven't heard, a Gigabyte is 1024 Megabytes, not 1000. 




 I do agree that active members alone won't solve any problems by itself. It does take a step in the right direction with the right kind of activity. We could have 1,000 members posting here every day, but if only 1 is submitting good content, and nobody is voting on what's good and what's bad, we're just going to continue getting swarms of bad content. This place becomes a mine field with the occasional treasure that takes too much effort to search for.

I personally like your idea of getting the posters involved in submitting vines they make and using this place to promote their page. Why isn't this a real thing yet?

Submit your ideas in a mod message, and we'll start discussing them.

Thank you.

 Hazy Problem Fixer

Spell Card

 This card cannot be destroyed, banished or removed from the field by any other card's effect. On your opponent's 3rd end phase after this card was activated, send this card to the Graveyard. Once per turn; you can Special Summon 1 "Hazy Flame" monster from your deck. If there is a "Hazy Flame" monster in your graveyard during your draw phase, you can add it to your hand in addition to your normal draw.

Hazy Flame monsters take way too much to get their power plays which can be stopped or undone quickly, so they need to be able to regenerate advantage, make plays without using too many hand resources, and they need to be able to get cards out on the field. Not to mention, it sucks that Hazy Pillar is stupid weak to removal making Hazy Flames weak to that.

 Then why don't you do a bit of help and actually report spam? As a new mod, I'll be on from time to time to make sure any shit that isn't actually vine related is removed. And we're not trying to be all funny vines. We are trying to promote all areas of vine. 




 I hope you and more people start a habit of regular voting. It's the only way to make sure we're on a path of improving the content for everybody.

 This post was removed since it wasn't a vine or a youtube compilation of vines.

* Vines are 6 seconds or less.
* The content was far longer than 6 seconds
* The content was not compilations of 6 second videos 




 The mods here have been disappointed in the lack of voting in this subreddit. This sub has more than 10,000 subscribers. Almost 11,000. Vine is a very popular trend right now even with its changing nature and that it's two year run already settling its place in social media.

The fact is, some of out top posts aren't even garnering the amount of upvotes that some subreddits get with fewer subscribers. Far fewer subscribers. Let me give you some examples.

[Example 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/vine/comments/2y4qi6/7_days_in_6_seconds/): This is a very well made vine. Not to mention a perfect loop which is a difficult trick in vine. This is the kind of think I would give a like. Maybe not revine since I only revine specific vines, but that's beside the point.

18 points, 83% upvotes. That means there's at most 22 votes on it.

[Example 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/vine/comments/2y2com/checking_your_bank_statement_after_a_night_out/): This vine has a theme that does rely on reading the caption or description, but luckily that is put into the vine itself instead of assuming you would read it. This makes it good to put in compilations since youtube compilations rarely put the information of a vine. Definitely something I find funny and gave an upvote. But...

25 points, 80% upvotes. That means there's at most 31 votes on it.

This is pitiful. Are there really less than 40 users here willing to upvote and downvote? Don't be afraid to downvote things you don't find entertaining. Or things that are just distasteful. We're not telling you to upvote everything. But with 10,868 (at the time I'm writing this) readers, we should be able to get a few hundred votes on each one. But we're averaging less than .003% of our userbase actively participating.

Things you should upvote:

* Vines you like
* Vines with themes you want to see more of
* Vines that are funny
* Vines with creativity
* Vines that show talent
* Good YouTube compilations
* Text posts about vine or asking for help

Things you should downvote:

* Vines that aren't funny, creative or show off talent
* Vines that are offensive or distasteful
* Troll vines
* NSFW vines
* YouTube posts that don't credit viners
* Things that aren't vine

DO NOT...

* Downvote Youtube compilations unless they are poor or don't give credit
* Downvote vines just because you don't like the user
* Mass downvote every post just to troll

Please be more active. We could make this a great and fun subreddit to visit. And we wouldn't mind getting some of these posts on the front page. We're not expecting you to make us a default sub. As cool as that would be, that's a bit too much pressure and really only goes to top quality subreddits. We aren't there yet. We're nowhere near being on the same level of many other subreddits.

So if we just all make a habit of visiting /r/vine and upvoting a few posts that we like and downvoting a few that we don't, we can improve the quality of our posts and userbase. Once a week, it's easy, and it takes only a few minutes and you'll find content more enjoyable as you go along. After all, that would mean you're actually voting on the content. 




 They go to download then they're done. Torrents are p2p, aren't they? Why would they need to go through a server? 




 Whether you're the top or not, you need your servers up. Don't see how being top would magically strain it. 




 How many STDs did I get from my cheating ex-girlfriend?... Oh, shit! 




 [Here's a link to what I previously talked about](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/2xp7fc/survivors_guilt/)

Like I said, more suicide attempts started surfacing in my town after my sister and I both had attempted. In such a small town, it was big news. But I wasn't prepared for this. Remember that cipher I found that made me think I could reach my ex-girlfriend? In case you don't, you can [read about that](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/2u6af1/i_was_told_posting_this_somewhere_public_was_the/). In other words, we'll get to that.

I looked at the house of one of the families. After my sister and I attempted suicide, three successful suicides happened nearby. Almost too spooky to be coincidence. Government has called to tell news stations to stop broadcasting. They think its encouraging suicides.

But, I know suicide is not a way to get attention. What good is attention when youre dead? Seek help, dont seek the cipher.

I found a cipher to try to talk to my ex-girlfriend who had killed herself after three weeks of our long-distance relationship. After I stopped thinking about suicide, I couldnt see the cipher anymore.

On the wall of one of the houses, though, the cipher hung from a frame. The parents of the deceased put it on the wall as a memorial. He was a painter, apparently. Something I would have never known if none of this had happened. I asked if I could see it. I wanted to sneak it away from them so they wouldnt look at it. They kept such a close eye on it since it was the last painting the deceased had painted.

Maybe it wont have adverse effects though. There's no instructions, and it looked like it was painted from memory. It was barely close enough to be recognizable.

Im stuck just waiting and hoping that nothing happens. Regardless, I'm continuing my therapy. These posts and my therapy talks help me take that wreched image away from my consciene. 




 "Alright, PUSH Mrs. Johnson." 




 I love watching both HC and Markiplier. Mark's very funny and has fun commentary more often than not. And it's mesmerizing to see HC simply not give a fuck. Seriously, he may jump or pull back every now and then (and that's *not* a joke for the internet to enjoy), but this guy just doesn't get scared. 




 So was I. But then something completely different showed up at my door. 




 He is just one guy who makes the games in a matter of months. While we may think of a while as a few months in the game industry as we're used to waiting years between certain games, He's able to write out a new scenario, new mechanics, and work them out in a matter of months. So he may have taken a few weeks out of his life to chill. But since he has the basics of the engine down, he can make it much faster than it took him to make the first one. 




 This game definitely requires a bit of luck on top of knowing what you're doing. And figuring out what you're doing is difficult. I'm still having trouble getting past night 3. 




 He's  UX expert. Not a videographer.

 My girlfriend was browsing random subreddits. She stumbled upon this subreddit and let out the biggest squeal because she knows how much I love Whose Line Is It Anyway. 




 I cant warn you enough that if you do feel the need or desire to end your life, stay away from those thoughts. Surround yourself by those around you. They definitely care. And if you fail an attempt at suicide like my sister or me, you would probably know that you never feel more loved until after youve accepted that youre still alive.

My theraputic rant aside, there seems to have been three suicides in neighboring cities.  In this context, you're likely going to think I'm crazy, but I'm considering everything I've been through. 

* *[First Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/2u6af1/i_was_told_posting_this_somewhere_public_was_the/)*
* *[Second Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/2vnyia/i_attempted_suicide/)*
* *[Third Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/2w37oa/i_made_the_news/)*
* *[Forth Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/2wkgih/my_little_sister_is_in_the_hospital/)*

The shorter version is that I had a girlfriend who committed suicide. I put a ciphered message to her online hoping to get the message to her in purgatory. Thoughts of the cipher drove me to thinking I could be with her again if I committed suicide. My sister went through the same thing with one of her closest friends and attempted suicide shortly after I did. The pandemic is making the news. There are have been more suicides.

Theyre not releasing any names or locations, but I wanted to let people know that now is the time to let everyone know that you love them. 

Im hoping the suicides and attempts stop. I feel responsible. Since I made the local news and got so much attention, it has probably put the idea into a lot of others heads. They all have one other thing in common: these people supposedly all lost someone to suicide in recent days. The news has been calling me asking me to speek out, but Im not sure if that would yeild any success. I might anyway since Im already speaking out against it here.

I am going to visit the families over the weekend. Or maybe just in the next few days. Its not final, but I hope to find something that shows that it wasnt me. Hopefully, the investigators didnt take away absolutely everything.

Wish me luck. Oh, who am I kidding? What am I possibly going to find?

Nothing but guilt. 




 Wasn't aware I was down voted. People can hate all they want. Doesn't mean I'm wrong. 




 Figured this out long ago. I bet a lot of us did. Nevertheless, congratulations on that find. Not many people would find something like that on their own. A bit of an oversight by the dev team originally. But whatever. I guess it was there for those who were a bit smarter than others.

 To post something like that on something as public as vine or reddit is just distasteful.

 Typical PC life span for mid to low end models is 1-3 years. All Macs are expected to perform well for 5 or more years. 




  other PCs have the same technical specs and reviews but at half the price.

If you want to take specs on paper and say well, these computers both have 2.0 Ghz with 2Gigs of ram and 200GB of data storage, then yes, you'd be right. But these aren't defining factors of how well a computer performs, especially when two different computers use two different operating systems.

Apple's operating system, upon being user friendly, having tons of productivity enhancing features, as well as multiple desktops which somehow still evades windows programmers, gets away with being able to accomplish the same things based on low-powered low-bloat open-source code. When you run windows on a Mac, you start to notice that the battery life drops since windows does require more power to run more often than not.

Having better specs on paper never guarantees better performance. When you look at the world of mobile phones, android phones just fucking *love* to tout that they have more Ghz or ram or cores than Apple's latest iPhone. But, you notice they still have basic issues such as scrolling not being quite as smooth as it looks in commercials, or their massive megapixel cameras not looking better by any margin than any other camera with 1 or 2 less megapixels.

Get reviews from power users, people who go on forums and debate these. Those are much more valuable than a user review left 2 days after they got it. When you're using a computer for just email and facebook, suddenly, any $300 crapper is going to be just what the doctor ordered and warrent a good review from the first two days.

But wait until there's issues with the computer. This is where Apple stands out. If you experience issues early on, it's confusing on who to go to for support. Best buy? Dell? Some different computer service? Microsoft? What if Dell and Best Buy say "It's a software problem, go to Microsoft", but Microsoft tries to pin it on Best Buy or Dell?

Apple is Apple is Apple. The computer, both hardware and software, came from one company, and THAT'S the company you go to. (Note: Yes, the hardware comes from multiple companies like intel or amd or nvidia, but Apple has sold the hardware to you and takes responsibility for the defects you may experience early on.) If it's under warrentee, Apple will be perfectly happy to fix the problem for you, or find a solution should the problem be a bit more of hassle than anticipated. Hell, they were even so nice to flat-out replace my iPhone 5s when it had an abundance of cracks and a bend that prevented it from working. (Another note, that's from my own stupidity and mishandling. Take care of your items, you should never have to deal with cracks.)

 Oh my god. I look like Colin Mochrie 




 They really are desperate to keep their tyrannic choke hold on the necks and wallets of consumers. Seriously, saying "we can't change the new rules, so let's try to make sure nobody can enforce them" is basically saying "We know we're doing shit they wouldn't like and that consumers don't like, but we're hoping we can keep them stupid until we're retired with lots of their money in our pockets."

Fuck you Pai. Fuck you internet providers. Fuck everyone involved in letting the internet situation get as bad as it did. For fuck's sake, don't tell  us this bullshit how you need more money and tax cuts and that you can't innovate unless you're a fucking monopoly. There are service providers in other countries half as old as you are offering fiber speeds for dirt cheap compared to here and they're all doing just fine. And once the rest of America figures that out, they're gonna rip you a fucking new one. 




 "I'm not afraid of a machine gun. Are you kidding me?" 




 We are America, and so is Canada, but only we are considered American! 




 "I'm technically disease free" 




 So basically, the ISPs are mad that they have to follow rules now. They've basically been dodging monopoly lawsuits by 'competing' in only about 5% of existing US territory and failing to expand into any other territory where another ISP exists because the other ISP wouldn't let them use the same infrastructure.

The Internet providers are sueing for the privilege to charge content creators to get their data to us faster. They basically want to double dip american pockets and be allowed to offer us speeds lower than the maximum they're capable of. They really don't get the point. The point of the new rules is that anybody can use any equipment that is already built up so you can move in and compete with anybody else's service. It also states that you cannot offer priority to any content creators or double dip into america's pockets. 




 "Introducing Richard's Dick puffs! How many can fit in *your* mouth?" 




 "Colin Os. No hair in your cereal, guaranteed." 




 Bring on the fox players saying, "But it's not how melee did it." 




 This is pretty pathetic. The only reason it even changed is because of the outlier, Google Fiber. ISPs are still gouging our fucking eyes out just so we can download at 1/20th of the speed they're capable of offering (which wouldn't cost them any extra to let us have).

 You're not helping. You helped him make his account? So you know him in real life? Mods tread carefully around those who know each other in real life or claim to know each other as scammers have used duplicate accounts to try to vouch for themselves so that they can ruse others into unfair trades without getting their main account banned. This even goes for me and /u/lily247, which is why we both have verification that we're two separate people (on our feedback threads).

Please do not try to get involved in moderator affairs unless you have been asked to provide assistance. 




 I hope you're not useing the "average" or "highest' values, and that you're checking links to verify that Yugioh Prices wasn't making any errors. This is very much recommended. There is no way everything you have presented in the binder totals to more than $20 dollars. I have checked myself, I even have many of the same cards. They're all worth around $0.50. People don't buy for average price. 




 For the apps that aren't important or too frequently used, I do this. I leave Safari and Messages open. Sometimes even Vine. But things like the Guitar tuner, Whisper, Maps, I close those right when I leave the app until I'll need it again. 




 Please do not go through with this trade. This user has been reported to be fake and/or a scammer. 




 If you are not able to send immediately/next day, you should not be posting. 




 I hate to brake it to you, but the total price of the core is actually about $15. The entire binder combined has a value of about $25. You're really asking for too much. This drastic over-pricing will not be tolerated. You have a few hours to revise this listing. If it is not revised it will be removed, and your profile will be banned from all Yugioh subreddits. 




 Screen capture software? They probably have access to the videos, they edit them and export them optimized for vine, and they use something like vineclient. 




 I hope it will eventually be for sale for those who couldn't afford both versions.

 Set it to a resolution that has its height at 480 pixels. And if you can, play it in windowed mode, and only capture the window. In premiere, you'll be able to make a sequence with custom setting so the height and width is 480 pixels. Se the pixel aspect ratio to 1.0 so the true aspect ratio of the video is 1:1.

[This is what I'm using](http://i.imgur.com/e5sm7Ys.png). Preference options may vary depending on the version of premiere. I'm using CS4. 




 I'm actually very surprised about Skill Drain getting such a deep hit on the banlist. And, on behalf of my friend John, I'm saddened that the Dragon Rulers are really gone. He's been playing them since he could afford them. awe well, time for him to run Red-Eye Black Dragon. He's actually been trying to make a good Red-eyes Black Dragon deck for a while. That new support kind of makes up for it. 




 Vine doesn't support 60 FPS. You're probably just seeing a video that was shot and exported without frames blending together. 




 Don't capture in such a huge resolution. try recording originally at about 720x480. I know it sounds stupid, "Why wouldn't I record in HD". Trust me, the bigger you record, the more information you lose when downscaling which means the computer has to decide what to throw out, and it's not always a good decision.

And you're probably not seeing bad quality video. It's probably pretty damn good, but you're viewing it in a stretched resolution on your computer screen. Make sure you're viewing it at the original resolution.

Not to mention, I would never recommend Vegas Pro. I'd recommend Premiere if you can get your hands on it.

Check your pixel aspect ratio, make sure it's 1.0.

 Feel free to discuss things about the ban list. This can be what you want, what you think will happen, or joking about changes. This thread is to cut down on the amount of threads asking about the ban list.

**When will the ban list be out?**

Konami has not promised a reliable date for the ban list to be announced. For all we know, they're still playtesting to construct the new meta for April. There is no way of knowing exactly when it will be announced.

**Should I edit my deck when it comes out or wait until April 1st?**

That answer is up to you. Some players choose to edit as soon as possible to try to beat price spikes from cards that find a good fit in the new meta.

**Will [insert tournament here] be using the old or new banlist?**

This depends on a few factors. Who is holding it? When is it? Large sanctioned tournaments will always use the ban list that is in effect at that time, not the newest announced banlist. Some locals enforce new ban lists early, but this entire depends on who is making the decisions.

**Will [x card] be hit/nerfed/unbanned?**

We don't know

**What will be the top deck afterward?**

We don't know

**What cards should I get beforehand?**

We don't know. Hold off on purchases that try to predict the ban list. 




 For general purposes, there never is a reliable date for the new ban list. It comes out when it comes out.

 So, instead of building a new browser which would conform to the latest standards and strain for a high quality web browsing experience on par with Safari, Chrome, or Firefox, they're just going to rebrand it? And then still keep IE for some windows users? That's absurd. They should just kill it off and put a new browser on with a simple name. Perhaps *Super Highway*. I think that'd be a cool name for something that's supposed to access the information super highway.

But this really doesn't make me happy. Microsoft is too stubborn to just let Internet Explorer go because they have to have "compatibility". Internet Explorer already needed to jump through hoops to be compatible with the evolving and standardized web that it couldn't exactly keep up with.

 Wow. I love how everyone assumes I'm ignorant and start talking about how it's a market thing and not a technology thing. You alone aren't going to change the market. Nobody right now actually needs a battery that will last for 7 days without a charge. I doubt anybody's awake using their device for 7 days so that they couldn't plug it in when they're asleep. I can understand wanting an all-day battery life, but 7 days is pretty ridiculous.

The new macbook already has a logic board half the size of most laptops and uses the extra space for battery life. And they're trying to keep it thin and portable to be comfortable to carry and use. So if you want shit's battery to last longer, tell the corporations directly. Tell the engineer's. Don't tell reddit. Reddit can't do shit. 




 I seriously doubt it. Apple may be about standards but they still are about protection. And I don't want just anybody using just any low-watt or high-watt USB-C cable they find lying around and potentially ruining their phone's battery by using a mismatched charger.

What I do expect is, not too soon, that lightning's other end will be USB-C. 




 If you're running Dragon Rulers, you'd probably run Mythic Tree Dragon and Mythic Water Dragon. They can be searched with Tidal and Redox unlike Red-eyes which is a DARK and cannot be searched with any Dragon Ruler.

Mythic Tree and Water dragon synergize well with Tidal and Redox through their effect of special summoning and changing levels and even give the deck rank 8 options. Red-eyes does not. It's a normal monster that must be Normal (trubute) summoned (2 tributes) or SSed through a different card's effect, basically taking up deck room just to be able to SS Red-eyes.

And *my point* wasn't that the vanilla 2500 level 4 beater would obselete Red-eyes specifically 100% of the time. Of fucking course attribute and type play a factor. I was making an example. In decks that actually regularly use normal monsters, a 2500 beater at no tributes trumps just about any other option, especially options you need to tribute for that have fewer atk/def. By after a big play, who wouldn't want to just slap down a fucking 2500 beater for free no matter what type or attribute? 




 You should submit that idea to Apple and/or third party manufactures. If you could get someone to make that, Apple would likely have more people buying the new Macbook, and the manufacturer who makes it would be getting some happy business as well. 




 Okay, this guy has a good point, but it's not the point Apple sees in this device.

The new Macbook isn't designed for people who need a lot of ports. The new Macbook is designed for the most basic of users. It's designed for the grandmas and parents who *don't* have or use flashdrives to move things around. It's designed for people who *don't* use their computers for mass productivity. It's *not* for people who use more than just internet to check their daily feed every day. Macbook Air used to be the same way. The place I think they fucked up is the price point. It has less power than the Macbook air (I don't mean it's underpowered, it's not underpowered for its purpose), has fewer ports, isn't as portable, and they want $300 more for it.

Peoeple, shut the fuck up and stop complaining uselessly on the internet. If you really want one but don't think you'd be able to use it, FUCKING TELL APPLE. In case you haven't noticed, just about none of us can do anything about your bitch-ass boo-hoos over having only 1 port.

Apple's introducing a new product that's aimed to pave the way to get users to use fewer wires (be more confident and reliant on iCloud keeping files consistent across their devices), fewer discs, and it's pushing for new standards. It's an early product that *YOU DON'T NEED TO FUCKING BUY*. Early adopters will likely find many problems that the press will go fucking nuts over and trying to claim that Apple made a shit product based on the first batch. But that's what happens. You remember the retina Macbook Pros? They were extremely costly, sacrificed features for thinness and battery life, and had logic board problems when they first started rolling. Apple started ironing out those issues, and those who can actually use one and still be as fully productive as they were before are the ones getting it. The ones who need a thousand more ports just to be productive aren't the ones getting rMBPs and they're not going to be the ones getting the new Macbook. 




 When you make a battery that can do that, then be my guest and get it into these machines.

... Oh that's right. 




 I love your story. It's inspiring. Although, it could do without the "still out there" ending cliche. Just a thought. But, it's your story, and you tell it how you want it to be told.

 I kind of feel this way too. Plus, I think USB-C just looks cooler than other USB devices. And it would bring USB ports to 2.0 or later right? No more getting USB 1.0 ports on a comp that you thought had USB 2.0 ports. (Yeah, It's happened to me a bit.)

 I read the post. I'm just trying to point out, if playing Smash a bit slower gets you bored, maybe you should hang out with more spacie fags or just avoid playing against her. 




 As long as RNG is used properly, there's nothing wrong with g with it. "What direction should this random chicken go? RNG says 8, so northwest. Now where should it go?" And so on.

But crap like "should I totally miss this enemy again? RNG says 1, so yes. And it keeps saying 1."

And crap like "yeah, your enemy is totally gonna do his almost undodgeable move 3 seconds in instead of 60 seconds in."

There's a right and wrong time for RNG a, and it should always be balanced slightly in the player's favor if it's going to randomly effect difficulty. But, it should never affect if something is winnable. Tester totter around a difficulty level, but not randomly have some shit be really easy and some shot be absurdly difficult.

Candy Crush does it all fucking wrong, AND THEY DO THAT ON PURPOSE. Some people get stuck on level 1. Some on level 14. Some on 212. While some players just breeze past those and get stuck on levels 34 or 56 instead. Who cares? It's random. And King evil-company bitches want you to pay up every time the game randomly sticks you on a level.

Ocarina of time uses the RNG to determine the direction of chickens and Bug's movements. It never makes a chicken impossible to pick up. It never makes a bug go in a random direction when it should go into a patch of soil.

In Majora's Mask (another Zelda game for those who don't know), some bushes drop items or rupees based on RNG. But rupees are never hard to find when you need them. Neither are bombs or arrows or hearts. Especially because some bushes and pots, mostly around soaring points, have definite drops. That's important because when you reset time you lose it all and have to soar right to one of those points. So it's a good thing those points won't screw you over by somehow not dropping what you need. 




 My punish game is horrible, I combo like a noob, I take too long to convert to KO, my neutral game is crappy, I get one good read per play session, and most of my KOs come from my opponent having south damage and me getting either a good hit or throw. 




 Are you kidding? I live that I have so much trouble against Zelda. It's a much different challenge than simply trying to play around a faster character. Zelda is extremely unique in that she has the strongest toolset for a control playstyle. Some other characters have defensive play styles. If everyone was just extremely fast and aggressive, the game wouldn't be so awesomely diverse. It may have well been all Fox final D no items mod.

I feel like everybody complains about slower charavters because it makes the game seem slower. But I don't want everyone to play like a super fast power-house of combos. That seems to be the point of all other fighting games, but not Smash which is more about fast thinking on your feet. Speed Chess if you will. Not to say slower characters don't have the potential to be a part of that game, they can be. But just because your character moves a little faster, doesn't make them superior or better to play. And just because a character is slower doesn't mean they're less fun or inherently defensive and annoying. 

Bowser love to tank through everything, soo being damage through reading and calling out your opponent on their next move. NEWS FLASH, that's how high level smash is played. Fast or slow, general neutral game is about calling out your opponent and conditions g them to do what you want them to do. Converting later into combos and KOs is how the game is won. The best players are the ones who consistently turn a proper neural game into that all important KO. It's why I suck. I hit plenty, but getting a KO I rarely get against higher skilled players.

If you think Zelda is unfun to play against, play against more Zelda players and learn Zelda's common strats and meta game.

 The problems I've had with Reddit apps lie within the things we do most often that Reddit apps don't get. Some of them don't let us edit apps, other apps maybe don't actually mark any messages as "read". Some apps don't let me check mod messages or submit text posts. Some of their UIs suck despite being as good as they can be on such a small screen. And I've even encountered apps that don't even let you browse an individual subreddit. I've even seen apps where I can't sort comments by new instead of best. And basically all apps suck if you're a mod of any subreddit and you're trying to mod on mobile. Not to mention, on most of them I've encountered, you can't even see the sidebar. That's important for a lot of subreddits.

Personally, I can't stand any of these apps. None of them offer everything necessary for an avid Reddit browser. I don't use any of them. I actually browse Reddit on the Safari mobile app.

 *Yawn and stretch* "What'd I miss?" 




 I can agree. It's sometimes fun seeing the pathetic bot users who have an absurd amount of channels they follow because they're following a lot of bots and spam that's giving them lots of fake followers. Bots and spam that follow me get reported and blocked because I'd rather have 100 real followers than 1,000 fake ones.

Not to mention, channels like "Best Vines" and "Best Voiceovers" that blatantly steal vines and parts of YouTube videos and never offer any credit. It's best to report these as fake accounts and block them. Same for the channels that try to steal other channels by using the same name and profile image on vine.

And of course, just like Myspace and Facebook before it, *EVERYBODY* is going to look at the number of followers or friends they have as a means of popularity and/or self-worth. It's a horrible mentality. I look at the number of followers I have to see if I'm putting out good content. 107 followers is pretty good for the average user. And hey, if a few of them unfollow me because I didn't follow back, then fuck them.

Don't look at vine as another place of social media. It's actually not that social, and you definitely will run into that group of channels that seem to know each other. And don't be afraid to unfollow anybody when their posts stop being like their old posts. I prefer to follow funny viners, so if someone stops being funny to me, I'm definitely going to stop following them. Yeah, I've been disappointed by looking up "funniest" viners lists and seeing the same viners over and over. The worst part is, some of them aren't even funny, but make jokes toward a niche community.

I wish I could find 20 more people worthy of following, but as it stands right now, I can't find many other pages I want to follow. Meanwhile, I'll continue to post a vine almost every day. I edit all my vines, and I love video editing, so I'm glad I've found a place that will let me do something small for what I love every day. 




 "How do you know it was him?"

 The PM homebrew launcher assumes you're using a disc. He's trying to load through USB since his disc drive no longer functions properly. 




 You're very welcome. I've been using this method for quite a while and have had to figure out what works and what doesn't. As far as I'm concerned, Loader GX and Wii Flow simply don't work.

Don't forget, with updates, you'll need to once again make sure that SD:\usbloader\codes\ has the updated codes file. Using old codes files can cause glitches and crashes. (I unfortunately discovered that from accidentally playing 3.0 with 2.6b's codes.)

Any other problems, just ask. I'm very glad I could help. 




 Tweaks to Ness to help with his bad match ups like Vs Wolf and Vs Sheik. 




 Use Configurable USB loader. Before you even start your Wii, open your ad card on the computer. In SD:\codes\ you will see a file called rsbe01.gct. Copy this to SD:\usbloader\codes\.

Now go launch CFG on your Wii. Go to Brawl, but don't launch it yet. Go to the settings. Set "Ocarina" to on and set the hook type to "AXNextFrame".

Save your settings and launch the game. It should boot up directly into Project M.

 I have the entire To The Moon soundtrack. I know what song you're talking about. This is just a soundtrack-oriented release. Only certain parts of the song are used, and the in-game version will be mixed differently with slightly higher BPM. The parts I do use loop nicely without fading out and/or starting back up again after ending.

All things considered, I understand the redundant criticisms I've gotten so far. And if you would play the game and hear it within its context, it would make more sense. But, soundcloud, for me anyway, is only meant for the soundtrack-oriented releases of the music.

This is why I really wish Reddit wasn't either a Link or Text agenda. I really wish I could leave a link and still have text without having it put it into a comment that is likely to be buried underneath the dribble.

 I wouldn't want Apple doing anything like this until all of their base models include GPUs. I don't see anybody spending 2k on a mac just to make sure it has a proper GPU in it. Unless they just took off with a new series of machines dedicated to the necessities of gaming where pixels need to be pushed out quickly. Right now, the GPUs Apple puts in are better for accurate pictures, but not fast pictures. And that's the big reason Apple still has this crude separation from gaming.

But, it's not impossible, and probably not even far-fetched in any means. Swift is now open source and is good for developing apps on a lot of platforms. So maybe this will bring a huge streamline to cross-platform development when it comes to which platform is getting all the games. People have developed for Windows purely because it was popular and re-developing for Mac required having a mac + some special software. With Swift going open source, this could be the huge gateway to get one language to code for everything so devs only spend a little more time making a new version to reach millions of more potential customers.

It's a dream. 




 I'm sorry, but who else was 'competing' for this patent?

 I hate that you used to be able to open up most of their computers and upgrade the Ram and Hard Drive yourself. A simple tutorial away. But now it seems like everything is soddered in to make sure you don't and for Apple to preserve the unibody look. 




 You mean they're now doing what dozens of smaller game stores have been doing forever? Good job Gamestop. Still not shopping there. 




 "You're doing that too much. Please wait 23 hours before posting again.

"Don't want to wait? Download our $1.99 plug in to skip this wait up to three times a day. Or our $5.99 to skip this wait forever." 




 "Have a good first day at school..." 




 "Oh, God. How come nobody here can beat the meat before putting it on a damn grill?" 




 GameCube FTW. 




 If you can get it, I'd say get it. There will be games exclusive to new 3DS but not the standard 3DS. Improved battery life, improved 3D, auto brightness, comfy in your hands, improved button layout.

The 3DS is not going to be obsolete for a few more years. Nintendo isn't stupid enough to just release a new console while their current gen offerings are still young. 




 You say that like they have plenty of left over staff to port large portions of old libraries to a virtual environment with no real guarantee that the efforts will pay the staff and then some. 




 In Nintendo's Defense, anything before the Wii wasn't a gimmick with controls. DS seemed like pure gimmick, but it something that definitely works when executed correctly. So I wouldn't can that just another Gimmick. And let's be glad the 3DS isn't just a DSi with a 3D screen, but a very competent handheld with extremely fun games to play. Yeah, yeah, low res, whatever, still way too much fun on one handheld. 




 I'm not a big fan of achievements. Games should be replayed because of replay value. Not for gamer points. 




 Name: Ultra Nintendo Entertainment System.

Rest assured, it will be comparable to any current system with lower power consumption.

Compatible with GameCube to USB adapters and there will be developer APIs so every game can use it from launch.

This built upon what OP said should put Nintendo back on #1 slot. 




 Ness will suck a little less. Just a little. 




 Wow. You're equating Amiibo to a store-specific preorder costume? Apples to oranges dude. Anyone can get an Amiibo, not everyone can get a pre-order. Not only that, but you're paying once for a figure that can unlock content in multiple games or claim daily rewards for some games. Not the same as other companies doing on-disc DLC.

And people are very right when they say the content is NEVER significant to say you're not enjoying a full game. If Amiibo was used to lock content such as extra levels or important items that could help you complete the game, then it would be a problem. But, even without the game, you have a decorative and collectable figure on your shelves. Other DLC does not give you anything like that. If a new game comes out with on-disc DLC, you gotta buy it. And if that DLC stops being supported, then you're fucked. If a new game comes out with Amiibo support, and you already have the Amiibo, then you're already bought that content. And it will never stopped being supported since you don't have to download it.

Amiibo-specific content being on the disc makes sense for this reason. If the game had to download content or checked a server every time an Amiibo was tapped, it would get very annoying very fast.

Nintendo did it much differently. The concept may be similar, but at least they did it in a fun and enjoyable way. And not buying Amiibo does not stop you from enjoying any game's main content.

Some people see it that way. But let me make it clear that **Nintendo is not getting a free pass for anything.** we still hate how hard to get they are. The price is pretty steep if you only want 1 Amiibo to use in 1 game for 1 time. Some of the content isn't worth an Amiibo you don't already have. And yes, it does suck that there isn't a way to access to content without one. But asking for that would be like saying developers should make all DLC unlock able so we can all play it for free. And those who paid simply didn't want to work to unlock it. It'd be a bad business model if nobody had to buy an Amiibo.

Nintendo had to sell some, and they weren't just going to let everyone have everything for free. So everyone can take their hate for Amiibo and shove it up their ass. If you're complaining about them not being abundant or available, I understand. But just hating on it because you see it as insignificant in-disc DLC enablers, then just stfu. We get it.

 Is good to see another fan of skyward sword. It was my favorite Zelda game before Majora's Mask 3D came out. I'm very sad that I do not play it more often. I have to share a screen with a family, so my  3DS has been filing the roll of main Console.

Feel free to hit me up if you'd ever like to discuss the game. And, I think there is a position to increase your overall stamina. There are a few ocarina cheat codes that I deal make the game more enjoyable with actually cheating at anything. 




 That's a strange predicament. I did dig up my old DS. The big brick from 07. I can use that for something. I think I can get what I want soon enough. 




 Wouldn't I need a Japanese DS? 




 I tried. Everything leads to the Masuda method. 




 I personally think both of them are awful is many places. iOS loves to rely on this transparency that adds nothing to the function and only takes away from usability even if by a little bit. Android seems to be way too flashed up and decorated for its own good depending on the version. 




 I don't have a GEN 6 game, and I honestly don't give a fuck what's easier on Gen 6. I'm doing Gen 5 right now. 




 ??? How does this help me bread a shiny? 




 Not trying to be competitive. Just having fun working for bragging rights. Lol. 




 I don't have a Gen 6 game.

Even if I got one tomorrow, I wouldn't put this down just to play the other one just yet. Trying to finish this one and do whatever fun stuff I can on it before I jump to Gen 6. 




 I take this with a grain of salt. This in no way proved Ryu will be part of the game. #BrawlVault. 




 ...Let's see, how could we have easily faked this...

Brawl + file replacement codes + Ryu hack + greninja hack + capturing the right stuff + putting music over the video. 




 I'm in the IE, looking to trade for a non-English Audino to help me breed a shiny. If anyone is interested, PM me. Don't comment. 




 Thanks for the information. 




 I'm playing Black on a New3DS actually. Been playing Majora's Mask on 3DS for a while now. Just recently got back into pokemon thanks to a friend lending me his copy of Black.

I probably should have mentioned all that. 




 I only ask because I'm trying to breed a shiny Audino and read that using a foreign pokemon with a non-foreign pokemon to breed yields the biggest chance for breeding one. Believe me, I don't want to hatch 8,000 eggs before I hatch a shiny.

But I'm only on Pokemon Black. As far as I'm concerned, /r/pokemontrades is meant for generation VI.

How could I possibly get my hands on a foreign Audino when nobody I know has a foreign version of the game/foreign DS? I can't, right? I'm in Southern California, and it flourishes with pokemon players, but not people on Gen V who play non-English copies.

Am I pretty much screwed?

 Yeah, I had to educate my girlfriend's parents about scams like this. It's impossible for some random company to see a virus on your computer. If they do see it, then they're looking at your computer's files and information without your knowledge and permission witch is a cyber crime. If anyone calls saying they see a virus on your computer, then it's fake. And they actually had paid around $80 to install some **fix** which was just spying software. I had to remove it and tell them they were scammed and to cancel their current credit cards just to be safe.

 I don't understand  




 You should have tried windows 7 instead of Windows 8. And this is coming from a mac user. Anybody could have told you that 7 is an almost infinitely better experience than 8. 




 Mostly, the operating system and is ecosystem. They are very tight knit. Instead of having some stuff picked out and made by one company and another company making changes and/or addons that are hot and miss, Apple is very strict about how they go about getting the product to you. They make the operating system and design it for the hardware that they themselves have handpicked. It's like putting two and two together to make for by one person who knows the math. The other side is like someone making  a two and then buying a fraction he thinks is equal to two.

I really like the feel of the operating system. And the parts in the computer are not just fast but stable. I would sacrifice 20% of speed for maximum stability any day.

And many people claim it is entirely out of the lack of popularity, but I disagree. Unix and Linux are simply built with security deeper in mind than Windows ever was. The fact that Mac was built off of a core that had networking and specurity as priority is a big peace of mind. Apple on paper and in practice had proven to be less vulnerable.

 So, some people are starting to maybe come to there senses. Seriously, this mass surveillance is a waste of money, a waste of time, and an overload of useless data that buries anything that could actually be used.

They can't give us that bullshit about how stopping this means we're stopping the spying on known terrorists and criminals. If they were *known* terrorists and criminals, then wouldn't we have a warrant for their arrest and their asses in jail? 




 Summoning of Chimeratech Fortress Dragon cannot be done during the battle phase as it is a fusion summon that can only happen during your own Main Phase. If it was something that can be done at any time, then it would be broken against Machine decks or even with DNA surgery. With DNA surgery, you would change everything to Machine-type monsters and simply tribute every monster on the field for Chimeratech Fortress dragon whenever you wanted (assuming there is a Cyber Dragon in play).

If Chimeratech's text said you can do it during the Battle Phase, or if it required the effect of a quick-play spell card, then it would have been alright.

 1.0 was considered a beta. It was pretty damn stable as far as random crashes go. But there was nothing horribly janky about the software. This was before the gamecube 3 frame delay was removed, before replays desynced, before lightpresses were put in, before individual input was a thing, before a lot of things. There were only 14 characters too. I believe Lucas, Sonic, Snake, and Falco were all in there, but I forget who else. It wasn't a very huge bunch, so it wasn't very popular for tournament play either. 




 This post has been removed because the linked compilation does not credit the viners who made the vines. 




 I would chalk it up to the NX being announced, not the Wii U's limitations. They probably just don't think the game will sell. Racer's are the easiest fucking thing and least limited thing to make when you think about how basic the programming must be and how the game doesn't even have to look that good since you're going by everything too fast to pay attention. 




 "Don't shoot until you see the whites of their eyes, or I'm telling mom!" 




 A lot of drama is added to the TV show's duels which creates turns that last 3-5 minutes especially when you consider each card effect is explained no matter how many times it's already been used. The writers are assuming there are going to be people who watch that episode as their first episode.

But our turns can actually go pretty quickly, and we deal up to a full 8k life points in a single turn. For us, it's desired. The TV show still lengthens duels by having damage be limited to about 200-1500 per turn most of the time. Not to mention, the TV show is very dramatized so those 3-5 minutes turns get stretched even further. 




 I got into it first. 




 I asked my mom to tell me a story from when I was young.

 Son, when you were young. You'd be all over the place. I couldn't keep you from running up and down the stairs. You couldn't decide if you wanted to be up or down, I couldn't keep up with ya. And I didn't really want to try. Oh, and how hungry you were. You were always asking for little snacks before dinner time. Most of the time I'd feed you an apple. And you calmed down. Before you were 7 you kept saying Apples are your favorite food in the entire universe. Those were your words. "Apples are my favorite food in the entire universe." That was until you discovered mushroom pizza. You'd start looking for mushroom pizza every time we ordered it. Sometimes you would get so sad when you didn't see any. You had to settle for pepperoni or plain cheese.

 But I digress. That's just when you were young and what you were like. One day, we went to an amusement park, and you kept trying to run ahead to play games and get on rides. I kept asking you to slow down, but you were so excited when you learned you could go on as many rides as you wanted for free. Didn't cost any money or tickets. So you wanted to ride on every roller coaster.

 I loved that joy in you. How you were always happy to spend time with me.

I asked my dad to tell me a story from when I was young.

 There isn't a lot of anything exciting to tell. You were pretty quit when you were with me. Your older siblings always asked for things from me and you just sort of asked for a slurpee or something every now and then. Even when I'd try to figure out thins about you like your favorite food or color. Wasn't until you were 8 I learned your favorite food was apples.

 I never really saw you running. It seemed like you wanted to play with everyone around you but you got quit when I walked in. Like you were saying bad words and you had to stop talking in front of me. But you weren't saying anything bad. I know, I listened from around the corner. I had to ask questions to get you to talk to me. But, even when I asked what you want on your pizza you would just say nothing. Same with burgers. I'd get you a burger and you'd just want it plain.

 I kept asking your mom how to get through to you. She kept saying to give you things to do. Don't let you be bored.

When I was four, I asked my mom about a purple spot on her face.

 Ask your father.

I did ask my dad. I became ten dollars richer not to talk about it.

No wonder my parents are divorced.

 Sometimes I have to be a real dick to get a point across. I don't think I'll want to mod here until the rest of my mod places are good. I gracefully neglected ygofeedback for a while and now we're very behind on setting up threads and flairs.

The current mods are doing very well. Maybe I'll apply if they ever need more. But for now, I like having my hands ful with what I have. I love Yu-Gi-Oh! And modding around has been a result of getting back into the game.

Yu-Gi-Oh! Modding and Smash Bros are basically my hobbies now. 




 Your landlord doesn't do anything for you for free. He takes your money.

Apples to oranges. 




 The community was once tearing each other apart and posting the most random shit that still managed to get invited to the front. The mods put a lot of work not only in making this place look nice and organizing content with the side bar, they weeded shit out and got binders and trades their own subreddits so the constant complaining about this being "binder subreddit".

You're fucking welcome. 




 I imagine that the mods of /r/Yu-Gi-Oh! Work a lot harder than I do. I don't care so much about the thanks. I run the subs that I do because I love the game. I'm asking everyone to thank the main mods not me. If I didn't already look like an ass, here's a news flash. Go fuck yourself. I don't mod this sub, therefor I'm not asking for thank yous. I'm asking that everyone make sure /r/Yugioh has mods that don't go underappreciated.

 To make it clear, I don't moderate this subreddit. But, I'm a mod on /r/ygobinder, /r/ygosales, /r/yugioh101, /r/ygofeedback, /r/customyugioh, /r/vine, /r/complainaboutanything and more. And on top of deciding what content to leave in and weed out, they deal with rude users, users being rude to other users, deciding on a subreddit's style, implenting features and organizing discussion, and continuously updating the sidebar to reflect any and all changes in its organization.

They do it for free. They don't put up a donation button, they don't have experience to put on their resume, they don't start a patreon to keep it going. They do it for free.

I want to thank all of the other mods of this subreddit and the other yugioh subreddits. I can imagine that moderating this sub has to be a lot of work compared to the sister subreddits that handle far fewer users. It's like a garden. It doesn't go on pause because you don't feel like tending to it for one day. If you leave it alone for a few days, weeds start piling up, plants start withering, and users often get away with harassing each other and starting many duplicate threads. Just today I saw 2-3 threads trying to be the first to start a banlist discussion.

If a moderator helps you with anything, send them a thanks. When users start bugging you or bad and unwanted content starts propping up, be glad the mods are there to help keep quality up. While I still object to a lot of design choices (I'm a designer, sue me), this site looks great, feels fun, and is very well organized. I find it absolutely amazing how much work they have put in.

Sorry, but I just couldn't wait until the weekend free talk to post this.

 Well, family oriented has never actually been inherently kid-focused. We just think it does because we're used to people appealing to the lowest common denominator. But ABC Family is a family oriented television station with almost all of its shows appealing to ages 10-50. Hell, I watched Smallville when I was barely into my teenage years. Same for Gilmore Girls and a lot of other ABC Family shows. 




  Even your girlfriend who secretly fantasizes about smashing your xbox with a hammer is probably cool with nintendo

Totally unrelated, but my girlfriend is actually a huge gamer. She introduced me to Left 4 Dead and the Jak and Daxter series among other things. I think the only long-running thing I got her into was Metroid. She and I both have a Wii U of our own and she occasionally plays Xbox for fun on CoD or Left 4 Dead or Minecraft or whatever. But... guess which one she plays most. 




 This just goes to show that anyone who loves games but doesn't have a Wii U simply doesn't know what he or she is missing. 




 Well, they see the OCG as a test of what's truly good against one another, so when they figure out what's good, they see us as huge fucking dollar signs with making all the good shit expensive and hard to find. Sure Konami, they expect us to believe that bullshit of wanting every card available to every player. 




 Yeah, people have posted about this 5,000 times, so I don't know why this guy still got a lot of fucking karma. JUST VOTE ON THE LINKS YOU FUCKING CLICK. 




 If there's a shared computer somewhere around, an iPad will be enough. He can transfer things to the computer if he needs printing, or hook up to blue-tooth printing. If he's going into senior year, I'd say hold off and give him a laptop for Christmas maybe because he'll need a computer for the world. But if he's just a freshmen, fuck no he doesn't need his own computer. Even if you do get him one for Christmas, he doesn't need a Pro. Especially if he's just feeling entitled or needy. A $500 refurbished one from 3rd party is fine. My girlfriend has that and she's going into college soon. It works great for what she needs.

 Here is a song I wrote to honor Mr. Iwata's passing and in loving memory of his career.

 Your body goes through long cycles to wake up and go to sleep. If you're going back to sleep and have your alarm interrupt you while you're falling back asleep or barely asleep, it completely kills your body's mood. 

Imagine bouncing on a trampoline. To get high, you need to start off low and let gravity work with you so you can put more force on the trampoline and the trampoline gives back the force you put into it. And you can't just stop, you slowly start bouncing lower. So imagine you just stopped bouncing but you figured out you have thirty more minutes left to bounce. But once you start trying to jump high, the trampoline just tenses up and doesn't give you back any force and almost feels like solid ground. But... you were expecting to go through the entire cycle of bouncing higher and higher and higher. You still want to bounce higher, but the trampoline's timer said FUCK YOU and basically killed your happiness. It took away what you were looking forward to.

Sleep is somewhat the same way. When you start to go to sleep, your body looks forward to a certain amount of sleep, and when it doesn't get it, it keeps trying to go to sleep while you keep trying to stay awake. 




 Not that we want to play it in HD, because without a super powerful computer and an emulator and an adapter, PM will not be HD for real. Some of us just want to be able to play PM on Wii U because Wii U has much less lag with most flat screen TVs and it would take away the need to have a Wii *and* Wii U set up in a lot of households. 




 "Okay Google, where's the nearest Apple store with iPhones in stock?" 




 Well, would an emulator be able to connect to a legit pokebank to transfer to a retail cart? I'm using Gen 5 for RNG, and I figured being able to get onto the GTS would allow me access to many more Pokemon.

 The script is all fucked up. Many blank pages. Can we get it fixed? 




 I get errors 20100 often, but those in the chat at raizo are telling me the servers are up. I've set the DNS correctly and have set the DNS correctly so many times I've memorized it.

I also get 52000 a lot which isn't listed on that page. Kind of wish that troubleshooting page was easier to see. I never even knew there was one.

 "[This thing is happening] because of [thing that happened at this tournament]."

"[Insert card] shouldn't be banned. [deck it goes in] Isn't even doing anything right now, they need that card." This mostly applies to Stratos. Ever stop to think that maybe that fucking deck isn't doing anything because that ban-worthy card finally got hit?

"That card is totally getting banned."

"[this card] is gonna be OP, but [this other card] still needs to come out to make [this other deck] viable."

"Fucking hate YCS. Nothing but [cheaters/meta]"

Yeah, Yu-Gi-Oh Players say a lot of stupid and down-right retarded shit. 




 I've read that page. There doesn't seem to be anything in the way of a tutorial. I've got it somewhat figured out on my own, but there's more shit with error codes and not connecting even though the connection test was successful. 




 I'll let you know if those are still available after some other negotiations. 




 I'vve been using AR DSi and a bypass https code. That's not the problem. 




 Are there any good beginning to end tutorials on connecting to an alternate server. This is a retail game and I'm using a DSi game. I've gotten error code 52000, so I entered custom IP stuff and then it gave me error code 52100. I'm really not sure what's going wrong.

As is, my router is a Netgear, but it's using WPA so I'm using my iPhone to tether my DS to the router. If I try to change the WPA protection to WEP, I know of at least 5 people who will be pissed that their devices won't be able to connect. 




 I'm strapped for cash, and I really shouldn't be spending money on cards at all. Should be playing online for free like a poor man.

Somebody please make an offer for it all.

 I think NX articles should be banned from /r/Nintendo. So far every NX article has been "Nintendo seems to want to do [this]" or "Nintendo won't do [this] with the NX" according to some guy who isn't actually part of the project and is just speculating based on whatever. And, of course, we get the "The NX will need [this] if it wants to succeed" which mostly talk about how it better be a 3rd party whore or a straight-forward console with nothing but an ordinary controller. I just want to get it straight that Nintendo has not actually said anything about it other than it's an existing project. It's a fucking project. It's not a console yet. Right now, it's just an idea. Nothing is confirmed about the NX, and these articles are posting about it as if they have the insider on a console that's only months away from being announced.

Big news flash to the NX hypers: The NX can be anywhere from 2 to 6 to maybe even 8 years away. Right now, it's just a concept for Nintendo. I don't even think we were meant to know about it yet. Someone just slipped up and said a little too much, and now everybody can't stop fucking speculating on what they want the NX to be.

Let's ban nx articles from /r/nintendo and shut the fuck up about it until some REAL information is passed around. Right now, Nintendo needs our attention on the Wii U and the games coming to it. 









 "You wouldn't believe how uneventful this last hour has been." 




 And for my next trick, I will need a young female from the audience and about 9 months. 




 Exactly. I wish everyone would shut up about it. Nintendo doesn't even look like they wanted anyone to know. Something just happened to slip out and suddenly everyone is trying to predict it's release. NX could be 2 years away, or it could be 6. Time will tell. 




 I really wish we could all stop worrying about the NX and just let Nintendo do their thing. 




 If we have to give up backwards compatibility to get a beast-of-a-system, I kind of wouldn't mind. If they have the Wii U true backwards compatibility for GameCube titles, all I would need is a Wii U and whatever the NX will be. Oh, and my New 3DS but that's a minor technicality. 




 It's finally feeling like they have a new one. 




 Wow. It's unlike Microsoft to admit that their solution or software sucks. It's also unlike them to adopt any kind of standard. 




 Can we please get people to stop posting this? I've seen this a dozen times. It's old news. 




 "I am not having sex with you to keep my job." 




 Yeah, not sure what to say there. 




 I like this part about Nintendo. It's another thing I see as a difference between themselves and other companies. GTA 5 could have been GTA 15 since [it's the 15th game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_(series)). The opening to Super Metroid admits to being Metroid 3 and Metroid Fusion says it's Metroid 4.

Mario Kart 7 could have just been named Mario Kart 2 and treated the rest of the games post Super Mario Kart as just spinoffs. This would have made Mario Kart 8 a Mario Kart 3 instead. And this would have pissed me off.

Why does it piss me off? I don't know, when other companies give their games the subtitle-spin-off treatment, it gets fans begging for that "give us game X". Like Kingdom Hearts fans begging for KH 3 when they've technically gotten much more than 3 games.

Naming conventions have never been nice in games. It sucks when every new game in a series is begging for confirmation on being a sequel or a prequel. And I guess at least I appreciate Nintendo's honesty with how many of a game they've released. (Except for Mario Party World Tour being the tenth Mario Party, not Mario Part 10).

Yeah, this is confusing. Yeah, I'm probably downvoted and banned for life, but I really just wanted to share this with someone. 




 "HO HO HO... MEEEERRY CHRISTMAS." 




 Lol. That's not even enough for 360x240. 




 I'm going to make this as detailed as possibly can so nobody here is confused and nobody can accuse me of being an idiot. So, as a prerequisite, 

* YES, I HAVE GOOGLED THIS. YES, 
* I HAVE TRIED THE SEARCH BAR OVER TO THE RIGHT. 
* YES, I HAVE TRIES TO CONTACT APPLE FOR HELP, BUT THEY ALWAYS MAKE ME CALL THEM AND I CANNOT TROUBLESHOOT WHILE ON THE PHONE.
* I keep iTunes updated.
* This happens whether or not my phone is jailbroken.

Okay, now that we got that out of the way, let me get into the details. To keep this simple, let's just say I have 10 albums each with 10 songs. Sometimes, when I re-sync my iTunes to my iPhone, I encounter errors on plenty of songs. Or just some songs. Or almost all songs.

Here is the error as simply as I can think to explain it. And it's in example form.

Album 1 Song 5 plays until about 25 seconds in. At that point, it skips to the next song. But, if I play that song and scrub to 26 seconds or later, the rest of the song plays as normal.

How do I know it's not just a random error with only my phone? I've had this happen on an iPhone 4, and 2 iPhone 5s models. My brother has also said that it has happened when he had a 5 and it happens now while he has a 6. That's 5 phones spanning 4 models, so I'm sure it's not just bad sections on my own phone causing the problem. Apps and documents seem to work perfectly without any errors that would be caused on bad parts of storage.

So I've troubleshooted that much. Now, I sync quite often since I get a lot of music, and I write songs and rearrange playlists that I want to update and sync to my phone. So, I try to delete that individual song and sync again to see if it will sync back on properly. ... the song doesn't sync back onto the phone unless I delete the entire album.

So, in the prior example, if I delete Album 1 Song 5 and re-sync, Album 1 Song 5 is still missing. But, if I had deleted all of Album 2 because they all had problems, Album 2 will be copied back onto my phone while Album 1 Song 5 is still missing.

I have reported this bug to Apple multiple times. Unfortunately, they've NEVER gotten back to me about the issue.

If anybody else is having this issue, I urge you to speak up. If there's a lot of people with this problem but no apparent fix for it, I'm planning to send this thread to Apple.

 "HEY, I LOVE YOU, GET THE FUCK OVER HERE." 




 Reddit. Nobody knows our slogan is "The front page of the Internet." 




 Same here. It makes it much easier. I still don't seem to be hitting any seeds correctly though, which sucks. I can't just get something I hatch/catch right away to match anything on the sheet. 




 I've never had to use l or r for keypresses. I know my buttons work though. They work in the other games I play. Thanks for the help.

I'll try to recalibrate and see if I can get results again. 




 I AM still trying to get used to Chatot pitches. I just read a guide about them, so I'm trying to get used to them. Now I have a chatter with a constant tone to help with it. 




 I'm using a 3DS, pokemon black, english version. Calibrated everything step by step according to multiple guides. But, what sucks is that even if I don't get that shiny I want, when I catch the pokemon and check it out, it doesn't seem to match anything on the spread, meaning I didn't even hit my goddamn seed.

I'm holding the keypressed it tells me to. I'm pressing A to launch the game 8 seconds prior to the seed time. And... strangely enough, in getting all of the parameters, the actual seconds seems to fluctuate between a 7 second difference and an 8 second difference. Everything from Vcount to timer0 to gxstat to vframe all stays the same. On BOTH machines that I've tested which is a standard 3DS and New 3DS XL. (Yes, I have different profiles for each one.)

I'm using *RNG Reporter 9.96.6 Alpha, XP compatible* and mostly following Titan's guide to 5th gen abuse for stationary pokemon. The kicker is I've twice gotten a shiny Cobolion with incredible stats. Got it twice actually, but the first time I couldn't catch it, so I did extra preparation and got it again.

Now I'm trying to do it for Terrakion. I'm using chatter the same way I always have. Push up and down between the two and count the chatters. (I only recorded on one, but that changed the chatter for both Chatots, so I'm not sure if both of them count to push the frame forward.)

I have literally thought of everything, but it doesn't even seem to be timer0 trolling because my timer0 for both machines is 123C and I've gotten that more than 10 times in a row with the same machine, so it's pretty stable in that regard.

Date and time are synced up to my computer's clock. since there's a small delay when you press "ok" to set the time, I account for that and normally get my clocks synced within a quarter second or less.

I actually only tried my girlfriend's 3DS because I thought it might be a problem with my New 3DS being a bit faster. But, I got a shiny legendary on the New 3DS. I seeded that and moved forward correctly twice with the New 3DS. But now, the game just seems to troll me. And... I've tried multiple seeds to get Terrakion to be shiny.

I honestly cannot figure out what's going wrong.

If anyone would like to help me, maybe talk over skype or something to help out, that would be nice. 




 Yeah, I knew *when* to press the calculate button, but *when* i was pressing it, I had no goddamn clue why.

So you're saying, if I get a seed with a target frame and it calculates a starting frame much higher than that, the seed simply won't work? Well, that's bull crap. 




 I've tried to get a seed to use to breed for a shiny. One thing I don't understand is what the hell all these guides mean by the pitch of the chatots' chatter. Another is when I press "calculate Initial PIDRNG Frame". What is this for, and why does it sometimes give me an initial frame much higher than the target frame? What does it even mean?

I really don't understand why I'm supposed to press that button. And I've actually not been successful in getting a hatched egg to match anything on the sheet.

I really need help in clarifying a lot of this.

In case it helps, here is some of my results from the parameter finder:  

    TID            163  
    SID            46347
    Actual Seconds 7, 7, 7, 8  
    VCount         8C  
    Timer0         123C  
    GxStat         6  
    VFrame         8
    Seeds          0B20A8E780F3313C
                   4910FA973BDFCB57
                   4EBBD421F656D009
                   D7D2BEEE423A5FFB

Every attempt was made at the top of each minute. For example, 2:20:00 or 4:53:00.

---

Note, I've gotten this to work now. It took a lot of trial and error. I had to learn to get around the qwirks of using a 3DS. Chatot pitch education really helped. I've left my info here for my own future reference.
