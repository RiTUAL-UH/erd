 I watched the movie after reading Emma's praise about the story.But i was really disappointed with the movie.A total disaster and waste of time. 




 Nah.Diesel is not a sword guy.He's all muscle.Looking forward to it. 




 Good film.Unique and excellent screenplay.Jake and Tony did a great job. 
























 Mirror, Mirror and Snow White and the Huntsman 




 It is a bit underrated movie although i think it deserves much more than that.I liked the movie very much.Brad Pitt,Casey Affleck did a great job.The directing was very good too.The concept of narrating the story was great. 




 After watching Part-1 my ideas on crime movies were never the same again.And no other crime movie can compete with it either. 
























 Totally agree with you on that. 




 I didn't say she praised the movie.I said she praised the script.I read that she said it was a wonderful script and she just had to act in it.

 You're right. Ratatouille's screenplay is easily the best among the Pixar franchise. 




 I agree with you on that.Though it is not number 1 on the box office.But still it has a gross.And its going to increase as the both the number 1 and number 2 films are a bit old now. 




 Everyone forgot E.T:The Extra Terrestrial (1982)
I would also like to add
Driving Miss Daisy (1989)
Ordinary People (1980)
Rain Man (1988)
The Breakfast Club (1985)
National Lampoon's Vacation (1983)

 
























 Damn that was a good holiday. 




 My niece was born this year and she was named Elsa. 




 I wouldn't say its great.But its not that bad. 
























 'The Theory of Everything' was good too. 




 (and) Gravity(2013), Source Code(2011), Cloud Atlas(2012) 




 Great news.Loved the movie. I think its the best movie of Tim Burton. 
























 "Ohh... I am not gonna kill you .......I am just gonna hurt you..really..really bad!" 




 Incredible. Really looking forward to it. 




 I think Pierce Brosnan is the best bond ever. 
























 What? Shrek 2 was great. Really funny movie. 




 Its gonna be good... 





























 The scene were Matthew Mcconaughey finds out solution and gives clue to Jessica is just too good. 




 Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman in The Prestige. 




 Why these two? Their previous scripts aren't good. 
























 Almost unrecognizable. 




 Once (2007) 




 You've probably heard of Inception
You might have heard of Super 8
You probably haven't heard of The war game
You've never heard of The Face of Another 




 Really great post. Thanks for the explanation man. 




 This is probably going to be the best movie of the year. 




 Amazing. 




 Heaven knows what he is gonna do..

 It will surely gross more than 1 billion dollars.
