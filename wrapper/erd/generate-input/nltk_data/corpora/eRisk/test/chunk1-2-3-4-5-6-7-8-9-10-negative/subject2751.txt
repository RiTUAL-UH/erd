 Great week for me!

Games I've played for the first time:

**Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective**: We played case #1 and we all had a good time. Truly an unique experience, highly recommend if you enjoy detective stories.

**Myrmes**: Solid worker placement game. I heard it could be brutal but nobody played aggressively in my game. The slight concern for me is the replayability of the game.

**Istanbul**: Love the efficiency aspect of the game. As a light (around 1 hour) strategy game it is probably one of the best out there. Could easily see expansions coming out.

**Blood bowl: Team Manager the Card Game**: Not really my type of game as it was quite confrontational but everyone did seem to enjoy it.

Games that I've played before: **Machi Koro**, **Caverna**, **Terra Mystica**, **Castles of Burgundy**, **Fresco** 




 This list is probably what you are looking for: Rahdo's top 10 worker placement games.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_THM0sLSfo

These are basically non-standard worker placement games. 

For example: 

In **Euphoria**, it takes an entire turn to retrieve your workers. However, places are never fully blocked, when you go into a space with someone else's worker, you bump them off and so they retrieve that worker back for free.

In **Keyflower**, workers act as a currency to bid for new buildings.

In **Fresco**, you assign your workers simultaneously and then reveal. Therefore you have to guess or double-guess where other people want to go.

I would recommend **Manhattan Project** as well, where you could put all your workers in buildings you have bought in one go, and also you could access other people's buildings by using the espionage action. 




 A mediocre week for me.

Games I have played for the first time:

**Biblios**: I liked the card drafting and push your luck elements a lot. Instantly became my favourite filler.

**Battlestar Galactica**: I understood its charm but it did not click with me. Indecisive players and constant rules clarification (it was a seven player game with 3 newbies, and we played with expansions) led to a 5 hour drag. I think once is enough for me.

**Discworld: Ankh-morpork**: Decent fast-playing game. I liked the asymmetric victory conditions.

**Bling bling gemstone**: Ridiculously stupid sounding game which was actually fun after a few drinks.

Games that I've played before:

**Caverna**, **Manhattan project**, **Russian Railroads**,**Lords of waterdeep x2**, **Kakerlaken poker** 




 Good week for me:

New games played this week (in order of enjoyability):

**Lewis   Clark** - love the efficiency building mechanic where more resource is not necessarily a good thing.

**Glory to Rome** - another efficiency building mechanic where you want to save number of actions and leech on others.

**Guildhall** - sweet short game based on chain reactions.

**Drum Roll** - standard worker placement game. The problem I had was that the cubes were not very thematic and some cards were basically rubbish.

**Packet Row** - good filler with slight deduction element.

**Port Royal** - Good filler where you can purchase cards to hedge the randomness.

**Roborally** - very chaotic, too random for my taste. Probably more fun if played slightly drunk.

**Cheaty mages** - another filler full of randomness.

**Holmes 13** - guess-who style deduction game. Not really much substance to it.

Games that I've played before:

**Agricola**, **Alhambra**, **Ingenious**, **Lords of Waterdeep**, **Splendor** 




 A good week for me.

New games I tried:

**Suburbia**: loved it. Lots of strategic planning, with a moderate degree of interaction so it's exactly my type of game. I love how we all create some back story for describing each of our cities as we go along.

**Cosmic Encounter**: Was somewhat fun but a bit too confrontational and chaotic for me.

**Arctic Scavenger**: Nice deck builder with some theme and interaction. Would like to play with the role cards next time.

**One Night Ultimate Werewolf**: I normally stay away from party games but this is short enough for me to be able to enjoy it.

**In the Year of the Dragon**: Another Feld that I enjoy. Probably the most unforgiving game of his but I really liked the mechanics.

**La Citta**: Was pleasantly surprised by this city building game. Early actions are hugely important.

Games that I've played before:

**Loot**, **Agricola**, **Tzolkin**, **Alhambra**, **Coloretto**, **Quantum**,**For Sale**,**Tsuro**,**Mascarade** 




 I like it a lot and would love to see a computer version come out!

I particular like the skill upgrade aspect which is basically efficiency management. I also like the strategic but not too confrontational blocking of routes which also boils down to managing efficiency.

The drawback I think is that the map and scoring conditions are fixed. This means each game feels somewhat similar at the beginning and at the end. Perhaps introducing different vp scoring bonus conditions would allow for more variety between each play. 




 Not too remarkable week for me:

First time played 

**Robinson Crusoe** - probably highlight of the week. 4 of us played scenario 2 and were so close to winning but the snow hit us hard. We lost on the final round.

**Machi Koro** - nice short dice game. I find the red cards a bit overpowered.

**City Council** - the semi-coop element didn't work out, would never play again.

**Ingenious** - neat little abstract game.

**River dragons** - a short programming game that is mildly fun. 

Played before

**Trajan**, **Libertalia**, **Hansa Teutonica**, **Alien Frontiers**, **Power Grid** 




 1st time played:

**Brass**, **Sail to India**, **Incan Gold**, **Ra the dice game**, **Panic on Wall Street!**, **After Pablo**, **Skull   Roses**, **Ascension**

Games I've played before

**Agricola**, **Notre Dame**, **Terra Mystica**, **Russian Railroads**, **Steam**, **Concordia**, **Manhattan Project**

Highlight was definitely learning how to play Brass! Such a well designed game, would love to try again. 




 In Concordia, you basically draft your own victory point scoring conditions. I think it's quite neat as it 

a) enhances your own strategy as cards provide you with both actions and scores;

b) hides everyone's true vp. Someone could appear to be doing really well on the board but score-wise they might not be; and

c) enables you to block others scoring points by buying the card they want  




 Short games: Splendor, Battle Wizards, King of Tokyo, Fleet, Jungle Ascent

Main games: Trajan, Snowdonia, Hansa Teutonica, Zombicide, Lords of Waterdeep

Only tried 3 new games this week: Snowdonia, Hansa Teutonica and Zombicide. I liked HT a lot but am doubtful whether it gets samey as strategies among players appeared to be quite similar. 




 Fillers: Coloretto, Bang the Dice Game, A Fistful of Penguins, Gang of Four, 7 Wonders, Archaeology

Main Games (played before): Terra Mystica, Tzolkin, Russian Railroads, Pandemic, Lords of Waterdeep

Main Games (first time): Trajan, Euphoria, A Study in Emerald

Loved Trajan so much that I immediately bought it after playing it the first time! I enjoyed Euphoria but somehow it wasn't enough for me to cross the line from a good to great game.   




 I'm a new gamer (~2 months)  but already highly addicted to boardgames and I've played 6 days last week to try find games that I like. It was tiring but well worth it:

*Loved it*

**Terra Mystica** My third time playing it. I bought the game and this was my first time teaching newbies. Enjoyed the game playing the dwarves. Hoping to try the mermaids/swarmlings/alchemists next time.

**Lords of Waterdeep with expansion** Played original game once. This was the first time with expansions. With 6 players it was still very good but I think it would be more enjoyable with 5.

**Russian Railroads** Loved it! I diversified too much and ended with 275 points. Will definitely replay, even consider buying it.

**Tzolkin** x2. Played this many times already. Still loving it.

*Liked it*

**Pandemic** I like how easy to learn the game is and how everyone gets tense during the game. 

**Nations** Played with 3 players. Went for military strategy and was very tight on resources. Will play again.

**Eclipse** My first long game (lasted 6 hours with 6 players). It does give you a great sense of achievement. Just didn't enjoy it at times when it took too long between turns. Not a big fan of war/dice rolling as well.

**Agricola** Learning game, got 22 points. I like the mechanics of the game but it felt a bit too restrictive to me. I enjoyed Caverna more.

**Ra** I quite like the design of this clever bidding game. Would replay.

*Alright*

**Coup, Quantum, Modern Art the card game, String Railway, Marrakech, Serenissima**

Hopefully I could game 4 days this week. Already looking forward to trying exciting new ones! 




 Does anyone know where I could find this in London? Their official website doesn't ship to the UK. Thanks. 




 Thanks! I'm not sure how to get the sizing correct as I've heard many people say it stretches a lot and it needs to be downsized 2-3 inches. So if I go to a retail store the "correct size" wouldn't feel comfortable right? How could I tell if I found the correct pair? 




 A.P.C. Petite Standard Jeans 




 When watching a live performance (e.g. concert/play/musical), I often think of what would happen if my mind is suddenly swapped with the performer. I would think of how much I'd panic as I don't know their material, and how the performance would stop as the audience jeers.
I have hypothetical stage fright. 





























 It was a good week!

New games played:

**Mage Knight**: Bought this second hand at a bargain and played the tutorial (exploring) game solo. Already now that I'll love it.

**Five Tribes**: Solid game. I find it more tactical/opportunistic than strategic. Just don't play with players with AP.

**Lost Valley**: Tile laying Euro with a badly written rule book. Turns are quite simple so a game was quick. We all felt that this game was just a bit short of being a fantastic game.

**Via Appia**: Fun light game which reminds us of arcade games.

**Valley of the Kings**: Great deckbuilding game with set collection for a small box. I plan to buy this one.

**Glen More**: Fun little tile laying + resource management Euro. Really liked the turn order mechanic. I'll buy this if I have the chance as well.

Games that I've played before: **Ingenious**,**Lords of Waterdeep**, **Agricola**, **Port Royal**. **Star Realms**, **Fresco**, **Dominant Species**, **Greed**, **Biblios** 









 I find that the best way to form a strategy is by looking at the monuments before the 1st turn begins. Decide on building a specific one, with a backup plan on building another one in case someone else built it before you.

Then based on the target monument, you probably have to upgrade your tech tree to fulfil your strategy more efficiently. The first half of the game is probably spent gathering wood/upgrading tech/gathering corn etc just to survive and build up for your long term plans.  




 I agree with the samey feel. Players can practically plan out their strategy before starting a game. Sure you would tweak your worker placements opportunistically, but you would be able to stick to a predetermined strategy more or less. 




 Sounds promising! Hopefully I don't have to throw away most of my games when I move. 




 I'll be moving back to HK in 2015 so thank you for the info.

Do you know any places/forums to meet random hobbyist for games? I'm just afraid there won't be opportunities for me to play Euros/try new games anymore. 




 I'm on the opposite end of the spectrum...
Just started playing board games this year, have played 200 different games already but currently own only 10 (though I'm constantly resisting my urge to buy more) 




 **Martin Wallace** - If you like managing money and cashflows, you'll love his games: London, Brass, Steam.

Also games that are slightly chaotic: A Study in Emerald, Discworld.

Heard good things about A Few Acres of Snow but have not personally tried yet. 




 I played over 20+ new games in August so I'll just list my favourites:

**Ora et Labora**: I love resource management games and this is very enjoyable as there is not much stress of feeding your workers. The only downside is there is no setup variability so I am not sure about replayability.

**Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective**: If you play with the right crowd, this is immensely satisfying.

**Bruges**: This should be in the top 100! Although there are lots of interesting decisions to be made it plays quite quickly.

**Ground Floor**: There are some interesting mechanics and as a pure Euro I still find it quite thematic.

**Thunder Alley**: Looks complicated but actually isn't. Fast paced racing game.

**Star Realms**: Probably the best filler that I have bought. It's good with 2, and decent with 3.

**Dungeon of Mandom**: As a filler this ticks all my boxes. Easy to teach, slightly strategic, fits in a tiny box, and fun!

**Space Alert**:  This has to be my favaourite co-op game. There's practically no downtime, no quarterback issues, and you really feel that you win (or lose) as a whole team. Love the subtle humour as well (Did anyone wiggle the mouse?) 




 This should help you a bit:

[http://boardgameprices.co.uk/](http://boardgameprices.co.uk/)

I personally quite like boardgameguru.co.uk 




 Just tried **Impulse** yesterday. I like it quite a lot, especially how quick it plays. Not too keen on the battle element, so I'll pass on buying this one but will definitely play it again if it hits the table. 




 Heh, I have ordered it on Amazon last night and the price went up by 9 today! Can't wait for it to arrive next week. 




 Thanks! I'm interested in **Pax Porfiriana** but it seems to be sold out.
**Biblios** is already one of my favourite light games, and I intend to pick up a copy when the reprint is out. 




 Thanks for your suggestions! **Blueprints** is on my watchlist and I just saw that the reprint is available on amazon, I'm tempted to click Buy Now.. 




 I have yet to try this, thanks! 




 I agree with **Splendor**. I know this will lose a bit of its appeal but if I use wooden cubes instead of chips, I could fit the whole game in my pockets! 




 I enjoy euros such as **Terra Mystica** and **Agricola**, but they are difficult for me to transport during the week, therefore I consider them "weekend games". I am hoping to add to my collection some "weeknight games" that are compact (**able to fit at least 2 games in a backpack**) but are still complex enough not to be categorised as a filler. I know that **Glory to Rome** is an obvious choice but it's sold out everywhere..

Thanks in advance!

**Number of Players**: 3-5 players. (the group discourages 2 player games)

**Game Length**: 0.5 - 2 hours

**Complexity of Game**: As complex as possible and as little dice rolling as possible.

**Your Budget**: Not an issue

**Competitive or Cooperative**:Either

**Games I Own/Like or Dislike**: Games that I dislike: hidden roles/bluffing/confrontational (**coup**, **resistance**,**citadels**). Games I own that fit my criteria already: **Guildhall**, **Race for the Galaxy**, **Hanabi** 
























 Played for the first time:

**Panamax**: Really liked it, definitely in my top 5 for 2014. The rules explanation takes quite a while, but once we started playing everything is quite straight forward. It comes down to either (1) take a contract and load cargo; or (2) Move the ships. Players need to balance the pace well - shipping everything in a round might boost income and save costs, but it might be very difficult to avoid costs in the next round.

**City hall**: A worker placement + bidding game. Played this with 3 players. Was not impressed as I won by exploiting the health commissioned spot early on which seemed too powerful to me.

Games that I've played before: **Small World**, **Viticulture**, **Coloretto** 




 To expand on the games that you already enjoy: **One Night Ultimate Werewolf**, **Dead of Winter** 




 Games I've played for the first time:

**Hyperborea** - Really liked this! More of a engine/efficiency building game than a civ/4x. Bag building and action selection is very unique. Only complaint is on the similar colours of the cubes.

**Vitivulture** - Pretty standard light worker placement game about making wine. I would even consider this to be a gateway game. Heard that the expansion brings complexity so I'll give it a go if I have a chance.

**Vinhos** - Another game about making wine which is one of the heaviest economic games I played. I liked it a lot but felt that it was a bit unnecessarily complex - it's like 6 mini-games in one. 

**Theseus** - Sci-fi mancala with different race abilities. Very tactical and plays within an hour. I'm surpriksed that I haven't hear many people mentioning this game before. 

Games that I've played before:  **Hanabi**, **Quartermaster General**, **Fresco**, **Carcassonne**, 




 They are currently organising an Agricola tournament (with drafting rules of course) that starts in Jan 2015. Search for London on Board on meetup.com if you wish to sign up. 




 **Pictomania**, kind of like Pictionary but you have to draw and guess what others are drawing at the same time. Immensely fun to watch! 




 The sale for the previous days were amazing....
Betrayal at House on the Hill: 20
Small World : 20
Lords of Waterdeep: 15

But of course they were all gone in the matter of minutes if not seconds


EDIT: Dominion: 15, gone within seconds as well. 




 Great collection of Euros!

I dream of owning **Glory to Rome** and **Age of Empires III** too, both very solid games but they don't seem get enough attention here. 




 I have played the games you have listed except for Archipelago and The Pillars of the Earth.

It depends on i) whether you are looking for something new and ii) whether the "more players" you play with are comfortable with heavier games. I would recommend Castles of Mad King Ludwig as it is incorporates bidding (sort of), tile laying, and building your own castle, which is sort of a blend of the games you enjoy.

Note that:

Concordia - without the expansion, this is a 3+ player game.

Manhattan Project, Bruges, Euphoria - These are all solid games for 4 players but I'm not sure how well they go with 2 players. 




 I've played 4 games with the expansion and feel that the new races make the game much more interactive and competitive/aggressive. 

Volcano factions can splurge easily in the first round if they wish and Shapeshifters and Riverwalkers could "intrude" into your home terrain. In a 4-5 player game, if you are not careful around these factions you could get locked in quite easily. 




 4 players. As with other Feld games I think it would play well in 2p and 3p scenarios as well. After rules explanation, we finished in under 2 hours and didn't have to revert to the rulebook so the rules were quite straightforward.
Minor complaint would be that there is an icon on the board that was printed really small (it doesn't help that the board is extremely colourful). Also requires a bit of time for initial setup. 




 My friend bought it at Essen for 35. Boardgameguru now has it at 40. 




 Great week for me:

**Terra Mystica (with Fire and Ice expansion) x2** - played the Shapeshifters (1st in a 4p game) and the Riverwalkers (2nd in a 5p game). Loved it. I feel that the expansion makes the game more interactive and you really have to keep an eye on what other players are capable of doing.

**Aquasphere** - Loved it too! I'm pleasantly surprised that a simple programming/action mechanic created such an interesting game. The length felt just right, and the production quality is superb. Thinking of buying a copy.

**La Isla** - Underwhelmed by this new Feld game. Minimal interaction, theme is bland. Upside is the short setup and play time.

**Bora Bora** - Lots of interesting choices throughout the game. However I find that the dice rolls can screw one over even more so than CoB.

**Steam Donkey** - Pretty decent filler for its price and length. Easy to teach as well.

 




 I would guess costs such as rent and payroll take a big part in this.
In order to compete effectively with online stores, it is true that FLGS should be offering an experience (e.g. game nights/ staff recommendations) rather than just sales so that people are willing to pay a little bit extra to support it. 




 Short but fruitful week of gaming.

Games I've played for the first time:

**Le Havre**: Absolutely loved it. I was scared to take a loan (fear of not feeding developed from other games) and ended up with 167 points but next time I'll definitely go for loans. I think I prefer it over Agricola because everything is open information (except for special buildings but there's a way to take a peek). Only downside is that it's 3 hours.

**Dungeon Lords**: I had high expectations for the game but I just found it too unforgiving and chaotic. Hope to try Dungeon Petz some time.

**Pictomania**: I was truly pleasantly surprised. I'm not much of a party game player but this was so fun to come up with a clever way to draw/complain at the obscure drawings from other players etc. I hadn't laughed so much during a game for quite a while.

**King of Siam**: Neat little area influence game. Pretty good for its weight and length (each player only gets 8 actions during the game).

Games I've played before: **Lewis   Clark**, **Russian Railroads**, **Greed**, **For Sale**, **Splendor**  




 I'm one of the lucky ones I would say. I live in London and had joined the board game meet up group that meets practically every single day.

If I show up on both days in the weekend I am guaranteed to enjoy 18 hours of gaming per week already. 




 Pretty good week.

Games I played for the first time:

**Sons of Anarchy**: It's pretty good for a light thematic game. There's a bit of dice rolling though so we didn't take the game too seriously

**Santiago de Cuba**: Good fun for its weight and length. Maybe too much of screwing people over though.

**Navegador**: The roundel idea is neat but I have doubt over its replayability. I would still prefer Concordia.

**Dead of Winter**: I'm usually not a big fan of co-op/semi co-op but this was probably the best one I've played. We were certain we would fail but we did pull it through (finished main objective) by strategically attracting zombies to different places. Completely forgotten about my second objective at the end though so I didn't win...

**Taj Mahal**: mildly interesting but it feels unsatisfying as a bidding game. 

**Around the world in 80 days**: Slightly fun racing game with a card drafting element. Not much depth to it, probably playing once is enough.

Games I've played before: **Istanbul**, **Sail to India**, **Greed** 





























 Yes indeed! I also like the fact that no two games will ever be the same. 




 I'm glad I'm part of a diversified group so everything gets played. But I do see what you mean, so it's a game that I will always be willing to play but not sure I want to own. 




 I completely agree with you. In the early turns there's not much going on, it's just about drafting the right combo of cards and tiles and taking a few 5/6s. Then it kicks off mid-game. 




 Fantastic week for me! Played for the first time:

**Kanban** - This is definitely one of my favourites in 2014. It's an interlocking puzzle and it's not as heavy or AP as I expected it to be. It's probably because (1) if you can't think of anything to do, most of the time you can just train; and (2) you can leech off other players' actions for scoring. We did however played the nice Sandra scenario so next time it might not be as easy as I think.

**St. Petersburg (2nd ed.)** - Very nice card drafting game. It feels like a more complex version of **Splendor** and less stressful version of **London**. I have not played the first edition before but the others said the new market tracks are an interesting addition.

**Shadowrun: Crossfire** - A great co-op deckbuilder. It almost feels like a very simplified version of Mage Knight with only the battle elements. The permanent upgrades also makes you want to replay it as well.

**Macao** - An early gem from Feld. There are many interesting choices every round which rewards careful planning and not being too aggressive. Some of the cards are written poorly though, so I do prefer his more recent games. A very solid and unique game still.

Games that I've played before: **Terra Mystica**, **Hyperborea**, **Machi Koro**, **Guildhall**, **Sail to India**, **Puerto Rico** 




 **Lords of Waterdeep** is a worker placement game that is easy to learn and the DnD theme (although not very apparent) may appeal to some in your group. The competition mainly comes from taking action spaces and quests that other players want, and playing cards that affect opponents.

**Lords of Xidit** is a programming game that is also easy to learn and it looks amazing. It is about recruiting characters to fight off monsters (NPC) on a map. You each have a dial and players simultaneously set their 6 actions of the round and then reveal together. Therefore you would need to guess/double-guess what other players are trying to do. 




 It depends slightly on location but for simplicity I'll use Amazon US prices. 

**Hanabi** - $9.89. Pure co-op logic/deduction card game with a slight twist - you can only see other players' hand but not yours. You give clues to each other  in order to play cards.

**Dominion** - $23.87. THE deck building game. Very simple rules, hours of fun. (Dammit why is this so cheap in the US. it's 30 here in the UK) 




 For me, it's about engine/efficiency building, upgrades, and the satisfaction when a plan actually worked. I don't mind randomness as long as the sequence is randomness -decision - outcome (**Castles of Burgundy**) and NOT decision - randomness - outcome (**Eldritch Horror**, **Eclipse**)

Examples: 

**Terra Mystica** - planning ahead for that chain reaction double town round for 10 extra points.

**Le Havre** - getting loans early in the game to fuel your shipping production then paying everything off in one go. 




 Based on the aspects you like, I recommend:
  **Terra Mystica** - It's a game about expanding your control on a map trying to form towns, while different buildings give you different income and abilities. No randomness after initial setup, not much direct conflict, managing the use of 3 resources (workers, money, power). There are no changing cost of resources though.

**Brass** - Economic game about connecting your industry empire to trade coal/steel/cotton. There's changing cost of resources. Not much direct conflict. Slight randomness due to card drawing. 

Alternatively, buy more expansions of **Power Grid** if you're just bored of the base map and power plants! 




 For every single game, there will always be people who hate it/regret buying/rate as a 1 on BGG etc. I think it's always important to decide for yourself (and your group) whether you like a game or not, especially when trying out a new type. 

It's also a very popular game so it's also likely that you could trade/sell it away if you didn't like it after all.  




 **Terra Mystica** with expansion: Played wit the mermaids. Doing quite well because of the # of clusters end game scoring, but I was greedy on the fifth round as I should have passed earlier when the good point scoring bonus tiles were up for grabs...came second and lost to dwarves :(

**Panamax**: One of my favourites of 2014. I was doing well early game and people started buying my shares and pushed the price up so I wasn't able to pay dividends in the final round. Pacing the cashflow is really important in this game! I'll try to get this played more often in 2015.

**Forbidden Desert**: Not a big co-op fan but I thought it was more interesting than Forbidden Island.

**Deus**: I was excited to try this but was disappointed as most parts of the game everyone was just staring down at their cards and there was no interaction at all. 

Gaming resolution this year: go to Essen. 




 I would say **Terra Mystica**

In TM There are a handful of actions you can choose each turn but it flows logically once you explain Terraform, Build, Power and Cult track. Everything else are just upgrades and ways of getting points.

In Eclipse, you will have to explain every single tech, battle, initiative, dice roll modifiers are not as easy to remember.

On the flipside, for the first Eclipse game you could all play with human races to simplify things a bit but you have to pick factions in TM. 




 positive: **Terra Mystica**, **Brass**, **Glory to Rome**
negative: **Battlestar Galactica** 




 It's H@ll Games/Pegasus Spiele, perhaps its the European edition?

It's a medium heavy game, the weight is about same as Trajan. I played once with 2p and once with 4p. Every action is an interlocking puzzle, which unfortunately means that people with AP will slow this game down a lot. 




 Yes if you are a big fan of Dixit/co-op/social interaction/family friendly games!  




 Thanks for your suggestion! Seriously, I think that would improve the strategy element. 




 A quiet week because of Christmas:

**Mysterium**: Played with a full 7 player game - lost inevitably. We agreed that 4-5 would probably be the best player count. Nonetheless, there was a lot of discussion and we all had a good time.

**Aquasphere**: Another nice puzzle-like game from Feld. Love the wooden pieces of the game.

**Castles of Mad King Ludwig**: 2p game didn't turn out great because a lot of rooms are not in play so it's difficult to plan ahead. I'll probably only play with 4p with this one.

**Russian Railroads**: About my 10th play, starting to get repetitive.

**Star Realms**: One of the best 20 minutes game out there. Easy to teach, quick and fun (when things go right for you that is). 

**Trajan**:  The mancala bit is still fresh to us and fun to plan ahead with.

**Bucket King 3D**: Silly little party game. Remember to draw cards after playing them. Always.

**Oregon**: A decent abstract tactical game. I wish there are more of these relatively short (45 minutes) game that comes in small boxes.

**Grog Island**: The bidding and catch-up mechanic is quite interesting (when you pass an auction, you still get some kind of reward). Surprised the rating isn't higher with this one.

It takes time for people to cast votes - so I'll expect 4-5 of them to make it into top 100 in a year's time. (**Dead of Winter**, **Imperial Settlers**, **Five Tribes**, **Castles of Mad King Ludwig**...) How long they'll stay in the top 100 is another matter.

I think there are many solid games released this year, especially in the light/medium weight spectrum which greatly helps in promoting the hobby (**Splendor**, **Istanbul**, **One Night Ultimate Werewolf**, **King of New York**)
 
























 I really enjoyed this game up until the last few rounds. Then it's a repetitive motion to bash the leader because players may only win at the beginning of their turn, not the end. This draws out an extra 30 minutes. Obviously this matters less in a 2 player game.

If it wasn't for this mechanic for game end, I'm pretty sure it would be a top-250 game on bgg. 




 Pretty solid week for me:

**Roll for the Galaxy** - really enjoyed this. It flows much smoother than Race for the Galaxy as you don't need to stare at your hand often to decide which cards to keep and which to play.

**Spyfall** - quite fun after you know the majority of the available locations. Love it when people come up with creative questions.

**Witness** - mildly amusing light logic game that takes 10 minutes. 

**Cyclades** - very cool bidding+area control game that becomes intense in the last few rounds of the game. I thoroughly enjoyed this.

**Lords of Xidit** - I really wanted to enjoy this more but I just can't stand it when people are AP over a simple game.

**Orleans** - my second play. Still enjoyed this but I have a feeling every time the ending of the game would be the same.

**Brass** - messed up some rules in the beginning but we eventually got it right. Very brain-burning but satisfying at the same time. Came close second, if only I chose the right railroads to build, argh! 




 Most games do it by dice. Some games, e.g. **Impulse**, resolves battles by flipping the top cards on the deck.  




 Games where 

1. Players are rewarded for planning ahead (**Terra Mystica**, **Agricola**)

2. Information is mostly open - even if you get backstabbed or blocked by other players, it should be foreseeable.

3. Replayable. Mostly comes with randomised setup.  

4. No randomised outcome generator, so every immediate outcome from a decision should be mostly predictable.

5. Feeling of progress within a game. You start out slow on resources and abilities, but you get multiple upgrades during the game.

Basically, I like a game if on my way home I think to myself, damn I should have done this and this instead of that, I was such an idiot!  




 This is neat! Instead of tracking total points, wouldn't it make more sense to score by average position? 




 Did you play in a pub in London? If yes I probably played with you and it was a great game!
In my game I was the first to build a metropolis but then spent way too much money and effort defending it, eventually losing my second island. I will try to be sneakier next time. 




 **Galaxy Trucker** - 1st half of the game: build your own spaceship in a limited time by grabbing tiles. 2nd half of the game: travel through space, getting hit by meteors, fighting off aliens, transporting goods for $. It's pretty light, chaotic, and fun. However, unlike FTL, you don't get to make too many decisions in battles/upgrading ships/recruiting crew. 




 Don't think of it as food production. Think of it as a discount for feeding at the end of each round until the end of the game. 




 I go to London on Board too, and I find that it's easier to bond with gamers with similar tastes than convert a friend to a gamer.  I prefer playing with gamers for several reasons:

1. Personal preference for games. Some interactive games (e.g. **Avalon**) probably work better when you play with friends and I'm personally not a big fan of those.

2. More opportunities to try out new games when playing with a group of gamers.

3. More opportunities to play at a competitive level (e.g. tournaments) with a group of gamers. 




 They are all great choices based on your criteria. 

**Glory to Rome** is an excellent game, but I highly doubt you can find a copy for less than $25.

I'm certain you'll enjoy **Race for the Galaxy** and **Star Realms** as you liked **San Juan** and **Dominion**. Just be aware that you directly attack each other in **Star Realms** in case that's an issue. Also, you can try out **Race for the Galaxy** for free on boardgamearena first. 




 Let's give this a go!
/u/boardgamerecommender test_subject2751 




 I'm not sure whether it's worth it to back the kickstarted version and wait 8 months, or just buy a copy now. 

Speaking from my own experience, you will like the game if you enjoy:  
1. Pool and engine building; a main difference from other "pool-builders" is that you start off by drawing 4 tokens each round, but this ability could be upgraded to a max of 8.  
2. Indirect conflict only (race on the map, buying a building someone else wants, buying the last token etc);  
3. Feld games, i.e. not thematic, multiple ways to get victory points; and  
4. Games that are not too unforgiving. Had a bad draw? You can place say, one token to a building that requires 2 tokens. You don't activate the building this turn, but it increases your chances to fill in the remaining token later for a big turn later on.
 




 Awesome week! Tried some new games:

**Sheriff of Nottingham** - A game about smuggling goods, detecting lies, and making deals. This has become my favourite bluffing + negotiation game! There's even some euro-y elements to it. Best to play with friends.

**Archipelago** - A semi-cooperative resource management game with a brilliant market system. The 4 newbies (including me of course) were really selfish and didn't care about resolving crisis on round 3....so the rebel counter jumped from 4 to 34. The host of the game (traitor) won by the end of round 4. 

**Imperial Settlers** - I enjoyed the engine building and chain combo bits of the game but was slightly disappointed as I didn't think it lived up to its hype. First half of the game is very non-interactive. Then near the end it felt like the winner just goes to whoever was lucky enough to draw the most over powered cards from the faction deck.

**Orleans** - I had a blast playing this new bag building Euro! Everything starts out slow (1-2 actions in a round) then with careful planning you'll be getting 3-4 actions and it felt so satisfying.  Definitely hoping to play this more.

Games I've played before: **Terra Mystica**, **Mage Knight**, **Splendor** x3, **Galaxy Trucker**, **Biblios** 




 Probably not a common gripe but only my own for **Lords of Waterdeep**. I find the initial 2 quests+lords randomly dealt to a player involving too much luck. I usually go with card drafting for the initial 2 quests, then deal 2 keep 1 for lords. 




 **Splendor**. It takes about 30 seconds to setup, and 1 minute to learn the rules. Note that it is almost an abstract game with minimal social interaction, which is very different from the games that you currently play. 




 **Ingenious** is quite similar to Quirkle. Most of Knizia's games are abstract math games, examples include **Ra**, **Lost Cities** and **Kingdoms**. 




 Unlike Agricola, Caverna rewards you for specialising, so focus on one-two main scoring elements. Also, remember to use rubies at the right time, e.g. getting a tunnel before building a mine/animal right before breeding/using a high level dwarf etc. Sometimes it even takes opponents by surprise.

Not sure about the balance in weapons in a 3p game, as you said, it's powerful if only one does it. If two do it, the other person can easily build a strong farm+animal engine very easily. It's usually well balanced in a 4p game.

 **Terra Mystica**

Before TM I've played a few gateway games that I found slightly interesting - Catan, Carcassonne, Hanabi etc. But in those games you forget most of what you did the next day. TM is the first game where I find the whole game replaying in my head after I go home, regretting over bad decisions, feeling smug about good choices made, discussing strategies with friends, yearning to try new factions, and eventually became the game I purchased. 




 **Age of Empires III** - merchants, captains, soldiers, monks

**Manhattan Project** - workers, scientists, engineers

**Belfort** - Dwarves, Elves

**Lancaster** - workers with different skill levels, you are essentially bidding worker placement spots with workers

**The Ancient World** - workers with different skill levels. You can share a worker placement spot if you meet certain criteria (e.g. skill lvl workers already there)

**Viticulture** - each player has a special worker that can give you bonuses/use blocked spaces. 




 Nice! I was actually thinking of just buying cubes to replace the chips and be able to carry the game in a deck box.. 




 Yes we did. 
I was the first player to get 2 tuna boats while everyone else had one.

I also had other buildings that gave me income when 12-13 were rolled.  




 New to me - 

**XCOM** Decent real-time coop. Probably becomes better when everyone is familiar with the cards and aliens and can make decisions much quicker.

**Captains of Industry** The highlight of the week. Really interactive economic game! Players produce and set prices of resources and the market interactions follow closely microeconomic theories. Will definitely play again.

**Belfort** - Decent blend of worker placement and area control. It could get more vicious than other typical euros.

**Legendary: Aliens deck building game** - another alien themed coop. I like the sense of escalation and you really do need to help each other out in this game.

**Machi Koro w/ The Harbour Expansion** - the expansion is new to me. I think it makes the game too long for what it is. The Tuna Boat strategy is very strong, and I got two turns where I scored $30+ coins. Not sure if I want to play again.

Games I've played before:

**Shadowrun: Crossfire**, **Stone Age**, **Trajan**, **Terra Mystica** 




 When learning new games with an indefinite end, I usually ask the person who's teaching "how many rounds does the game usually last?"

It helps for planning a strategy.

For games like Tzolkin, you just have to assume that other people will screw you over whenever they can, so always be prepared for a shortened round. 




 Awesome!
It's interesting to see that it drops off slower than the overall 100. 




 Great chart!

Do you mind doing one for strategy games only? Thanks!
http://boardgamegeek.com/strategygames/browse/boardgame?sort=rank rankobjecttype=family rankobjectid=5497 




 That was me on the what did you play this week thread.

More details around the game:

New map, scoring for borders.

Final results for bidding- Shapeshifters 17, Nomads 12, Acolytes 4, Aurens 0

End game score:  Shapershifters 128, Aurens 125, Nomads 119, Acolytes 110 




 Carcassonne: Each cycle begins with a drafting of tiles. With N players, each player draws N tiles from the bag, keep 1, pass the rest along, repeat until the final tile. You should now have N tiles in your hand, This allows for N rounds of actions with the normal rules (without drawing a tile at the end of round). Repeat cycles until all tiles run out. 




 The paper is thin, like a normal card, so it could get bent easily. I know the tableau doesn't play a significant part in the game (the cards do), but a similar thickness to that of the Imperial Settlers tableau would be much better. 




 [Link to expansion rules](http://zmangames.com/rulebooks/Terra_Mystica_Fire_ _Ice.pdf)
Last page - new game options - factions for auction.

At the beginning of the game, draw 5 races out of the bag (the expansion comes with faction tokens). Start a round robin auction using victory points. Winner gets to choose which race he/she wants and also the starting position. Repeat until all races have been chosen. The person who chooses last will always pay 0.

This way, there is still an incentive for people to play weak races as you probably won't need to pay for using it. Obviously the bidding only works when all players are experienced and are able to estimate the point differences for each faction after initial setup. 




 Since the board for placing rooms to be built have all the details, don't bother taking out the rooms from the box until someone decide to build a room. Then the player will find the tile from the box, and put a token of some sort on the board for placing rooms to indicate it has been built. 




 Great week for me.

Games new to me:

**The Ancient World** x2: Lovely tableau building Euro about expanding your empire and fighting titans. Player interaction mainly through active blocking and card drafting. Only issue with it is the poorly manufactured tableau and I had no idea why they had to put dice rolling into it.

**Chicago Express** - Fast paced game about buying shares and running train companies. Loved the semi-cooperative element in it. Not sure about replayability as there is no variability in setup.

**Fauna** - great family game. Love it when everyone gets it wrong.

Games that I played before:

**Terra Mystica** w/Fire and Ice. Played the Shapeshifters by bidding it with 17 points at the beginning. Won by 3 points. The bidding mechanism does make the game a lot tighter.

**Panamax** x 2 - Still my top game of 2014. Looking forward to playing with an entire table of experienced players. Rules explanation is so tiring..

**Greed** - A filler that I don't mind playing.

**Orleans** - Tried the monk strategy and won. I should be able to get a few more plays out of this before it gets repetitive.

**Tzolkin** x 2 - Some day I will win at this.

**Shadowrun: Crossfire** x 4 - Bought my first ability. Hoping to play at least twice a week to save up karma for some better abilities! 




 Interesting perspective on interactions and replayability! 

I just played Chicago Express today - it was roughly an hour though, are you referring to another game? 




 I have only been boardgaming for a year, and am curious about what long time gamers think about the boardgaming world over the past years/decades.

Has your favourite (or top-3) games changed many times?

Have you tried so many games that most new games feel "sort of like X, with the mechanic of Y and Z"?

What are the most noticeable changes in the boardgaming world? Do you like what you're seeing?  

Thanks! 
























 I think it also depends on the size of your gaming group. If your gaming group is expanding and you find that sometimes 2 tables are playing at the same time, then I think it's very reasonable to purchase more games. 




 To give another perspective, you should also think about whether **your gaming group** is ready for Terra Mystica. You/your group seem to be mostly into interactive and thematic games but TM, whilst being an excellent strategy game (and my personal favourite), brings a different vibe to the table. As my friend once said, if he sees my game of TM with silent players hands folded, staring at the board intensely, he knows that we're having some serious fun.

Mage knight is really good as a solo game anyways so if you enjoy character progression and action point optimisation, and don't mind reading rules I'd suggest buying it. 




 There's a whole range of boardgames that could be played solo  available:
[BGG link](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/search/boardgame?sort=rank advsearch=1 q= include%5Bdesignerid%5D= include%5Bpublisherid%5D= geekitemname= range%5Byearpublished%5D%5Bmin%5D= range%5Byearpublished%5D%5Bmax%5D= range%5Bminage%5D%5Bmax%5D= range%5Bnumvoters%5D%5Bmin%5D= range%5Bnumweights%5D%5Bmin%5D= range%5Bminplayers%5D%5Bmax%5D=1 range%5Bmaxplayers%5D%5Bmin%5D=1 range%5Bleastplaytime%5D%5Bmin%5D= range%5Bplaytime%5D%5Bmax%5D= floatrange%5Bavgrating%5D%5Bmin%5D=6 floatrange%5Bavgrating%5D%5Bmax%5D=10 floatrange%5Bavgweight%5D%5Bmin%5D= floatrange%5Bavgweight%5D%5Bmax%5D= playerrangetype=normal B1=Submit)

Also, technically all fully cooperative games (e.g. **Pandemic**) can be played solo. You just have to take up the role of more than 1 player yourself.
 




 What are specific details that made you appreciate the attention to details that board game designers have put in a game? It may be something subtle in the rule book, designs on the board, player aids etc.

For me, I have found the following useful:

1. Easy reference sheet on the back of the rule book (instead of credits!) to explain various icons so that you don't have waste time flipping through the book.

2. If money is open information and is used frequently, use a resource track on the board to indicate how much each player has. Also makes the game less fiddly.

3. Different icons in addition to player colours for the colour blind players. 




 Looks like you enjoy Euros so obligatory: **Power Grid**, **Keyflower**, **Eclipse** and **Lords of Waterdeep w/ expansion**.
 




 The rules are on BGG already, and Rahdo plays through the game in his video. 

I do agree with your point on stretch goals. 




 Have you tried the mini-expansion? It adds a few interesting element with the new engineers and bonus tiles. As there is a public pool of really strong bonus tiles there's more of an incentive to rush to get it. 




 Pretty solid month for me, listing from my least to most favourite:

**Machi Koro The Harbour Expansion** - Dragged the base game much longer, and in truth everyone is just waiting to buy the tuna boat.

**Ghost Stories** - Too relentless as a co-op, not much feeling of reward/satisfaction when you kill ghosts as more of them just keep on coming. 

**X-COM** - Pretty neat asymmetric roles in a real time co-op. Maybe I'm just not a big fan of co-ops though..

**Xia - Legends of a Drift System** - A 4 hour game (with 5p) that depended on dice rolling....I did win by shipping goods (with Lone Drifter and Manchester it's really easy). It's fun if you like a lot of chaos and random outcomes I guess.

**Kemet** - The design is very solid and the tech tree is pretty interesting. A bit too vicious for me.

**Chicago Express** - Fast paced economic game with bidding mechanism. No variability in setup though.

*Summoner Wars** - Quick head-to-head battling card game. Getting to exploit your own faction's strengths is pretty fun.

**The Ancient World** - A nice little mix of mechanics but nothing really groundbreaking in this game. A decent gateway worker placement.

**Belfort** - Area control game with worker placement mechanics. It seemed harmless but the play style of each game is different due to the special buildings that comes out. I love worker placement with variable powers of workers so this fits the bill.

**Captains of Industry** - A (mostly) closed economy game where players produce, buy and sell resources to each other. Lovely interactions with a great simulation to micro-economics. Would definitely replay.

**CO2** - Very intricate Euro but once you get pass learning the rules it's very fun to build combos and getting what you exactly need in a round. I love games where there seem to be very limited actions (15 turns per player in a 4p game) but there are actually a lot of decision making required. Players also need to pay a lot of attention to what other people are planning and capable to do on their turn. 




 **Scoville** - a new game about planting and harvesting peppers. If you stand between two fields of red pepper and blue pepper...you harvest a purple pepper. You get points for planting peppers on the fields and spending peppers you own on recipes/quests.  




 In 4-5 player games, players need to make much tougher decisions:

1. Initial placements: obviously you will have to think harder when more players are present on the board. 

2. Map is much tighter: Triple terra-forms, upgrading to 3-shipping, using priests as workers...you seldom see this happening in a 2p game but be prepared to do so once you get blocked in a 5p game.

3. Power generation is much quicker, but the good power actions are easily taken in the first action of any given round.

4. Cult tracks are much tighter - in a 2p game if you've fallen behind on a track you just don't bother moving up. Same for largest network.

5. Favour tiles and Town tiles. There are 3 of each in the level 1-2 favour tiles, and 2 of each for town tiles (in the base game). This means you could pretty much guarantee to get what you want in a 2p game. Definitely not happening in a 5p game.

6. Variability. It's just maths. The combination of factions present on the board becomes much more varied with a 4-5p game. You'll need to keep an eye on more player's special abilities. 




 Yup! I learned Caverna before I played Agricola so on my first play through I felt constrained and under accomplished.

Then I played Caverna about 10 more times and eventually got bored as there is practically no random setup. You don't need to plan that much ahead as there are way too many alternatives. I've switched back to Agricola and find it much more satisfying when a plan works out! 




 **Shadowrun: Crossfire** or **Legendary deck building games** to a Harry Potter theme. 




 Have played **Pictomania**. It's one of my favourite party games! The rules are very simple, basically there is a common board of topics on display and you are randomly assigned one of it to draw, but you have to guess other people's drawings quickly at the same time.

There's a variety of difficulty that players can choose, from easy ones like submarine, goat, gardener, to abstract ones like who, bored, insurance. 




 **Nippon** - from the designers of Panamax. Probably out in Essen?

**The Gallerist** - from the designer of Kanban. Should be on kickstarter soon.

**La Granja** - waiting for a reprint in the summer! 




 **The Resistance: Avalon**, **Game of Thrones (2nd ed)**, **BSG**, **Cosmic Encounter**, 

Betrayal and backstabbing are just not within my definition of fun. 




 Not boring, but standard as in getting duplicate ingredients, testing twice, publish a theory. Sure the artifacts mix things up a bit, but you can't really plan too much ahead as it will depend on the test results. 




 Alchemists is a good game, but I don't think it is that replayable. Once everyone knows the procedure of crossing out boxes, the first two rounds become fairly standard. 
























 Based on your ratings, we have a pretty similar taste in euro games. The most suitable one is probably **Argent: the Consortium** where you use minis as workers for worker placement. It's decent with 2 players but probably best at 3-4.

Otherwise, minis usually mean thematic RPG (**Arcadia Quest**), Co-ops (**Mice and Mystics**) or map based area control games which only excels at high player count (**Kemet**, **Cyclades**). 




 A lot of people don't update their ratings to games, so BGG top 100 will never represent "the best 100 games out there" but rather "the Hall of Fame of 100 games". That's the reason why some successors and the original games are both in the top 100 (e.g. **War of the Ring**, **Imperial 2030** etc) 









 It's a neat little game that is fun to bring out every once in a while - best when you have actually forgotten about everything you did in your previous game. That's because it's completely deterministic. There is no random setup. The same buildings always comes out at a fixed time. Therefore I do not recommend replaying it frequently. 




 I do not recommend Bohnanza for 5p. Trading becomes too easy, and the game lasts too long for what it is. 




 I think so. When introducing a new game to a group, some basic labeling would help you find the right crowd. For example, "an area control game about engine-building and resource management (~Euro)" receives attention from a different crowd than "an area control game about betrayal and hidden identity (~Amerithrash)".

It's not about whether one is better than which. It's just a quick and simple way to identify with the right crowd. 




 Long-term goals: Grow to 4-5 dwarves, fill up most of your board, find 2-3 ways to accumulate a lot of points. Unlike Agricola, Caverna rewards specialising, not diversfying.

Mid-term goals: Food engine and dwellings. It might be sowing/ breeding/adventures/ eating resources. Whatever your strategy is, it's optimal to build corresponding rooms. 

Tactical choices: Rubies are extremely powerful. Uses include - getting a pair of animals before breeding, digging a tunnel to build a mine, getting veg and grain before sowing, going out of turn for a big adventure etc. It's good to keep 1-2 rubies in front of you to keep your opponents nervous. 




 Solo: **Mage Night**

2-p: **Castles of Burgundy**

3-p: **Le Havre**

4-p: **Terra Mystica**

5-p: **El Grande**

6-p: **Pictomania**

7+: None. I'd rather split the group into 2 games. 




 It sounds like a co-op game would fit all 3 criteria.

**Shadowrun: Crossfire** games are relatively short and you can set your own difficulty. It also incorporates permanent upgrades to your characters as you play the game repeatedly.

**Robinson Crusoe** is a co-op survival game that scales from 1 to 4 players. 




 If that's the only criteria, [this](https://boardgamegeek.com/search/boardgame?sort=bggrating advsearch=1 q= include%5Bdesignerid%5D= include%5Bpublisherid%5D= geekitemname= range%5Byearpublished%5D%5Bmin%5D= range%5Byearpublished%5D%5Bmax%5D= range%5Bminage%5D%5Bmax%5D= range%5Bnumvoters%5D%5Bmin%5D=100 range%5Bnumweights%5D%5Bmin%5D= range%5Bminplayers%5D%5Bmax%5D= range%5Bmaxplayers%5D%5Bmin%5D= range%5Bleastplaytime%5D%5Bmin%5D= range%5Bplaytime%5D%5Bmax%5D= floatrange%5Bavgrating%5D%5Bmin%5D=7 floatrange%5Bavgrating%5D%5Bmax%5D=10 floatrange%5Bavgweight%5D%5Bmin%5D=4 floatrange%5Bavgweight%5D%5Bmax%5D=5 colfiltertype= searchuser=test_subject2751 nosubtypes%5B0%5D=boardgameexpansion playerrangetype=normal B1=Submit) is probably what you're after.

But **Mage Knight**, **Kanban**/**Vinhos**, **18xx**, **Here I Stand**, **Twilight Imperium** are all heavy games that are on par with Through the Ages but they are vastly different games. It would therefore be more helpful if you provide more information:  What did you like/dislike about Through the Ages? What's your usual player count? 




 Games new to me:

**The Doge Ship** - An average worker placement game. I'm usually up for dry euros, but I feel like there's mostly tactical play in this game and not enough strategy. 

**Formula D** - We played the base game only. A lot of probabilities and calculations involved, but I'd say it's a good game if you don't take the dice rolls too seriously.

Games that I've played before:

**Kanban** - taught it to 3 newbies but they all got on quickly. It's always a blast making jokes about office culture and meetings during the game.

**Panamax** - Probably my second favourite in 2014 after Kanban. Taking the offshore account card secured my win.

**Castles of Mad King Ludwig** - Probably my third favourite in 2014 still. The score updating is still a bit fiddly and the presence of AP players are what my ratings down.

**Agricola** x2 - Made a huge mistake that I probably will not forget whenever I play Agricola in the future....after having the baking tray I used the Major Improvement space to build the clay oven as I forgot that it could be built as a Minor Improvement. Lesson learnt at a severe cost.

**Splendor** - I still enjoy the game as a filler but probably will not voluntarily suggest bringing it out any more. 




 Have you tried the **Terra Mystica Fire and Ice Expansion** yet? It changes the base game quite a lot.

I'm pretty sure you would enjoy **Panamax**, **Kanban**, **Vinhos**, and **Brass**. 




 I recommend trying at [London On Board](http://www.meetup.com/LondonOnBoard/events/). There's a meetup practically every day and it's quite easy to find people to join Eclipse. I have seen it played every other week. 




 Borrowing examples from well known games:

Ownership of buildings that other players may use at a cost (**Le Havre**, **Lords of Waterdeep**, **Keyflower**)

Anything with area control (**Belfort**, **Dominant Species**)

Sharing stakes in the same company (**Imperial 2030**, **Panamax**, **Chicago Express**) 




 Yup. It's not about drawing well, it's about highlighting key concepts and getting it done quickly so you can start guessing other people's drawings. 




 **Pictomania** is a ton of fun, I highly recommend it. In a N player game, each round there will be a 7 x N matrix of items/events/ideas and players are assigned a specific column and row to draw (e.g., Column X, Row 3). Therefore, you are already certain that no-one else is drawing anything from Row 3. Drawing and guessing happens simultaneously, and you receive points if other players guess your drawing correctly and vice versa, with a speed bonus.

Players are rewarded for **creativity** - expressing themselves concisely, **deduction** - sort of sudoku like when you're not entirely sure what other players are drawing, and **boldness** - making quick guesses on other players' drawings. 

A minor con to the game is that it tests players' knowledge on actual historical figures (e.g. King Arthur), objects (e.g. U boat vs shipping boat) and pop culture (how do you draw the 7 books of Harry Potter differently?). Obviously if players get uncomfortable these cards could be removed by player consensus when they are drawn. 




 All pretty safe bets for ~4p games: **Lords of Waterdeep**, **Dead of Winter**, **Sheriff of Nottingham**, **Hanabi**, **Castles of Mad King Ludwig**, **Dominion** 
























 I dislike games with traitor mechanism or those that require backstabbing. I just can't identify any fun factor. Why do people find lying and deceit to be fun? 
The only game I can stand in this genre is One Night Ultimate Werewolf because it lasts 10 minutes. 




 Whilst I agree with your points, it would be more accurately named as "successful medium-heavy game designs".  




 Before buying the copy, why not try it online at boardgamearena.com to see whether it's really what you are looking for? 




 I've won with the strategy you described, but I've also won before by rushing the knights to gain more early actions, then dominating movement and trading posts. 

The issue I have with the game is a more generalised description of the above: the lack of variability and a deterministic opening two rounds. This means there are standard opening moves for knight strategy, scribes strategy, cog strategy etc. 




 Don't waste the back page of the rule back with credits! Put something useful there - icon references, FAQs, explanation to end game scoring, just generally things that players may need to look up frequently. 




 I've taught 3 games now...and it's really tiring. Another issue is that no matter how many times I tell newbies "it's really important to get cars, don't just focus on training and getting seats", there's always one player that ends up with only 1 car and loses by a margin of 40+ points. 




 **Terra Mystica with expansion** - played Chaos Magicians, came in second and lost to Riverwalkers. If the Aurens were not in play I could have gotten more points off the cult track..

**Agricola** - 5p tournament game in which food was brutally tight. Pulled a close win by playing the Braggart in round 12.

**Goa** - finally tried this. Love the tech tree upgrade aspect but I'm never a big fan of auction games..

**Nations the Dice Game** - Fits the bill for a light civilisation/drafting game that plays under an hour. I expect to be playing a few more games of this. 

**Elysium** - I've played a few 3p games before and didn't realise 4p could be so cruel. Every move is a blocking move! Gives a very different feel compared to a 3p game.

**Kanban** - Great game. I hope to play a game with all experienced players some time. Teaching to newbies is very tiring.

**Small world** - Still not a big fan but I'd still play it from time to time.

**Castles of Mad King Ludwig** - Very tight and enjoyable game. Just don't play with players with AP..

+Various fillers including **For Sale**, **Perudo**, **6 nimmt**, **Criminal Dance**, **Troll** 




 Looking forward to **The Gallerist**, **Nippon**, and the **Castles of Burgundy** spinoffs, although the Gallerist will be on kickstarter anyways.. 




 I've been to the Yellow Submarine in Tokyo and they have a good selection. Links to Yellow Submarine Osaka shop:

 If there's no luck in a coop game, it means that there will always be an optimal solution. Experienced players will recognise and suggest the optimal solution while the inexperienced players sit there executing the plan. This is why cooperative games almost always need luck of some sort, so that your attitude to risk is an input to your strategy.

Relatively speaking, **Robinson Crusoe** and **Hanabi** has less luck involved. **Mysterium** also has minimal luck but it's a different type of coop game. 




 I think if a group have tried a variety of games and decided they don't like social deduction, then it's just a matter of taste. It's the same answer to "how to get my friends to like euro games/war games/broccoli/horror films etc" 




 While I own and enjoy both **Kanban** and **Panamax**, I don't think they would be games that you're looking for based on the games you listed above. With a 4-p game, it **always** go beyond 2 hours. In my opinion they get recommended regularly partly because they came out in 2014 and new games always attract more attention.

For mid-weight economic games, I'd suggesting trying **Power Grid**, **Chicago Express**, **Imperial 2030**, **Concordia**? Perhaps even **Terra Mystica** or **Brass**?

For mid-weight worker placement games, I'd suggest trying **Manhattan Project**, **Tzolkin**. **Dominant Species** also seem to be a good fit for your group as you enjoy cut-throat games. 




 Exactly my thoughts. In **Macao** you get coloured cubes that don't represent anything and you can spend money to buy points, can't get more pasted-on theme than that. 




 I really enjoy 3p games. In 2p, the dummy player introduces extra randomness. In 4-5p, there's a lower need in paying attention to other players' choices. I think 3p presents the best player interaction in terms of phase selection. 




 Asmadi games published the beta pnp version online: [link](http://asmadigames.com/MottainaiPnP.pdf)

I've played Impulse but not Innovation. It's slightly similar to Impulse where everyone contributes a card to the "phase order track" so whichever role you choose it will benefit other players. One difference is that the role card you choose this round will not be activated again next round - instead your previous role would be discarded into the "pool". Similar to GtR, cards from the pool could be hired as clients or taken as materials.

Even with a few cards that allow you to directly steal things, Mottainai had less direct confrontation compared to Impulse. It's also not as obvious who is winning, as players could reveal cards from the hand at the end of game to score extra points. 




 Went to a weekend convention here in the UK so I managed to play 33 games last week, but I'll just post the memorable ones :P

**Elysium** x2 - Very simple yet brain burning drafting + set collection game. Plays within an hour and a lot of player interaction for a Euro. It was a hit at our con. Only complain is that you're never sure what will be available next round (unless you play with a certain deck).

**Roll for the Galaxy** - Full of interesting decisions yet very quick. One of the most played games at the con. The other two are probably Elysium and Quartermaster General.

**Argent: the Consortium** x2 - My fifth play and still enjoying it thoroughly. Everyone was in the run for winning until the final reveal. 

**Panamax** - Played it many times but this is the first time to play with a full table of experienced euro gamers. Lots of table talk. It was INTENSE. Scores ended up 94-94-108-114 which surprised all of us.

**Terra Mystica** x2 - Still my all time favourite. Riverwalkers were fun to play with.

**Aquasphere** - I wish it could be more strategic. Ends up being very tactical and you just have to be at the right place at the right time.

**Captains of Industry** - I love economic games but I'm starting to have mixed feelings about this game. The random time tracker can be annoying at times.

**Mottainai** - It felt like a constipated version of Glory to Rome as the pool was always empty. Just doesn't flow as well, but perhaps we made some rule mistakes.

**Red7** - A pleasant surprise following the disappointment in Mottainai. Very clever and fluid game once everyone understand how to break ties. I should pick up a copy.

**Scoville** x2 - A decent game. Both times I played the final round seemed like an anticlimax though.

**St. Petersburg (2nd ed)** - Clever game, but gives a clear advantage to experienced players who know the distribution of cards by heart. 




 1. **Terra Mystica**

2. **Agricola**

3. **Mage Knight**

4. **Kanban**

5. **Castles of Burgundy**

6. **Panamax**

7. **Concordia**

8. **Le Havre**

9. **Brass**

10. **Glory to Rome** 





























 I find the Little Prince a very cutthroat game sometimes! 









 Obligatory **Castles of Burgundy** and **Trajan** since you like Feldian games.

You can try out **Tzolkin** on boardgamearena before making a decision.

**Panamax** doesn't work well with 2. 




 I don't think an outsider could do anything much about a sore loser really, except maybe play low conflict or co-operative games. 

Maybe keep reminding them, one way or another, that game groups only exist when everyone is having fun.  




 Fields of Arle actually gives a very different feel from Agricola. If you enjoy the resource management, progression in technologies and personal farm with a relatively low stress level, then Fields of Arle would be a good game for you - there's basically no food pressure. If you enjoy the high stress level, competing for action spaces, and synergising with cards, then Agricola is still the better option. 




 Decent week for me:

**The Voyages of Marco Polo** x 2 - You know a game is good when you still look forward to the next play after losing badly.

**La Granja** - Interesting mix of mechanics and almost abstract farming. 

**Arboretum** - The cards look nice and rules are simple. A decent filler for me.

**Kraftwagen** - Quick playing action selection game that is surprisingly cutthroat. However, the research cards somehow is a bit too random.

**Nations** - My second play. I'm usually a fan of resource management games but  I don't really enjoy this one. For its length, it is too punishing for someone who lags behind, random cards in the new age makes it more tactical/take-that than strategic, and the feeling of progress across ages is just incremental as you are constantly tearing down old buildings. Not sure I would want to replay again.

**Evolution** - Pretty neat idea and simple to play. 

**Pandemic: Contagion** - Mediocre light cube pushing game. I don't feel like I'm making meaningful choices in the game. 




 Have you tried **Quartermaster General**? It's a fast playing 3 vs 3 WWII game that plays under an hour. Easy to pick up, varying player powers for the 6 countries, and surprisingly each game plays out quite differently. 




 Yes. I was in the exact same position as you last year. I live in the UK and ordered from amazon.de. Just print the rules from bgg. 




 you spend more time thinking about board games than actually playing them. 




 Nice collection! We share a lot of similar taste in games. If you are looking for any new games, I'd recommend **Roll for the Galaxy**, **Elysium**, **La Granja** and  **Voyages of Marco Polo**. 




 I'm a cult of the "new", not in the sense of games that have just released, but in relations to learning new games. I like learning mechanics that are new to me, appreciating clever subtle designs, and discovering  strategies. When playing "old" games with standard strategies, I sometimes find myself on auto-pilot mode. Perhaps I belong in a subset of Cult of the New called **Cult of Discovery**. 




 Probably good enough for a collection oriented towards low conflict family games. Great for introducing someone to modern board games (see **Catan**, **Ticket to Ride**, **Hanabi**, **Carcassonne**, **Dominion**). However, there will be many types of games the collection will never reach: games with high conflict, games with high stress level and strategy, and games with deceit. 




 Have you tried **Game of thrones the board game** or **Kemet**? Each player is dealt a hand of cards with different values/attributes, symmetric in Kemet and asymmetric in GoT. The twist is that the cards you use are temporarily discarded and only come back to your hand until you have spent your last (or penultimate, can't remember) card. Therefore, you have to pick your battles. 




 I taught Marco Polo to about 10 different players. I love how each time I hear how their initial reaction being "this is super powerful, how is this not broken" then after playing switches to "this is actually quite difficult to use". 




 A fruitful week!

**Voyages of Marco Polo** x 4. Tried out another 4 of the characters, making each game feeling very different. And most importantly, every single player that I have taught the game to enjoyed it too.

**La Granja** x 2. A Feldian farming game! Love the multi-use cards and range of flexibility that this creates. Excited to try out more strategies from the different helpers.

**Roll for the Galaxy** - I love games with low down time so I'm certain this will remain one of my favourite short games.

**Pictomania** - Great fun, especially when players think of abstract and creative ways to draw! Loved the table talk too.

**Dungeon Petz** - a great example of a thematic Euro. Rewards careful planning and risk management. The bidding bit was probably my least favourite part, but it was always fun to make up back stories to the pets you have, which appeals to a group of players who usually couldn't care less about theme.  




 I would say it's quite realistic. I've played a fair bit (30+ games), and in 4p games usually at least 1 player manages to form a 3rd town. Obviously not as likely in 5p games.
Examples of my own:

[Dwarves](http://terra.snellman.net/game/emanova3)

[Mermaids + Darklings](http://terra.snellman.net/game/4pLeague_S6_D7L25_G3)

[Mermaids + Nomads](http://terra.snellman.net/game/4pLeague_S7_D6L24_G7)

[Nomads + Witches](http://terra.snellman.net/game/4pLeague_S7_D6L24_G5)

[Swarmlings](http://terra.snellman.net/game/4pLeague_S6_D7L25_G7)

[Halflings](http://terra.snellman.net/faction/4pLeague_S6_D7L25_G4/halflings/)

[Witches](http://terra.snellman.net/game/4pLeague_S7_D6L24_G2)        

Tips:

* It's easier for certain races (Nomads, Witches, Mermaids, Riverwalkers, Yetis)
* Be prepared to lose a fair amount of points (10) throughout the game for power leeches.
* 3 towns =/= win, as you can see from my examples.
* Try to avoid spending 3 workers to dig as much as possible.
* Sometimes you have to pass early to secure the bridge next turn. 




 Ranked by my preference:

**The Voyages of Marco Polo** - Best Euro of 2015 to date. I give credit to the designer's bold choice of radically different player powers. This will be in the top 100 on BGG very shortly.

**Clash of Cultures** - Rock solid tech tree in a civ game. I can see multiple viable strategies. Too bad I always suck at military and defending.

**Kraftwagen** - Neat action selection mechanism in a light Euro setting. I was initially worried about the imbalance of the research cards, but it didn't turn out to be that bad - some suggest a variant of revealing 3 cards instead of 2.

**Goa** - Very interesting bidding system and tech tree. The luck element was slightly annoying in an otherwise fine Euro.

**Patchistory** - Another civ game with a nice patching minigame. The auction mechanism is interesting but it dragged out the game as the bidding process could be quite slow.

**A fake artist goes to New York** - Awesome party game for the end of the night. Probably the best 2,000 yen I spent. 

---Dividing line between good and mediocre games---

**Nations the Dice Game** - Scratches the itch for a 45 minutes light dice driven drafting game. Nothing innovative here so it is not as replayable as **Roll for the Galaxy**.

**Criminal Dance** - a silly party game for non-gamers. Probably more fun with family and children.

**Temporum** - Not particularly interesting card game. Usually there's only one logical choice on your turn. 




 That's an interesting mix - I have to say it's rare to see players enjoying both Terra Mystica and Elder Sign.

As for Mage Knight, I'd recommend playing it solo at least twice before teaching other players. You will still inevitably get some rules wrong, so even then I recommend playing the co-op version as the first multiplayer game. Oh but it will be a very satisfying and rewarding experience at the end. 




 If your group has a website (e.g. meetup), it's useful and efficient for players to just prearrange a game. 




 **The Voyages of Marco Polo** - definitely the highlight of the week. At first there seems to be nothing revolutionary about the game: resource management, worker (dice) placement, route building with secret objectives etc. However, the radically different player powers changes the game entirely. Plus bonus points for variable setup! I can see myself playing 10+ games of this by the end of the year. Instant favourite of 2015.

**Fields of Arle** - Solid resource management game for 2. However, it doesn't feel too competitive, as even in the rulebook it says that this is a "development game". Too much of a sandbox for me. Still prefer Agricola.

**Clash of Cultures** - Awesome civ game. I do love the tech tree, but same as every other Civ game, I lose because I was too trusting to my opponents.

**Glen More** - A light Euro that plays within an hour. Probably best with 3 or 4 as you can plan ahead a bit. Too chaotic with 5.

**Agricola** - A 2p teaching game. Ended up with 53-40 with the help of Woodcutter, Market Woman and Stone Tongs.

**Temporum** - A mediocre card game where players try to be in the right place at the right time....and drawing the right cards. 




 Wow! Really looking forward to this. Stronghold games has become my favourite publisher. Lots of solid euros: **Kanban**, **Panamax**, **La Granja**, then **504**.
