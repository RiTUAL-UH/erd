 That user tried to give a technical argument.  He argued that the military like reddit AND the military internet traffic is routed through Eglin.   This does not spoil a theory of the military manipulating reddit.  It just means that there is no proof.  




 Is it not completely logical that they would do something like this?  Do you really think that the military would allow users to browse the internet using IP addresses traceable to geolocations ?  It could be used by an enemy to give away the position of their troops and other useful intelligence.  There are countless other security reasons that they would route military internet traffic through central hubs on a VPN and not just allow everyone to connect direct using the local ISP.  

I'm not precluding anything dodgy going on but the explanation given is a reasonable basis on which to start theories. 









 This is one way I see them of handling the crisis.

Not seen many develop the theory.

However, ideas and rumours are making it to the news

If not war in the middle east, then some other world event to knock oil prices up.   N Korea?

Anyone else seeing such coverage or ideas?  Some dismiss it as anti-putin propaganda but I think it makes sense for some kind of covert provocation to rattle markets  and increase oil futures. 




 It is just how i see military logic panning out.  They got got some dangerous people there but they do not have the political will to keep them there.  So you got to wonder what options they consider.  Discussion of "criminals" implies a justice system.  Gitmo is outside of that.   









 I don't see how it affects peoples view of SOPA.     In fact people are going to be more in favor of piracy if corporations or goverments  are going to restrict what gets broadcast. 




 


Strange thing that happened in the heart of the U.S., the ill-famed cesspool of injustice, is now afloat in the world as shocking news.

The Sony Pictures Entertainment, the biggest movie producer in the U.S., which produced the undesirable reactionary film "The Interview" daring hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and agitating even terrorism and had a plan to distribute it, was exposed to surprisingly sophisticated, destructive and threatening cyber warfare and has been thrown into a bottomless quagmire after suffering property losses worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

The public in the U.S. is now describing this case as "disgrace suffered by Sony Pictures Entertainment," "very sorry thing caused by the U.S.," "Sony Pictures Entertainment showing a white flag before hackers" and the "unprecedented disaster suffered by the U.S."

Those who meted out a stern punishment of justice were reported to be cyber experts styling themselves "guardians of peace".

Seized with terrible horror and threat in face of their merciless hacking attack in retaliation against unjust actions, many movie and drama distributors in North America including 41 states of the U.S. and Canada immediately canceled the screening of the reactionary movie. And it was reported that the Sony Pictures Entertainment which directly sponsored its production and distribution hastily issued a statement on Dec. 25 that it would suspend the screening of the undesirable movie which had been planned in 63 countries.

The NDC of the DPRK highly estimates the righteous action taken by the "guardians of peace," though it is not aware of their residence.

It, at the same time, considers as fortunate the step taken by the Sony Pictures Entertainment to give up the overall distribution of the above-said movie due to the decision and strong pressure of the movie and drama distributors for stopping the screening of the reactionary movie, though belatedly.

This is an official stand of the army and the people of the DPRK on what happened in the heart of the U.S.

This stand is taken by the DPRK because the movie "The Interview" is an undesirable and reactionary one justifying and inciting terrorism which should not be allowed in any country and any region.

Another reason is that the movie is run through with a story agitating a vicious and dastardly method of assassinating a head of a legitimate sovereign state.

No wonder, even political and social circles of the U.S. commented that it is quite wrong to defame the head of the state for the mere reason that his politics is different from that of the U.S. and it is in the hostile relationship with the latter and, therefore, the Sony Pictures Entertainment got into a serious trouble and paid a due price.

For these reasons, the DPRK is more highly praising the "guardians of peace" for their righteous deed which prevented in advance the evil cycle of retaliation-- terrorism sparks terrorism.

It is quite natural that the movie and drama producers should refrain from undesirable deeds contrary to the noble mission to lead morality and civilization.

But what matters is that the U.S. and its followers are groundlessly trumpeting that the recent cyber attack was made by the DPRK.

The FBI issued the results of the investigation into the hack at the Sony Pictures Entertainment on December 19.

According to them, it suffered tremendous losses.

One may say this is the due price incurred by wrong deed, the evil act of hurting others.

The U.S. released a statement asserting that this loss was caused by the DPRK.

No matter how big and disgraceful the loss may be, the U.S. should not pull up others for no reason.

The FBI presented a report on the results of technical analysis of hacking program used by the "guardians of peace" for this attack, citing it as the ground that the serious hacking was caused by the DPRK.

The report says the malignant code had access to north Korea's IP already known several times and the hacking methods applied in the "March 20 hacking case" and during cyber warfare against media and various other computer networks in south Korea in recent years are similar to that applied against the Sony Pictures Entertainment this time, being another ground that "this was done by the north".

The report, in particular, adds that the malignant code and algorithm applied during the attack are similar to what was used during the hacking attack on south Korea, citing it as a proof.

Not satisfied with those groundless "evidence", the FBI is letting loose ambiguous remarks that it is hard to fully prove due to the "protection of sensitive information sources."

This means self-acknowledgement that the "assertion about the north's deed" came from an intentional allegation rather than scientific evidence.

It is a common sense that the method of cyber warfare is almost similar worldwide. Different sorts of hacking programs and codes are used in cyberspace.

If somebody used U.S.-made hacking programs and codes and applied their instruction or encoding method, perhaps, the "wise" FBI, too, could not but admit that it would be hard to decisively assert that the attack was done by the U.S.

Moreover, the DPRK has never attempted nor made a "cyber-attack" on south Korea. The rumor about "cyber-attack" by the DPRK was a concoction made by the south Korean puppet regime and its plot.

After all, the grounds cited by the FBI in its announcement were all based on obscure sci-tech data and false story and, accordingly, the announcement itself is another fabrication. This is the DPRK's stand on the U.S. gangster-like behavior against it.

What is grave is that U.S. President Obama is recklessly making the rumor about "DPRK's cyber-attack on Sony Pictures" a fait accompli while crying out for symmetric counteraction, strict calculation and additionally retaliatory sanctions.

This is like beating air after being hit hard. A saying goes every sin brings its punishment with it. It is best for the guilty to repent of its evil doings and draw a lesson when forced to pay dearly for them.

The DPRK has clear evidence that the U.S. administration was deeply involved in the making of such dishonest reactionary movie.

It is said that the movie was conceived and produced according to the "guidelines" of the U.S. authorities who contended that such movies hurting the dignity of the DPRK supreme leadership and inciting terrorism against it would be used in an effective way as "propaganda against north Korea".

The U.S. Department of State's special human rights envoy went the lengths of urging the movie makers to keep all scenes insulting the dignity of the DPRK supreme leadership in the movie, saying it is needed to "vex the north Korean government".

The facts glaringly show that the U.S. is the chief culprit of terrorism as it has loudly called for combating terrorism everywhere in the world but schemed behind the scene to produce and distribute movies inciting it in various countries of the world.

It is not exaggeration to say in the light of the prevailing situation that the U.S. administration and President Obama looking after the overall state affairs of the U.S. have been behind the case.

Can he really cover up the crimes he has committed by trying so hard to falsify the truth and turn white to black.

So we watched with unusual attention what had been done by the "guardians of peace" to avert terrorism and defend justice.

Yet, we do not know who or where they are but we can surely say that they are supporters and sympathizers with the DPRK.

The army and people of the DPRK who aspire after justice and truth and value conscience have hundreds of millions of supporters and sympathizers, known or unknown, who have turned out in the sacred war against terrorism and the U.S. imperialists, the chieftain of aggression, to accomplish the just cause.

Obama personally declared in public the "symmetric counteraction", a disgraceful behavior.

There is no need to guess what kind of thing the "symmetric counteraction" is like but the army and people of the DPRK will never be browbeaten by such a thing.

The DPRK has already launched the toughest counteraction. Nothing is more serious miscalculation than guessing that just a single movie production company is the target of this counteraction. Our target is all the citadels of the U.S. imperialists who earned the bitterest grudge of all Koreans.

The army and people of the DPRK are fully ready to stand in confrontation with the U.S. in all war spaces including cyber warfare space to blow up those citadels.

Our toughest counteraction will be boldly taken against the White House, the Pentagon and the whole U.S. mainland, the cesspool of terrorism, by far surpassing the "symmetric counteraction" declared by Obama.

This is the invariable toughest stand of the army and people of the DPRK.

Fighters for justice including "guardians of peace" who turned out in the sacred drive for cooperation in the fight against the U.S. to defend human justice and conscience and to dismember the U.S. imperialists, the root cause of all sorts of evils and kingpin of injustice, are sharpening bayonets not only in the U.S. mainland but in all other parts of the world.

The just struggle to be waged by them across the world will bring achievements thousands of times greater than the hacking attack on the Sony Pictures Entertainment.

It is the truth and inevitability of the historical development that justice prevails over injustice.

Whoever challenges justice by toeing the line of the biggest criminal U.S. will never be able to escape merciless punishment as it is the target of the sacred drive for cooperation in the fight against the U.S.

The U.S. should reflect on its evil doings that put itself in such a trouble, apologize to the Koreans and other people of the world and should not dare pull up others.

 It would not surprise me if it is standard procedure for when a hijacked plane turns towards a city. 




 I always wonder why they don't poison them just before release.  Some  long term illness like cancer that might not be noticed for years.   they could induce it by exposing prisoners to carcinogens .  That way they neutralise threats and can get rid of the political blemish. 

































































































































 i only wanted him to change the way lobbiest and money influence policy.  All the things in the image just seem like consequences of a tainted system of democracy. 




 What  if ISIL stopped executing hostages and instead, they just filmed sequences of endless torture using the same techniques of the CIA.   I am trying to imagine how the America media would dress it up .  

I think it is the lack of outrage on torture that is the problem.  I won't complain about people reacting to the"The interview" release unless it becomes clear that the sony reaction has been all about boosting dvd sales.
 




  People love to vote on quick fix images over effort posts.  Just another day on reddit 









 In the category of stunning, heartening, woefully underreported good news: In 2000, an estimated 9.9million children around the world died before age 5. In 2013, the figure was 6.3million. That is 3.6 million fewer deaths, even as the worlds population increased by about 1 billion.


There are a variety of reasons for increased child survival, including improved prevention of malaria and HIV. But according to a recent report in the Lancet, about half of these gains came from reductions in pneumonia, diarrhea and measles  diseases addressed by vaccination. 


What is exceptional about this particular public good is how much of it has been generated by a single source.  - Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance  supports vaccination for nearly 60 percent of the worlds children. It is a global conspiracy of health.

Gavi provides heavy but eventually diminishing subsidies for immunizations in poor countries. It also acts as a sort of purchasing co-op, helping nations get better prices on vaccines. And it amounts to a guaranteed market for vaccines that would not otherwise be profitable to research and produce.

Apply what you say to the media in general, then you got a point . 




 fair enough they want to overthrow Assad and you are right that it is a wider point.  I agree it is supporting one side more than another but I don't think it is a level of interference that should be polticised.  I expect that there are real and unsavory ways that they do support effort against Assad.  

 These militants in Syria are responsible for targeting civilians, were they doing that to Israel's people the medical care would precede imprisonment.

Indeed they would. I hope they would arrest those suspected of war crimes.  However, for them it is  syrian rebels fighting in a syrian civil war.  They probably don't ask too many questions.  




 I don't see it as ridiculous to characterise humanitarian assistance as a humanitarian act .  Do you want them not to treat fighters or not to be there at all?

 Not sure of the equivalence of Hamas.  Maybe you can explain that?  

  




 in a way I admire it.  I had little appreciation of the power of economic sanctions but looking at this and looking back to what happened in soviet times help me see the power.  Of course a country struggling economically can react in a few undesirable ways.

 I don't think people have a realistic understanding of what torture is.  If we substituted the word  "torture" for "rape" people might react a bit different and feel horrified.   It is just a word but it triggers people to the reality of what it is rather than viewing it as an enhanced interrogation technique.

I expect Shoving hummus up rectums is considered sexual assault/rape in some contexts and so this is how it should be described.
 




 A programmer would give you advice about programming.  I can explain how to do it in HTML but it sounds like you are looking for a piece of software or an online wizard.

However, I think Sony are trying to make the most of it now and will make big money out of the movie.  It is easy to slip into thinking that they planned it from the start.   However, I believe that there is real damage being done in the leaks. 

 









 Is there a broader point here that I am missing?  This is just combat footage/ hospital footage.  Treating the injured whether friends or enemies is a pretty basic and human thing.  I hope that people are not going to try and politicise it.  There are so many other things to notice about this region. 




 Vladimir Putin has blamed the west for the current crisis, and hes not alone. While locals have likened it to an economic war, some western commentators agree.
Earlier this year, back when oil was still at around $88 a barrel, New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman pointed the finger squarely at the US for the collapse.
Widely accepted in Russia, is that the US and Saudi Arabia are colluding to keep production artificially high in a bid to drive the price down.
The net result has been to make life difficult for Russia and Iran, at a time when Saudi Arabia and America are confronting both of them in a proxy war in Syria, he wrote. This is business, but it also has the feel of war by other means: oil.

**Just as they did to the last leaders of the Soviet Union, the Americans and Saudis are trying to pump them to  death**

 So the government is justified to use of anti-terrorism laws in local law enforcement ?   I've heard the funding terrorism argument enough when fighting small crime.    














 The constant distrust in the system is what has historically given rise to fascism

Check what happened in the 1930's with distrust of public officials etc.

So the current sentiment of how terrible the government is and how impossible everything seems to be a repeat of what empowered facists. 

  I will write more on it some time.  I know people here think their constant outrage at the system is a good thing.  Maybe it is healthy.  However, I see it as a danger.  It just depends on what predators are lurking.

Background : 


An off-shoot of the PID (Paul is Dead) phenomenon / legend.  I find the whole PID thing interesting, simply with regard to how many weird splinter theories have popped up:

* Paul died, and was replaced

* Paul did NOT die, but was replaced (often called "PWR" instead of "PID")

* Paul did not die, and was not replaced, but the "clues" point to a **SPIRITUAL** death and rebirth, as seen in Christianity, the ancient mystery schools, the occult, etc.  (The symbolic death and rebirth theory is a favorite of mine, and IMO one of the more plausible theories)

* ALL of The Beatles were replaced (Personally, I find this one extra silly. Replacing one guy would be hard enough. Replacing four of the most known guys on the planet? Good luck with that. Some people also insist that *many* celebrities were  replaced. Bob Dylan, Davy Jones, etc...)

* The Beatles were part of a conspiracy by The Tavistock Institute (and/or other groups) to change social attitudes, and/or destroy Christianity (be a  les(s), and/or brainwash youth.


I believe thebeatlesneverexisted.com falls somewhere between the last two categories. The general theory being that for some reason, The Powers That Be wanted to force social change in the 1960s, which they accomplished using "tools" like The Beatles. This is usually considered in a sinister light. I find some versions of this theory to be more plausible than others. 

A researcher named Dave McGowan theorizes that the **entire** hippy movement / psychedelic rock scene in the 1960's was started by the government, as a social engineering project. Some aspects of this story are strange, and seem unbelievable, but he's collected a bit of information, some of which does seem... odd...

For example, some of the big psychedelic rock pioneers and legends come from military / intelligence families. For example, Jim Morrison's dad was one of these. Famously, when asked about his parents by reporters, Morrison claimed his parents were dead. (If memory serves, this can even be seen in Oliver Stone's biopic)  In reality, of course, this was not true. Now, this could be because he (or "they" if you want to be all spooky and conspiracy theory about it) wanted to distance himself from his military parents. And that *could* be to throw people off the trail of the conspiracy. But it could just as easily be due to the fact that rebel rocker Jim didn't want it known that he was a military brat. 

One of the things that makes this story somewhat plausible to me, however... there is some minor evidence that the government / intelligence community may have been "behind" some of the proliferation of psychedelic use, and psychedelic culture. The CIA experimented with LSD for many years before it hit the streets. They even tested it on unwitting civilians, in one or two now-declassified programs. And some of the early major LSD "cooks" and gurus have ties to government and intelligence. Owsley. Leary. If you know much abut the history of Tim Leary, you may know he wrote a personality test the government supposedly uses to this day. And you may also know that the man got into quite a bit of hot water, and almost seemed to miraculously "weasel" out of it, unscathed. The Life article that popularized Magic Mushrooms? By R Gordon Wasson. A banker who supposedly had intelligence ties. The mushroom article that so fascinated the public, published in Life magazine, owned by Henry Luce. Another man with intelligence ties. 

It's a bit complex and convoluted, but really fascinating stuff, if you're willing to read with an open mind. 


You can read quite a bit more about Dave McGowan's theories about the ties between Hippies, Psychedelics, and the Intelligence community, in his work "Inside the LC" (Laurel Canyon, in California) on his website:

http://www.davesweb.cnchost.com/


You can read more about the CIA's experiments with LSD (and much more) in the book "Acid Dreams: The Complete Social History of LSD: the CIA, the Sixties, and Beyond"  By Martin A Lee, and Bruce Shlain. Really excellent book. I can't recommend it enough.

And you can read (or listen) to more about intelligence ties to psychedelic culture (and lots of other related, and unrelated topics) over at Jan Irvin's website, "Gnostic Media."

http://www.gnosticmedia.com/

[Jan Irvin Interview:  Creation of the Drug Culture](http://www.gnosticmedia.com/the-corbett-report-interview-672-jan-irvin-on-the-cia-mk-ultra-and-the-creation-of-the-drug-culture/)


Tying all this back to The Beatles?  Well, let's just pretend for a moment that the government, or some other group *did* want people to take psychedelic drugs for some reason...  What better way to make it look more attractive, than to get Paul McCartney ("the cute one") on TV talking, quite unapologetically, about how *he* had taken it?


Or maybe that's not what happened at all. It's fun/interesting to think about, though.

Hopefully someone finds this interesting.

 Gamers... haven't lost a single fight in the history of the internet. Every single time they have ever fought in an issue dealing with censorship, insane ass people, and even against very idiotic journalists. They have won time and time again in the past in almost a unstoppable manner.
We survived the 80/90's of parental fears and censorship by creating our own version of the ratings scale which is far more accurate and far better than even the movie industry. Instead of Teen rated games dragging down M rated games, each and every rating is independent and has remained so even in the wake of insanity that is Jack Thompson and California's insane bills.
Jack Thompson is dis-barred and I am pretty sure he is officially looning it out somewhere in Florida. I could be wrong but I think that is the last place he was at. (Actually. This would actually be a pretty fascinating interview for some post career thing.)
Anyone involved with the California bill has pretty much been a laughing stock since then.
Then there are authors who have went on Fox news to talk about the evil's of video games and video gamers responded by trashing their books. In a way that is very petty but it does have the effect of getting the message clear... one which the anti-gamer gate really needs to listen to.
Gamers are done being harassed.
I have said this before in previous topics but I will restate it once more. Gamers are done being bullied. They want to peacefully be able to play video games, occasional read about video games and be able to feel like they aren't being judged for the games they play anymore. This is really simply it.
And do you know something, Gamergate has lasted over TWO FUCKING MONTHS NOW!
Two months of it under constant attack for simply asking questions. In all honesty, this kind of retention rate for something on the internet if fucking astounding in and of itself. Most people thought this would be done in a week, nope. Not even ME3's ending pissed people off this damn much.
And judging by how tweets are going. This movement is only getting bigger and being talked about more and after the bully storm that is the mainsteam press is done when it usually does in terms of insulting gamers constantly. The dust will list and Gamergate is still going to be here.
Wanna know why I know Gamergate is literally not going to be negatively effected by this?
Because Gamergate is full of gamers.
Gamers... are the most terrifying force on the entirety of the internet in existence. I say this as a gamer but in terms of forces you sincerely do not want to fuck with. It's gamers.
Gamers by all definitions do not have a 'give up' thought in their brains. They believe otherwise. No matter how impossible of a challenge it is. They will seek to overcome it no matter the obstacle. No matter how much abuse they take and no matter how long it takes. Gamers are unstoppable due to the fact that they are willing to do whatever it takes to achieve victory, they will do things thought impossible even by the games own rules or even exploit the rules to their own gain. They will wait and grind their power up until they can fully unleashed almost godlike characters within their games.
Even then, they are some of the kindest people in history, the fact is. Most people never actually willingly ever do evil playthroughs in their video games. Talk to developers about it, it's the truth, hell, most people never even touched renegade options in ME series. Then there is the fact that they even have helped supported countless charities. Hell, even now people on twitch are playing games so some kids with cancer can hopefully become cured one day! Then there are moments where there are some poor people who really haven't played a video game in their life and people actually donate game systems and video games to them so they can play.
The truth is that video gamers are willing to accept anyone into the hobby no matter the background. This has had some bad effects due to... well... assholes playing video games. But even then the truly despicable people are usually ostracized anyways.
Gamers are merciless, they are patient, They are kind, they are giving, they are absolutely terrifying.
Then there is the biggest fact of all that I think you all have noticed throughout this topic. Gamers do not actually care what gender you are. At all. The only reason you think they do is because people are pushing that gamers 'believe' in this or that without any real explaination or even proof. The truth is, yes, there are some assholes on xbox live and such, but are gamers as a whole assholes. Hell no. The fact is that we are not severely self policing ourselves just to prove without a shadow of a doubt that we don't take kindly to this shit should say that, even though there are assholes, we ourselves will help take care of them.
But most of this is ignored. Either due to the fact that mainstream media has always fucking despised us or the fact that game journalists have finally shown their true colors and decided that their audience is made up of assholes.
Gamers are not standing for it and this is the result. Gamergate, a movement which has been building for several years now. This is only going to become more and more well known until they cannot actually ignore gamergates side anymore. Then the house of cards will tumble and those that once thought of bullying us gamers will know that gamers wrath is fucking terrifying.
Game journalists. We don't need you anymore and Gamergate has sufficient proof of that, we can communicate on our own, recommend games on our own. We gamers don't need your bias anymore. Good luck when the final blow is struck because I can personally assure every journalist out there about this one fact.
Gamers are not just merciless, but vengeful, any job you will try and get in the future will immediately be intercepted and warned about your past behavior in public. This is what will happen and no place of integrity will ever touch you. Hell, even more fast food joints wouldn't even touch you if you have the kind of mouth people like Bob Chipman have about being pro censorship and even subjugating gamers who disagree with him to even the dude who helps run Gawker who wants to bully gamers.
You will never have jobs after this industry. Gamers remember and never forget and if you want proof. Look at Phil Fish for a moment and tell yourselves this. Will that man ever have a job after the shit he pulled? No, no he won't.
This is not a threat, but what will happen in the future just as I had known that Gamergate would have eventually happened one way or the other.
Honestly. If you are anti-GG you need to know these things. Gamers just want peace and ethics. But since it is obvious that it isn't going to happen. Expect this entire debate to continue onwards for years and it is going to become more and more serious.
Big edit. I should also mention that the word, 'impossible' is literally non-existent within gamers minds. This word and it's meaning holds no sway for gamers. These are people who, under 3 differing guilds within Everquest brought together 300 people to fight an ultimate dragon and actually managed to out heal it and out damage something people honestly thought was impossible to the point where developers shut down the fight and pissed everyone off for nearly winning something thought impossible.
Then there are people who actively accomplish impossible feats against even the largest forces possible in video games. Hell, just look at Dark Souls. That entire game series is built upon accomplishing fighting fallen Gods and actually fighting them with respect and end up becoming a bigger badass than all of them. Hell, just look at a game like the entirety of the Shin Megami Tensei series. A series literally built upon even the most common enemies being strong enough to absolutely murder your sorry ass and instead you have to prove you are a badass by kicking the hell out of everything ass.
Gamers don't understand what the word impossible even is. To them, it is a goal line to cross.

 I agree that it would be a great stunt but as a marketing stunt it would be limited to a vandalised facebook page or something.

It appears that real damage is being done beyond what a film can generate.  I am also sure that no-bullshit cyberdefence people will be looking into this especially if it appears as a government mandated attack.

 Sweden as a country that likes to pretend it champions net freedom, but itself does the exact opposite: did you know that Sweden has given the copyright industry powers of net surveillance that even the Police dont have?

Sweden likes to portray itself as a country that champions the importance of the net and its freedom, and is never late to criticize other countries, but is one of the worst offenders in the West when it comes to respecting this fantastic tool that upsets the old guard and the status quo.
Today, we look at the curious IPRED law in Sweden. It was introduced in silence and shadow in the summer of 2007 by the Justice Departments Stefan Johansson, who has also been Swedens and the EUs negotiator at the ACTA table, and who has frequently been seen at Swedens Association For Copyright.
The really insidious thing about the IPRED law is its name: it copies the name from a European directive (IPRED), but legislates things that the European directive explicitly doesnt contain or force Sweden to do. Therefore, politicians of all colors have defended themselves saying that Sweden must implement European Union directives, whereas in reality, they are pursuing their own agenda and trying to wash their hands of responsibility.

The law concerns the copyright industrys right to violate privacy  specifically, demanding subscriber identities of IP addresses, on allegations of violation of the copyright monopoly (typically, file sharing), and sue them in court where presumption of innocence does not apply. In Sweden, the Police may only break the privacy of identities behind IP addresses when the crime being investigated is severe enough to result in a jail sentence. But most file sharing cases have stayed at fines, and therefore, the Police does not have this power.

So Sweden has granted private corporate interests  the copyright industry  more extensive powers than the Police, in terms of cracking down on the Net and making dissent and civil disobedience dangerous.

 Britain should recruit british citizens to become fighters.  There would be plenty of volunteers especially if it was a government endorsed program to support the moderate syrian opposition and not terrorists.  Somehow they won't allow that but will fuel those already there including foreign fighters. 




 They aren't destroying online freedom.  They are monitoring it and eroding privacy.  The law of the country applies online and offline.  So question the fundamental laws.  "Freedom" should not only exist online and I think it is annoying that people try and reserve online as a place to be free.  People should be free everywhere especially scotland.

Want to make a difference in local government?  You want broadband included as a priority in your municipality?  If you live in a municipality that has any sort formal planning processes, you need to get it on the radar of your Planning Commission, and included in your Comprehensive or Master Plan.  The bad news is that if you live in a place where no formal planning takes place at all (e.g. all counties in Texas, as far as I know) you likely live in a place so red and "freedom loving" that the idea of "municipal" mostly doesn't exist.  Texas counties, for example, don't do any planning at all.  Many cities in Texas do plan, however.  Some even have massive budgets to do it with.

------------

**tl;dr:**  1)  Form a local interest group with focus, goals, and consistency.  2)  SHOW UP.  Get noticed.  3)  Find out who the decision makers are in your municipality.  Find out what they do, what they are required to do, where they get their authority.  YOUR OVERALL GOAL:  Get municipal broadband included in your municipalitys Comprehensive Plan as a defined community goal.

----------------

Step 1:  Form a *local* interest group.  Local is defined as people who live close enough together to meet time and again.  To get attention, your interest group doesn't have to be sane, rational or even right (half of regulars at your local Council/Commission meetings aren't).  I would recommend you be all three if you want to really be effective, though.  Your goal is not to lobby Washington D.C.; it is to lobby City Council Members/County Commissioners and Planning Commissioners.  You'll need:

-Leadership (not this "everybody-is-in-charge" OWS crap).  
-Goals (not this "we-want-everything" OWS crap).   
-Focus.  This goes along with Goals.  You must know what don't want, or are willing to give up (again, none of this "we-want-everything" OWS crap).  You are not Wage-Equality group.  You are not an Anti-Poverty group.  You are sure as hell not OWS or an offshoot.  You are the Municipal-Broadband Group.  This is what you are, this is who are.  You are an organization with clear, distinct goals and focus.  YOU ARE NOT OCCUPY WALL STREET.   
-Committed membership.  Commitment equal that of the retired, pissed-off old people who show up angry and pissed off at every meeting.  Commitment equal to those oldsters who will be dismissing you, belittling you, ignoring you, and trying to push you aside so they can talk about what *really* matters (like a new subdivision ordinance to let them up-zone their land and sell it for massive profit, for example).  This is where Step 2 comes into play.  SHOW UP.  
-Consistency.  You are nothing until every member of the City Council, every member of the Planning Commission, every County Commissioner, the Planning Director, the Public Works Director, and all of the Long-Range-tasked Planners in your muni know the names of every single one of your group's principles.  They should be on a first-name basis with you.  Until this happens, you don't matter.


Step 2:  SHOW UP.  Show up at meetings of your City Council/County Commissioners and show up at Planning Commission Meetings.  The only people who show up for these things regularly are the same 5-12 pissed-off old people, *every single time.*  This is because the meetings are boring, and no young person in their right mind wants to be there, not even me (If I'm there, it is because I am getting paid).  SHOW UP ANYWAY.  Your group should never let a meeting pass without at least one of your principles being present and accounted for.

Though I would recommend you come prepared to be all three; remember that you don't have to be have to be smart, informed, or even rational to get heard.  Half of the regulars there aren't, I guarantee it.  Don't let them intimidate you; half of them are suffering from dementia.  If you are smart enough to know what "Municipal Broadband" even is, and why it is good, you are probably smarter and better informed that anyone else in the room on your topic of choice.

Step 2a:  Remember what I said about the same pissed-off old people showing up time and again at local government and planning meetings?  Yeah, as an intermediate step you may find you have to first campaign for evening meetings in your municipality.  Seriously, a substantial number of "public" meetings are held when most of the productive working public is at work, which means you can't attend and no one in power has ever considered that this might even be a problem.  If you want a good indicator as to how much of your local policy is set by old people (e.g. retired people) just look up the meeting times in your muni for Council and Commission meetings.  That alone will tell you all you need to know about who really matters in your community.  If every Council and Commission meeting happens between the hours of 8-5, and you happen to be under 55, I've got a news flash for you:  YOU DON'T MATTER TO ANY OF YOUR ELECTED OFFICIALS, AND NEITHER TO ANY OF YOUR PEERS.  You don't matter because none of them have ever seen you before.

Step 3:  Research the following people and things:

All members of your City Council/County Commissioners.  
All members of your local Planning Commission (if you have one).
The Planning Director for your municipality (if you have one).
The Planners for your municipality (if they exist).
The Long-Range Planners for your municipality.  Each muni is different.  Some split Long- and Short-Range Planners into departments or sub-departments.  Some munis task only one Planner with everything.

Find out if you are in a GMA (Growth Management Act) state.  If you are, then your munis are partly governed by things called Comprehensive Plans.  These are mostly written by Planners tasked with Long-Range Planning, with input from the Planning Commission and the Public (that's you!).  *These things matter, in a GMA state they are supposed to have force of law.*  In a non-GMA state, they kind-of have force-of-law (it varies from state to state, and how much they matter really depends on who is in office at the time).  If you are in a GMA state and want municipal broadband, I don't see how it happens without this being worked into your muni's Comp Plan.  If you are not in a GMA state, you may still have a Comp Plan for your muni.  Find out if you have one, and when the next update is scheduled, and how you get involved.  If you live in a muni where Comp Plans exist and have force-of-law, getting Municipal Broadband included as Comp Plan goal is a HUGE step to making it a reality.  In a GMA state, you can potentially drag a muni before a State Hearings Board if the muni has a defined goal in their Comp Plan but take no steps to implement it.  Hearings Boards can sanction munis that violate their own Comp Plans. State funds can be withheld.

Step 3a:  GMA vs. non-GMA:  Find out how Plans are created in your state and in your muni.  Do you have a Growth Management Act (a state law) or equivalent that requires Planning?  Alternatively, do you live in a state where Planning is legal, but not required (e.g. Texas)?  

Examples:  Washington is a GMA state.  Planning is enabled and Comp Plans are required by law (RCW 36.70).  Most munis do not have an option about creating one, they must make one.  They must have certain required components.  Munis don't get to opt out.  Most Comp Plans end up with mostly the same structure, because the GMA says so.  If a WA State muni doesn't Plan correctly, they can be punished by the State for not doing so; by the Growth Management Hearings Board or the state legislature.  Idaho is a non-GMA state.  Comp Plans are required, but Idaho does not have GMHB equal to WA state.  There is basically no enforcement on Comp Plan creation in ID, and some of the Plans are really bad as a result.  Planning in Idaho is allowed to be done by munis through the Planning Enabling Act (Idaho Code Title 67, Chapter 65).  Munis are given almost complete freedom in the creation of their Comp Plans.  Comp Plans are still supposed to have the force of law.

Find out how your state and your muni do planning.  Get involved.

In general, remember that political will to enforce Comp Plan goals and policies is generally less in Redder states, and generally less in non-GMA states.

 I think people forget that the independent agencies like the FCC really aren't supposed to obey the will of the people - that's not their job. Their job is to regulate in the way they best see fit (whether or not the way they see fit is good is another argument). The premise of this (which is, as you said, technocratic) is that the will of the people isn't necessarily the best choice, and often *isn't* the best choice. People are very easily led astray or misguided.

Gotta also remember that Verizon sued the FCC about net-neutrality... *and won*. The FCC really cannot do *anything* at this point without doing a ridiculous amount of research, otherwise they risk being sued and losing again.

If you want what is supposed to be the will of the people involved, Congress needs to act. Organizations like the FCC were created so that they would be apolitical and unbiased (whether they are or not is questionable). It's also the reason that it's rather difficult for presidents to *remove* heads of independent agencies - it promotes them being apolitical, since they don't have to bend to the will of leadership. 




 FCC in February:  "It was a really close decision, but we've decided to ignore the entire nation's population and do what a handful of rich guys are telling us to do: destroy the internet." 




 I have good empathy but I'd be less tolerant of others' flaws if I won the lotto -- I'd tell a lot of people to sod off. 




 * "Don't tense up with the cold wind - relax, no really, relax, let it pass through you."
It was very Jedi, and it works... I just have to remember it, because it's a reflex to tense up in the cold.


* For the sake of the environment/your wallet, you DON'T need to leave the heat on all the way when you leave the house. DO leave it on a little bit, though. I generally turn it to about 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit). When you come home, turn it back up, put some new warm socks on and keep your sweater and hat on until it's warm again.

* When it's very cold outside, or you are leaving the house for a few days, you may need to leave the faucets running a little bit so they don't freeze up.

* Get plastic sheeting to insulate your windows, you essentially shrink-wrap it with a hairdryer and it creates a bubble of air that will block any drafts.

* Use thick curtains, but open them while the sun is out to let the heat in.

* Keep your doors closed inside the house.

* Make or buy draft stoppers from fabric and dense filling and put them at the base of your doors and windows.

* Cook a lot! Make sure you have proper ventilation for boiling, sauteing, etc. because the steam will cool down and it will actually be counterproductive. Baking is best, and after you bake leave the oven door open to let the heat escape into the room.

how much to give to charity.



    

                   

So the priest says, we'll

draw a circle on the ground...



    

                   

...we'll throw the money way up

in the air and whatever lands...



    

                   

inside the circle,

we give to charity.



    

                   

The minister says "no", we'll

draw a circle on the ground...



    

                   

throw the money way up in the air

and whatever lands outside...



    

                   

...that's what we give to charity.

The rabbi says "no, no, no"...



    

                   

we'll throw the money way

up in the air...

 The article/comment....  (It isn't that sort of website where traffic matters as there are no adverts)

----------------------------


So, the SpaceX hype turned out to be just that. An altogether more prosaic investment was announced to fund core operations.


SpaceX, currently embroiled in a court case with its benefactor the US government which elected to give SpaceX no part of a recent $11bn launch order (http://spacenews.com/42882filing-suggests-jurisdictional-challenge-in-spacex-lawsuit-against-us ) and on the heels of a recently crashed launch, needed cash. This investment is about funding its core operations, not about initiating some fantasy global satellite constellation about which no mention is made.


Google (who made no comment) are named alongside Fidelity as investors, but no amount is given. So, it could be the Google Charitable Foundation, and it could be $1 for all we know. Fidelity invests for a living.


Also, in typically cryptic fashion, no terms are mentioned. Ordinary shares, convertible loans, preference shares, exploding warrants, covenants and targets ?


The uninformative Spacex website merely has the text below, making it clear that proceeds are to fund continued innovation in the areas of space transport, reusability, and satellite manufacturing i.e. the core business was running out of money, and no mention of fleets of satellites.


Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) has raised a billion dollars in a financing round with two new investors, Google and Fidelity. They join existing investors Founders Fund, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Valor Equity Partners and Capricorn. Google and Fidelity will collectively own just under 10% of the company.


SpaceX designs, manufactures, and launches the worlds most advanced rockets and spacecraft. This funding will be used to support continued innovation in the areas of space transport, reusability, and satellite manufacturing.


Incredibly, newspspers of record like The Times reported last night the rumours, not the facts SpaceX is a private company and thus is subject to no stock market rules about truthful or complete press releases. Google made no announcement, suggesting nothing material has happened

http://i.imgur.com/7I4OvJ7.jpg 




 Costco again proves that you can treat employees well and pay them a fair wage while remaining competitive.  

Look into the history of costco management. They have very consistently and firmly stood by their employees.
A few years ago they were ridiculed by their investors for basically treating their employees too well (too much pay, too many benefits, etc). The CEO basically told the investors that they were welcomed to sell off their stock if they have a problem with it, but that the company has consistently been a good investment because of the decisions they make to stand by their employees and that he has no intention of changing that.

I have a lot of admiration for costco as a company.  All hail Costco ~ company of common sense and eminent reign.

 All the talk of mass surveillance is very dangerous if it doesn't come with some hope of a solution because it grants more perceptual power to a system that already has a radical, extreme and destabalising amount of it. All that is necessary to control others is the projected perception of power. That's why we have worked hard to break that perception, for example in the race to spirit Edward Snowden to asylum vs. Washington DC's race to arrest him, we won, demonstrating that with a few good ideas and some determination it is possible to beat this power cluster in a well defined head on contest.Solutions are going to come form the demand that organisations, governments and individuals have for protection. Don't be dispirited; a lot of people are now working rapidly on tools and standards to counter the mass surveillance attack. There's a great flowering in that field. 




 It's frustrating, the internet has become such a creepy "you are the product" medium. The more of this I see, I start to feel like I don't want to be a part of it anymore.

It's a common misconception that security and privacy are a trade-off, and that privacy must be sacrificed in order to increase security, however this is not necessarily true.  



Not only can we have security without sacrificing privacy, giving up privacy for security is less effective.

One thing forfeiting privacy does do is allow for more control (of *us*):  **[Privacy and Control](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/04/privacy_and_con.html)**


If we have a right to privacy, then shouldn't the government also have it (for secrecy)?  Absolutely not.  Here's why: **[Privacy and Power](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/03/privacy_and_pow.html)**

 How do your towers ultimately connect to the internet ?  Satellite or fiber or another ? 




   quick synopsis of battle. Keep in mind this is nowhere near to the degree of the story this thread is about.  

**1)** I'd been on Double Play getting 220 channels and HBO+streampix, encore, etc. 50mbps internet too, for 79.99 base price + $10 HD Fee. Pretty good monthly payments of just $96 bucks. I was proud that I managed to get my bill under $100. This has been in service since about Xmas, when I signed up.

**2)** As you all know, Comcast has been pushing X1 Triple Play for a while. X1 Double play was pretty much not allowed except in a select few markets. I wanted the X1 box for a while, due to the features and the UI. (Side note: it's not that great after all -- the UI is sluggish and the features are just so-so). So I finally saw X1TP package offer for 99/month for 12 months, NO contract. I said hey, this is a decent deal. I had no use for the phone, so the increased price due to phone service was always holding me back.

**3)** I sign up with a chat agent for the package. I typically use chat agents for signups, as I'm able to really think out my negotiating tactics with them. Anyways, there wasn't much negotiation to do in this case. She offered the $99 package, and said I'd keep all my existing channels, and that I'd now have X1 service and phone service.

**4)** Tech comes out and installs my stuff. Everything went great, and he was friendly. Techs always seem to be the best Comcast employees, though they're actually just contractors. He leaves, I check out the new X1. Then I realize A) my extra channels (the 80 extra over the 140) are now gone, and B) my HBO, Streampix, encore, etc are gone. 

**Uh oh Comcast.......HERE WE GO. Also, folks -- make sure you record every call with Comcast, whether phone or chat. You'll need it.**

**5)** Over the next 5 days, I end up battling it out with phone and chat support. The results are all over the fuckin place.

* Told I AM supposed to have the channels AND HBO+Streampix
* Told I am NOT supposed to have the channels
* Told a ticket was filed with senior authority regarding false advertising from the chat agents promising the channels. Was told I'd receive a 24hr callback. I tell them I bet it won't happen. She promises. Big surprise -- it didn't happen. Never actually received ANY call back in response to that ticket.

**6)** I continue to battle it out with them, and finally get a phone agent to enable my HBO. Turns out the agent that filed the ticket actually turned my HBO on, but never reset my box. STILL missing those extra 80 channels though.

**7)** This week, I called  and chatted to see about getting the promised 80 channels. No results, and agents tell me that I AM and am NOT supposed to receive them. What a surprise. Eventually I got fed up with them, told them they keep lying to me and can't give a straight. I got a little sideways with this particular agent (no name calling, just being aggressive about my disgust with the run around), when my modem suddenly just resets. TV never went out, I checked and zero outages reported. I found that incredibly suspicious, given the timing. After that, I give up and go to bed. It's like 3am.

Later on while researching, I realize 2 things:

A)	If youre signed up for Triple Play, Comcast will NOT allow you to see offers for Double Play packages, or any service level below your current one. All you can see is more expensive packages, and individual services.

B)	Comcast started offering X1 Double Play without announcing it. How did I find out? I had to go to their site, pretend to be a new customer, enter a bogus address down the street, and pull up offers for new customers.

**Theyre intentionally hiding this information from you, and the agent failed to inform me of the availability of the service, despite me making it clear that I had double play and wanted X1. So she intentionally sold me something she knew I didnt need, and the web people are in on it by keeping you from seeing this info without faking your way to the page.**
So I get on the phone and get an agent to sign me up for Preferred Double Play. In the end, I shot myself in the foot and added $20 to my bill, and all I gained was a $10 X1 box. Leaving my DP plan cost me another $10.

**Once she sets it all up, she says theres a $2 fee for disconnecting the phone services, and that Ill be billed for the Triple Play for 10 days. I say ABSOLUTELY NOT, theres a 30 day guarantee for customers, stated in clear terms on the site.

She responds that I dont qualify. Why?

A)	Im not a new customer. That is the biggest bullshit Ive ever heard, and its NOT in the terms.

B)	I didnt cancel ALL my services. Again, complete bullshit, and NOT in the terms.**




**8)** Fast forward to today. I sent an email yesterday (Wednesday) that was about 4 pages long to Comcast Cares, outlining my experiences with them. I tell them every last detail, I include chat logs, the whole deal.

I reference the exact terms of their 30 day guarantee, I let them know that if they cant support existing customers, how on Earth can they support NEW ones. Business 101 stuff. I request a refund on the Triple Play services for the 10 days, and request that my original 79.99 plan be re-instated on the bill for those 10 days, then they can switch me over to the Preferred.

Im still waiting to hear back.

The other hidden term in the doom-sayers is a misreading of history. People recite the Microsoft/Apple war endlessly, but it really didnt happen that way. For a start, it was not Microsoft that made the PC the de facto standard, but IBM. With its massive brand leadership in business, when Big Blue decided to go with MS and Intel architecture, everyone else had to follow or go under. Atari, Amiga, and all the CP/m systems vanished within a few years. The only non-IBM clone survivor was Apple. However, IBM did not do so well out of it either, and eventually exited the market, selling its ThinkPad line to Lenovo. Most of the other players from the 80s and 90s are also long gone. Microsoft did prosper, but it did so on OEM buy-in for Windows, and subsequently on major systems like Exchange servers, and the ubiquity of Office. 












































 I hope that, despite his persecution, people will follow Aaron's example of conscientious action and his commitment to the ideals of honesty and openness.

I think it's interesting that the government chose this particular case to go after Aaron on, especially considering that JSTOR didn't press any charges. I wonder if has anything to do with the way that the corporate state has locked up a lot of our society's knowledge in private database and expensive subscription system. I think Aaron's attack on this restrictive system was not so much a material threat as a symbolic one, and presented a serious challenge to a system that maintains legitimacy by keeping most of the public ignorant about its nature and its history. In such a circumstance, spreading information freely to the public is pretty much a revolutionary act.

These 'solutions' promote widespread pesticide and herbicide use and make genetic changes with absolutely unknown future impact. Monsanto's patented corn genes have already spread into the wild with unknown consequences.

 So tell me which countries specifically  and even better point to the  telecommunication regulation ?  The rest of the world is not a utopia but USA is hellish and must be near the bottom of the pile. 




 Worth mentioning that the Netherlands was the first European country to have neutrality by law. I don't think any corporations could change that but I do wonder about how much of the horrible corporate culture in America spreads into international operations. 




 They signed the voluntary code of practice now.     




 No.  However, the USA seemed for a while the most [corrupt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture
) for a mature economy especially on this issue.


Many other countries had corporations pushing their own voluntary net neutrality code BEFORE the regulators stepped in because corporations fear the regulators elsewhere.

I know I am making sweeping statements.  Hence, I was asking for specific countries that seemed to be at risk of loosing net neutrality or risked following a US decision.. 




 Which countries are you thinking of ?  Only America has a Comcast problem and regulators whose first instinct is to serve corporations.

 Thursdays historic vote by the Federal Communications Commission to reclassify broadband was not the first but merely the latest step toward regulating speech. The FCC voted to no longer classify broadband as a Title I entity (of the Communications Act) but instead as a Title II entity, like common carriers such as telephone service. The commissions three Democrats approved the change over the dissent of the agencys two Republican commissioners.

Anyone who believes this vote was about preserving a free and open Internet as so-called net neutrality supporters have claimed has not been paying close attention. One only has to revisit statements and actions undertaken by Administration officials in the last several years to understand the end-game.

President Barack Obamas first-term chairman of the FCC was former Harvard Law School classmate, Julius Genachowski. Genachowski directed a multi-pronged effort aimed at increasing government control of news, information, and entertainment.

The FCCs ill-conceived National Broadband Plan, was the first round in moving electronic media (the dominant form of information distribution) from other platforms (e.g. broadcast) to broadband.

The goal, claimed Genachowski, was to make the spectrum occupied by television broadcasters available to other wireless platforms such as cellular telephones. That was merely the excuse. By virtue of the broadband reclassification vote, the regulatory light touch of the Internet, which allowed it flourish in the past couple of decades, was abandoned in favor of the heavy-hand of government regulation.

Perhaps to mollify critics, the agencys Democratic commissioners insist they will exclude Internet service providers from some of the other Title II regulatory burdens placed on telephony.

Does anyone truly believe DC politicians will resist the urge to extract billions of dollars in payments from Internet service providers as they currently do with telephony in order feed the Universal Service Fund? The USF was a reelection windfall for Obama. It was used as a slush fund to hand-out the notoriously nicknamed Obama phones to low-income voters. About 2.2 billion dollars in Obama phones were given away in 2012.

There were other FCC actions that signaled the Democratic majoritys desire to regulate content.

The Future of the Media inquiry fell well-outside the agencys statutory charter. The 468-page report addressed topics in which the agency did not have the expertise to properly evaluate the information it collected including company business models, corporate debt levels, newsroom staffing policies, and print industry operations.

The report contained what could be one of Washington, D.C.s greatest juxtapositions. The executive summarys opening statement was In most ways todays media landscape is more vibrant than ever, offering faster and cheaper distribution networks, fewer barriers to entry, and more ways to consume information. Choice abounds. Apparently, this leads to the conclusion that this better-faster-cheaper-more-abundant media needs government regulation.

Another regulatory agency, the Federal Trade Commission, also unqualified and without statutory authority, launched its own effort to improve journalism. The FTCs Reinvention of Journalism discussed several proposals to reinvent journalism, including some that would drastically alter the media landscape and severely impede a free press.

The staff discussion draft suggests a news licensing arrangement be adopted, perhaps with the governments help and support. That suggestion of licensing news organizations should send shivers down the spine of any First Amendment supporter.

Another proposal was [a] national Fund for Local News [to] be created with money the Federal Communications Commission now collects from or could impose on telecom users, television and radio broadcast licensees, or Internet service providers [emphasis added]. Does anyone still think the FCC wouldnt demand broadband providers pay into the onerous Universal Service Fund in order to fund government-approved new entities?

I could continue ad infinitum with the FTC report but you get the idea.

Meanwhile, allies of the Obama White House and influential advocates of regulated content, such as Free Press, have been completely transparent in their wishes. They call for the government to spend as much as $30 billion annually to fund approved news operations.

Lawrence Strickling, the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information, is the principal advisor to the president on telecommunications and information policy. As assistant secretary, he proposed the government regulate Internet content. [W]e rely on the Internet for essential social purposes: health, energy, efficiency and education. He added, There [should] be rules or laws created to protect our interests.

In 2009, Cass Sunstein was appointed to head the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. Fourteen years earlier his book Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech revealed his hostility toward the First Amendment. Like Free Press and the FTC, he argued (in a subsequent book) in favor of government subsidised (sic) programming, and that the government might impose must carry rules on the most popular Websites, designed to ensure more exposure to substantive questions, and the government implement a Fairness Doctrine for the Internet requiring some websites to offer opposing viewpoints.

One can easily imagine which websites would receive universal carriage and which would be mandated to carry opposing views.

  I find that last part of the title ludicrous and looking at the article they never make the assertion anywhere that it can be successful just because of it's timeslot

Yes well done!  That is why the title says it has  "every chance of success" rather than aserting that the show will be successful for its time slot.


  A show being show at 8pm on a Sunday on BBC TWO does NOT guarantee any popularity for the show.

Yes! You sure speak the truth!

  Making this ridiculous suggestion that Top Gear was popular because of that timeslot is just stupid.

Yes that would be ridiculous.  Hence no nobody said that!   

There was only a suggestion that the timeslot for this series isn't a dead one and is one which might inherit top gears audience. The articles says "Airheads is likely to appeal to the same male audiences as the car show".    Stuff like that actually happens and is something tv schedulers think about.   I think the fact it isn't on a childrens tv time slot like the early robotwars is significant and a good thing.

 As long as its framed as reasonable network management." I dislike the vague and undefined nature of "reasonable". To them, reasonable, in terms of the legality of file-sharing would be zero file-sharing, right?

The FCC is smart enough to know it would be difficult to force ISPs to take action by law in terms of demanding that they willfully damage their own business, so now expect to see pressure steadily applied to the ISPs, so they voluntarily choose to "do the right thing".

We have already witnessed the MPAA abusing any law that helps them shut down piracy and I see these loopholes in net neutrality being heavily abused by the MPAA as soon as they can get started on that.

Sure, Net Neutrality does have its good points, but doesn't feel like its good for our way of doing things. The main problem has always been their continued failure to see downloads and lost sales as two quite different things and so they pursue file-sharing doggedly to ensure that we rush out and buy their products. Frankly, if TV broadcasting was better and not full of shows for dumb people and as many commercial breaks as they can squeeze in - I wouldn't even need to download.

I also dislike their notion that you are not entitled to your privacy, unless you're willing to pay for a service to ensure you get privacy.


Reasonable Network Management needs to be explicitly defined such as the ability to counter a DDoS attack. Throttling unlimited data customers on mobile networks because you want to get more money from them or using man in the middle attacks on BitTorrent traffic have been the result of the vague reasonable network management definition.


But at the end of the day, it is weird to even suggest that the economy revolve around "hollywood".  Since when did that happen.

Basically the article  says that all innovation and technology that could be disruptive (outside of their ownership) can be considered illegal. It took labels TEN years to consider digital files as "legitimate". Independent content is never "legitimate". They always consider streaming services as "illegitimate". Every new technology has this hurdle and it's just been given the go ahead.

And penalties for abuse?  This copyright loophole is an end run that invalidates everything net neutrality was intended to do. It's useless.

There is nothing to increase competition. Nothing to reduce rates. Nothing that will immediately speed things up or increase service. Nothing that an average person can use to fight bad behavior or abuse of DMCA (which is more likely than pirating). Nothing to repair damage when whole domains are blocked erroneously. Now they approve of blocking technology. What did "we" win?

When the US is adopting something the Europeans are now dismantling tells us a lot, does it not? 




 You know Washington is on the wrong track with a regulation when even Brussels has a better idea. Witness the latest net-neutrality proposal from European Union leaders, which is smarter than the 300-page blobfish recently imposed by President Obamas Federal Communications Commission.

In response to demands from the European Parliament for net-neutrality regulations, EU member governments are discussing a Latvian plan that would leave the marketplace scope to set rates for different types of data transmission. While the proposal from the governments would require Internet-service providers to equally treat equivalent types of traffic when providing internet access servicesa big nod to proponents of net neutralityit would also allow providers to enter into agreements with content companies to ensure a specific level of service quality.

This isnt a full-throated commitment to letting market forces work on the European Internet. It would be better if the EU werent imposing any new rules on the telecommunications industry. Nevertheless, the provision opens the door to differential pricing, the bane of the net-neutrality crowd but potentially an important market tool for stimulating future investment.

Its also a major improvement on what the FCC did last month when it applied early-20th-century utility rules to the Internet. The key insight in Europe is that there needs to be some market involvement in pricing. The European proposal also waters down a plan to further limit the roaming charges mobile operators charge customers using services outside their home countries. Roaming already is subject to Brussels-imposed price caps, and the European Parliament and Commission are agitating to ban roaming charges.

Any final regulation will need to survive the European Parliament, where support for activist regulation is stronger. What Europe really needs to boost investment and pro-consumer competition would be a single market for telecommunications services, coupled with more reasonable antitrust enforcement to allow the consolidation Europes telecom market so sorely lacks.

Still, this climb down on net neutrality raises the prospect that the EU could end up with a more pro-investment business climate than the U.S. Not everyone wants to follow Washingtons lead in tightening governments grip on the Internet.

 http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/utorrent-downloading-client-hijacks-users-computers-to-steal-bitcoins-10091567.html

good job independent.  I thought it was bit shit for them but at least the put it right 














 I wonder if AMD or Nvidia will fight to be the official partner of Vive. That has to be worth something to them. 




 The only media source to have tested it themselves is beta news and they called the rumour  crap.   

http://betanews.com/2015/03/06/reports-that-utorrent-silently-installs-bitcoin-crapware-are-crap/

I don't think others wanted to sacrifice their tasty titles.  

Some really shit journalists just copy and pasting from reddit. 




 You see how the story evolves into one that cannot be confirmed or denied.  Then it is left to reddits circlejerk to vote up a scandal and hide the uncertainty.  Shit like this always happens when reddit and isn't helped by low quality journalism  




 No you didn't do that.   You just gave your opinion as a TL;DR and missed out key facts.  

Hence it is safer and more fair just to have rules that specify exact title.  This means people can get  upset at the media source rather than accusing OP of bias 




 My title is from the article.  That is my point.  You should direct your complaints to the article and not to the OP.  I just posted a link and followed subreddit rules.  

Your TL;DR is misleading because it does not accurately summarise the uncertainty of the article and how it uses a flimsy single source for which there is no evidence and something that the company has already denied. 




 Thanks that is interesting.  But what about TF own testing?   I'd be interested in what they actually believe.

They are just reporting what people are saying.  
Why are there "sides" in this producing evidence that people cannot replicate for themselves?  There is a lot of hysteria around this now and it wouldn't surprise me if people are being devious or whatever.   

I'd like to see some of the trusted media test it for themselves and not just report on internet rumours.   It isn't that hard to get the installer and see what happens.  Instead they are just making headlines. 

e.g. betanews test if for themseveles and call the rumor "crap".  
http://betanews.com/2015/03/06/reports-that-utorrent-silently-installs-bitcoin-crapware-are-crap/
 




 
Your TL;DR is also misleading and based on an unfounded internet rumour.  Lucky this is /r/technology and not the ministry of truth. 







































  
Giving BitTorrent the benefit of the doubt, there are three clear scenarios that could have caused this situation. Either the users are collectively mistaken; there is a lack of transparency in the software installation, leading to confusion amongst users; or there is a software fault whereby users are experiencing issues not otherwise intended 




   Update: BitTorrent has stressed that the Epic Scale software is not a "silent install," and we've confirmed it ourselves. The post has been updated with that information.

misleading to call it stealing 




 LONG LIVE THE KING 
























 Hey, I like the banner.  I hope we can use it for /r/vive.  If not now, in the future.    









 Sounds like it could be a user error 

 We design our software to ensure that partner software downloads don't occur without approval by the user. But given your report, weve also double-checked this particular offer, and have determined that it cannot be installed without user approval.

This unconfirmed rumour from a single user should not be on the top page of reddit. 




 Great comment.   It sums up why there is little public reaction to it the net neutrality debate unlike the US drama.  

Also EU corporations already volunteer a lot of their conduct because they fear the regulator stepping in .  It wasn't like they were even trying to be evil 




 
 "We're building tools and hopefully they're valuable to hardware partners who want to do it. In some cases, we'll take the leadership role in shipping stuff. But we're really just building tools for other people to continue. So you'll see more headsets."  Gabe Newell  

 The HTC Vive is a virtual reality platform that's shooting for the moon. It will likely be expensive, or at least more expensive than its competitors. Even if you're not walking around, you're waving your arms in 3D space with the controllers, and that's going to require a decent-sized area that's clear of obstruction

 This is just the opening salvo for Valve.  Valve likely doesn't care that much who "wins" the virtual reality game, as long as people buy games from Steam.

 Short answer is that it will depend  on the game.   




 Some discussion here
http://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/2xn19r/am_i_the_only_nearsighted_who_is_kinda_upset/

I think it is a yes but whether it is less optimal is unclear.  People need to keep asking about this.

 I wonder if we will be laughing at the bulkyness of both of these in the  future in the same way we can joke about the Brick phones. 




 Yes.  It is very much just HTC's implementation and device.   There also looks to be a lot of non-steam content on the vive via HTC.  I don't see it as valve hardware but it is their flagship for now.   

Check how steamvr is seen as a platform for different hardware in the same way that steam and android are platforms.   
https://steamdb.info/static/img/blog/53/steamvrplatform.png


I created /r/vive which is focused on the HTC device but fully expect /r/steamvr to have a lot of content that won''t make it to my subreddit.  As things are so early, there is a lot of overlap right now and people are not seeing the difference. 














 Good post.   I suppose some people were reading it  as *Vive la France !* 

I'm not entirely clear but some people are calling it "reVive" as that is what the logo says with "Vive" being the trademark friendly word. 

So if Vive  is a play on 'revive', we can see the dictionary meanings.

* as in to activate, set in motion, or take up again; renew:
* to restore to life or consciousness:
* to put on or show again.
* to make operative or valid again.
* to bring back into notice, use, or currency:
* to revive a subject of discussion.
* to quicken or renew in the mind; bring back:
* to revive memories.
* to reanimate or cheer 

which might make sense for future marketing campaigns. 








































































































 In the United States there is no specific constitutional guarantee on the privacy of correspondence. The secrecy of letters and correspondence is derived through litigation from the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In an 1877 case the U.S. Supreme Court stated:

 No law of Congress can place in the hands of officials connected with the Postal Service any authority to invade the secrecy of letters and such sealed packages in the mail; and all regulations adopted as to mail matter of this kind must be in subordination to the great principle embodied in the fourth amendment of the Constitution. 

The protection of the Fourth Amendment has been extended beyond the home in other instances. A protection similar to that of correspondence has even been argued to extend to the contents of trash cans outside one's house, although unsuccessfully. Like all rights derived through litigation, the secrecy of correspondence is subject to interpretations. By Supreme Court precedent, rights derived from the Fourth Amendment are limited by the legal test of a "reasonable expectation of privacy". 




 What if britain withdraws from the European Court of human rights?  This is exactly what the Tories are talking.

http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/03/tories-plan-uk-withdrawal-european-convention-on-human-rights

You see your entire copypasta argument supporting guaranteed rights instantly falls apart.


In the US, the Bill of Rights is seen as a sacred text, with any violation intolerable. 

Also compare this to the UK government where the will legally justify mass surveillance 

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/17/mass-surveillance-social-media-permitted-uk-law-charles-farr


So I'm certainly not the idiot here.  Top tip. Don't use copy pasta.

http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/24/gchq-nsa-surveillance-scandal 




 I think the citizens take it seriously and slowly those rights becomes an election issue.  The current government might not care until then. 

 




 Proofs that you can be a statue while being unable to grow a proper beard 




 http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/24/gchq-nsa-surveillance-scandal 




 I believe that virtually every single one of our international dank memes was invented or codified by the people of Chennai.  




 Fuck Comcast 




 Stopping these sneaky moves is important and necessary. But it's like bailing water out of a leaky boat. To plug the leak, reduce the influence of money in politics. 




 While your OP   is certainly aired in jest, I honestly believe we are in the midst of history in the making. While trying to avoid buying into hype and grandeur, let me elaborate a moment.

We've all read some writings from Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton (this guy is a true hero), Ben Franklin, Thomas Paine, John Adams (no less a hero, ironically HATED Hamilton), etc on these very topics. Similar was their plight and equal was their discontent, though it would inevitably grow much stronger nearer the Revolution itself. Their established, respected government encroached upon their fundamental rights. It was nothing new then, it's nothing new now.

Having watched the video, I am unable to separate them it from those letters and well known quotables from patriots long gone. Granted, no one is asking for revolution, at least, no one of any sense. But the fact remains that one day these silly little sketches from from a silly show finding their way to a website like may find their way into the textbooks text-tablets of our grandchildren. Will they speak of an evil, failed coup to cripple the Government's (No doubt by then the word will carry a capital G while the word "god" will not) enforcement of the law? Or will they be the words of activists who fought for human rights against an overreaching body? 

For all of our sakes, for our children's sakes, I sincerely hope it is the latter. May changes to policy, and more importantly, the world's attitude towards these issues, come swiftly and peacefully.

Let me pre-empt the critics.  Yes  some are reluctant to compare Snowden to the likes of Jefferson and Franklin. Please do not misunderstand. I know it's a big jump, but I don't see it as immediately inappropriate. Americans hold certain historical figures up high as a manner of culture. They deserve our respect and gratitude, but in truth they were humans who spoke up in their times. They were farmers, business men, lawyers. Both sets (activists then and now) committed treason in the name of human rights, and that is to be respected.

Now, we do not need a new bill with his face on it or anything. My position is simply that these events and issues will undoubtedly be marked in history, and that Snowden has had no small part in it.   #NSALookAtMyDick may well be an important chapter and history in the making.

 The trouble I find with that system is that it invites exceptions and conflicts

e.g. data protection act versus anti-terror legislation.

The American system isn't great but its simplicity seems better equipped for people to point to fundamental higher rights when making arguments.

Maybe a trained lawyer would have no problem describing the UK system but I get confused by it and don't find it empowering.

 This is what I'm talking about

  At the top of the Pyramid and you have the Rothschilds, the British Crown and the Vatican.  You can make a noise about lizard people to distract and create ridicule.  However, you cannot hide back the truth which is evident in the media every day. 




 Virtually every single one of our international sports were invented or codified by the British. Ping-pong was invented on the dining tables of England in the 19th century, and it was called Wiff-waff! And there, I think, you have the difference between the British and the rest of the world. Other nations, like the French, looked at a dining table and saw an opportunity to have dinner; the British saw it as an opportunity to play Wiff-waff.   So yeah you may call me 'Murican but I know why we have table tennis and why it ain't no ping pong.

If there is a message, things like games help individuals see the problem, futility and perhaps the solution for themselves 




 In the UK, the data protection act has teeth and is a hugely important for how organisations go about their business.   Not sure about exemptions but things like counter terrorist legisalation must make plenty of those for GCHQ.
https://www.gov.uk/data-protection/the-data-protection-act


 




 The Sovereigns assent is required to all bills passed by Parliament in order for them to become law.  This means that the Queen and British Crown is in ultimately in charge.  Never forget that.  England will prevail.
 




 
They are just afraid of how legislation will be used.  Look at the mess that the European court of human rights has caused and how it has crept much further than expected.

 




 The guardian is a leader on promoting the snowden leaks and disemination of information. That is *why* I mention it.

Now ask yourself - what if a country offers justice, justice in the form of a charter of liberties, allowing every man to forage for his hearth, to be safe from conviction without cause or prison without charge, to work, eat and live on the sweat of his own brow - and be as merry as he can.  That would be a free and land.  But it would require a royal decree.

 Everywhere else is like Britain.  It is the empire on which the sun never sets. 




 The US government is concerned with the actions of the NSA because citizens have rights expressly declared in the Constitution. The NSA has violated those rights which delegitimizes the government itself. So the situation is taken seriously.

Elsewhere like Britain, there are no guaranteed rights. The only concern for the relevant parties is reserved for trouble makers like the Guardian newspaper, who insist on keeping the citizens informed.

 On December 2nd, 2013 a man was shot in Iceland by police officers after shooting two of them with a shotgun (both officers survived).  He was not killed immediately, but died in the hospital later, because the shot was meant to subdue him, not kill him.  The Icelandic police force publicly apologized to the man's family and offered counseling to the officers involved.  

This was the **first** person to be killed due to an armed police operation in **Iceland's history**.

 Depending on country, I don't think it is a terrible thing to have these types of arrangements and a good opportunity where everyone can win.   The net neutrality argument is weak when it makes services unaffordable for the masses. 

 




 I think I will wait to see what games/apps need room space.   I keep thinking of the nintendo wii where all the good games require subtle movements and the shit games involve flailing arms around in a big space.

 Yes.  Do you understand how infrastructure investment is not necessarily well served by draconian net neutrality laws? 









 *  Net neutrality in India doest sound so good. 

*  They need content creators to invest in the infrastructure.

*  Facebook etc seem to be willing to throw a lot of money at it but not sure what regularoty changes will do for this enthuasm. 

*  Also remember how most are reliant on mobile networks. 

*  There must be a milder solution.

 https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/3anybz/missed_the_start_of_it_will_they_have_the_full/ 




 I think it would be good if they companion show that goes in depth  for the details of what is going on. 




  http://vodmine.com/video/8esACo22t7X8NRVIzT3k

found elsewhere on reddit. Not sure which streaming sites will keep a regular supply of links 




 Thanks for linking to /r/battlebots 




 We have no rules against people posting links to torrent/streaming sites. 




 Hey bakes7b, better check the info on /r/shadowban  




 Please subscribe to  /r/battlebots  




 Lots of discussion on /r/battlebots 




 Battlebots is back on television soon.  Are you excited ?  
Are you going to subscribed to /r/Battlebots and get hyped? 









 This sub is just starting out and is still small.  I'd like to see this place welcome a full range of VR related discussion.  Hence we have vague submission guidelines.  We just need to get more people posting.  The mods aren't really filtering content or anything like that.    




 Thanks for posting.  

It is already shared and you might have missed it because of a bad use of nsfw tag.
https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/39pkh6/tested_meet_the_new_battlebots/

So removing this one.

 




 Now that more channels and airtime is available, it would be nice to see an extra companion show that goes in depth and behind the scenes.   









 Post removed.  Requesting users to post contact information  is not allowed.

Valve the company has a public contact address.  Use it.

Don't use this sub as your personal army

 




 Does the bbc even own it?  Wouldn't Channel 5 or Dave be more likely to bring it back.   Look at what happened in the case of red dwarf etc.

 ok no worries. I don't like it because it doesn't fit reddit rules of personal information and encourages people to investigate someone who might not want attention or a discussion about them about them.  e.g. There are plenty of people who are pissed off with the battlebots live experience so far.  
https://www.reddit.com/rules/

I left it for a week but it was slowly bothering me for the moderation standard it would set.   So it stays removed.   If people with battlebots associations want to start discussions about their experiences under their real name that would be cool.  Similar to /r/IAMA with vertification.  Maybe better to do it on /r/IAMA and link to it from here  




 Removed.  Feel like personal information from a throwaway account. I have no idea who he is and don't think he is a public figure.

 




 When a post is downvoted to 13% it is usually  either the result of vote brigades or profile stalkers.  This is because default setting hide posts when they reach -4.  So you are right it isn't normal reddit but it isn't /u/bbrex either.   

I don't really care about drama in the world of VR nor what other subreddits are doing to maintain post quality.   What I do care about is people invading posts on this subreddit to downvote them in an inorganic way.    




 All your recent and long comments in /r/oculus  have been removed.  Hence they are stuck on 1 vote and no replies.  Log out and have a look at  the threads.  Seems like you are wasting your time there.  I can only suggest you talk to their mods ,

Sorry your attempt to move the discussion here proved unpopular. But thats reddit.    



















 Thanks for adding that.  A lot of people here just have a casual interest in virtual reality.  So I hope you don't mind if I keep challenging you . 




 Nice to hear some positive feedback after the recent gloom.   BTW, you should visit /r/shadowban  




 I'm not sure how well fast moving combat works on those free live streams.  I don't find them ideal for sports.  Hopefully there will be some high quality pre-recorded streams.    
 




 Thanks for the info.  Feel free to start discussions about robogames in /r/battlebots.  This sub is about competitive robotics in general and not limited to the Battlebots brand.  

If you have a professional connection to robogames, maybe declare it with a user flair selectable from the sidebar.   




 Not enough  substance here to warrant a submission.  Hence you are downvoted.  No one knows who these names are or what they did. 




 There are unofficial websites streaming abc live internationally accessible.  

http://www.time4tv.com/2013/08/abc.php

http://www.stream2watch.com/live-tv/us/abc-live-stream

(best with ad block)
 




 We can only hope that they will learn from their mistakes and the feedback.  It isn't much effort to be considerate to an audience and keep them on your side.    




 Can you edit in some better context about who these people are, what it is all about and how it relates to virtual reality in a way that the average person would care.  

This comes across as a personal rant which is hard to understand.  So I am not sure it belongs here.  Sometimes it is better to post facts in the OP and save your opinions and personal experience for the comments.  This post is attracting some reports and some aggressive but empty attacks in the comments that I've seen fit to remove for not meeting the "be nice" guideline. 




 More complete video of interview

 reddit has a community at /r/battlebots.  Hope people can join for hype and episode discussion.  Spoilers will be tagged  .   




 You are right. I've changed it.  I think if titles and comments are clearly marked, there is no problem having them.


Thats us fixed.  Unfortunately, your account has been shadowbanned by admin.     Visit /r/ShadowBan for some info on what to do 




 Hey  James.    Thanks for the invite.  Sorry I missed your reply.  Must have been under a deluge from one of my technology posts.

It would be cool to have a /r/robotwars community there and it would really work if they revive robotwars.     If you got the original hypnodisc then you deserve to keep the throne on that sub!

Half the reason, I wanted in on that sub was to update the side bar with some other subs and x-post there.   So will gladly accept the invite. 




 The new shows has new rules about active weapons so it could be a variety of stuff.   Any industrial bot like snoo could be cool.  Saws, claws, spikes and even flames are cool. 














 Hi.

/r/battlebots is a community for fans of Battlebots, robot combat and the wider world of the world of competitive robotics.

There is a new tv series starting soon and so I am expecting the subscribers in the sub to grow substantially and fast.

This could be a fun snoo to create.

Any input appreciated.

 I'm trying to figure out why do x86 emulation rather than just making an x86 chip.

Does x86 emulation avoid licencing fees? Or is is the chip designed for more specialist applications rather than the mass market? If so, why bother with x86 at all?


If I had to guess, it's because this chip's primary purpose isn't running x86 code; it's running Elbrus code! But it's handy to have x86 compatibility, for legacy software and other stuff that hasn't yet been ported.

I think an x86/x86-64 license would be required from Intel/AMD, even if it's only an abstraction layer and not a hardware implementation. 




 With this latest news Rightscorp must certainly be on its last legs. The 
shareholders' confidence was already in the toilet and this certainly 
won't help any. This case should prove to them, once and for all, that Rightscorp is run by greedy morons and bottomfeeders who don't comprehend the first thing about the legal system.

The entire basis of Rightcorp's business model is leveraged upon ignorance and can only succeed where those they are pursuing are ignorant. This particular action of Rightscorp against CBeyond proves it quite handily. Ignorance is, especially in the information age, only temporary and, therefore, the stragegic basis upon which any alleged early "successes" Rightscorp ever had are now quickly evaporating. If I were a Rightscorp shareholder I'd cut my losses now while my shares still had at least a little bit of value left.

A subpoena has no force of law unless it's signed by the judge. The signature of the court clerk only evidences that it's been filed with the court, nothing more.

I'd like to say "Kudos to Christopher Bunce" but all he was doing was what every other ISP's legal counsel should be doing -- telling the copyright trolls to get a valid court order to produce client records. But to get that the trolls must first file a lawsuit for copyright infringement and, then, under that lawsuit, pursue client records under Discovery.

Tragically, there are still a few ignoramuses in charge of ISPs that don't understand the basics of due process of law, so instead of telling copyright trolls to go pound sand (or better yet, just ignore their color of law "subpoenas") they sometimes ignorantly hand over customer records at the drop of a hat. Such ISPs could easily learn a few things from this case... if they wanted to. 




 Nearly any program can be justified 'in the name of security', but how much privacy and how many freedoms are you willing to trade 'in the name of security'. This single decision will not end the debate, so expect to deal with it as the digital age matures and becomes more deeply integrated into every facet of our lives. Think well now what decision you make lest you come to regret it later. 




 Good news for battlebots 














  Mods, please sticky this, seems helpful? 

Hey qwertythe300th, I've added you as a mod so that you can sticky and unsticky your post as you see fit and maybe help keep this place going smoothly in other ways.  Hope you can accept.  Thanks for keeping us up to date and thanks for using spoiler tags 














 They neglect to mention GCHQ having its own military satellite system called Skynet - more a name coincidence.

 ok.  thanks for contributing  




 Pinging /u/twister662  - Please see this thread.   

As a quick fix, I've commented out your changes to the css just to revert us back to something that works for everyone.  I really liked how it was before and I could see what you were trying to do here with the dark background.  Unfortunately, the current state  meant a broken experience for many users.  Not sure if you realised this.     You can still make of the css whatever you want as you got some great ideas.  I only patched it because it was unreadable for many.   




 Thanks for the feedback.

You can remove the custom styles using this link
http://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots+nocss

I agree it is hard to read at the moment.  I am not a fan of white on black styles for reading .   Maybe it is my old eyes.

However, I can see what it is trying to be and it has the potential to look good.  It did use to look really good a few weeks a go and it was from the same mod.  This restyle just needs some tweaks. 

I don't want to step on the work of other mods too much as it was only changed yesterday and so might be a work in progress.  So suffer for a day and if it nothing changes I'll revert or fix it.



EDIT: Ok I'll fix some of it as we got black text on a black background in the body text of self posts!  So it is broken/


EDIT2:  I think it looked good and worked  if you had RES installed and have it on night mode.  Otherwise it was broken and sometimes unreadable.

 The way I see it, they are giving away access to their limited internet because that is of benefit to their advertising business.  It will lead to monoplies and undesirable stuff if left unchecked in the long term.  However, in the short term it is a finacially viable way of giving internet access to the poor.  They would not fund internet.org if there wasn't some stong benefit for them. 




 But who is going to pay for that ?    




 Same could be said for Americans.   




 Thanks. It is a great help 





































































 This is the time to stop mega corporations from deciding the fate of the country. The time to rise against monopolization, against the internet sales tax, against the destruction of net neutrality.

 Thanks for posting. However, your link appears broken.  Plus it was already caught in the spam filter and so never made an appearance.   Feel free to repost with a direct link..   

  









 

I don't think people want it to be different.  It just took a break because it stopped being so fresh.  New younger audience should enjoy it. 

I hear it will be more reality tv focused .  So maybe influenced by shows like x-factor .   




 American version.   More like the later series of robotwars when it was more pure battles 




 Hope fans and those interested can join us on /r/battlebots .  





































































 Do you prefer your American TV persona or your british one ?   Do you get a choice of how the editors portray you and do you mind? 




 What do you think about the American system of tipping the service staff ?   









 Just like that film "Edge of tommorow" 



















 You're understating it 




 If they merge, they should be investigated under the RICO act, as both have horrible Customer service   together IMO it makes a criminal enterprise.  However, all Comcast will do is just keep killing people until RICO goes away.

 



















 Net neutrality fundamentalism isn't always a good thing straight away.  I feel that they could return to the question of net neutrality 10 years down the line when they have infrastructure and everyone online 



















 I wonder what extra info a HMD can provide about the users?  Trivial stuff like how tall someone it.  And maybe  some sophisticated stuff about posture.  All this can feed machine learning and recognition algorithms.

 From the sidebar, he is Scheduled for an AMA here

 Ray Billings - Tombstone - July 22nd 10PM ET / 7PM PT 




 Removed as a consideration for others.  Even though you used spoiler tags, they don't work on mobile devices.  If you want to talk about this better to use a spoiler flared post with a title describing the nature of what you are speculating here but not actually revealing anything..    

e.g. This post seems good for heavy speculation around teasers and trailers
https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/3dzrwf/potential_spoilerdid_abc_show_us_the_winner/ 














 Our automoderator kills low karma accounts to fight problem users.   I've manually approved your comment here and will do so as I see them.  You may have this problem in a lot of subreddits.  So better go karmawhore or get a new account! 




 Someone try and mention /r/Battlebots. It was kind of missing from the last two /r/IAMA.   It is always good to get some fresh-blood from the defaults visiting here.  I have a feeling this AMA might do well given the excitement from the last episode. 




 This sub is for discussing public information around battlebots.    If people want to post a reaction after something has been broadcast, I can't see any problem with that and encourage it.   

The only time spoiler flairs are really  used and people are asked to be  careful about titles is when people are discussing trailers and teasers leading upto the  broadcast of an episode.   

Other spoilers like results of matches gleaned from inside information are prohibited.

 




 It shouldn't be.  There is a spoiler flair for that.  I don't even think it is was a  spoiler as it appeared after the broadcast.  So removed it now anyway 




 Thank for posting. If you want to advertise a live stream , I would prefer you do it in the comments of the live thread or other comment sections.  

full episode streaming links tend to get removed as posts because they don't support a discussion.  Your post here is now removed .    




 You posted this 7 days ago.  I tend not to allow posts that are direct links to episodes whatever the source as they don't create a discussion.  So  feel free to post about it in comments as a response to requests.

 Definately qualifies for the "robot combat" flair 




  I'm not harping on about official videos

fair enough. Maybe i should have directed it at the OP.  I'm just a bit wary of a sentiment I see emerging on here that the nature of the source is important.  People have virtually stopped sharing current video clips in recent weeks and I blame it on a mild jerk about sticking to the official stuff.

 I just said that I don't think it is.

The link here is definitely the official youtube of the battle bot creators. 

You can see it link from :

http://battlebots.com/

https://www.facebook.com/battlebots

https://www.twitter.com/battlebots

https://www.youtube.com/user/battlebots
etc.  

Thankfully, the battlebot creators are good enough to make their stuff avialable to all countries.

abc who bought the series do their own marketing and have their own youtube, twitter etc complementing it.

 The production ideas it is something they will improve on for another season.   

https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/3ax944/contacted_battlebots_was_not_disappointed/

I see the whole "reactions" thing is an attempt at emulating shows like x-factor and america's got talent.  It reminds me of canned laughter from 1980's comedies.   




 I think it is a rehash of quotes from elsewhere and not an actual new interview ? 




 It would never happen except for where they could close betting before filming took place.  Getting a betting company involved as a sponsor might be cool for a robotwars reboot outside the US.   




 No idea. One thing I understand is that he is an american role playing and I believe it is filmed in the US.  Makes it more weird because there must be some kind of regulations around some of the stuff he does.  .. that drone is an example..  




 Who is watching battlebots ?

^(shameless plug /r/battlebots) 




 meanwhile in russia 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNPJMk2fgJU

(drone+automatic weapon) 




 They look like filler clips that got cut from the show rather than standalone youtube features.   




 Your links aren't internationally accessible nor specific and I don't think those videos are  there .  People harping on about official videos will destroy the discussion on this small subreddit.  This subreddit does a lot of good for creating the hype that encourages people to watch the show live when they can.  It really doesn't matter what the source of the clips are.  As you can tell, I am more bothered about content contributors being hounded  or worrying too much about their sources.

For what its worth,   the OP here has posted links to the official youtube channel of the battlebots creators .    




 The prototype looks all wrong with 4 small jets on each tower.   Don't think I believe this kickstarter but interested in the concept as a consumer product.

Remind me of a big version of Philips AMBX which wasn't a success - particularly the fans addon 



















  The sub is absolutely for anything competitive robots and robot combat related.   

There are some links to databases and organisations in [the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/wiki/
)

If you find something better, please add them as it is user editable.
 




 the link is  a user editable wiki.   So if you are so inclined, you can add it or someone else may. 




 From variety

 And while most of it is meant to be viewable on plain old TVs, it would also feature special scenes that break the frame, allowing viewers equipped with virtual reality (VR) headsets to look around and explore the inside of a spaceship or immerse themselves in an alien firefight. Its a very interesting blend, said Betuel. The otherworldiness of it lends itself to VR.

Sounds like the alternative angles DVD feature.  Could be good for the success of the series which I'm looking forward to


 




 Pretty open to ideas beyond what I mentioned in the OP. I think that it is half the fun for the people creating stuff to have a lot of freedom.    Steak_59 has already done something cool but if you are rustling anything up we can use it at some point if not at the same time.  Thanks for your interest. 




 Thanks. That snoo is awesome and looks great.  I've dropped it in the sidebar because I wanted to use it immediately.  Later on it should take its proper position in the header and I'll drop a credit to you too when I figure out the redesign.  For the header, I think some kind of crowd/action photo could look good.

 Thanks for posting. Someone else posted it a minute after you.  However, that link is internationally accessible and not restricted by country. So   we will run with that one and remove this one.   




 /r/battlebots 

A subreddit about robot combat and competitive robotics.  We are trying to get away from the TV brand and make our subreddit more about reddit and reddit's community.    So some kind of snoo would be great or even a whole design for our header.


Something that works on a dark background is probably a good idea.  Also it would be nice to have a snoo's as a user flairs.    

Any suggestions or help appreciated. 

   




 All those other subreddits are independent of this one.  They can offer different content and a different pace. They are all worth subscribing to and contributing to.    (more related subreddit are listed in the sidebar )

I can only speak for what this subreddit is trying to do and offer.  There is a great community here thanks to the momentum of the TV show but the common interest is way beyond a tv show and that is what I have always defined this community around.

 




 Hopefully things like the [current sticky post advertising a "fantasy league"  will attract interest and happen](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/3d7nci/would_anybody_be_interested_in_a_rbattlebots/
) .

People are still building bots and may share their local experiences in combat or engineering.

There is also the possibility of a reddit community funded bot but not heard from them for a while.

Review old stuff and general discussions.

Other television shows such as BBC Airheads might be of interest as it sounds like it is going to be of a similar flavour to robot wars.

Hopefully enough to keep all the robot combat subs ticking over.  It may be a little quieter though.

Ideas for this subreddit are most welcome especially people willing to implement them. 




 /r/battlebots is for fans of robot combat and all forms of competitive robotics.  It isn't tied to the television show.  People are already welcome to post whatever they want here whether it is robotwars, drone racing of conceptual ideas/art.  

Any suggestions to help make that more obvious are welcome.  I think we will drop the header image soon and more of the branding that ties to the show once it is over (or even sooner if anyone can help make some nice graphics).  




 Gore/NSFW warnings would be good  




 They haven't sold the show abroad yet.  Maybe it is too American or maybe the deal with ABC gives them exclusivity for a bit.. 




 It has been downvoted because it is a repost.  Thanks for posting though. 




 I've removed this link for the same reason I remove "full episode links" -   A playlist doesn't support a specific discussion about robot combat and is just link dumping.  I'm still trying to work out specific and consistent rules.  So please bear with me and try and understand . 

Feel free to add the youtube playlist to [the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/wiki/).  I will add it to the sidebar along with the other official links.  


 




 Internationally accessible https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHjSr1qz3IA 
 




 check the info on /r/shadowban 




 Added a tab.   




 Thanks for posting.  However, full episodes posted as direct links are not ok because they are unreliable  and don't support a discussion.  You can post them in the comments though .   Edited clips supporting a specific discussion are fine as links.  So I have removed your post for now.   




 Then don't bother including them because no one actually cares about them and they do not come to /r/battlebots read about them.  I'm not sure what you are trying to achieve here. 




 Stop dropping big spoilers and then trolling or ignoring people complaining  . It isn't clever or welcome and this is at least the 2nd time you have done this.   People have asked you nicely.  Each time you have not edited your post or used the spoiler markup in the sidebar.  This shouldn't require moderator intervention.    




  I was pretty annoyed when the Mod deleted my post and wouldn't explain what I should fix but I'm glad I'm getting some positive feedback

 [The problem with your previous essay was highlighted as a flair and a comment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/3d2kqw/do_you_want_a_season_2_of_battlebots_we_need_to/ct19ayf).  I even quoted the specific sentence that I was not happy with and matched it up to reddit's rules on vote manipulation.  

It was sufficient explanation because  in this revision you say, ... "I apparently can't ask you to upvote..." This is an indication that you are  starting to understand basic reddit rules !  I'm not sure why you feel entitled to any extra attention nor the need to dedicate your revision to me.  

 




   Most people think it is a good post.  However, a descriptive title might help avoid surprising people . 

Putting the spoiler tag on it seems to damage it as people might think it is more than what it is and avoid it.   How to handle spoilers and people complaining about spoilers is something this sub needs to think about a bit more.  Maybe if there is a 2nd season there will be a firm policy. 




  I do like that the show has been on the front page of reddit a couple times now but maybe we should agree and try as a subreddit to get proper links voted up on those subs vs illegitimate links.

Reddit rules : **"Don't ask for votes or engage in vote manipulation."**

Also do not encourage negative attention on the people who contribute to this subreddit.  

Use /r/battlebotsmeta if you want to address moderation issues in this subreddit  such as what posts should be removed or changed. 




 Arguably it isn't really a spoiler.  It is just a teaser and has been put out there by Battlebots.  It is the same as any other episode preview or trailer.  This sub discusses public information around battlebots.  The real spoilers that we would probably remove rather than flair is inside information about the results of matches.  Another way to handle this is to just get rid of the spoiler flair altogether because it seems to imply that certain content is off limit when in fact it is on-topic.    I'd rather just encourage descriptive title such as "Episode 5 sneak peek" and even just use the flairs to add this information..


Just to note, we have started to sticky ["spoiler-free" discussion threads for episodes](http://redd.it/3cewrv
) for those that want to avoid teasers and previews.  We also flair things as "robot combat", "bot building" and "general robotics" where the topic isn't battlebots the tv  show.  These are also good for people that want to avoid teasers and previews.  
 




 We've made the spoiler tag a bit more substantial. Hope that helps.   




 To address your specific issue, I have changed the existing "spoiler" flair  to block thumbnails as well as label posts.  


nsfw is a bit of a hack and hides too much content from casual users and people don't necessarily want to enable NSFW  on their reddit accounts to view battlebots tv gossip.  Only in very small tight knit communities would it work nicely.

I've removed your post because I don't want people marking stuff nsfw based on your suggestion.
 




 They are using a create-online and sell generic website widget for hats and clothing.

The fact that they have not sold the licensing rights to a proper merchandising company makes me think it is unlikely we are going to see anything quality in the near future.  Next season maybe

More discussion on this

https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/3cfpke/battlebotscom_now_selling_merch/ 




 /u/Jamesterjim -  the top mod of /r/robotwars told me he has the original hyponodisc in his garage.  (don't try and figure out who he is or post personal information. I'm just username mentioning him here in case he wants to say hi but he is pretty inactive on that account.)  You are right that it was the most iconic robotwars bot.  It was definitely a collectors item if the original team did not hang onto it. 









 Interesting to see the branding develop.  They dropped the "RE" bit completely.  RE was an HTC product line.

Still there on the older website logo which was around when this subreddit was made http://www.htcvr.com/ 




 Sure support the official youtube channel.  Maybe we will put that channel in the sidebar along with hulu and abc go. 

However, ABC need to make their clips available internationally and not restricted by country.  There may be licensing reason not to do that ..e.g they want to sell the show in other countries.  However,  if it remains as it is , then the fan-made edits become the go-to option for discussion forums and finding them becomes a main topic for discussion.  I think the hype and interest we have on reddit encourages more people to watch the show live and so it isn't doing harm.   

 









 /r/robotcombatart  (link) 




 So you know, that link shortener will hit the spam filter and it will be up to mods to approve it.  So there may be delay  




 You still got 3000 subscribers here and your /r/Battlebots post seem to get in and ahead of others.  So you have a fanbase and following on reddit no matter what happens on youtube.

If you don't personally want to continue, can I suggest you open up this sub in some way.  
 




 "This channel has no videos."

The problem with them closing down all the youtube links is that people are going to be trying harder to find them as it is no long as so easy.  Hence this sub may unfortunately turn into a hive of piracy and not be about all the other cool stuff we talk about.    




 Some of the short clips of just the battles posted to this sub are still there and working  




 check the info on /r/ShadowBan as your user account has problems 




 I don't normally remove posts based on content.  Lack of content is the problem here! 




 Thanks.  That Sounds great .   /u/MikeNCR leads all the AMA scheduling. So I hope he will be able to confirm with you the spot.  




  Nothing for females, yay. 

PR disaster for them.  They  are using udella.com which is a create online and sell .  So they deliberately chose not to have any female sizes, models or products . It would have just been a click  to make it happen.

  Actually, I'd MUCH rather have shirts from the builder teams representing my favourite bots and have some of the profit go to them for repairs and future designs.

This should happen.  They can promote them on /r/battlebots provided they stick around and talk to people.

 Some really bad mockups.  Looks like one of those  generic  T-shirt printing companies that supply a widget for your website when you supply them a logo.  

I think they  could do really well on merchandise and licensing .  Toys, clothing etc.   So disappointed to see them promote their brand in such an amateur way. 




 Hey kidkaracho thanks for posting. I've removed this post as I don't want full episodes posted as direct link posts at the moment . Clips and edited footage that promotes a discussion is fine. Full episode links are tolerated in the comments.

This policy is due to the reliability of links, the need to promote discussion and community wishes.  Sorry, I haven't formulated explicit sidebar rules on this. 




 This thread is a good slow burner.  Thanks for making it. I've stickied  it and hopefully it will keep going for a bit.  

Also don't forget we host "Ask a builder Anything | AMA" threads - normally on wednesdays.  See sidebar.

This week we have Will Bales - "Hypershock"  




 check the info on /r/shadowban 




 Already had "fights only" posted .  Thanks anyway 




 If you want, why not create a  thread for pre-episode [spoiler free] discussion of the fights and predictions .  I'm sure people will respect it and you can make your own rules in the OP for the discussion.  In fact, if you or someone wants to organise and police it properly, I can give them some moderator permissions and it can be a sticky at some point.

As you say, the show is putting the information out there and things like  promos are always going to be dissected in the comments.  I think it is easy to avoid direct discussion of the show and still find plenty of stuff here.  

The only stuff I would moderate against is things like the results of matches being revealed by people who have been to the filming.

Now what annoyed me most recently was Terminator Genysis -  every big plot twist was revealed in its [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNU_jrPxs-0) 




 In the UK it was called  Scrapheap Challenge.  It was presented by Robert Llewellyn (Kryten of Red Dwarf - Same show that the robotwars presenter Craig Charles is famed for.)  It would be neat if they copresented on a robotwars revival.
  




 Post this to /r/BattleBots

 /r/battlebotsmeta 




 It is a waste when people vote down stuff to 13 % (i.e. hidden on default settings) when, in fact, the thread features some thoughtful replies , interesting points and original discussion.  This isn't about the quality or accuracy of the OP but maybe some casuals have similar thoughts .    




 Stickied for an hour for the discussion.  

 









 Thanks that is a great example of how to do it right.    I think I may discard the bot and try and find a mod to handle it.   




 The disaster and community involvement in the design is part of the fun.  I guess some dogecoin fans just want to see the branding 




 I think you are right.  I think people on reddit just want more technical and tactical filler and not just what we are getting now.

I think browsing /r/battlebots while watching the show is the perfect compromise.

 














 Flaired as a possible spoiler.  

 




 You know they actually do stuff like this and they millions of views.  Granted, it is "best of" or "top auditions"  rather than episodes.  However, the idea remains that people don't give a shit about the filler especially when viewing for a 2nd time. 




 
The critisim of filler was a big topic here : ["Lets cut to the chase: There was 10ish minutes of watchable TV in the first episode."](
http://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/3at8pz/lets_cut_to_the_chase_there_was_10ish_minutes_of/)

Below is what battlebots executive produce said to a subscriber of /r/battlebots regarding fillers

[It is the /r/battlebots top post of all time](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/3ax944/contacted_battlebots_was_not_disappointed/)


 
 HI Sepheroth998 - This is Greg the co-founder of BB and EP of the show. Ive been browsing this Subreddit (and all the comments elsewhere on social media. Ive also forwarded the link to the other EPswere listening.
 
 There are many answers to the many comments on the thread, but the bottom line is this:
 Were on ABC. 
 
 The show many hardcore fans seem to want would never be on ABC. It would more likely be on something like Discovery Scienceand a small cable network would never have the budget to produce the show we want. Because were on ABC we cant make a predominantly science / tech / engineering focused show. We would lose a huge chunk of the audience and never get a season 2. 
 
 We have to appeal to a wider range of people, hence the sports casters, tale of the tape, background packages, etc. Wall-2-wall robot fighting and would fatigue a majority of the audience and the show would fail. So we need to walk the line between fights and filler. 
 
 Do we have too much filler? I definitely think so. Im actually agreeing with many of the comments Im seeing. But Im a tech/robot geek (probably like most of the Reddit posters). And we cant make the show just for people like us, we need to go broader. In the end its all about balance.
 
 That said, more tech and real robot analysis is coming. Bobak Ferdowsi is a real robot engineer and he will be doing breakdowns of many of the robots in future episodes. And were learningmore importantly our production partner Whalerock is learning, and season 2 will most likely incorporate many of the suggestions were reading from fans, and the balance will be a better mix of fights and relevant talk. 
 
 So please stick with us and keep the faith. At worst use the fast forward button on your DVR : ) (or better yet just Mute and get a snack)
 
 And we did try and get Grant on the showjust didnt work out this time around.
 
 Email me anytime
 Greg



 









 Put it in the wiki
https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/wiki/

reddit is spam filtering that domain name. 

 I would approve it if it wasn't just the homepage.
 




 Airheads coming soon

http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/12/drones-jeremy-clarkson-airheads-top-gear-bbc-robot-wars

Hopefully it will be a topic in this sub as I think there is enough cross over interest. 




 /r/battlebots or are you talking about the removal of filler.  because that is a great idea 




 The battlebots executive producer agrees there is too much filler  

 The show many hardcore fans seem to want would never be on ABC. It would more likely be on something like Discovery Scienceand a small cable network would never have the budget to produce the show we want. Because were on ABC we cant make a predominantly science / tech / engineering focused show. We would lose a huge chunk of the audience and never get a season 2.

https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/3ax944/contacted_battlebots_was_not_disappointed/


Anyway, please subscribe to **/r/Battlebots** .    We have an awesome and lively community during screenings


 




 A lot of subreddits have twitter feeds pumping out links from the new queue.  

I made one for /r/Battlebots .
https://twitter.com/RBattlebots


I want it to grab some of the audience who follow  #battlebots 




However, it was quickly banned from appearing in search results.

That seems fair because it was just spamming links.  

So I want to know how did other subreddits get their spamming twitter accounts into good standing with Twitter.  I don't know much about twitter.  

Should I be asking my reddit subscribers to interact with it?

Should I give the new account some time to overcome age limitations ?

Should I stop posting links and just post the titles ?

Is my account banned requiring a new account?


So the questions are mainly about how to use twitter to spam reddit links .   I think there are some general lessons and warnings here for setting up a twitter feed .  Any help apprecaited.

 I thought something like this was a great idea.  It is very reddit too! It gets harder when I think of how much merchandise and stuff is floating around for stuff like RW and not sure of the quality.  It might be a more exclusive thing for the collectors. 




 Make it more than just an advert.  Tell us more about what you plan to spend the money on and how you may scale up or down depending on what you raise.  Remember there are technical minded people here who can evaluate your plans and there may other  help or interest other than just cash. 









 " Use Voat Instead " 




 **The wiki**   

I think the [/r/Battlebots wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/wiki/index)  could be a useful place to promote other websites, robot combat organisations and guides etc

https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/wiki/index


Use it in whatever way you want.   Add pages and improve the formatting if it helps.   Your account needs to have had a small amount of activity in this subreddit to edit it.  If someone wants to put a lot of work into it and curate it, I'll throw them some mod powers to help them manage it.    Meanwhile, I want to try and make sure that our sidebar is promoting community content. 

----------------
**Other stuff**

*User Flairs:*  

User flairs are now editable text and can be whatever you want for fun.   

People can get a "Verified Roboteer" flair by choosing a flair with the name of their bot or team experience and then participating in the [thread](http://redd.it/39s4hy).  Again, it is just for fun and to identify who is actually a builder of a particular robot .  "Verified Roboteers "  need to remember not to edit the text of your flair or else you will lose your verification status. 


*Posting:*

I just wanted to remind people that we are interested in everything around competitive robots and not just Battlebots the television show.  So feel free to share some crazy Ideas, concept art and stuff from other robotic events and tv shows.     
 
/r/battlebotsmeta  exists for ideas, feedback and whatever .   




 Looks like you started this thread to preach an ideology 




 Outside the US, there are no options.  Our sidebar has some official US links.  Full episodes are easy to find on youtube. So it doesn't look like they are clamping down on it.  I'd say that it is in their interests to get people widely interested in the brand again in the 1st season.  




 Example

https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/3bgqcd/mohawk_robot_team_member_here_ama/


-----------------

Only Mods can add this type of flair in the flair setting menu 

https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/about/flair/

Mods need to add  "VER" as the CSS class and then save. 

This adds the text "Verified Roboteer" and the yellow background.


---------------
Possible discussion: 

Is the styling right? 

Who gets flairs? 

Do we need any other types of flair?



I don't want it to be untidy and I want people to feel equal unless they have some genuinely useful experience/achievement that a flair may help advertise.  I can do some fancy hovering or animation but then I thought it is better to show the information.


It might be cool to have a selection of grey flairs that users can choose from for fun.  But I'm not bothered to do that work at the moment..

------------------
Edit: I don't think the old flair templates were set up quite right.  I cleared all the flair templates.  It wasn't a thought out decision, so sorry to whoever took the time to do that and if it was that way for good reason that I did not understand.

Anyway....

It is now user editable text rather than a limited range of flairs.  

Those who change their text to their own bot can then get verified by mods.  

The old system was too dull and people were choosing flairs like "Robot Wars".  I think it is more fun to let people choose their own text in flairs.   

 




 no need.  Just saying so people know if comments or the post itself  disappear.  I already picked this out of the spam bin once .The best thing is not to use the shorteners and revert to long links.   




 Hey thanks for this.  Just to warn you those links shorteners like goo.gl and others get filtered by reddit . So if you edit the OP or someone quotes them, mods will have to approve them manually. 




 wrong sub! you want /r/battlebots 
 









 Pretty much everyone is saying that.  I hope they see the interest and make a companion show for any subsequent series.   I could also imagine a good youtuber remixing the actual fights with their own analysis and making a better show. 









 I agree. I changed it yesterday in an effort to make some of the main listing pages easier to read but over looked the main text.    Will have a look 




 Glad you found the episode discussio thread. removing this 




 wrong sub. 




 I'm surprised there hasn't been more fan art and casual discussion of concepts. Maybe this is an interest that will grow more when the show is off air and there is less real stuff to occupt people.  I'm not sure how it would work on a message board but sort of see how it works on reddit. Maybe you can try testing interest sometime. 




 Hey /r/television, given the popularity of some [recent posts in here](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/2v0gz8/battlebots_coming_back_to_air_on_abc_for_the/), I think there is a lot of interest in the current series of Battlebots.

 The mods help enable the community.  Part of this means that the door is left open for people willing to step up and make things happen.  Are you offering to do something specific and useful ?  What is your plan for "some energetic positive moderation"?   The other question is, does your plan actually require moderator powers or mod support.  

All the mods so far were added by me for a reason  and they have done a lot of good for the subreddit both in hard work, giving it credibility and offering experience.  No one is holding this subreddit back and we are all keen to make as many ideas and activities happen.   We also need "positive community" as opposed to an "entitled community" .   




 Big Spoilers

For me spoilers are things like who wins and loses matches . If I see such information in the title of a post before a TV show I will remove it and maybe ask the user to repost it with a better title. If I see a title of a post warning of spoilers inside, I may tolerate it depending if the information is important and more than just spoiling the tv show for others.


Mild Spoilers 

Mild spoilers are things like photos of bots, tv adverts and who is participating. If the title of a post reflects the content, then there is nothing for moderators to do. If a post title invites people to look at photos, adverts or match line-ups, then a user can to decide for themselves if they want to look at it. They don't need any extra warnings as it is obvious that it is a mild spoiler of sorts.
If people are so adverse to mild spoilers and incapable of reading titles, then they should not be browsing a subreddit about battlebots.

 




 I usually add moderators on the basis that they offer to do something useful and specific

This sub is a good place to present ideas.


Other moderators can add new moderators on a similar basis.   




 Lets make these happen and promote them when they happen.

/r/IAMA allow people to post links to ama events happening in different subreddits.

/r/technology  allow self posts and are often quite tolerant especially if asked nicely.

Other robotic subs?  

 




 These have been well done and encouraged some good interactions. 

However, I think they can be technically improved by assigning CSS classes. within the flair menu.  With the right styling  "verified roboteers" or teams can have colored flairs or icons.  

I can do the CSS for this but if we want to have some icons and graphics, then some help and ideas.   

I could add a  flair specific mod in the same way other subreddits do ?


----

There is also an argument to keep the flairs similar and dull as this encourages an atmosphere where there are no "power users" .   

 




 At the moment we allow anything related to competitive robotics.

We aren't removing anything and accept all behavior.  I don't think a tv show is going to bring out the worst in people but who knows.

 I think the community is really good and mature.  The downvotes will sort out the really bad trolls. 

If anything is removed (comment or link), we inform the user unless it is obvious and random spam.   

Some of those repetitive questions such as where to find episodes can be removed if we catch them early and can redirect to an older thread.   




 This is a widget for promoting threads which may be old or are link threads that we cannot sticky .  Also for making announcements.


 [This was the example](http://i.imgur.com/4PNxBcK.jpg).

If it is useful , we could make the header area bigger to accommodate multiple announcements


----


Moderators simply need to edit the sidebar text to change these

https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/about/edit/ 

Add this to the **top** of the sidebar:

    * [](#notice)[Thing 1](link-to-thing-one)
    * [](#important)[Thing 2](link-to-thing-two)


----------


The css code for this change
    
    .side .titlebox .md ul:first-of-type li a[href="#notice"] + a:before {

        background-color:#A0C55F

 We don't promote full episode links in any official capacity . There are a lot of people who cannot access the show as it is only broadcast in america and there is literally no other way to access it. Hence, we tolerate it. The sub also tolerates other long clips of the show because people want to talk about them.
You are right that it can be a problem as piracy can strangle a show. So this policy may change if the sub grows very large, if we get targeted by spammers, if the community demand the mods take action (as you are now), if battlebots talks to us and explain that it is actually a problem or I start to see DMCA takedown requests in /r/chillingeffects .
Right now, we are trying to grow the community and see what they want. So no heavy moderation or rules just yet but rather encouraging people to talk and share stuff. This and other possible rules is definitely something that we should keep talking about though.
Meanwhile, feel free to point out the problem to the people sharing links either directly or by addressing the community in a self post.

--------------

Our sidebar now caries links to official episodes (US only) .  This is to show that we do primarily support people using the official methods to access the show.
