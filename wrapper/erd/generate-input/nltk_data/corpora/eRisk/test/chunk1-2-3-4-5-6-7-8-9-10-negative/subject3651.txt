 Depends on the state you live in--sometimes the district as well.  





























 Maybe something like revival or revitalizing America?  Revitalize   revitalizing both have 'vital' in them (obviously lol), but maybe it can be applied in creative ways 




 Ed Show (Ed Schultz) - MSNBC   then Thom Hartmann does a 1-hr radio show w/ him weekly  














 I think he was busy w/ the budget committee and then did the swing through some of the western states. I totally feel you, however, I'm sure he waited this long to see if he is even able to come up with a viable financial backing for a campaign that can compete w/ all of the money guzzling candidates.  









 She is super obnoxious. Making me nauseous. Haaaha.  

































































































































 Clinical trials, outpatient surgery services  




 Keep your head up miss, you and your strength admired by many. :) 




 It's what we are here for :) glad the nurse had such an impact with such a small gesture  




 Maybe try working in an outpatient setting-- procedural clinic or something?  




 Khan academy, iTunes university  




 Go to the director of the nursing program with paper trail :) teachers have a curriculum they need to stick to and she's obviously not.  




 Ouch! Take it to the director of the nursing program; they have to stick to a curriculum. I agree 100% on keeping a paper trail- make sure you have everything ready when you see the director.

 Agreed!! 





























 No problem!  








































































































 Congrats!! Be diligent! 
















































































































































 Wow, what a horribly written article.  




 Those ears!  





























 Totally agree. I just emailed her about her downplaying Bernie.  




 You are awesome!  
























 This video has already [been posted] (http://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/34v93r/hillarys_faux_populism_is_no_match_for_bernie/). 












































 I though that in Denmark, Italy, Austria, Finland and Sweden, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland, minimum wages are laid down by collective agreements for a range of specific sectors? 





























 Lol I know :[, I started cleaning and decided to listen to it instead hahaha :) 




 I totally thought it was my internet!! Hahahah 




 You are very welcome! 












































 That is awesome!! 



















 LOVE.  














 It took a while for me to load, I just had to wait a moment and then it played.  












































 From what I have seen, he tends to update it periodically--maybe as he schedules events? Hopefully, when/if he announces that he may have some dates to put up there. :) 







































 [This](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/15/hillary-clinton-minimum-wage_n_7075258.html) is what I found.  She never likes to give details, only vague responses, haha. 

















































 Thanks! :) 






























































































 That is horrible, I'm so sorry to hear that. :( 




 totally agree 









 I guess I need to talk to some more of my fellow nurses at work :D

 I was totally thinking the same thing. Insanely annoying and not to mention, super condescending.  







































 Totally agree!!! 






















































 love it, what a great idea! 














 Have fun!! 












































 Oh yes, #1 fan 




  I totally felt the same way :) it was very well written! 




 You don't offer anyway to justify the message behind the words he said, whereas this article does. It seems as though you are heated by how people interpret his message--maybe he should choose state them a little more clearly. I mean he believes in the bible, but not scientists? Get a grip. Jeb is trying to appease his donors while trying not to piss off half-way intelligent voters.  














 the fact of the matter is that he doesn't attribute climate change to HUMAN ACTIVITY because he isn't sure of "what percentage is man-made and what percentage is natural--it's convoluted"

 thank you so much! 







































 What do you feel, has been one of your greatest/favorite achievements as a United States Senator? 









 awesome idea! 




 yes!! 














































































































































































 lololol 






































































































































 awesome article! 




 I totally agree with you! Precisely the reason I posted the article--Chris Matthews has always downplayed Bernie and it's nice to see that he has stopped that rhetoric (at least for now). Hopefully *now*, he can rightfully acknowledge why Bernie has so much support, even though the rest MSM has yet to recognize it.*^avidly ^waiting* 









 Thank you for being so open and honest! I'm sure that this will help many people out there that have or are struggling with the same thing. :) 




 It is people like you that keeps us loving our jobs, so thank you! 


































 Totally agree, the article doesn't really depict feminist issues--for they are issues that effect everyone 




 Thank you!!!! 





























 I don't even have a Twitter account, but I'll make one for this. :) 





























 Depends on what and how one attributes value to their personal circumstances and how they apply it throughout their lives.  




 I agree. I was speaking to the differing interpretations and perspectives that people apply to meaning of value   




 I don't believe that to be true. People are still going to college; they wouldn't pay for the means to pursue higher education, they would just get a job or learn a trade. Value does not have to produce tangible objects like jobs or money--I would like to think that value is a little more intrinsic than just an outcome. Like I said, value is something that can be perceived and applied differently for everyone. For some it can be just getting a job, while for others it can be simple fact of loving to acquire new knowledge.  




 Value is based on personal perception; my view definitely does not align with yours, at least in this case. :) 









 Lmao, if they had mentioned Putin or Russia then you have a point. But when you have a show where Russia nor Putin have any editorial power it makes your argument/rant simply inapplicable to the circumstance--mainly because it's about Putin and Russia and not Thom or Bernie. Again, just my opinion.  




 I saw her on TYT a couple of months ago, but nothing other than that.  




 We have very different perspectives, to say the least. When I value an opinion of someone I don't let a watermark dictate whether or not to share it with the Bernie community. As I see it there are two choices: I can not post it and some may stumble upon the video on their own, but on the other hand, many won't--and for me the most important factor is sharing what I perceive to be as valuable content. I obviously chose to post it for the reason that it may help someone to understand why Bernie is downplayed in the main stream media. Some may hate it, like it or even love it--but the notion that this may open up a dialogue or introduce different perspectives to other people trumps the fact that RT licenses his show (at least for me). 









 Research his affiliation with RT before citing their past news coverage because once again, RT has no editorial power over Thom's show. They LICENSE it to run on their network and in turn Thom is able to use their studio. All employees are under Thom's company and have zero connection to RT other than the equipment being used which also means Thom decides what will be on his show and he has also said in interviews that he wouldn't have made this agreement if they wanted to dictate what was on the show as well as having any editorial power. Since that isn't the case, RT does not have any power and this is the only reason why Thom agreed to have them LICENSE the show--Larry King has also said the same thing about his setup with RT.  









 You obviously don't understand that Thom runs the show and the employee are listed under his company. RT has no editorial power because they only license his show to run on their network and in turn they let him use the studio. Furthermore, this show also airs on free speech TV where Thom does his radio show. Please do some research before concocting outrageous claims. On top of all this, Bernie and Thom have been doing brunch with Bernie for 9 years so I really don't think your claim holds any strength. Lastly, Bernie did an interview on politicking with Larry King which is also licensed by RT so, I think he knows and I think you should know the *facts* as well.  














 Yeah you're right. She supports a minimum wage increase but didn't [endorse](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/hillary-clinton-support-fast-food-workers) $15/hr 









 Thom licenses his show through RT and they supply him with the studio--however, Thom employs all of the workers and has the editorial power. Therefore, RT is not allowed to dictate what Thom talks about nor do they supply him with employees (Thom pays his workers under his company)--it's the same deal that Larry King has with his Politicking show. Check wiki to fact check everything--although I don't think I'm very far off. Sorry @ work in between patients so I can't double check everything now.  




 Totally thought I was the only one that had that feeling!  

















































 Yay, seems like Hillary is feeling that rug^bern hahahahahaa.  

















































 sorry about that, didn't notice--still early in the AM for me :) 




 yes! you are awesome, thank you! 
























 AHAHAH!!
 









 Very true! 







































 NPR is the same as the main stream media; bullshit. 









 Here's the [link](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-naiman/nyt-taxing-wealthy-cuttin_b_7512960.html), sorry about that! 















































































 Yayy! 
























 Poll [PDF](http://morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/150502_crosstabs_mc_NH_v1_AD.pdf) 









 Didn't even see that, thank you!  









 Ha. 




 You complained about an opinion/analysis piece, when you are reading entries to a subreddit that is based on opinions/analysis. So sorry, thought you would have understood that; didn't know I had to clarify. 









 I replied. 




 I guess you don't understand the fact that *I don't care* about what you think. I believe that the message is a good one, and for that reason, I posted it. 

*Get over it* and **go complain elsewhere.**

Furthermore, /r/inthenews is for opinion and analysis--so, if you don't want analysis or opinion then don't come to this particular subreddit with your complaints. Find an opinion/analysis you like or support and post it--but don't come here and whine about opinion pieces.  









 Go for it 





























 Yes!! 





























 I'm an asshole, I'm so sorry lol 




 Still not editorialized. You can have an opinion on the quote--and as you perceive it to imply some sort of 'weakness'. However, I see it has passion, strength, and commitment. The *fact* remains that the title was not editorialized as you initially suggested it was.  









 Very true 




 Finally, speaking some truth
Clinton may have opinions on these and other topics and wont tell us what they are. Alternatively, she may only figure out what she thinks once the political winds are settled. Either way, this is not presidential behavior. 



















 Thank you! 




 Taking a direct quote from the article is not editorializing the headline/title.  





























 Agreed, reading and I would say embrace the outdoors 




 Wondering the same thing... It would be totally awkward if they just sat there stiff not eating lmao. I'll try to find out though :) 




 omg lol, I didn't even notice. eeek :/ 




 I totally agree with you! Last month almost *all* HP articles were downplaying his candidacy as well as his personality and/or the way he looks/dresses (but that's one of the things I love most about him--he doesn't care what people think; all he cares about is getting the job done).  









































































































































































 His voting record proves his long standing passion for civil rights and minorities as a whole. I *hope* he now will articulate how important these issues have been to him--as well as his positions for future betterment for **all** minority classes.  



















 That's because Hillary is corrupt.
