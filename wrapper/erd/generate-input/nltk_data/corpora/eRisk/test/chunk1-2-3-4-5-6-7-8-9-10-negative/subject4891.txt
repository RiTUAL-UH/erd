 RALLY THE CHAN! WAR IS COMING BROTHERS! Get 2chan on this too. 




 I meant to say humans lived with dinosaurs. 




   Seriously, I see it all the time. Every film with cavemen has them riding dinosaurs. In fact, 1 in 4 Americans think that Humans lived with Cavemen. 
  It's sad how anthropology is so misunderstood and underrated.
 




 What show is this? What episode? What program is that of which this poor fellow had to endure such trauma. 




 That was...that was...beautiful. 




 Will you be working with Chuck Norris? 




 Sounds cool. 









 Specifically ones in which the coding can be done from the iphone? 




 I have had difficulty finding a good game hacking subreddit. This subreddit pertains mainly to ethical and sometimes illegal hacking. So can someone direct me to a reddit about game hacking? 




 That is brilliant. 




 Specifically. 




 It's 2001: A Space Odyssey  




 Thank you, my good sir! 




 As in how did you create the flags? 




 How did you do this good sir? 




 Nice to be alone away from all the "EXTREEME HARDCORE PVP" 9 year olds, huh? 




 Why not have a nerd server for gmod?  
  It would be a sandbox server with one of those maps that have been multiplied in size by 4. 
  If we do decide to take my idea, all I ask is to be co-owner at least. 




 This is beyond fake. 




 It kinda reminds me how in real-life corporations evict people and tear down structures for their own mega highways.  




 How did the ender dragon attack? Did someone spawn it or what? 




 Is it due to the rules or because of the massive amounts of griefing sparked by Team AVO? 




 Sandstormed by Darude 









   1. Play nice. Try not to flame. Let admins defuse the situation.
  2. Don't post things that are retarded and unrelated.
  3. Post prehistoric content other than dinosaurs from time to time.
  4. No religious references. I have nothing against religion. I am quite fascinated by it. But "God/Allah did it 6000 years ago" doesn't satisfy our thirst for prehistoric knowledge.  




 Is that Tiny Tim? 




 He was merely upvoting a post. The arrowhead representing said upvote.

 Old minecraft. Especially the community. 2011-2012 was simply amazing because of minecraft. I remember during the winter it was thunder storming and windows were being smashed by hail, and I logged onto a server and I felt instantly comforted. 
R.I.P. Classic Minecraft 2011-2012

 I shed man tears 




 That's the movie I was originally thinking of! I couldn't remember the name. 









 Beautiful 




 Whose is the founding father of nerd.nu? Who is thee who stretches Reddit's empire to minecraft? Lol.
 Also, can I contact this person through reddit? 




 We've heard this story a hundred times. "Scientists discover new alien planet capable of supporting life!" People get hyped. No further research goes into the planet. The hype dies.   
  Anyone else remember Glise 581 from 2007? 




 They are planning something. As I said before, they are training on their server and talk of Ddos attacks and hacking an admin account are common. 









 Because, if you watched the videos I put links to, you'll see their massive numbers. Plus, that was only a small fraction of 4chan. Us Redditors have been a thorn in 4chans side, so some think they plan to launch a campaign. Plus they wouldn't stop at griefing, it would be followed by the hacking of admin accounts and Ddos attacks. 




 I meant nerd.nu 




 http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FGH3CiySJ1o

http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kQay4_FJU7E

Look at that. I'd say the 4channers are Gods of pvp. They remind me of the Spartans. 

  So what happens if they raid c.nerd.nu? 
It has happened before. Reddit's official server has been raided by griefers originating from 4chan. We, as Redditors, are really a thorn in 4chan's side. So what happens when they come for the server of Reddit: c.nerd.nu?



 




 How did he do it? Can someone list the commands used please? 




 Can I give a minecraft item (A hoe, specifically) the ability to shoot guardian lasers? If yes, what command can I type in? Also, can I do this on my multiplayer server?
 




 Well, Reddit has had lots of enemies and has had a lot of flame wars. I think it's important to document these flame wars as they were crucial to the history of Reddit, especially the big flame wars which have effected the entire internet, like the feuds with 4chan. 




 What websites and organizations of people have really just been a thorn in Reddit's side? Ex. 4chan and Team Avo? 
























    WE MUST GO AN TAKE 4CHAN BACK FROM LE TUMBLR AND 9GAGGERS!

   Would they have had the brains to do it? 




   Is the pricing flexible?

Can plugins like Element 3d work with it?
 
How hard is it to learn?

What are it's advantages over Adobe's After Effects? 




  Put the price difference aside. 
Let's focus on the technical advantages and disasvantages of each. 




   Would the homo erectus, neandertal or the denisovan been able to use the bow and arrow? 




  I'll start.

1.Things exploding that would never explode in real life. 




  Maybe a campaign to launch an ad on reddit? 









   Take the Tumblr-4chan Flame Wars of Independence day. A series of ddos attacks occured. But no arrests were made. Why? 




 4chan actually made me shed tears... 




 Link? 




  It's a seems like a really good software to start film-making.  









   A good code injector is needed.
 It doesn't have to be, but specifically one where code modifications can be made directly from the jailbroken phone.  














   Could be used like a war elephant I guess. I had this question when I was a wee lad and decided to post it. 









   Stupid question. It's quite a long story.  




 How do you fall for that? 




   They were pretty intelligent. They knew about projectiles.
We know that most likely none of them ever built or shot one.
 But if we put all of that aside, did Neanderthals have the intelligence and physical capacity to build and shoot a bow and arrow? 




 Just wondering. 




   Now don't get me wrong, there economic system was great. There was no such thing as poor in their society. They also were very good at making remedies for injuries and diseases and were skilled warriors. They survived against all odds. Now, I did't come here to argue over who is more developed. 
  I'm just wondering why was it that Europeans had gunpowder, more advanced science, advanced corporations and armies. They also had ships that could cross entire oceans and some of the Europeans had mastered the art of Gliding (People like Otto Lilienthal). 
 Why is it that they were technologically superior the the natives? 




  I would've preferred it if it was a 3d puzzle game. Something like Super Mario 64. 
 Pretty good visuals too. 




 It seems like it would be pretty chaotic. With the eruption of Toba and the impending Ice Ages. 
  Similar skirmishes probably happened when Homo Erectus, Neanderthal, and Sapien existed together 80,000 to 100,000 years ago.
  Homo Sapiens had the evolutionary advantage. They crafted bow and arrows, which were devastating weapons back then. 




  It's not saying there was a prehistoric LOTR style war between species, 
I'm just saying it is theorized that humans fought Neanderthals which might have helped killed them off. 
  
 




   My favorite theory for the Neanderthal demise is the one where it is thought that humans helped drive the Neanderthals to extinction. Some sort of inter species war. A battle for resources and land.

  It fascinates me. What does R/ anthropology think? 




 P.s. How do you add location?

   I heard border collies really go crazy if you don't give them something to do. I'm worried my pooch gets bored when I'm not home. Border collies are dogs bread for work. They love work, even if it's a simple task. So what activities or "jobs" could my Border collie do? 




 I asked r/ vfx, but I want an answer from a larger community. 




 I don't understand the pricing system. I pay 495 upfront, then what? 
(I plan on buying the commercial version.) 









   Greetings Reddit, I think I'm done. 
I can't take it anymore! I have no one to talk to!
  I'm such a loser, one of my teachers has a strong disliking towards me, I live in my cousin's shadow, and my dad was never there for me...
  One day at school, I had had it. I was gonna do it. I tried to tell myself that I was being irrational. 
  I went to the counselor. They called my mom. Rather than being supportive or consoling, she got onto me for telling the school, saying that they're going to label me.
  I wanted to talk to my dad, but he is overseas. He doesn't give enough of a care.
  I have no one to talk to. I'm a popular guy, and have many friends, too many to count, but yet, I have no one to talk to! 
  My parents and my friends are only concerned for themselves. It's always them, not me...
  I can't tell you how many times I've been cheated out of birthday celebrations, or have never been called by my dad. 
  I can't do it Reddit!  




 How would this abandon all of that? 




   I've been on minecraft since Alpha. I loved it. I grew with it. I was 10 at the time of classic. Oh the fun! 
  Everyone hates the updates, and so did I for a while. But I'm starting to like them. I think horses and the armor stands give minecraft a medieval feel. 
  What is your stance on the updates? 




   We need them. C.nerd.nu is stuck in the olden days without them. With slimeblocks, we can create flying machines. We can venture into the skies of minecraft, we can safely venture into the void. This is the final frontier... 




   I feel like the community is dieing. I don't want Minecraft to end. Minecraft is a beacon of hope in the hell that is the gaming world, it is a fresh page that stands out against the all the "GUNZ BLAZIN COD FPS". 
  Minecraft doesn't feel fun anymore. It feels like it's dragging with all the recent updates. What do we do? I don't want minecraft to die! 









 Oh my god op... Give us the seed or instructions how to generate a world like that! 




   Tell us about the greatest things that have ever happened on vanilla servers. For me it was this battle we had against a guy who created this army of mobs. He built a fortress literally IN the layers of the farlands. This was beta of course.
  Tell us your vanilla nostalgia stories and feel free to list the ip to a vanilla server in the comments: 









 Thank you for the advice! 




   Hello my good comrades. I'm 14 and am interested in that of a filmmaking career. I want to create top-notch effects, to do this, I feel the only professional tools for me would be The Foundry's Nuke. The thing is, this costs $4000. I've had this dream of becoming a filmmaker for a long, long time, since I was a wee lad! 
  My parents won't allow me to work a real or summer job just yet, so what might I do until then?  




   I'm about to be 14, and would like to have a career as a filmmaker. I want my cgi to be top-notch. I want it to be so good, it gets featured on the Cgbros YouTube page. So, I would like to aquire a copy of The Foundry's Nuke. The thing is, this software costs about $4000. My parents won't let me get a job yet, so I've turned to r/beermoney. Being an avid user of the subreddit, I saw how someone went to Vegas on their "beermoney", so if they can go to Vegas, I can get Nuke, how hard can it be? Harder than you think my friends...Vindale looked very attractive, but my hopes were dashed when I found it charges you for the products you test. I turned to swagbucks, which promised $35 per survey, but my hopes were crushed yet again when I realized these offers are only to reel you in, after that you get a survey every two months for only $0.02.
  I need advice. What might I do? 




   I want to start a career as a filmmaker, to accomplish this, I'm going to need to get a copy of The Foundry's Nuke. This vfx and compositing software is used in every film from Gravity, to Star Trek, to Transformers, you name it, Nuke is in it!
The thing is, this software costs about $4000. My parents don't really want me working a job yet, so what might I do?
  Being an avid user of r/beermoney, I've always wanted to try a bunch of paid surveys, and maybe in 1-2 years I could get the money, but I'm afraid of scams, so I really need some advice! 














 Did it get taken down? It was from 2010 or 11. 




 I downloaded an app called badoo, put my profile as a member of isis, messed with people, someone legitametely called the police. I am in Texas. 



















   It's turning into an rpg. 




   He played Saruman. He could be a great Herobrine.
"There will be no dawn...for Minecraftians!" 









 Also, does the student version give you watermarks and only let you render in less than HD? 














   Say I torrent a music creating software and publish my works and make money off said works, is that illegal? 














 Saw this on /3DCG/. The question was, "If I used a pirate bay torrent to download The Foundry's Nuke (A vfx Software) and use it to create little short films like FreddieW on YouTube, would it be illegal if I used Google Ads and made money off of the videos I created with the software I downloaded with a torrent?"
 









 I see places where you can find after effects, MODO, Cinema 4d and all those goodies for sometimes half-price, but are there any good places where you can find a copy of The Foundry's Nuke for $2500-1000 at least?
 
























 So could I perhaps use the equation y=16x+62. It's a linear equation, and I need to graph it. 




 Can you explain just a tad bit further? 




 The goal is to create a scenario which can be graphed using a linear-function. 
  My scenario is "Poncho Villegas is a soldier who needs to capture a fort. He needs 600 troops to do so, and currently only has a company of 62 soldiers. He receives a platoon of 16 troops each day. How many days will elapse before Poncho has the required force to conquer the fort?"

How might I solve this? I am having trouble puting this in linear function/equation form. Help me, r/ Homeworkhelp. 




 Wow! Nice to know someone is as interested as me in this effect! Do you have a video tutorial? 




 Low quality pictures yes I know, please acknowledge these were taken with laptop cameras. 









   I have seen Tron and Tron: Legacy. I always loved the derez effect. Whether it was evaporation or programs shattering into thousands of cubical vowels. 
  I have also seen a few episodes of VGHS, and the derez effect is also pretty cool. 
  If you were creating a movie which has a plot centered around a vidya gam or a computer, how would you recreate this effect? 




 Wat 









 Kinect 




   Could you use it for motion capture and then somehow port it to Maya for animation? 




 Wow! I know what route I'm taking! 














 Alright, what about this.
http://nibbler.silktide.com/en/reports/mvutbrviwojhuvqp.softstorepremium.com

I really want this site to be legit. I am looking for cheap prices to buy After Effects, 3ds Max, and Autodesk Maya. That is my dilemma. I want to buy these usually expensive softwares for $150-$400. 




 It is certified by McAfee though. 




 It was tested with McAfee though. It looks legitimate.
http://imgur.com/i5K9Ktn 









 Oh. Might you be able to clear these misconceptions up? All I want in my vfx work is photorealism. 




 Wow! Might I inquire what software you used to create 3d models in this wonderful render? 









 I really thought Tau Ceti was a good candidate? 




   Seriously. Every comedy related sub has a rule against memes and rage comics and posting such on a social network is considered "shit posting." 




   It's basically a cheaper version of Maya. I'm assuming it can render simulations? 




 Thanks! 


































   I think it will be around $200. 




 I'm sorry good fellow, but I do not believe there were any birds (Assuming you are denoting to the branch of Archosaurs) in the videos I had seen. 




 What might you mean, good sir?

 A reddit is the website you are on.

 When I right click, it selects each of my objects. I can't move them anywhere unless I want to move all of them. 




 I suck at character modeling. How did you get good at it? 




 Blender kicks ass at creating stuff like planes and materials. But sucks at character creation. 




   If we had a good list of links, it would be good for new users like myself. 









 I'm using AE, blender, and maya. And I don't feel like cycling through softwares. I was impressed by element 3d.  




 Great man. Thanks 




 Just wondering. I need a renderer. 




 Usertesting is pretty good. $10-15 per test. 




  Also, what other sites could I use? 




   I saw someone who did a speed modeling video where a guy modeled a gun based of an image which he had in the background really fast. He could chose a polygon and stretch it out in less than that of a second. I'm thinking he just uses keyboard shortcuts, for that's what people do in Blender speed modeling videos. So, what keyboard shortcuts do I use to do such? 




   Can I just import my models into renderman and then use muh shaders to render it out? 




 Alright. So how do you do the "sped modeling" thing? Where one is able to stretch and select polygons very fast in blender or Maya? Do you just use the keyboard? 




   I saw a video where a guy created a 3d model off of an image? How does he bring the image in? How does he change the size and select shapes of polygons so fast? A simple explanation would be great? 




   I want my reader to feel sadness and anger. But I feel like killing characters to often becomes cliched and gimmicky. What are some tips, r/ writing? 









     I've worked on a few vidya games which was pretty cool, but I was completely sapped of creativity. We used CryEngine, and I realized how similar it looked to CGI movie effects. I started comparing films to video games.
   I asked myself, "How can a film be more interesting than a video game if a video game is so interactive and keeps the player on the edge of their seat?"
     Anyway, long story short, what are some nifty writing and editing tricks to keep the film vibrant, exciting, and interesting? 









   I was thinking Christians would feel good because you know, your hurting Satan, the ultimate sinner. Yet games such as the Diablo trilogy and Darksiders have created controversy. 




 Looking for a place to download the engine used in Quake. I'm designing a retro game. 




 Does anyone know where I can download the engine used in Quake 1? 
I think it's id tech 2 or something. Anyway, I'm making a retro game, so if y'all could help me find this engine, that would be great. 




   One side of the planet would always have day light, another would always have constant darkness. 




 Okay? Where do I start? Where do I begin making an agreement with Nintendo?
Also, do you have to own a company to become a dev? 




    I think R/ Nintendo would know better than anyone else. 
I know you need to have an agreement with Nintendo, so where do I start?
 How do I acquire a devkit? How do I publish my game for the Wii U? 









 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5AvCxa9Y9NU
  
  Seriously. They're releasing two games in 2015. I'm worried for CryEngine.  




 Voxel farm is a Voxel engine. You make shit out of billions of tiny voxels. The more voxels, the better and more round a model can be. This is supposed to solve the problem of games not being able to render enough polygons. 
  With voxels, you can have unlimited detail, and according to Euclidean, not have to worry about hardware specs.
   So I'm trying to find an equally good Voxel engine without jew prices. 



















 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4SUNWOVxVmk

  I'm a cryengine dev, and I want to know if my tech works with Wii U. 









   Seriously. Valve doesn't know what the consumer wants. We have our standards too high. If Half-Life 3 came out, what would you want? 









   I haven't seen any good one in a while. Working on a film and need some good footage for inspiration, btw. 




 I have a quiz tommorow and I'm having much difficulty. 









 Oh! Never thought of that. Thanks for the advice! 




 Also check out another primitive shot: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Le3q4UVr8E 



















   Do we think they will release a free non-commercial version of it, just like Pixar did with Renderman? 









 Minecraft  





























 Will I be able to do waking cycles with characters? 




 So can I make boids walk in rows and formations, then interact with other boids and particles like in LotR. 




   I model in blender. Must I uv map in blender as well? Or can I uv/box map in Element 3d and then texture the model all inside AE? 




 And what sort of solution is there? 




 I'm trying to do a lotr scale battle. How do I get them to walk? Also, is there a limit to boids? I want to render several thousands battling several thousands. 









 I'm just so worried about vfx for my films. 




 Meaning it will expire? 




   Does it have all the features? I see these all the time. 









 Basically I want to do a large scale battle sequence. Maybe a few thousand agents fighting each other 




 Damn that is pricey! Maybe can I just create multiple simulations and then composite them later? 




 Massive software? I noticed you capitalized Massive so is that a crowd simulation software? 




   I'm thinking of thousands of agents. I have a powerful computer.  









 Is it possible? 









 God dammit I just want a dirt cheap/used version of autodesk maya. 




 What does that mean? 




 Original equipment manufacturer. Meaning the software comes without the fancy box. Meaning it is sold at a significantly lower price. 




 Appon.us sells OEM VERSIONS of autodesk software at low prices. I for one, think it's legit. 









 Why does it look shady? 









 Appon.us 









 Yes or no? 




   I wanna composite green screen actors into a cgi matte as well as add cgi characters. The thing is I'm new. So give me some tips and tutorials? I have element 3d, by the way, so just consider that.

   I already tried the whole "click on chose the best quality for videos in your youtube account settings!" Doesn't work. I have amazing Internet with multiple boosters, so it's not connection. 




  Yeah. Why do we take our children to see the latest flick? Why do teens flock to movies like Guardians of The Galaxy and 2014's TMNT? Why do we watch movies? Why do people care? The answer is the reason why we make a living out of this. So, I ask again, why do humans watch movies? 




 I have both, and am looking to create photorealistic renders, do I have enough? 









 In terms of photorealistic rendering? 









 Deus ex machina? As in the god? Can you elaborate? 




   I'm very intermediate at modeling. I'm just about a pro. I can texture and UV map like nothing. But sculpting, oh sculpting, I just can't! 
   Where are some tutorials to get me started? All i can find are tutorials introducing the tools, I want a tutorial which shows me how to sculpt something like a character. 
Please help, r/ blender? 




   I came up with a story about aliens who create the human race, but have to fight hostile aliens to do so because said hostile aliens want to prevent them from creating humans due to humans destructiveness which might lead to their downfall. 
   The thing is, this story is pretty generic. What to you scifi readers and viewers, makes a story outstanding?  














 X+y+z=15
2x-y+3z=-15
-x-y+z=-7
(Hint: solve for z and get two equations to have x and y only.)
  I don't know how to use this with subsitution. The best way would to. E to use process of elimination.

 I'm trying to get my ptex from mudbox to maya, but the textures won't extract.
http://imgur.com/tHLAMLI 




   I want to send to maya. Yet when I use the send to maya command, the textures are black. I need to fix the textures being black, or fix the map extract not working. 









 Any fixes? 









 Track of course! 




 It's a very different interface from v1. 









 Olay 









 No, I don't want an animated video texture like something on an iPhone screen, I have a maya obj sequence where a ship is flying and I've brought it into element. The only thing is, It won't allow me to box map the model in the animation. 




 Obj sequences. I figured out obj sequences. By the way, when you open an obj sequence, do you want to click and import the very first frame or the very last one? 









 Well how do I bring the textures into element?i don't see the materials showing up 




 I want the model WITH its textures on it. 




 Please answer both questions. 




 Explain please. 
























 Wheres  a good place to upgrade? I one time found a place selling cs6 upgrade for $150 




 Why would I need to do that? 




 http://imgur.com/ZkLhmml

 Please help. I'm so frustrated.
I have a 64 bit windows computer. I believe I have nvidia GTX video cards. I don't see why element 3d for after effects won't work? 









 I'm using a software designated for educational use, and I want to showcase my work and tutorials to students and my audience. 
 




 Where can I find the student terms of use? 




 Ok, on a side note, Im using student version. Can I use my animations in YouTube videos and allow YouTube to put ads in my videos. 




   What if I used ads? It's not commercial use. I'm not directly gaining money. 









 I need help with binding rigs to arms 









 Pardon my newfagness. I'm stressed. I'm working on a film and trying to import shit to Max and Maya and everywhere. Anyway, thanks. 




 Please help. Don't tell me to look up on google. give me a straight step by step guide right here. I'm on a time constraint. 




 Will it also import the rigs too? 




 http://m.imgur.com/hrqxkem 




 You should note that I had deleted the shortcuts then tried to redowlad maya 




 http://imgur.com/XQmnmeQ
It says I've downloaded the software yet I can't find it anywhere on my computer  




 Is it that simple? I don't need any extra scripts or plugins?  









 Install now, download now, or browser download?

 What steps do I take? 




 Well o got it so I guess this thread is kill 




 I've tried install now and download now, both of which didn't work for some reason. So now I'm trying browser download. 




 Would I be able I use that for my youtube short films? Also, will I be able to get the software every year for free? Like do I need to confirm I'm a student? 




 B H = discounts galore 


































 how do I export skeletal animation with cry blend with the latest release of cry blend? 




 I don't have photoshop though 




 

Every time I bring in a texture in as a .tiff or .psd, nothing shows up. It's just a "Replace Me" cube. What do I do?
Please don't point me to the manual, as I have already read it. The cryblend manual dosnt work either.
Tell me please, what are the steps to add textures to my blender exported model. Maybe I'm not doing it right.
 




 Maybe I should try sending a 16 bit file rather than the standard 8 bit ptex file. I just don't know! 




   The ptex texture appears blurry and transparent. What might I do? 




  When I go to shaded view mode, all I see is a crystal clear gray texture. Send to maya didn't work. P.S. I'm using mudbox to maya. 




 I'm wondering. 



















 K thx 




 Just need to know. 














 Has anyone ever tried this? My pooch is a border collie, so she's pretty smart. But I'm not sure if I'll be able to get her to stay still to take that many pictures of her. 




   Basically, I divided my mesh into multiple sections using the p seperate command. Then, when I was done unwrapping, I used the mirror modifier to make my mesh whole. However, when I want to add texture, I have to add materials to each seperate section of the mesh. If I join all the objects together, it makes a huge mess. What do I do? 




 You got me! April fools to this faggot sub! 




 Simply realistic looking terrain. 




 Other than massive data sizes and textures being loaded procedurally like in Rage, I don't see anything too bad. 




 Terrain in unreal engine looks just so bad! Think of the game Rage. If you let it sit for a while, it would look amazing. With unreal engine, if we can preload the textures so we don't have the same problems as rage, we could create an amazing looking game. 




   Okay. So, what we do is we create one big ass map in a 3d modeling program and compose a texture atlas. We export that as an fbx and bring it into unreal engine. Using gimp or photoshop, we create an even bigger ass image texture. Finally, we unwrap that kush and bam, a realistic map. I think this would do great with terrain, as Unreal Engine isn't good with rendering dirt or sand.
The only flaws I see with my idea is:
A: How do we get the image to unwrap in specific areas?
B: How big of an image would we need? 




 basically I have a warehouse, and I want to apply seperate materials to certain parts. I don't want to have to export dozens of files. What do I do? 




   So I create a new pallet, then what? 














 Oh, well are there any 3d printing subs? 









 Winning the race really 




   Today was our track meet. It was but a fine day for running, as the weather was well suited for the track season. I was running the 300m hurdles. I was doing brilliant. I was in third place, and edging ever so close to passing the individual in second place. Suddenly, the unthinkable happens. I fall. I go from 3rd to last place. I fall in front of my family, my girlfriend, and 1000 people. 
But this isn't the first time. It's been like this for ages. I just never meet my own expectations whether it be sports or school. I'm just done. I'm ready to go. 














 I was thinking of me in one of those green morph suits and holding her paws with the gun and then painting me out later in AE. 



















 For me, I usually recalculate area normals and remove modifiers.  




 Dump em' 




 The object 




 So I can bake my rendered textures to the model and then export it? 









 I specifically want to send a prerendered model to cryengine. I believe renderman can export .fbx and .objs? 









 I mean, you guys are r/disney. Y'all should have some experience with animation. 


































 Don't waste your time with greedy fucks like Autodesk. There software is hard to use and you will get an error even when you do the most simplest thing. He'll need experience with programming. Modo sucks ass. Start with blender, have him learn cycles rendering. Then, he should move to maya. If he's looking for games, use unity or cry engine. Unreal lags like hell. 




 Basically I have this cgi cyborg suit looking thing, and I need Brooklynn(The dog's name) to wear it. So, I'm gonna mocap her on set, take her mocap data into maya, animate the suit with the mocap data, and then bring the shot of the doge into AE plus the rendered shot of the cyborg suit and composite it onto the dog. 
  Is there any other efficient way to do this? Any tips? Has anyone ever mocapped a quadruped before? 
Pic related, Brooklynn: http://m.imgur.com/z0g5ooK 




 And where is a tutorial for the new mecanim system? 




 I added a float called speed, and added transitions using between the idle and walking animations. 
Didn't work. Added a component script 
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class zombieWalk : MonoBehaviour {
protected Animator myAnimation;

void Start () {
 myAnimation = GetComponent ();
}

void Update () {
 myAnimation.SetFloat ("speed", Input.GetAxis ("Vertical"));
}
} 
  That didn't work. 
  Help! My levels look great. I've baked renders to image textures so my levels look like pre rendered vfx. My ai can navigate through the most treachorous paths. But then there's animations! Nothing works. Please help, I'm pretty desperate as you can tell.
 



















 I simply don't want it to rotate 360 degrees around me.  I want it to walk towards me. I tried adding a rigid body, and freezing the x and z rotations. Doesn't work. Tried adding a character controller, didnt work. 




   Let's face it. Source 1 is a pain. Compiling mdl is horrendous. Half Life 2's normalmaps/bump maps are so shitty. What improvements will be in source 2? 
























   I've had enough. This has gone on forever. I will never be good enough. Plus my dad called me a dick and always yells. I find refuge in creating levels and unity 5. I bake textures in Blender cycles and then send it to unity so the graphics look like fucking Gravity. It's amazing. I thought my family would be proud. But no. My family said I spent too much time online, which I felt was a fucking erroneous assumption, since I only worked on the project for 30 minutes each day before going outside and trying to please everyone in track.
    It's killing me. I can't go on much longer. 




   Please help. Newbie from CryEngine here. 




   if so, are there any examples? 









 Im trying to make a mod with the source sdk, and i need to know where the models and materials folders are for half life 2. 




 I dont have the username folder in steamapps, I guess thats part of the steampipe update. Anyway, I need to find the Half-Life 2 materials and models folder so the faceposer and model viewer can easily find and present my models with texture.

 Ahh ok 




 Source 2? How the hell do I get Source 2? 




 I have experience with C++. How do I script enemy and friendly AI in Source? Are there any tutorials? The wiki isn't very helpful. 




 Thanks m8. 
























 Great. I have the build. How do I install it to blender? 
























 What do you think the error means? Do you have any suggestions? 









 Cryengine supports .cga animations. So yeah. 




   Seriously. Cryengine can't read cryblends cfg or armature files. So don't try. Please, I just want to know how to bake armature poses into hardbody poses. 




    Cryengine is having trouble with my armature exports. So how do I bake animation from armatures into shapekeys? 





























 How the fuck do I even do that?
The trace back error I'm getting: http://imgur.com/PxFJZpu
I don't get it. This is so easy in Maya. 
So I'm in the environment variables, I've found RMANTREE all that, now what do I do?
 



















 How do I change it to PRman 20? I downloaded prman 20 but that did not change anything.  




 Yes I have PRman itself. 









 What does that mean? 









 What price range are we looking at for this plugin mate? 









 LONG LIVE THE TROLL MILITIA! 














 I never had any intentions of bringing Aurora to war. I was only suggesting plans of action since our close allies, the FSR, have decided to occupy Orion. Please, I'm not a violent individual. I only wish to live with my friends in Aurora, my political goals or beliefs for Aurora should have nothing to do with my citizenship.
 




 Fuck it, done. Like I  said, third time posting here, and why? Why do I keep on going through this shit? So here I am, fucking rock bottom. Let's look at what's happened with me, shall we?
I'm running hurdles. I think I'm pretty damn good. It was my very first year, never even took interest into sports until then. I get 4th or 3rd place. I was running with the big boys too. I thought my family would be proud, but fuck no. Dad never went to my meets, for he is in the Navy. Can it get worse? With my family? Of course. Everyone compares me to my cousin. Everyone say's she's a genius in school, yet I'm the one who leads her and tutor her. I'm even compared to her in my favorite sport: Hurdles.
I'm tired of the comparison. One day, I decided I loved movies and took up a hobby known as Visual Effects. With help from people like Gleb Alexandrov, I created this: http://imgur.com/VhhuCFd
I thought my family would be so proud, but rather everyone justs says, "That's cool and all, but did you see what your cousin did in her soccer game/hurdles?"
Then there's tonight, fucking tonight. I'm currently in High School, and I'm living with my divorced mom and my sister. My family members are SJWs , so I can't talk rude to my sister despite her talking rude to me. Anyways, we are all watching tv, and being the shit service AT T Uverse is, it stops working. I offer to fix it, but I fail. I tell my family that it's just AT T being shitty. And they fucking say,"Oh stop it, AT T is cheaper. Your just being ungrateful. Besides, you only have yourself to be mad it, you thought you could program it." Program it? Are we in a fucking 4chan cringe thread? How do you program a tv? I know OpenGL and Pixar's Renderman, not whatever shitty code language AT T uses. And then my family complains that I'm always grumpy.
What the fuck do I even do at this point? This has gone on for years and years and years, we have shitloads of pills everywhere. What am I to do? 




 yes 




 Info: Refugee from the Kairenreich. Member of New Leningrad and Tel-Aviv. 




 Ive been on a couple times before. And in those couple times, the kaisenreich has fucking imploded on itself 




 That's why I'm traveling to CKR. I'm a mercenarie with shit loads of materials for slimeblock tanks and aircraft. 




 So with this, I can join minecraft Classic servers again? 




 I think this one will do. http://imgur.com/PF3t9NZ 









 Alright first we need a picture of a grill and a popular tumblr account 




 So, we find a picture of a girl, and call her Melissa. We say that Anita Sarkeesian said she was "Not a real gamer and an insult to feminism." We say that Melissa commited suicide. We start a tumblr hashtag saying #justiceformelissa. Sarkeesian gets BTFO by her own forces 



















 so, should i try setting my profile to different minecraft versions. i want to join this classic server called team 9000

 The 3 boys could just as easily be being abused and neglected, but of course, biased r/twoxchromosomes only sticks up for the female, while insulting the 3 boys with degrading terms like spoiled. 




 Do you think it is anything serious or fatal? 




 Not along the red lines, rather in between the groin and hip bone, does not move freely. No recent infections. There is only one. 




 Current medications: Zoloft 




 But I don't want the Hdri map showing up in the final render.  I only want the lighting.What do I do? 




 Is RIS compatible with standard maya hypershade nodes? 




 How the hell do you even bake lighting in Renderman. The online docs are from 2008. How do I bake lighting in from the Envlight onto my character? Please help fellow gentle sirs of r/cg. 









 Just wondering. I've seen slimeblock bombers only used on 4craft. I've just taken an incredible interest in aviation, both in game and in real life. 









 I've got my AllPurposeMaterial and everything. So where do I go now? What do I need to do? What nodes do I connect and how do I connect said nodes? 




 So I paint ptex in mudbox, send that over to maya. Add renderman attributes which include ptex supoort and subdivision scheme. i then go into slim, create an allpurpose material, and attack a ptex color node. I go back into maya, select my object, go into slim, right click the allpurpose material, hit assign as surface. go back into maya, choose renderman ris, hit render, and nothing but black?
  what should I do?
Also lets make this a general renderman questions thread while we are at it. 




 What the hell went through your mind when posting this? It's not even funny. Just two cucklords giving each other genuine advice. 




 Aside from the game coming out itself. 




 Also, with source, I'm using Blender cycles to render scenes and then baking their textures so that the game looks photorealistic. Is this efficient if I want good graphics?
   But again, I need a place to download steam pre steam pipe, crowbar, mdlcompiler, and studiomdl don't work.
