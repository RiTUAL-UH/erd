 If she was a White man who did this she would have been fired by now. That is all that anyone needs to know and the double standard shows you how the Left wing scum running the liberal arts institutions in America are taking over and they're winning because our media is garbage and won't call them out. News reports about this story aren't calling her out; they are merely reporting on the facts. When the media creates the narrative that people like this have been festering and taking over liberal arts departments in academia in the Western world for decades then I'll be satisfied.

 [The thread in /r/CFB about Manti T'eo's fake girlfriend](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/16pi4a/deadspin_manti_teos_dead_girlfriend_the_most/) being exposed might be one of my favorite reddit threads of all-time. The hilarity contained within those comment threads was truly astonishing. This guy's comment from the thread sums it up perfectly. 

 This comment will undoubtedly get buried but I feel compelled to voice my opinion nonetheless.

Watching this story break and unfold over the last hour in this comments thread is what I love MOST about the Reddit experience. From the initial link, to the ensuing denial from ND fans and Te'o supporters, the speculation, the reaction .gifs, and then the real time links to ND's statement - I have never had quite such an intriguing social networking experience in my almost 20 years of using the internet.

All credit goes to DeadSpin for breaking the story but I'll always remember reading these comments in real time as the story was breaking as a truly unparalleled experience in the ever developing social network medium.

 Yeah, but it bashes views that reddit feels are held by fat redneck Republicans so the stupid post stays and will frontpage. The wise teenage liberals of reddit probably are cool with ~~their tax dollars~~ their parents' tax dollars putting illegals through college when many American citizens - not illegal Hispanics - can't even afford college themselves and need to scrounge tirelessly for an education.

 I love how reddit's wise teenage liberals think that all of the illegal Hispanic immigrants pouring over our wide open borders are hardworking.

  The discussion quality on TiA has been horrendous. It's easily one of the biggest circle jerks on reddit.

The sub consists almost entirely of image posts because the mods don't allow self posts. I'm not sure what anyone would expect discussion-wise when this is the case. Sometimes articles are posted to TIA and there is good discussion but those posts are in the minority. If the mods want better discussion then they should allow self-posts but they don't want that. We see self-posts in this sub all the time and there is better discussion so I don't see why we can't have that in TIA. The mods just don't want it. This wasn't always the case there.

 Yeah but girls don't have the societal and necessary impetus to approach men to get any sort of romantic or sexual gratification started like in a bar or a club. Very few girls like you described exist and behave that way. There are more than a few unattractive guys that behave in an awkward and uncool manner but feel the need to try to engage because both society and women put that burden on nearly all males, both attractive and unattractive alike. It just so happens that the former has to do it a little bit less while the latter has to engage with women 99 percent of the time if they want anything to happen. Most of the time this doesn't end well for them while most of the time it ends well for attractive men. 

It's much easier to get labeled as a creep if you're a man who fucks up socially in romantic situations than it is for a woman to be labeled the same.

 I found some more information about this story that is pretty interesting. I've redacted both personal and identifying information, just to be safe with the mods of this sub.

They've let wholeinabucket's comment stand even though he named the boy but I'm not sure if the mods will remove the comment for personal info if and when they see it. This boy killed himself in 1999.

 At one of the largest high schools in North
 Texas, a single gunshot brought grief and shock to students and parents.
 Classes had barely begun Thursday morning at Richland High School in
 North Richland Hills when a young student, described as a loner,
 took his own life. School administrators scrambled to keep school open,
 but many students went home for the day. It happened right after the
 morning bell in a bathroom right off the main lobby. Sophomore [John Doe]
 walked into a stall, pulled out a nine-millimeter pistol, and shot
 himself, once in the head. The student was rushed to a nearby hospital
 where he was pronounced dead.
 
 Freshman [redacted] said, You hear girls crying. Its so sad.
 So sad, people we go to school with. So sad... As news of the tragedy
 spread, anxious parents showed up to claim their children. Some worried
 about how easy it is to bring a gun inside a school with no metal
 detectors. [redacted] is a parent. Theres a firearm in the school.
 Regardless of whether he took his own life or someone elses life, there
 was a gun in the school. School officials say there hasnt been much
 trouble at the school before.
 
 [redacted] is with the Birdville ISD. Im sure this will be
 reviewed. This has not been an issue. Its sort of a fine line you walk,
 do you want metal detectors at all entrances of a high school facility.
 Or is this an isolated incident.
 
 NBC Fives [redacted] reports that police werent the only ones at the
 school after the shooting. About a dozen counselors and volunteer
 chaplains were on hand to help students cope with what happened.
 Theyre meeting one on one and in small groups, talking about the
 tragedy and trying to prevent another one. Reverend [redacted] said,
 Its a big concern because to a lot of young people its a viable
 option. And of course, were telling them its not a viable option. Life
 is worth living. There are people who will help you and love you. The
 pastor says the student who killed himself, [John Doe], had no
 trouble with drugs or girlfriends. But he also says the teenager wrote
 some 8 to 10 letters to friends on Wednesday, which have now been given
 to police.
 
 The ordeal shook up other students who didnt even know the boy, who
 wonder what could have gone so wrong? One student who knew [John Doe]
 described him as being very depressed. The student said [John Doe] never
 played with the other students in gym class.

 Diary of a cult member

 By [redacted]
 
 NORTH TEXAS - 16-year-old [John Doe] committed suicide Thursday at
 his high school. Journals he left behind indicate a confused young man
 torn between a dangerous cult and doing what was right. They give a
 frightening look into the world of a teenager who took his own life.
 
 [His parents] say they had no idea their son was so
 torn up inside, not until he killed himself and left behind personal
 notes and a journal describing every day of his life for the past year.
 [His father] says, He was extremely confused. He was being bombarded with
 questions in his head, Whats right, whats wrong, what do I believe,
 what am I doing, what should I do next.
 
 Through words and pictures, [John Doe] described his involvement with a
 so-called Wiccan Cult. The beliefs were far from the traditional Wiccan
 Religion, whose members practice white magic, and encourage harmony with
 nature. His dad says, Its contorted and deformed the way theyve done
 it. Theres nothing good about it. The Wiccan Religion was of good
 things that you can do and anyone that would do evil with it was not
 accepted and they were cast out.
 
 [John Doe], too, was apparently cast out of his group once members realized
 his true intentions, to help others get out. His father found a
 disturbing letter filled with threats from a fellow cult member. [The father]
 says the letter said, We will join together against you, your Catholic,
 anti-atheist group. The letter went on to describe how [John Doe's]
 deviation from the cult would result in a so-called dreamscape trial.
 [John Doe's] step-mom [redacted] says, Entering and attacking a person
 through their dreams. They quote, unquote, kind of call it a dreamscape
 and even if the person doesnt want to participate they can still do
 it.
 
 [John Doe's] journal also described the study of two books: The
 Necrinomicon, or The Book of the Dead, and The Satanic Bible. Some cult
 experts say whatever his intentions, [John Doe] was simply messing with
 something way too dangerous. [redacted] of Watchman Fellowship, Inc.
 says, Theres a lot more to it than maybe they initially believe.
 Rather than just an innocuous investigation or morbid curiosity, they
 actually find themselves being drawn into the lifestyle. A lot of times
 the quest for personal power becomes overwhelming.
 
 Its advice too late for [John Doe], but information his parents hope
 will reach others whom may be lost and searching for answers. [John Doe]s
 family and friends gathered for his funeral in North Richland Hills on
 Monday. Pastor [redacted] told the congregation [John Doe] is now living
 peacefully in heaven.

 PLEASE HELP! That (now viral) video of the officer in McKinney subduing a girl in a bathing suit was in OUR neighborhood. The situation was NOT what is being reported
 
 A DJ setup in a public space next to the private pool in our neighborhood on Friday and played loud explicit (F-bomb) music for multiple hours (it is unclear if he was invited by a resident as no one has claimed responsibility). The teenagers (both black and white) were being brought into our neighborhood by the carload because the DJ was tweeting out invites to a pool party for $15 (obviously unauthorized by our neighborhood). The teens began fighting with each other and pushing their way into our private pool. Some were jumping our fence. The security guard was accosted when he tried to stop the beginnings of this mob scene. Some residents who live around the park/pool area tried to come out and settle things down. The teens started yelling racial slurs at our neighbors and started assaulting people and property (throwing bottles at cars and attacking a mother at the pool with 3 young children). The first officer on the scene was by himself. At that time, the party had grown to a large, aggressive crowd. As the officer arrived, many teens started running through our neighborhood. Many of the teens were being very aggressive and yelling at the officers as more arrived.
 
 This was a very dangerous situation for the officers AND the teens/residents not involved. The news media has refused to hear the neighborhoods side of this story. The video being distributed is only a very small segment of what happened. This information being distributed by the media and others is extremely distorted and in some cases outright lies.
 
 PLEASE HELP US STOP THE BROADCASTING OF THIS IGNORANCE. The media is trying to make it look like our neighborhood is a whites only, racist area. Anyone who has spent even a few minutes in our area knows this is an outright LIE.

That is the account of a McKinney, Texas local.

http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/06/08/412889290/texas-pool-party-update-teens-and-residents-speak-out

The person who wrote what I posted here is a resident of the pool's community and they sent this out to media outlets. The man even provides his name but I won't post that since it's personal information. 




  most

So some did not and the cops were called because they were trespassing.  



















  "Tresspasser" is just a codeword for a black person amongst inhospitable white folk.

No, it's code for people that trespassed by accosting the pool security guard and climbing over fences to get into the pool when the rules of the pool state that you're only allowed to bring in two other friends with you to the pool. Random people showed up to this pool after some DJ tweeted about it and they didn't have a right to be there. The residents heard all of the loud noise coming from the hip hop music that was blaring, saw all of these people that clearly weren't residents of that community flooding towards the pool, saw altercations and fighting going on and then called the cops. They were trespassing.

 most of whom clearly lived there

You just supported my point for me. Not all of them were welcome there. Most might have been. Some were not and the cops were called because they were trespassing. 

 their parents' HOA dues pay for

Some of them weren't from that community and neither were their parents so I don't know what you're talking about. Maybe try facts when you make points. 

 And as for the non-residents, black residents are entitled to have guests just like everyone else.

Yeah, only when they follow the rules which they didn't. Some were trespassing and those who weren't brought more than two friends to the pool which is against the pool rules. 
 




  but why did he feel the need to pull his gun out?

[Because he thought that someone there had a gun and was about to pull it out on him.](https://imgur.com/a/hDZ0N)  




 He committed a crime so he ended up in jail like he should have. He stole something and was jailed for it. The issue in his case was that he stayed in jail too long without a trial, not that he went to jail.  




  So it's the children's fault

Yup, they were the ones trespassing and who were asked to leave by both the community residents and the cops and failed to do either.

Lena Dunham sexually molested, groped, and masturbated next to her sleeping sister yet the media have little to say about her being a disgusting sexual abuser.

I think Palin is a retard but she does have a point and anyone who pays attention to the media knows that they have a liberal bias.

  I live in the American Gardens building on West 81st street. My name is Patrick Bateman. I'm 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself, and a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an ice pack while doing my push-ups. I can do a thousand now. After I remove the ice pack, I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a water activated gel cleanser. Then a honey almond body scrub. And on the face, an exfoliating gel scrub. Then apply an herb mint facial mask, which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion. There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me. Only an entity, something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our life styles are probably comparable, *I simply am not there.*

This is definitely one of the worst posts I've even seen in this sub and that's saying something.

 There's a big difference between secession - which is the legal and constitutional right of states should they seek it - and killing Jews and invading sovereign European nations like Hitler did. Learn your history before you post your pandering, smug may mays for le wise teenage redditors who just got out of school for summer and just completed their first government/civics course.  




 Lincoln wanted to kick free black slaves out of America and send them to British colonies because he didn't want them around and because he "didn't want racial strife" in America. *Freed* black slaves. For the not-so-smart among us, that translates to what we know and refer to as "black people" in modern day America here in the 21st century. I guess wise redditors knew that already though. I guess Lincoln is racist? Even though he was on the side of The Union as their leader and freed the slaves like wise *progressive* and liberal reddit teenagers were told with such pride and conviction by their burnt out Baby Boomer high school civics and government teachers who forced their students to watch MSNBC political talk shows for homework each week and regularly voiced their disdain for The Tea Party and FOX News in class any chance that they got? I'll wait for wise teenage redditors on Summer Break to figure it all out. After all, I'm just a racist, dumb, uneducated redneck who clings to my guns and religion and hates Obama. I'm totally not a highly intelligent, well-educated White male atheist from a heavily liberal metropolitan area outside of the South who doesn't own a gun and who voted for Obama though, right? Right.

http://www.history.com/news/5-things-you-may-not-know-about-lincoln-slavery-and-emancipation

Sorry to interrupt your circlejerk here. By the way, Lincoln didn't really care about blacks much. He was opposed to slavery of any kind that enslaved a man or woman of any color, not just blacks. Big difference between him being opposed to slavery and that consequently meaning that he liked blacks or wanted them in America. Quite the opposite, really.

Try to come to terms with the fact that Lincoln and other American presidents and heroes were "racists" by the definition that redditors have of the word since some of them owned slaves and/or didn't think that blacks were equal to Whites. Good luck.

  What doesn't make sense to me is why Ellen and or the admins don't talk to the community

Because we're the peasants and they're better than us so why do they care what the average user of this site thinks? That's how they think.

 




  you people are jumping with joy that this happened so you can, in your minds, prove a point.

They're proving our points for us. We don't need to do anything. This is the umpteenth story about a non-citizen, illegal criminal alien coming into this country and killing someone because of Obama's open borders policy. Bush opened the border up as well though not to such an extent as Obama. The GOP sells out real Americans so that their fat cat donors can get cheap labor while the Dems sell us out so that they can get a giant new voting bloc straight outta Mexico and Central America. Who stands up for real Americans?

http://www.wbaltv.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/Two-Arrested-After-1-Child-Beheaded-2-Partially-Decapitated/8900586

Bet reddit never read or heard about that. Just one of many stories. 




  Could someone explain why it's a good idea to not deport people who are in a country illegally?

Because Obama and the Democratic Party want America to turn into Brazil or South Africa demographically so that they never lose another election. Obama is going to amnesty all 11 million + illegal immigrants in this country so that he can ensure that he and the Dems run the country in the future without the GOP standing a chance. It's just racial mob rule democracy that the Founding Fathers never wanted in this country. Dems and Obama don't care. They're done courting the white vote so they're importing as many non-whites as they can who are lower class so that they vote for the party that gives them government benefits.

I wonder if Ellen Pao and the other reddit admins or employees will put pressure on krispy to take control of the situation, the subreddit, and of karmanaut.

  The truth is, Roberts is the same fool that believes racism doesn't exist anymore.

No, he just doesn't believe that racism is as virulent and institutionalized as it once was. He doesn't believe that there is no racism. He believes that things like affirmative action are outdated and he is right. Soon, the SCOTUS will be examining an affirmative action case involving a white female applicant to a university that rejected her and admitted a less-qualified black applicant to their university solely due to race. In my opinion, affirmative action policies are racist in and of themselves because they always tend to discriminate against someone due to their race in order to "not discriminate" against someone of another race, gender, sexual orientation, etc. 

How is it fair that qualified individuals like this young woman are denied opportunities that they earned so that people who aren't qualified can be made happy? It's total nonsense.

We see the same thing with Asians in Ivy League schools like Harvard who discriminate against them by rejecting them and accepting typically blacks and Hispanics solely due to race and for no other reason. They say "we have a holistic admissions process" which is a bullshit way of saying that "we drink the diversity Kool-Aid even though we can't demonstrate that it benefits any of our students to admit less-qualified college applicants who happen to be non-Asian minorities."

 Are you a girl if you're transgender? I thought that you can be a girl if you're transsexual since you've taken hormones and other treatments to change your body. Transgender people are just one sex but feel like they're another gender so a boy who feels like a girl who consequently dresses like and/or behaves in a feminine manner. Am I wrong here? Can you be a female when you have a penis but feel like and say to others that you are a girl? Sorry, I'm not well-versed in this trans stuff but I'm curious.

 - Blink-182 and other pop-punk bands. If there was a soundtrack to my childhood then it was filled with Blink-182 songs along with other pop-punk bands like Yellowcard, Green Day, The Offspring, Sum 41, etc. Any time that I hear songs from these bands on the radio or anywhere else I am transported back to my childhood and remember days of running around our neighborhoods playing Cops and Robbers or of days in the Summer spent riding all over town on our bikes or attempting to skateboard in each other's driveways. 

- Skateboarding and skateboard fads. Me and my friends were posers but I still loved the Tony Hawk Pro Skater games and wearing all of the crap that I bought at PacSun with my friends. Billabong/Quicksilver shirts with skate shoes, cargo shorts, and a rope or pukka necklace was a must back in those days. 

- Recess. So much fun. We and my friends used to play soccer, kickball, basketball, football, or we used to chase the girls around and they would do the same with us. This was the age of cooties so being able to outrun the fairer sex was essential to your survival. Nobody wanted to be a member of the male herd to be culled by a superior female specimen who was capable of running you down and infecting you with her cooties with the touch of a finger. 


- Playing video games with friends. Countless nights we would spend over each other's houses playing Playstation, N64, Gameboy, GameCube, XBOX, etc., until we were called home by our parents or we fell asleep. GoldenEye sessions that lasted hours. Pokemon playing on Gameboy that lasted hours. We would play the game and would also trade cards with each other during breaks. TJ is still on my shit list for putting a crease in my holographic Zapdos. Bastard. 

- Field trips at school. I was lucky enough to go on plenty of field trips growing up to a number of different places. Me and my classmates went to art museums, the aquarium, the movies, to theme parks, to giant outdoor arboretums and gardens, to wildlife parks, musical concerts, and more. I always looked forward to these because I got to hang out with my friends outside of class and because it gave me a chance of sitting next to girls I liked on the bus on the way to and from the places that we went to. I'll never forget getting to sit next to and talk to Dana on the bus and then during our trip to the art museum out in the countryside in middle school. I can remember that whole day. It was like heaven for me at that age. I barely knew Dana but she was really pretty and nice and we were split up into the same group and walked around with each other the whole day and then talked and played trivia games with our friends at the back of the bus, you know, where all the cool kids sat. I used to listen to a lot of the songs on my NOW compilation CDs and think about Dana. I remember listening to LFO songs all the time while thinking of her. I guess you could say that things got pretty serious. 

- Watching cartoons. It's strange to think about just how big a part of life cartoons were and then how they were gone when I got older. I haven't watched a cartoon since I was 14 yet I watched them relentlessly for years. Hey Arnold!, Doug, Angry Beavers, Pokemon, Rugrats, Dragonball-Z, etc., all long gone and out of my life despite being such a big part of growing up. It's bittersweet to try and watch some of the episodes again only to realize that you've seriously outgrown the shows and that they no longer are as captivating as they were many years ago when you were a kid. 

- Spending time with friends. We used to be together all of the time during the school year but it was the Summer months that were magical for me and my friends. We would honestly spend just about every waking minute with each other. We would wake up, all go to the pool, spend hours there until dinner time, usually head to each other's houses for dinner, then play outside at night or in each other's basements all night and sleepover each other's houses. We would repeat this routine almost every day of the week. I loved some of the games that we would come up with when we got bored of established games like basketball or whiffle ball. One of my favorites was called "Santa Clause" where one of us had to put on this giant Santa hat over our heads and then come down my friend's basement in the dark where we couldn't see anything. The other guys were down there and had constructed all of these obstacles or boobie traps to screw up the poor friend who had the hat over their head. The way to win was for you to be the last friend hiding who didn't get touched by the guy in the Santa hat. You could hide or beat the crap out of "Santa" with pillows. Many times it was our hysterical laughter that gave away where we were and Santa would lunge at us as and tag us as soon as we gave away our position. Riding bikes, playing tag, swimming at the pool, playing sports, video games, watching movies, watching MTV music videos, and doing other fun stuff with my friends is something I hope that I never forget because those were some of the best days of my life. We were totally carefree, life was so much more innocent and interesting, and it was so much easier to have fun back then. No drama, no egos, no responsibilities. We were all just friends and as we got older things would change and some of us would change and it was bittersweet to lose some friends who you spent the best days of your life with, only to then make new friends who you would make new memories with later.

 lol funniest comment so far in this sub. Yes, the mainstream media has totally *pivoted* from the fact that a White supremacist killed some blacks. Yes, our totally right wing media managed to pull one over on everyone by *pivoting* and making it all about the flag. lol wow dude. It totally wasn't the Left in this country and SJWs and black lives matter protesters who made it about systemic racism and the legacy of slavery and the Confederacy. It was totes the GOP or the media pulling our eyes away from the racial killing and towards the flag. 

No one pulled anyone's eyes away from the killer. Are you even joking? 

I would love for you to show me statistics about just how prevalent the beliefs of White supremacy are in our modern day GOP. Y'know, the GOP whose leaders don't even stand up to Obama when he tries to get 11 million illegal Hispanic immigrants amnesty in this country. McConnell and Boehner did nothing to stop him yet White supremacy is enough of a part of the GOP base that cosmic forces needed to *pivot* away from their "involvement" in the GOP. Funny stuff.

  Why do you think Pao would take this case to court when it has no chance of succeeding?

Because she is bankrupt and this was more than likely the only chance that she would be able to take anyone on this planet and a past employer for more than 100 million dollars...all while doing nothing but pay a lawyer to convince a jury that they should award her over 100 million dollars. She jumped at the opportunity to grab over 100 million bucks while literally doing nothing but saying that people were mean to her because of her gender. 

Her and her husband are in the hole for something likely close to 100 million dollars by some estimates. That's just unbelievable, really. How else would she and her likely prison-bound husband pay off those debts and pull themselves out of a 100 million dollar hole? Probably by trying to sue someone for about the same amount. 
 




 A Feast for Bros 




  but a CEO that engages in a law suit you don't agree with, then that bitch has got to go.

She lost resoundingly in the lawsuit and her claims were found to be totally without merit. Myself and thousands of other redditors over the past year saw this and saw the suit and her for what they were: a cynical way to bail her criminal husband out of jail (maybe literally) and for her to cash out by screwing her former boss and company over. How is noting someone's past behavior at a Silicon Valley company an "ad hominem" not worthy of discussion? For months, redditors in this subreddit and others were all over what was coming out about her past behavior and about her husband and how this made her look as a person and as the new CEO of reddit. The view that this site had of her was never positive and has been that way since January right up until this week when some people are now viewing her as this wronged woman who did nothing wrong. 

 All your criticisms are based on her personal life. They are personal attacks.

Not at all. I clearly discussed her personal and professional life and the bleeding together of the two and how she was toxic upon assuming the role of CEO. Not just me but the majority of reddit saw her as unfit to be CEO of this site given what we came to know about her since January or right around the time that she became CEO and people started talking about her during her discrimination trial. 

 You claim to hate SJW, but you are obsessed with irrelevant details about someone's personal life.

Her personal opinions and views are not irrelevant when she is the CEO of reddit and she has more than enough power to try and instill her views and values on the site and therefore on all of its users. Do you and others really not forget her blog posts and announcement posts on this site that reeked of tech world double-speak and mushy language that people were pissed off about? Reddit literally downvoted one of her posts beyond zero because they were so ticked off with her view of how the site should be run. She announced her views to us all so this isn't speculation it's just the facts and a retelling of how reddit reacted to her opinions and views for the site.  




 ITT: Redditors managing to forget that regardless of what Pao did or didn't do on this site, she was a scummy, shady character before she ever became CEO here and that was the reason why reddit didn't want her around. 

You guys seem to conveniently forget that she sued her former mentor and boss for close to 100 million dollars in a gender discrimination suit in which she lost big time. You all seem to forget that she did so out of desperation because her husband bankrupted their family through a failed Ponzi scheme in which he drained the pension funds of many people through his criminal behavior that may well send him to federal prison at some point. She literally sued her past employer in Silicon Valley for nearly the exact same amount of money that her husband lost through his shady and criminal business dealings. How soon reddit forgets.

Totally turned on her mentor, boss, and "biggest advocate and defender" in order to try and loot his company for over 100 million dollars based on accusations that the jury ultimately found to be resoundingly baseless. She didn't get a cent and *she* has to pay her former boss and company's legal bills for suing them over a baseless accusation that threatened to tarnish the entire company and an honest guy who was her champion in Silicon Valley. Low life stuff from her. 

You guys seem to forget that her and her husband are seedy, scummy, shady characters who have a history that is available for everyone to read about. Redditors found out about it and called her out for it in numerous threads before she even started doing anything unpopular on reddit and no one could understand why reddit would get into bed with not just her but with her husband since she was taking this job here as her "do or die" job where she was going to try and rebuild her image and career while facing down bankruptcy.

[Same as above. Very informative and entertaining read.](http://www.vanityfair.com/style/scandal/2013/03/buddy-fletcher-ellen-pao)

[The guy is a criminal. No two ways about it. Pao pulled the gender discrimination card only after her husband played the race card first. This is who these people are. They cry discrimination, sue people with deep pockets over it, and then sometimes come away with major settlements or punitive damages. Scummy people with little to no integrity.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Fletcher)

[Update on their relationship and professional lives from this week.](http://nypost.com/2015/07/12/ellen-pao-hedgie-husband-are-losing-their-power-couple-status/)

You also seem to forget that she has a history of associating with the types of people labeled as social justice warriors and feminists who are big fans of censorship and that reddit rightly had major concerns about how she was going to run the website as a result. For example, her Twitter feed, friends, and tweets reeked of this sort of stuff before she even was CEO and it paints that picture of someone who reddit rightly didn't want anywhere near the main controls of this site. Her tweeting during in the lead up to her gender discrimination trial and all of her interactions on Twitter was something straight out of the Anita Sarkeesian playbook and it was noxious for me to read through since it just reeked of "I'm a victim please give me money" nonsense that we've seen before from professional victims like her. None of these views or opinions turned out to be erroneous at all because her and her husband have an open history of this sort of stuff and reddit watched her entire trial unfold for weeks and chronicled it all and found her to be what the jury found her to be: a scheming, cynical opportunist and hustler who was totally full of it and not credible. 

These really aren't my sole opinions; they're the opinions of redditors that I have read about Pao since January yet people seem to be forgetting this week why she was so unpopular a selection for CEO in the first place. All of the people coming out of the woodwork this week acting like she literally did nothing wrong, was a good fit for CEO, and that she was wrongly chastized and scrutinized are pretty delusional and have bad memories. Did she personally ban FatPeopleHate? Probably not her personally but her and Alexis definitely sat down and agreed to get rid of the sub. Was reddit really so wrong to assume that **the CEO of this site was not the one who gave the order to ban FPH and other offensive subreddits?** Absolutely not. The CEO is very much the person calling the shots not just here but in most other companies or corporations so people coming out of the woodwork this week acting like reddit just pulled another Boston Bomber manhunt screw-up again are over-the-top and delusional.

 More like an obitchuary.  




 Probably because Pao didn't have the good graces not to throw her boss under the bus in order to score millions of dollars to pay off her shady husband's debt. Reddit didn't like Pao not just for her decisions on reddit but because her and her husband are scummy, shady people.

Dylann Roof may very well have been mentally disturbed but the media have chosen to ignore that angle and have completely chosen to ignore how his attack was a planned murder-suicide and not just a murderous massacre. He ran out of bullets and didn't manage to kill himself after he killed his victims. The media wants him to look as bad as possible so they'll call him a terrorist like they want to and ignore any other possible motive for his killing such as mental health related to suicide and depression.

 She makes this joke and she's a hero.

Hope Solo literally stands front and center on my screen right now with an interviewer gushing about her and her teammates and it's alright because she can beat people up not get into trouble for it with our biased media. 

Hilarious stuff.  




 Can someone tell me why she gets as much attention and publicity as she does? I'm not an MMA fan at all but I just saw her do this on TV and I've seen her on TV a lot over the last year and I'm not sure why she is so well-known. I know very little about MMA other than it apparently has become a fairly popular sport in the last couple of years. However, I don't think that women's MMA is popular at all yet I would wager that more Americans know who Rhonda Rousey is than they do other well-known male MMA fighters. Can someone in this sub explain her apparent popularity to me or why the mainstream media and sports media seem to pay attention to her so much? Serious question and not rhetorical or trolling in any way. 

Edit: You people are pretty weird. I explicitly state I'm not trolling and just asking an honest question to try and understand something and you downvote me. OK.. 




 Aaaand forwarded to HR. Definitely not something to just forget about in my opinion.  




 Yea I was a bit skeptical of this as well while reading that exchange. I don't think this is the first time that subreddit has been messed with or trolled in a sort of way. 




   If Steve announces they're banning hate subs, this place is going to explode.

No, it won't. They'll ban CoonTown, maybe WhiteRights, probably not TheRedPill, and maybe some other shock value and seedy subs like rapingwomen and CandidFashionPolice. Reddit will kick up a bit of a storm but not much at all, far less of a tantrum than the one that we saw during the banning of FatPeopleHate. Life will then proceed as normal a week after the purge and redditors will continue to visit the site because they really don't care about those subs being banned. FPH was a sub that had the power of reaching /r/all every day and it was honestly a force to be reckoned with because it had so much activity and so many subscribers. None of the subs that Huffman is going to ban really have much of a base that had the power of FPH in voting and gaining visibility.  




  So some people on the jury did feel that her case had some validity.

It was literally 1 woman whose objectivity as a juror was questionable. She was very emotional when all of the other jurors disagreed with her view that Ellen was the victim of discrimination. 

 Without knowing anything, "you" assume she was unjustly let go.

I never once mentioned the firing/resignation of Victoria. 

 if a ceo posted a blog with racial slurs, the same type of people why wanted Pao gone for things she said, would defend the racist Ceo.

You don't really have much evidence or proof of this anywhere, especially here on reddit, and I would wager that if this CEO was in charge of a corporation or entity in which their racial views could affect their decision-making or running of their entity then the patrons or employees of said entity could rightly take issue with them. 
 




 The "but reddit's a private website and you have no guarantee of free speech" argument trotted out by people like you has never been a great argument since the argument doesn't extend beyond the notion of the admins saying "because I said so" when asked why they don't allow certain subreddits. At least try not to be lazy and employ some of the historical arguments made in the past for freedom of speech and what not. Better to say and elaborate deeply on why free speech shouldn't be allowed on a privately owned website instead of just saying "Cuz it's my website brah and I do what I want!" to anyone who questions the limiting of free speech on reddit. 

 hate speech

Hate speech is in the eye of the beholder and in this case it could have been in Ellen Pao's eyes or in the eyes of Huffman and Alexis. Know what? After how I've seen these people behave over the years and over the past year, I really don't want them making moral judgments on what should and shouldn't be allowed here and on what constitutes hate speech. For some people, /r/MensRights is a hate group akin to a neo-Nazi group or forum while other people think that it's just a group dedicated to addressing the issues of men in an ever-changing society in which they are feeling threatened, troubled, and or confused about their roles as males among other things. 

This is why you don't let people regulate hate speech because then you get differing views on what exactly it is and the Potter Stewart position of "I know it when I see it" doesn't always fly with people like myself who don't want a sole individual's pair of eyes making judgments for the rest of us.
