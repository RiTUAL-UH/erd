 Thanks, that was really clear and easily understood. The video also helped a lot. 









 I met him as well. I was really young, 5 or 6 maybe and he was shooting a movie near where I lived so my dad brought me over there and told me  "That's the Genii from Aladdin!!". I, being a 5 year old, immediately ran over to meet him. As I was running over, a van with some sort of film equipment was coming by and was going to hit me. Robin yelled at the same time as my dad for me to stop. Robin Williams saved my life, then afterward, we had a little conversation about watching for cars. Meanwhile, my stupid older brother sat in the car and listened to music.

 Thanks for all the help guys!! 





























 This pretty much sums up my entire life. At least I have reddit, where I know everyone hates everyone! 





























 If over time waves lose energy and speed, does that mean that there are separate sections for waves of separate wavelengths? I'm thinking this because if if an X-ray were to lose energy over time and become a radio wave,  wouldn't it be moving at the same rate as all other radio waves created near the same time? Then over time, wouldn't there be a huge difference in the number of radio waves and all other wavelengths? 




 I don't mean to be mean

but I'll make you my queen

if you suck on my peen

I keep it very clean

and it's really quite lean

I'm sorry it's green

I got a bad gene

I'll be honest, I'll become quite keen

 This is too accurate.. 




 With all the buzz about the issues with Unity, the frame rate issues in particular, I'd expect Ubi to say something about it. Have they said anything about upcoming patches or anything? 
























 Kyle or Chad. I've never met anyone named Kyle or Chad who wasn't a douchebag 




 I think that this happened to show that despite the attributes I described he's still a human, and humans fuck up.  




 I actually respect Frank a great deal. He does what the fuck he wants and gets what he wants despite all obstacles. This doesn't change the fact that he's an awful human being though. I think that one thing the show does really well is showing that despite him being an awful person we all want to be like Frank, at least a little bit. Everyone wants to be strong willed, intelligent, cunning, clever and ambitious. But everyone also wants to be a good person, unlike Frank. Frank doesn't give a fuck. 
























 Yeah, it would serve drinks. I thought about getting a job at a club, but I life in a rural area so there aren't any around, which is one reason why I had the idea.  




 Brand new to this sub, so I have super limited knowledge. I'm an 18 year-old who is considering starting a dance club in my local urban area which allows 18+ patrons. I'm going to take a class on entrepreneurship next semester, but I was curious if you guys had any advice on how to get this all started. I was thinking market research to see if it was even worth pursuing? 




 No follow-ups, and each of them is thinking only in terms of their designated title within the group (ie, the physicist is only thinking in terms of physics). 
























 The shoes I'm referring to are the ones he wears during the talk when he announces that they will be streaming the UFC fight. 




 A dance club like with a bar, dance floor and obnoxious, loud music 




 Any particular reason you feel this way?

 Should probably use a throwaway, but who gives a shit? A similar thing happened to me about a month ago, and a few months ago, but with a twist. This beautiful, amazing girl and I went on a few dates. Then she disappeared. I messaged her saying I understood if she didn't want to see me and that I would respect it, but she told me that she had depression and was into in pretty bad and she disappears when this happens to her. Then a couple months later we got together and dated for about a month and a half..then she disappeared. Long story short is that I think I scared her away by trying to see her to comfort her, and because she was my gf and I wanted to see her. Sorry this became a long story but it's making shit worse for me and I ended up venting it here. But to relate it to you, when things got better for this girl I dated she came back to me. Your friend will probably do the same. 




 Is it bad that I'm pretending that this is the girl who broke up with me like a month ago? Probably. 
























 I don't really give a shit who I tell. I mean I don't just go around telling everyone, I have to know them enough to be generally comfortable. But if I'm feeling depressed and someone asks me what's wrong I'll tell them that I have depression and want to just be alone. 




 I'm terribly sorry to see this. No one deserves this pain. I'm experiencing something fairly similar unfortunately. I was with this amazing girl, we were fantastic. I knew she had depression and other issues, but I wasn't ready for her to get depressed then break up with me because she didn't feel able to be with someone. I've unfollowed her on Facebook but every once in a while I can't stop myself from looking and every time I look I experience heart shattering pain. She doesn't advertise relationships on Facebook, or her feelings all that much for that matter but when I look I'm just crushed that she isn't experiencing things with me. But this happened before and she may come back to me like she did before, but until that happens I'm afraid I'll feel this way. This extreme feeling of love and missing her. To make it worse, this all began when my depression and anxiety starting to really "bud" if you will.  




 My job isn't necessarily cognitively demanding, but it's more demanding than me sitting my room feeling depressed. So I use it exactly as you described the potential use for tasks. I even go to work like an hour early because when I'm at work I don't have the time to feel depressed, and it's a good distraction from my depression. Granted, the idea breaks down when we have slow night. I work in a restaurant. 




 I deal with this practically everyday. Everyday it's a struggle. Honestly, what I do is just tell myself that I need to. I might have nothing to to do that day, but to be a real member of society I need to get the fuck out of bed.  




 Everything. 




 Looks like I'm fucked then.
 




 Well in a sense they are, aren't they? They're contributing to the larger collection of media which does shape and define us as a nation (I assume you're talking about American filmmakers). I mean I hate these pretentious douchebags as much as anyone, but they are contributing. I may not be in a significant way but they are
