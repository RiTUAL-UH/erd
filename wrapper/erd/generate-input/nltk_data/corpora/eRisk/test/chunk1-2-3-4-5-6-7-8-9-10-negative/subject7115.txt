 The voices told her it was okay to attack people because its all just for fun. 




 The only reason I like the Sith more than the Jedi is because of their ability to shoot force lightning out of their fingers. I wish I could do it. 




 She doesn't have a home. Alderaan was destroyed by the Death Star. Thanks for bringing it up...She was finally getting over it. 




 Totally. Right on. 




 Zero fucks given 




 Sounds like my typical weekend. 




 Go to bed grandma. 




 Dang. You beat me to it. 




 IT'S OVER 9000!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! In the delicious category. 




 Serves him right. 




 I find this incredibly arousing. 




 Stupid 




 It's more funny if anything. The little girl in front row to the left looks funny.  




 Monopoly is over man. Ended on the 22nd. 




 No? It just looks like people spending time at the beach and someone snapped a picture of their friend laughing.  




 Legendary 




 This is amazing 




 I'm so sick of seeing this one. I've seen it 6 times on r/wtf 









 I feel as if I saw this last month 









 He's rather attractive. 




 When did we rename the Internet "the mall"? 




 Some men just want to watch their hair burn 




 do you get what kind of plant it is? 




 There are very few things I wouldn't do to this man. He gets me so aroused just by looking at him! 




 Thank you! 




 I caught that a few months back. I had a Disney day and watched Hercules after The Lion King and laughed my ass off. Fuck you Scar!!! 




 He's from the UK and represented Britain in the Olympics. 




 Video killed the radio star* 




 You're right. They discovered that its actually animal skin. Not human. 




 I like the altered one better 




 I would do more than that to him 




 This is the repost of reposts. I've seen this at least 5 times a week for the past two months. 




 It doesn't look like him though. I know who he is but that's not him. 




 It was just south of Arizona. They found him in a ditch shot in the head. They caught the one who took his truck and by that time they had loaded it with various weapons and tons of blow, transporting it. 




 Someone posted a picture of this guy walking around outside a couple days ago. Who is he? 




 Sleep? Not for me. Because spiders. 




 Agreed. My uncle was killed by cartel members when he was on a business trip. 




 Nicki looks so good. 




 It's definitely animal (obviously) but I can't tell what kind. It looks like a plant eater though looking at the teeth. But then again I can't for sure tell due to quality. 




 Unless there is strong, hard evidence to suggest it is in fact related to the Nazis, this is not what you think it is. I agree that it might be Masonic or depending on the age of the building, just might be coincidence if the building is older than the 1930s. 




 I see dinner 




 Anyone want to double stuff her? Anybody? No? Me either. 




 That looks like my ass. Maybe someone photoshopped some ass cheeks on this lady's tits. 




 I like the first comment. She thought she was all cool correcting the word. 




 This is so SHOCKING.   




 I can't stop laughing at the reactions of all the people behind them. 




 It looks like it's most likely the umbilical cord. 




 It's not a swastika. 




 Obviously not everyone knows it, for example this post. 




 It looks like a Pokmon. 




 I agree. It's a gap. 




 Thank you! Someone knows what that symbol really means and how the nazis perverted it. It's origins go way back and people don't know it means something completely different. 









 Is this from a movie? I feel it is and I've seen it. 




 This gif would do better in wtf 









 My pants just got shorter 




 Pretty sure I'd be arrested for public nudity because I'm not inside all day, like you. But let's just end this because I'm sick of seeing your name pop up on my inbox. Last time I'm replying to your stupidity. 




 DAT BREASTMILK 




 No. I slept. Like a normal person. Because I'm not up all night harassing people on reddit. I have a life. 




 You do too. 




 And again, I don't care. 




 You're so sweet. 




 Do you honestly think I care? Because I don't. 




 I would still shake the hand of whoever tricked me. He/She deserves a congratulations in my book. 




 I give you that, but bacon. That's all I need. 




 She still looks white. That's enough for the media to feed off of. 




 Uh, yes Houston, reading you loud and clear. It seems you don't quite understand sarcasm, over. One small joke for me, one big step over your head. 









 This is...FANTASTIC. 




 It looks like an outfit Sasha Baron Cohen wore in "Brno." 




 Reminds me of the sculptures from James and the Giant Peach that they made out of all the mashed peach. 




 I would be disappointed if I ran to get this mystical "free beer" and discovered it was just a clever way to get my attention to go inside. Then I'd just laugh and buy a beer anyway to commend them on their trickery. 




 This made me cringe. 




 It's shopped 




 It's true. Whenever pretty white girls do anything, America puts all the attention on it. Attractive white people are the news. Everyone else gets pushed aside. 




 It's not even funny. That person is dead and it's rude to make fun of dead people. 
























 I got dumped a couple of weeks ago for the first time after 8 months with my first ever boyfriend. I had never been in a relationship with anyone before, nor had I done things with a guy so he was my first everything. I even ended up giving him my virginity because I thought I was ready. I don't regret it. But I just still have a lot of emotion towards the breakup and keep trying to tell myself I'm past it but it really hurt my self esteem. I'm a bigger guy and so it was hard finding my first relationship and took a lot of time and hard work. I'm 19 and I just can't figure out how to get past it and rebuild myself. All my confidence is gone and I don't know many other gay guys to ask. Please be nice. Thanks. 









 Exactly. 




 Those feels. They hurt. 




 I upvoted because you're cute 




 The red brick road leads to death, disease, anguish and sadness. There's also cookies and milk. 




 Do I see egg clusters from flies or just puss? 




 I don't get it. Is it wtf because its the same? 




 Yummy! That hair! ;) 




 How did it happen? This makes me so sad.. 




 WHAT?!? 




 He can keep playing with those joysticks he has. I'll take the one in his shorts. 




 This is fucking hot 




 Stalin had an iconic mustache yet people still wear the style and he was worse than Hitler and killed millions more than the Nazi's did. Sadly, I admire his mustache. 




 I'm gay and I just got pregnant. I'm scared but I'm keeping it. Take that nature! 




 This is how I feel on all three dating sites I'm a member of, and in real life when I ever get any courage to try and ask anyone out. 




 He gets me all sorts of hot and bothered 




 Decomposition. You'd look like this too if we left you out somewhere to rot. 




 A woman who fucked up cooking?! This is an abomination! 




 Nothing funny about this but damn they're hot! 




 Did you think it meant January 1913? 




 I'm assuming you think that flesh colored thing right under the kangaroo is a ballsack. You're blind. It's a foot. Otherwise, what the fuck are we looking for? 




 I ain't saying he a gold digger... 




 Buddha hand. They smell fantastic. 









 So jealous! 




 Hot damn! 




 Totally a bag from a box of wine. I've done it at parties. 




 Can I marry him? 




 Dark Helmet from Spaceballs. Very nice. Love that movie. 




 Source?? Please! 









 LOOKS LIKE THIS FAGET IS FINALLY GETTING MY FUCKING BATH READY FOR ME 




 HOW ABOUT GO FUCK YOURSELF YOU CUNT NIGGER SHIT FUCKING PROLAPSING PUSS SUCKING FAGET AND DON'T FORGET YOUR CAPS LOCK BUTTON FAGET 




 THANKS I NEED SOMETHING TO FUCK BEFORE GOING TO CLASS

 YES 




 This is really cool 




 THAT'S WHERE I CAME FROM FAGETS.  




 Well excuse me. I didn't mean to upset you. Gracious. 




 Does anyone else think it looks like the dog is smiling? 




 They're all along the bottom and in the background.  




 Do you really not see the maggots? They're on the reverse side. 




 Repost 




 NO CAPS LOCK
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE FAGET
NO ONE LIKES TO READ THAT MUCH 




 THIS IS MY REGULAR FUCKING WEEKDAY NIGHT FAGET 




 WHERE ARE YOUR CAPS LOCKS FAGETS

I WILL STICK MY SUSHI ROLL IN THAT FAGET 




 There is nothing significant in this photo 




 I think he's trying to get into porn or he might have already done so. Anyways, he's fucking attractive now. 




 Ahhhh, Hispanics 




 I think he likes you. With his penis. 




 I honestly thought this was a man who had put on fake boobs. 




 It actually is a legitimate photo taken during a paranormal investigation of the Amityville murder house. It was taken in the 1970s. 




 Yeah, with no explanation your picture makes absolutely no sense. But since I now know, I can say she's stupid. 




 Agreed 




 Nice makeup. It looks good...but obviously not good enough. 




 Try posting a picture of your mother. Wait. That's what this is. Never mind. 




 Could help with sex 




 I'd bang 




 How about attention whore who probably has daddy issues 




 Looks like Amanda forgot to clean out her locker. 




 Just broke up last night. I can't wait until I no longer care. 




 He looks like Wall-E. 




 It's all a matter of food distribution.  









 I did too. And I'm a man. 









 No. Too late. It's been posted quite a bit already. 




 It's a repost. Trust me. I made the same mistake... 




 There are people with thyroid conditions which causes them to gain weight uncontrollably even though they have a healthy diet. 




 Apparently someone already put this up. I didn't see it on here so I thought I was the first person to post it and then learn that someone beat my by an hour. Dammit. So I have to call my own post a repost. I'm so sad.. 














 I agree. It looks pretty good. 




 She didn't choose the wookie life. The wookie life chose her. 




 Where do people get all these photos of my family?! 




 Last year when I spent Halloween in College Station, I got into two car accidents with the same car and had it break down. Then proceeded to push it half a mile into a parking garage. The car was also covered in puke. The worst part about my night? I was sober. 




 Dammit grandma! I said later! 





























 Are you in Texas by any chance? I'm pretty sure I saw this on my grindr 




 There's no need to be coy. I want him to just fuck me. 




 I haven't laughed so much at a comment in a while. Thank you! 




 THIS FAGET PIECE OF SHIT HAS ALREADY GRACED THIS PAGE
FAGET 




 Repost 




 I feel like I saw this the other day... 




 One of my favorite movies too. The first time I watched it, I got so scared and paranoid that I would religiously check every window and door plus any possible entry ways every night for an entire week. 




 Now, who's to say these men are gay? A real gay man would never look this terrible. They're obviously straight. 




 I know your feels bro 




 Fake dummy of Sigourny Weaver from one of the Alien movies maybe 




 Having your foot too close to the side because it has the potential of getting caught perhaps 




 Tommy Defendi (guy on far left) is one of my top fantasies. He is the one who made beards sexy for me. 




 It's either Ajay or Micky off of Fratmen.tv. They're twin brothers. Yes. You read that right. Twins. 




 Damn Tyler Perry. You scary. 




 Even though I like Michelle, upvote for you! 




 Decomposition bitch 




 I'd go with him anywhere... 




 Nice try. Now go cry somewhere because you failed. 




 Never mind. It is Dahmer. 




 As a gay man, I take extra pride in my ability to spell. Maybe you just hang around fucking idiots. 




 I was thinking more along the lines of "Maybe he should coach the Ice King. That guy sucks at catching and keeping his brides." But still, I'm glad you made the reference. :D 




 My heart. These feels. Sigh... 




 Please tell me they actually said that on television. 




 Sometimes I just want to say "Free? You just made it $5 more expensive." 




 The human body has so many toxins and hidden pathogens, you need specialized equipment to safely and effectively remove waste left from decomposing tissue so that other humans won't get diseases. You can't just Clorox that shit. 




 They think our food is weird as fuck too. Calm down OP. 




 The picture on the bill comes from a famous painting depicting Lady Liberty leading the French people into revolution. 









 WHAT STOP WHISPERING FAGET 




 You forgot #swag 




 Meth. Not even once. Just kidding. More like all day, every day. 




 Deer gets hit by car, dog gets free meal. I see no reason to say its wtf 




 You couldn't post the picture of the one with the close up of the balcony of hooded people. Worst repost ever. 









 Can't even begin to say how jealous I am of this... 









 THIS IS SPACEDICKS FAGET
WE ONLY USE CAPS LOCK OTHERWISE YOU'RE FUCKING WHISPERING LIKE A FAGET, FAGET
 




 I should give this to my parents. 




 WHAT 




 Congrats! I just lost my virginity this past September on my birthday. 




 FUCK OFF WITH YOUR NO CAPS SHIT 




 WHAT ABOUT YOUR CAPS LOCK FAGET 




 Very cool. Thanks for sharing. 




 4chan beat you by days. 




 Someone said it but *hearse 




 I just got told that. Sorry about it. 




 Sorry about that. But a simple "hey this is a repost" would've sufficed you fucker. 




 I hide requests and other stuff so I only get statuses and important life events but they slip in and then I think of the other people they're friends and ask "Do you think the other people like to see that stuff either?" Answer is no. 




 I do that too but there's some people I actually like to keep in contact with so I just ask them to stop. They usually do. 









 Inconceivable 




 Aw, you're so sweet! 




 Oh ok. Thanks! 




 It's a pig *gosh you guys* 




 Oh my god, I'm so butthurt. Let me go swig some bleach because I can't take your bullying. I'm so depressed because you said bad stuff about me. 




 *I do my best* 




 Some of the comments are racist? That's outrageous.. 




 *drool* 




 If he doesn't look directly at me, I'd do him morning noon and night. 




 GET THIS SHIT OUT OF HERE YOU FUCKING FAGET 




 You really should. Fantastic movie. Long but worth your time. 




 By proving that they shopped it to be a half a foot longer than what it is? Innovative. You'll go far here. 




 I was just born. How am I typing? 




 What do you gain with this? A sense of accomplishment in falsifying the post and hoping to get karma from it like the fake artist girlfriend poster? Original or not, that alligator is still rather large. This does nothing. 




 Common thing in local Mexican restaurants here in South Texas. 




 Always 




 There's a picture somewhere of them blowing a guy. Just google it, you'll find it. 




 It doesn't matter. But if a white guy does that, it's all over the news and he's a racist. 




 There are plenty if guys, gay and straight, who have nice handwriting. 









 Bitch stole my wig 




 Does OP have a problem with it or OP just jealous and amazed? 




 PETA this and PETA that. PETA bullshit, PETA PETA PETA. 




 It was one of my favorite books as a kid. And my favorite childhood snacks. 




 No hope left. 




 It was nice most of the time. We'd get into little fights but we got over them quickly and everything was good. And being big and not getting guys that often, I have to go for guys that fetishize fat guys. Sometimes it gets creepy. I don't want someone who wants me because I'm a big guy and that's what they like, all those people do enable guys like me to get bigger. I'm trying to shrink, not grow. I want someone who is going to support me in weight loss. I would talk to my ex about it and I asked what would you do if I lost weight and it was a considerable an he literally said he wouldn't be with me anymore. I need to get away from the fetish. But sadly, it probably won't happen. I have to get skinnier before I can find that.  




 It's hard to seperate things because a lot of things I do on a daily basis or some of my mannerisms remind me of him a lot. Things I say, thing I think of just scream out and it just gets me down. My self esteem has always been an issue for me because I'm a fat guy, and I'm trying to change that. It's hard work but I'm trying. He brought me up and then when he said he didn't love me anymore and broke up with me over the phone, it destroyed my confidence. 




 *things I will masturbate to 




 Seriously? Go back to your PETA headquarters and take a piss shower while you're at it. 
























 Honestly, one of the most disturbing things I have seen. I can handle gore. But buff children? Nope. 




 "Can you fuck it??" 




 *Shoe 




 It's called a horse show crab 




 OP, we demand answers. Where is your fucking roommate? 




 Thanks! I don't hate my ex for breaking up with me though. I just wish our relationship had lasted longer. The breakup was really sudden and unexpected on my end. A couple days before December started he just up and tells me he doesn't love me anymore in that way and it was over. I already had gotten his Christmas present early. He was my first bf too. 




 You're at an HEB! 




 I wasn't expecting to spend Valentine's Day alone this year. Now I'm going to be spending it alone. 




 Cunt 




 I would so fucking vote for them 




 Just saying "no" would've been less amusing 




 Fuckin' 




 Didn't Hitler have his moustache in that fashion because he enjoyed Chaplin's films? I think that's the reason but I'm not sure. Correct me if I'm wrong. 




 *shit* 









 I tried salvia one time and I will never go back. My trip was messed up. I grew a hole in the top of my head and water started coming out it, soaking my entire body. Then it was water out of every oriface. I melted into my chair, and my arms fell off. Then I came back together, turned into a black man and got so scared because my friends turned into the KKK and had a burning cross in front of me, and they were all waiting to lynch me. I'm never doing it again. 




 This makes me feel good. My brother is a chef and attended Le Cordon Bleu in Austin. He taught me all these tips about knives. 




 I love PostSecret. I think this one comes from the Secret Lives of Men and Women compilation book. 




 A lot of Mexican and Tex-Mex food places in my area warn customers that their food may contain small bones and other fiberous tissue that might have not been completely ground up.
An artery is nothing. If its cooked and edible, eat it. 




 No matter if people think that statement sounds racist, it is so true. 




 His painting looks like its made out of shit. If I had to paint him, that's what I'd use in order to match his personality. 




 I could troll people at nursing homes 




 HOW THE FUCK DID HE DO THAT?!? 




 I always preferred Marvel over DC. Fuck me, right? 




 It's a repost. If you wonder why you might get down voted, just understand. 




 No it didn't you filthy asshole.
This is a repost. 




 Am I the only one who doesn't get it? 




 What a bitch. Repost 




 Turns out, this fox is a liberal democratic communist loving facist. More at 10 after a full hour of Nacy Grace bitching her viewers out. 




 Mine too 




 Exactly 




 ARE YOU AT BLINN IN BRENHAM, TEXAS?? 




 I thought it was semi funny because all the girls look like feet and horses (except the one on the far left). Never mind then... 




 Rafael Alencar and Johnny Rapid. 




 Please don't tell me this little alien abortion lives in Texas. I have to leave this state. NOW. RUN FOR YOUR LIVES. AND SOULS! 




 I've always wondered what his first experience getting sexed up was like. You know. Since he couldn't touch it himself. It was like super brand new probably. 




 More like THANK YOU for bringing this to a movie theater. 




 Little ginger complained about being kicked on national Kick a Ginger Day. What a punk. Lets go kick him. 




 Agreed. The caption was brilliant. 




 This is cool! I've never seen one begin decomposing in one of those before. 




 Not wtf but I have to say its sort of clever. 




 About to catch fire? What am I? A fucking psychic? 




 Already been suggested somewhere on reddit. Someone posted it back when all those kids at Sandy Hook went down. 




 You are mighty handsome looking! 




 When they first had a website, I wanted to go on it, so I asked my mom which key was the backwards G. 




 I'm so tired of seeing this picture get posted... 




 I love the picture of Raven at the bottom. "If you can't love yourself, then how the hell are you gonna love somebody else? Can I get a amen up in here?" "AMEN!" 




 It was all the fault of the police for not securing the scene. Everyone rushed in, contaminated evidence, and the prosecution fucked up in nearly every way during the trial. 




 Lemme correct myself, they look like they just hatched a several hours ago 




 This in a month? She's in stage two decomp from what it looks like! 




 Almost. From the looks of it, they're still eggs. 




 Good job at getting the joke! 




 Think about it. It's not scurrying around your place anymore. 




 They just need to be more obvious with their sexual attractions towards each other. Makeout in public, film themselves fucking, spread the tape and watch all the teenage girls realize they never stood a chance. So much blood would be shed. 




 Ok, Hinduism. Still wanted to point out that fact it's not the swastika. 




 I have blue/green eyes and after I've been crying, the color goes bright green. Not lying. 




 The Nazis didn't. Stop being stupid. The Nazis stole that symbol, turned it another way, and used to symbolize their Ayran pride. It originates in Asia and is common to find on statues of Buhdda and in temples around different countries.  It is a symbol of peace. 




 *goose 




 I agree 




 *duck

(please go in the direction I'm hoping) 




 Same here 




 I love Tina. Amy as well. 




 OH MY GOD. MUST GET TO WALMART. 




 Quick! Someone slap a brazzers logo on it. 




 Why is John Lennon kissing that man? Oh wait. 




 *eagle 




 Oh god. Now everytime he arouses me I will think of this and get turned off. 




 When suddenly a black man took a picture in front of the booth? This photo tell us nothing. 




 Bitch is serving straight up fish. Whether its cross dressing, doing drag, or dressing as woman due to the fact you might be transgendered, he still looks good painted. Whatever his reason, he looks good. 




 The magic of drag 




 Holy molestor powers, activate! 




 Cards against humanity 




 Bravo

 Wonder if he ever attended a Wigstock festival back in the day 




 I wonder if Johnny Rapid knows when he poops... 




 I never went to see the movie in fear of heavy disappointment. Whatever I've heard from people who have actually seen the series, I am so glad I didn't go see it. 




 It is supposed to be a wine holder. It's only because you have a dirty mind that you wanted it to be what you think it is. 




 So envious! It's beautiful! 
























 I just finished with the tenth doctor today :( I feel like I'm in mourning because I loved him so much 




 This is why I like kids. They're just so funny! 




 This is why I like kids. They're just so funny! 




 Paint me like one of your white girls 




 You never know. She could have pudding in there just to freak everyone out. But she probably doesn't. Just look at her. Pudding? That's too smart. 




 At first glance I thought of Tenacious D and The Pick of Destiny. 




 I totally thought it was wtf when it was posted THE FIRST TIME. 




 The one on the right is Chris Crocker, known for his famous "Leave Brittany Alone" video on YouTube. 




 Hello haha 




 They are featured in quite a few episodes under the ninth reincarnation of the doctor in 2005 when the show came back. I know I'm right. In the show they dealt with a specific family of Raxacoricofallapatorians called the Slitheen. 




 Post it to r/wheredidthesodago 




 Of course, no problem! I enjoy telling people. Also my name is Eli! 




 The creature is off of Doctor Who. It is called a Raxacoricofallapatorian. Link to an explanation of the creature:
http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Raxacoricofallapatorian 




 This looks more like stains from decomposing bodies. They even have human outlines. 




 Thanks. It was my best guess. I honestly just remember how much of an impact it was on the surrounding communities. 




 The Johnson's lived 30 miles away from where I grew up. President Johnson was long dead before I was born, but Lady Bird died almost 10 years back, I think back in 2004 (can't really remember). I lived in Fredericksburg, and the Johnson's in Johnson City. They attended church in Fredericksburg at St. Barnabas Episcopal Church. Lady Bird was such a nice woman. One time when I was 3 years old, we were late for church. We sat in the back row, behind Lady Bird. I was being unruly, not behaving. Mrs. Johnson turned around and told my mother what a cute child I was and asked if it would be alright if I sat with her. Needless to say, I was quiet the rest of the service. She loved kids. I bet she really was laying into her husband. 




 While it may be a gimmick, she really does have enormous talent. She's just gone off the deep end, let the fame get to her head (I think at least). I'm a huge Gaga fan but you have to admit it when the people you idolize and respect lose it. I saw her in concert in 2010. She really is an amazing vocalist and her piano skills are incredible. She just needs to calm it down. 




 I see where you get that and I respect that being her fan. The great thing about music is that a song that can be so small and insignificant can mean so much to someone. A lot of Adele's music speaks to me on a personal level. The music helped with a lot of heartbreak. But, music is fascinating. Songs become personal, and that's the beauty. Some people enjoy it for the tune, the rhythm, the vocals, or the words, and its all about taste. Like wine. You pick and choose until you find something you like. That's how I see it all.  




 I see no difference. In every aspect. 




 What's his porn name? 




 It's the angle of the camera... 




 I think you spelled "*I am an asshole*" wrong 




 **kill the child** 




 Same. 
**24 cents for a pack of ramen is TOO DAMN HIGH** 




 You even used the same title. What a dick. 




 Very 




 He was so attractive and handsome. 




 Sorry someone ate the chips like they were supposed to be eaten and left the ones they didn't eat in the container because they didn't want a whole lot of chips and tried to keep the left overs from getting stale? 




 Someone noticed that earlier 




 Nice little tongue twister 




 http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sawfish#section_2

Or you could not scuba dive where they are? 




 Looks like my toilet after really spicy Indian food. But I love my curry. 




 Walmart does a shit job when it comes to gathering carts from their lots. Walmart is just shit. And as far as the cart crew shirts, I'm pretty sure they have them at most, if not, all stores. It's a corporate uniform. They don't really have a choice. 




 Downvote me if you want but...
*knife 




 Because Ozai is an evil dude. Why would he be nice and upvote someone? 




 Agreed 




 lulz 




 That was beautiful 




 This is one of the cutest things I have ever fucking seen. The expression in its eyes was priceless. 




 I fucking love gingers. Too bad you don't like guys. I'd be more than happy to be your valentine. Please take it as a compliment and not a comment from a creeper! 




 *Licked 




 They are. I think the person being locked though is Marcus Butler. They do a lot of videos together. 




 Jack Harries. Yum! Both he and his twin. Wish he was licking me!  









 Closest thing to a man granny has seen in years. Plus, repost. 




 I didn't know medical examiners dyed the brain when they examined. I've neer heard of that. It's cool. It made the brain look diseased though lol Do they do that often where you work? I've seen a couple autopsies but have never seen them dye it. 




 Well that fantastic for you. You go be a bigot back at them instead of being a bigger person and not giving a fuck. 




 And you think this hasn't been posted 40 times either? 




 You couldn't wait at least a day to repost it? Just go away. 




 Repost 




 Totally not a sand crab 




 This has been posted before. 









 Well, I know I'm looking at a repost 




 Oh god what the fuck is that! It looks like a caterpillar but it can't be so what is it! Oh my god!!!!1!!!!!!1!1!!!!! 




 You're the stereotype that prevents me from having straight friends. Good job. 




 -_- so. funny. 




 From the movie "The Mummy" and its also computer generated. 




 It's common knowledge. I saw a post a week back that had someone's thumb with her face drawn on it. The resemblance was uncanny. 




 That guy has been an extra in so many movies.  




 Why not laugh? 




 Oh god, that was perfect 




 Because you're not in the fucking north eastern part of the country. 




 Why do people think it a good idea to repost the same thing everyday? 




 This made my skin crawl 




 Took me a second. I thought you were implying something about a street name. Now I see. I too am "lame"... 




 "I'll meet you there a quarter past Y" 




 Whenever I see Claire Danes nowadays, all
I can think of is her playing Temple Grandin. I always expect her to talk in that way. 




 Some heavy drugs and her sexuality. 




 I remember it being a pretty popular post. A few days ago that is. 




 Is it wtf? Yes. Has it been posted a million times? Also yes. Even if you're new, I'm surprised you haven't seen it yet. 




 Am I the only one who remembers that Daleks can fly and levitate? 




 Nike doesn't advertise in other countries? 




 The underwear of course. Aw fuck it. Who am I kidding! I want all of it!  




 Want! 




 If this is your picture, why aren't you helping? Stop taking pictures and get your mouth to work. 




 ...the fuck? 




 WHO THE FUCK FOUND THE GODDAMN GIF OF MY FUCKING FAGET ASS GIRLFRIEND BRUSHING HER TEETH

 My brother is his doppelgnger. He's had people approaching him asking his for photographs and autographs. He just goes with it (for the women) but he says it can be very tiring. 




 I would find so many things wrong with my place just to keep them around. 




 I never realized this... My brain... 




 He* 




 No. He got caught somewhere under my house and we couldn't get to him. We would let him play outside (as long as someone was always with him) and my dad was outside with him, left him out, went to find him and he went under the house. We had no way of getting him out. We died under my house. I was 11 and cried for three days. 




 What's a kd 




 I miss my ferret. I know Pedro is in a better place though. 




 I'm just saying. Doesn't really look like her. 




 You sure that's actually her? Because it doesn't look anything like her facially.  




 I don't believe in prayer. And I'm pro choice. Yeah, no rally or prayer meeting for me. I just don't like people messing with my state. If you want to leave the state, by all means leave, you won't be missed. I don't go around bad mouthing where you live so don't do it to where I live. But thanks for stereotyping me with the people who are no doubt the majority. I just wanted to let the original guy who insulted the state and moved away that he wouldn't be missed. That's all. I could care less about what's said or thought about me on here, just that I'm not the typical Texan. By all means bring your down votes. I give no shits about it. 




 Do I give a fuck? Lets check the board. Show me "Do I give a fuck?" [X] Ooo looks like I don't.

 Actually, I would say the same top three! I know Detox will definitely get in there. I like Ivy and I do agree, I hate the way they say her name. I liked Coco at first. Then she let Alyssa being there get to her so badly and now all she does is play the victim. Alyssa has gotten over it (except for having little digs at Coco every now and then, which is understandable to me being in the competition setting. People are going to try and put you down.) I would like Coco even better if she didn't have that attitude. Roxxxy is all body and face. No substance in my own opinion. But as far as top three, Detox, Alyssa and Alaska are the best predicted for it. I would want either Detox or Alaska to win though. But, if Alyssa gets that $100,000 maybe she could fix that overbite! 




 I think these top 7 all have something they're talented at. Obviously for Jinx and Alaksa it's comedy, Alyssa is a dancer, and they all display it well. Even though I'm disappointed with what she's done so far, Detox is really talented. She is a great performer in her own right, but I know she can do better than what she's given us on the show. 




 No one this season has any talent whatsoever? If that's your opninion then so be it. 




 You really haven't seen much of her work outside of the show, have you? She's brilliant and every bit as talented as Sharon. Yes she and Sharon do the same style of drag and they think a lot alike, but that is a bullshit answer as to why she got onto the show. I don't disagree that Sharon had some doing with it, but nevertheless Alaska is earning her keep. She needs to change it up like Michelle said this past week and that she's getting predictable. They said the same thing about Sharon. Sharon is all about spook, Alaska does more "glam". They're both unconventional. Alaska is doing a great job. 




 I only down voted this because you were lazy and used "ur" instead of just typing out the word itself. Sorry. 




 Most of the major universities in Texas have quidditch teams. Not weird or wtf. 




 This is a picture of the site where JFK was assassinated. They made a movie starting Kevin Cotner exploiting the conspiracy theory of there being a second gunman who delivered the fatal head shot. In the movie, Costner kept replaying the footage in court, narrating JFK's movements in response to the head shot, that he moved "back and to the left." 




 Don't worry OP. I know what you're referring too. I don't agree with the second gunman theory myself after studying it so much and physically going to the assassination site, but I know. 




 I'm gonna go ahead and say boat? 




 This is genius.

 Dealing with religious friends is tricky. If they love and care for you, the fact you're gay shouldn't be a big deal to them. You're still the same person, you just decided to share an aspect of your personality and life with them you hold value to. If they have issues with it because of their religious beliefs, they should have enough sense to look past it. If they don't, I wouldn't say they really cared for you. But don't take it offensively. They're missing out on amazing opportunity to know someone who is courageous, strong and just brilliant. I've had really religious friends who have beliefs against homosexuality look past it because of the relationship we have and for who I am. Hang in there. I never really believed it when people said it gets better, but now I can say that it gets unbelievably better. I became so much closer to my friends and my life is looking up. I was so low. I have nothing to look forward to but the top of the hill. I hope this helps. Good luck and love yourself. 




 Darn! Oh well. Thanks for letting me know though! 




 Source perhaps? 




 If this isn't a repost then I don't know what is 




 It's riddled with Doctor Who references. I've only had one person respond and know what it all means. Nice fellow. He just stopped messaging me one day. Don't know why. I always watch what I say. It happens a lot. Maybe I'm not saying the right thing? I would have no clue since I've only ever had one real relationship. 




 When I came out to my brother in November all he said was "About time you told me! I was wondering when you were going to do that." I told him because he was the only person with me when my ex broke up with me, via text. It was so great to tell him! Made me and my brother so close. 




 I try to make it as honest and fun to read as possible. After three years of going out to places to meet guys, and the same amount of time on dating sites, I've only had one boyfriend. It lasted for a good seven months. I've been single for nearly 5 months now so I need to get back into it. 




 I just joined that site a few days ago. I'm hoping all goes well. It's my third dating site. I don't do well in real life. 




 Not eligible for the Darwin Award. 




 Imagine having them both at the sme time.. 




 OP can you give the video? Thanks 




 I thinks it's sad there are people like that. 




 Didn't look like her to me 
























 Was she in a car when she told him that? He told her to swerve. I assume she's in a car then. 




 So he has one cart on there at that moment, and that makes him lazy? 




 Fuck off with this 9gag shit. 




 Sick of seeing him. Like someone said before me, stop giving him attention please. 




 In a deleted scene, Rose and Jack tried to both get on but the combined weight was too much for the door. James Cameron also teamed up with the Mythbusters and tested it out. They confirmed that only one person was able to be on the door and have it be able to stay afloat.

 That's true.

 Exactly. 




 He's cute too but I don't think this goes here 




 Oh how I can count the times this exactly happened.. 




 Both maybe. I would certainly feel like this a lot but never express it to someone. I would lean towards pity perhaps.

 Goddamn repost. 




 I have never seen a religious billboard in my part of Texas. 




 Texas isn't an easy place to live when you're LGBT. I love Texas, but people who do this thing is what makes me the most uncomfortable. Keep your head up. If you're that desperate to get out though, Austin is a good place to visit. Mind if I ask where in Texas you are?

 I shouldn't say just Americans. Just any country that views animals the same way. 




 It's a taboo in a lot of countries and I don't agree with it but if you put it in their perspective, it's no different from other animals. Americans view dogs and cats differently than people in the East. In their culture it's completely ok to do this. Yes it's fucked up, but you have to look at it their way: in a lot of cases it's either eat or starve. 




 I didn't know that. That's pretty smart. I used to smoke and never heard of doing that. 




 This was posted already today, 6 minutes before you, but that one is a repost already. Repost of a repost.

 All it really is, is a cry for attention. She calls herself names so someone will tell her otherwise. I tire of seeing it and dealing with people who act like this.  




 I thought he had downs at first..

 But it is funny. Where the rest though? There more to this photo that didn't get posted I guess. 




 Calm down. It was just a suggestion.  




 Anyone have names? 




 That would make it Christmas for me. I have the hots for him and the other two off of Workaholics. 




 If they don't find out who it is through security footage, you can always save a sample and send it off to a lab for DNA testing, which you can do with shit. People don't realize that their DNA is nearly everywhere. Locard's Principle: "Every contact leaves a trace."

 Something a kid wrote. Calm down. Obviously can't spell. 




 My friends did that too! Because I was in a foul mood already, I didn't really dance. I don't want to so I just sat at the table wishing I had a spiked drink! I'm sorry you had such a shitty time. 




 Oh please let it be a sign from the drag goddesses. 




 I wouldn't have minded dropping the money, if it had been with a boy. I hope you enjoyed it though. My friends tried their best but I ended up going home early and raiding my parents liquor cabinet. 




 I felt out of place junior year. It was also just a tough year for me because I was dealing with all my emotions and the thought that I should kill myself, which I almost did, but I'm glad I didn't. I made senior year different for myself and I brought a better attitude with me. I still didn't go because I kept longing for someone to spend it with in a intimate way, which friends can't do. 




 My dad told me a joke about a one eyed prostitute the other day. 




 Sounds like a really great guy. I only went to prom once with friends and I didn't go my senior year. I just wanted someone to go with me, I stayed home rather than go. I love my friends but sometimes it only does so much. I didn't want just my friends, I wanted it to be special and have a date, like everyone else had, like all of my friends had. 




 Alyssa gets drop dead GORGEOUS. 




 WERK 




 There's various pictures of Detox here standing with other people at the taping of the RuPaul's drag race reunion/coronation taping they did this past week. She went head to toe and this is the coolest look I've ever seen. 




 That's the T 




 I'm sorry about that. I'm just in a fighting mood today and haven't had a smoke in a while. I'm trying to quit and it sucks! I get really on edge when I don't have cigarettes. 




 Did I say it didn't? Voguing formed out of it as a dance. I know reading came first. It's just an expression saying that reading is fundamental. I'm not saying its fundamental to the dance, or that it came from it. I know reading came first. I'm may act like an idiot sometimes, but I'm not completely stupid. 




 It's fundamental.
But vogue is a form of reading or shade. 




 Retouching? Honey, that's photoshop. 




 Yeah. They had a lot of big dreams. They came from the depths of society and it makes me feel thankful for what I do have, but I still see myself wanting to be as brave as they were in chasing after who they are through the medium they saw fit. I gained a lot of respect and pride trying to understand their lives. They made the best out of shit situations.  









 She did put it out on the front of pop culture, but she definitely took it. The thing I don't like is that I don't hear much of her crediting those who created the style. I hate that about Madonna. She takes the credit and never gives it. 




 Madonna never created it. She borrowed the style, the mentality of voguing, and adapted it to her own taste, then put it into song. It's been a crucial part of the culture there in New York long before she did anything with it. 




 Yes 




 It is. It's one of the few documentaries that I watch regularly. 




 It's from the documentary "Paris Is Burning." It's a style of dance created in gay culture and is known as voguing. 




 It's been here and on r/funny before. 




 His tits are just as good 




 I kind of like mine! "Beverly Spits" We have a cat named Spits. 




 It's cool. I was just trying to help you out there. It was just really vague. I misspelled explanation earlier and I even checked it before I posted. We all make mistakes. No big OP. 




 Sorry for sounding condescending. I was pointing out some things for OP to consider and thanks for pointing out my mistake. If I point out a mistake, I expect other people to do it for me, so apparently it happened even though I double checked before I posted that comment. Also, when did I become a large bundle of sticks? 




 Check your spelling before posting next time, and maybe give a bit more explanation as to what's in the jar instead showing it to us, and expecting us to know what's in there. 




 Bone marrow is good 




 Well I'm glad you're taking control. My parents sure didn't and I'd hate to see a kid go through the shit I did because of their weight. Grandparents are supposed to be those guys to spoil but even they should know when to stop so maybe just talk to your parents and/or in-laws about it. Packing him a healthy lunch for school might be something too. It's ok to indulge every now and again on sweets and junk but teach him that if that's all he eat, it's a very difficult road filled with many serious health complications. I know it's like I'm giving you a lecture but its all in best interest. Wish someone would've done it for me. Keep it up and best of luck! 




 You should do it more often 




 Oh god. She isn't even qualified to judge that show. I want to see a Grammy before you judge people's singing! 




 YES. 3 




 This was awful 




 Have you never cooked or experimented with brains before? If you're an executive chef (I'm only assuming that since its your sous chef) and you work at a high end place, how come you haven't ever done brains? Brains are good when prepared correctly.

 I haven't heard Alaska sing live, I was going off of the challenge they did a few weeks back really haha. Glad to hear she's better than she was led to be in the show. 




 Roxxxy is just a pageant queen to be completely honest. I feel Ru isn't looking for that anymore. Jinkx can display glamour when asked, she's funny, she can really act and sing and for me that's the total package and what a superstar is. Alaska is almost in the same boat only because she can't sing. I like Alaska's style more than Jinkx's. Roxxxy is just all beauty and no substance IMO. Jinkx and Alaska are entertainers in all respects of the word, whereas Roxxxy is look. 




 I completely agree on that. You can blame the editing all you want but I really think they didn't have much to paint her differently. Her attitude was unacceptable on this episode and I feel there is no editing to blame for it. All Roxxxy right there. 




 Who is it 




 You should watch her on Willam's Beatdown on YouTube if you haven't already watched some of the episodes before. I look forward to Drag Race on Mondays, but then I yearn for the Beatdown on Fridays! She also does makeovers on a show on the same channel (The Stylish) called Transfashionable. Courtney Act is also on Transfashionable.

 Some kid did that in my kindergarten class. Then the weird kid that no one liked went over and sucked the pee out of the carpet. The reaction on the teachers face was priceless now that I think about it.

 I was drinking vodka primarily then got talked into a game where I drank wine and beer. I then went back to vodka. My morning did not go well.

Edit: I drank a shit ton of vodka. 




 Well I'm not at school for the time being. I live in a town of 10,000 where gay is still a major taboo. All of the gay guys my age have been smarter and moved away.

I hope it looks up for the both of us soon. Thank you for listening. 




 It's hard to get out of here. I was going to college last year, moved three hours away from home. I was really close to my boyfriend at the time with him only being less than an hour away at a different school.

I went to reapply for this past semester of school and had some issues with my loan and financial aid which forced me to stay this semester. I'm trying to become a forensic entomologist and my small junior college doesn't really handle people in that field which is why I'm trying to get into a major university (Shooting for A M). I found out last week that it's probably not going to happen because the advisors at my school got me into the wrong classes and I have to stay under a minimum 45 cumulative hours in order to get into the department at A M. They literally told me to forget my degree. So that has only brought me down even more.

My mother also broke her arm this past July so it was fortunate I stayed home. I got to take care of her because my father has a job five hours away so he's only home on the weekends. I'm stuck right now. 




 Hello everyone. I am 20 years old, overweight, and gay. Every time I meet someone and things go well, they end up rejecting me or saying they shouldn't be dating right now. I've only had one actual boyfriend. My friends all know that I'm gay, as well as my siblings. My parents are the people I'm working on. Please don't tell me they already know, that's not what I want to hear since I hear it so often from my friends and dates. For everyone else, it's not their business unless I want it to be. I don't care if someone else tells them, but I won't if I don't want to. To get to the point, I go on dates, talk to various guys, meet wonderful men, but can't get someone to take me as theirs. This is what makes me so down and low. Especially right now. I had been seeing this guy for 2 months, and things were so good. I couldn't believe I was able to find someone like him. Then things took a bad turn when I thought to bring up the conversation asking where this was going. Needless to say, I've been rejected. To make matters worse, my bisexual ex, who I have become very good friends with, has met a girl he really likes. He talked about moving to where she was, marrying her in the next few years. I would be fine if I wasn't so jealous that he's doing better than me. I've been to my lowest before, where I twice tried to kill myself. I'm scared about going back down. Every time I meet a great guy, it turns out to be nothing. I'm so tired of being tossed about. I'm so sad and alone, I don't know what to do. All I ever wanted was a companion to be with. I was alone growing up gay in a small rural Texas town, and as an adult, I'm lonelier than ever. I can't stop crying. I just want my pain to stop. 




 I too am from Fredericksburg. 




 My nana is very content at the nursing she's at. As she's said to me many times, "I got nothing to squawk at." She turned 91 recently and has been in the worst stages of Alzheimer's for the past couple of years. When we went to go see her for her birthday, she called my mother (her daughter) by name instantly. I could've cried. She hasn't known my mothers name in two years. Sometimes it all comes back to her, other days she's lost but happy. All she does is smile. I always bring her chocolates because they're her favorite. She doesn't know who I am but she knows she trusts me and when I look into her eyes it almost as if she's remembering me, but then the moment passes and she goes back to the chocolates. I don't think about her forgetting who we are. I think about if she's happy or not. I always ask, and the answer is always "Definitely." 




 I've all about given up even bothering to date anymore due to my fear of rejection. I personally haven't ever handled it well, and lately being as lonely as I am, I honestly am not sure what would happen if I got rejected, no matter how politely they said it. Yeah someday I could get a yes, but I'm too afraid. For you rejection might be easy. It's not for me. Not by a long shot. Being gay, I could just wait for someone to ask me, but I've had no offers. 




 Aw congratulations to the both of you! To many more wonderful years together! 




 :) nice 




 I just want to let you know, this gif made me laugh for so long, it started to hurt. It seriously made my fucking day. 




 My sister, her boyfriend, and I are all struggling with quitting. It's just so satisfying. I started smoking socially while I was drinking, and it evolved to a point where I used to smoke a pack a day. I'm 20!  I usually smoke now when I'm bored. I was so close to quitting last year. It would take a week to two weeks for me to finish a pack. Plus, being a broke college kid and not being able to afford them helped. I'm looking into some alternatives. If anyone had any suggestions, things that have worked for you, I'd be glad to hear some.  




 The hairy chest, the smile, and that butt. Mmmmm

 About two months ago I met up with this guy, hit it off, went back to his place to get it on. We started making out and we were having a good time. Then I noticed there wasn't much to grab a hold of while I was exploring. I figured it was just because of the way his dick might've been positioned. I went to go down and unzipped, pulled it out and just looked. This guy had a 2 1/2 to 3 inch dick. I am not joking at all. I wish I was because this guy was really cute. I'm a bottom and so there was no way I thought it would do the job. I didn't say anything, I just blew him, let him finish, pretended to look at my phone and was all "oh shit, I have to go! There's an emergency with a friend of mine!" Didn't see him again. 




 Horrified because you're jealous she's got a bigger dick 




 Looks like its already been done. Good job everybody. 




 Mother of god 




 There's plenty of chaser where I am. Problem is, they're almost all AT LEAST 20 years older than me. Finding someone around my age who isn't into a "daddy" type is hard.  




 I think OP went full retard.

 Having a hard time finding a video but these two are Jonah (the red-head) and Chris from Dirty Boy Video. I'd have to pay to see the video but there are some more photos.

 Same here! My first time was fantastic because the other guy was very experienced so he knew what he was doing. Anybody after that hasn't been that good and last time I had sex it hurt a lot.

 I live in Texas, which is home to two "Body Farms", belonging to Texas State University at San Marcos, and Sam Houston State University in Huntsville. I'm actually studying to become a forensic entomologist! I am so jealous (as bad as that sounds) that Stephen Fry got to visit one! In Texas, the "Body Farms" are very hard to get in to. They are very strict as to who is allowed in. I heard from a professor of mine that you even need express WRITTEN permission from the Dean, various department heads, etc. My professor has been trying to get into one of them for years with no success, even though she has her PhD in entomology. They had a problem a few years back with students taking cameras, phone, anything that takes photos, into the farm. The bodies are all donated and so the privacy and dignity of the decedent have to be protected, so when that was violated, they tightened the reigns. I'll hopefully be able to get in good words with a few people and maybe one day get in myself! Fingers crossed. If I can't get in, I can always wait until after I die. I plan on donating my body for research to one of these farms. Still, these farms are not just cool for a person like me, they help investigators and researchers out a lot.  




 Some girls are like that. They will do anything to avoid messing their nails up. 




 Awesome people 




 The males are harmless, yes. Females have the short pincers that can hurt. 




 If you want to know, this one in particular is a male. They have large pincers that obviously extend way past their heads. They are practically useless. The females on the other hand have short efficient ones that can hurt you, even draw blood. 




 I've never had a boyfriend who lived closer than 2 hours from me. 




 Think of it this way:

Either have parts of a dead rat spread about

Or

Have a live rat somewhere in/near/underneath your house 




 All I see is trash

 She's younger than Mother Dust 




 We're still beating this horse? 




 Transvestite, transgender. Transvestite is just so people can directly understand. The meaning of transgender can be pretty confusing for non-LBGT people. It was confusing for meand I'm gay. I use either interchangeably. 




 Looks like a transvesite. Clue is the hands and the face. Silicon injections and the hands are pretty darn manly. Someone's tucking a secret or is post-op. 




 Depends on what version/translation you read. In some it does say children and that they were killed. 




 Lana Del Rey is actually pretty pleasing make out music.

 I'm so jealous. Fuck. 




 If you find a wound on the animal, there's a good chance that flies laid eggs in the wound. The main concern is that they can carry disease into the animal, making it sicker. In some cases the maggots actually help, eating the dead tissues (which is what they do) and clean up the wound. Doctors do it to humans, but they of course have access to sterile maggots. Still have the animal checked for infections and such.
Another theory is that it's bot fly larvae which burrow into the skin and incubate until they are ready to fall out and turn into adults. If you find small holes in the skin at central points (spaced/grouped fairly close together) could be bot flies. Have your animal checked just in case though. Hope this helped. 




 YESSSSS. Jill Harkness, reporting for duty. 




 Congrats! So jealous! I'd be focusing on Jinkx the whole time. I have a huge crush on her. I watched all the "Drag Becomes Him" videos and it made me love her even more. So happy you get to see them! 




 I never thought it a funny read because I loved Sharon, and at that point in the season, I could care less what the fuck PhiPhi thought about anything.
That video just pisses me off. She's so unprofessional. I never liked her, and I never will no matter how much convincing someone did. She's just ugly on the inside. 




 I LIVE!  




 If you can carry your groceries in a small basket like that, they can out them into a bag and you can carry it like that. There's really no need to take it outside to your car. 




 I've seen this in places far from the ghetto. It's just so the baskets don't leave the store. The store I worked for didn't allow the carried baskets to be taken outside. 




 I agree. It's pretty darn cute. 




 I couldn't either.
A week ago. 
























 My grandma died this past December at 92. She wasn't the person I knew for the past 6-7 years. She was different. It sucks but I made sure was happy until the end and that's all that mattered to me. 




 If you saw them and thought they acted suspicious that means they're doing a shitty job of being discreet in order to catch the robbers. It's good you called. 




 Oh damn! 




 I'm gonna have to come up to Lubbock for this!!! 




 Bitch I can't breathe!!!!!!! 




 I saw that and thought it was absolutely baffling. There was another part where one of the journalists laid down to take a picture of a statue or Kim Il Song, and a party member chaperone blew up, threatening to have them kicked out of the county that day for disrespecting the statue. Fucking crazy. 




 One day... 




 Good lord you're like a dream 




 :(((( 




 Kind of looks like Shiloh from ChaosMen 




 Hieeeee Ru! I just wanted to say that you are such a huge inspiration and I've been a die hard fan of Drag Race since season 2 when I stumbled upon it. I love all of your ideology and you've helped me learn to really love myself. I really feel it and I know I can do anything I set my mind to. I sometimes get down because I haven't found that one person I can really connect with and to give some of this love to. I'm young and I got time but I can't help feel like something is missing although I have all the pieces in front of me. How do I go about becoming more positive on my outlook towards a prospective partner or finding someone to share myself with? Don't get me wrong, I love my friends and family. What I crave is intimate connection. How do I get what I've desired for so long? Thanks for listening! Can't wait for the new season! 




 Omg that's on my fucking birthday! YASS GAWD!!! 




 My parents have a Dauschund that whines and cries during car rides. Our other Dauschund loves car rides and she does too. It's just when we do long car rides over 45 minutes long that she gets anxiety. She's about 6 years old. I've been thinking maybe getting her an anxiety shirt (a thunder shirt I think is what it's called) and see if that would help her. Holding her in your lap sometimes isn't enough and she'll start whining again. I hope the comstant press use and sensation of being held will help her. 




 I've had great conversations with some nice guys on grindr. Then they ask for a face pic. I either send one because I think "Maybe this guys different. Maybe he won't block me just because of the way I look and we can continue having this awesome talk!" Or I don't send one because I'm too afraid and just want someone to talk to like you do. It never works out after I send a pic. I feel for you bro :( 




 Wow looking good 




 I couldn't sexualize him during GotG. He and my brother look too much alike. But I got to pretend my brother made a fucking awesome movie so I find it a fair trade. 




 And then you look at everyone else like "yeah I did all that shit. I'm a crazy motherfucker" 




 I already had the lucky egg on me and exp share. Beefed up Cobalion and Terrakion and pretty mush destroyed. I know it was a lazy attic but it worked. Thanks for the advice! 




 Thanks! I beat them all! I beefed up Cobalion and Terrakion and took out Iris all with Cobalion, one hit each. Felt good. 




 You go girl! :) starting my journey myself. Keep at it! 




 Hey everyone. I'm fairly new to playing the video games. I only ever watched the tv show and did the card game when I was younger. So I need advice on how to beat the elite four and the champ in this particular game. Here's the pokemon I currently have on me:

Cobalion lvl 67
Terrakion lvl 54
Magneton lvl 53
Unfezant lvl 51
Golduck lvl 48
Surperior lvl 44

Any advice helps. If I need to go and level up my pokemon more, then I'll do it. If you can give me a strategy so I don't have to do that, even better. Anything helps! Thanks! 




 Hello to you all! I just found this subreddit and thought I would get some help. I'm 20 and have always had problems with the amount of oil that is produced on my nose. The pores get clogged very quickly as well. I wash my face every day using just a basic Dove men's face and body wash. My face feels good for about 4 hours, and then it feels like I heavily dowsed my face in oil. I need some help! Anything helps! 




 You means it's not already? 




 my fried chicken is all over the floor 




 I hate how true this is 




 Solomon is bottom 




 yumm 




 I can sense this sort of split is going to happen for my father and I sometime in the future because that fact I'm gay and don't agree with his political ideology. It's silly that something like what happened to you can rip families apart. I'm sorry it happened and I hope something better comes out of it. Keep positive! 




 "Your planes gonna crash! -click-"  I DIED!!! 




 I was too afraid to put Shannel myself but I'm glad someone else put it. Never really liked her (especially in all stars). 




 S1: Tammie//Akashia

S2: Raven//NPB

S3: Manila//Alexis or Mimi, I can't decide

S4: I only liked 4 queens overall from this season and they were Sharon, Chad, Latrice, and Willam.

AS1: Jujubee//Mimi

S5: Alaska or Alyssa//Roxxy or Serena

S6: Bianca//Darienne or Swordfish 




 Oh cool! They're all really beautiful! Hope that I can get one someday. 




 What's the ratio of her Savannahs? 




 It is a SeanCody guy and the name is Allen. This is from a scene with another guy.  [Here you go](http://www.myvidster.com/video/24259275/Allen_Jeffrey)

 It was the cardboard thing that came with underwear that was my material in the beginning. I would pick underwear based off the guy who was on the front.

 Definitely not a great feel to feel. "'Tis better to love and lost than never to have loved at all." 




 What if they never had sex? It's been a year and a half since things were broken off between me and this guy I was seeing. We didn't have an actual relationship, just sort of a friends who really liked each other. I still feel a lot for him. We never had sex in the 8 months we were together. I felt that I genuinely loved him. He just didn't feel the same.

Edit: words 




 I used to think that the slang and language used within the community was only recently created. Then I watched Paris Is Burning and was educated. I love the film!

 cute ;) 




 I went to school in Brenham, TX for a year where the original factory/creamery is and one of my friends worked for them. So much free ice cream! He would come from work every day with a small cooler filled with sandwiches and cookie cones (my favorite!), pints, and half gallons. 




 That's true! 




 Even if you could get decent prints off the blades, they would still have to be run off databases. It could've been done by someone who's never had their prints taken, like dumb teenagers. The Intergrated Automated Fringerprint Identification System [(IAFIS)](http://m.fbi.gov/#http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/fingerprints_biometrics/iafis/iafis)  has millions of fingerprints in its database which includes criminals, civilians, and suspected/known terrorists. Even if the comparison was narrowed down to the local level, they have a large possibility of not getting caught. But do I hope these sick fucks get what's coming to them? Absolutely. 




 Oh fuck. This is hot! 




 I think the peanut butter is PERFECT. So making these! 




 I had one serious conversation with a guy on OKC, and it was such a nice one too. I think it was the next day or so, I took a risk and asked him to dinner (which was super uncomfortable for me since I had never actually asked someone out due to the lack of opportunity). It never happened. Not because he said no, but because after I asked him out he stopped talking to me. We were having a great time talking to each other, but I guess he couldn't handle talking to someone face to face. 




 Anyone have a source? 




 I haven't had a birthday party since 5th grade. Only one person showed up out of the 10 or so I invited, and even then they only could stay for 30 minutes. I haven't had my own party since. So now that I'm older, if I know of someone with a birthday the same day as mine, I suggest we plan together because I know their friends will show up and I might actually have a decent birthday. I've done it twice now and I had so much fun. I could've cared less about presents, I was just happy people were wishing me a happy birthday. 




 Hell yes it is. I also like being the one who gives it! 




 I remember this place as well. I used to talk to a lot of people and it made me feel better. I had a guy that I really liked and he liked me as well and so it was an internet relationship of sorts. Then his mom found out about him and one day I get a call from his phone number, but it was his mom and she accused me of poisoning her son and never to contact him again or she'll call the police. I was 15 at the time and just the threat of police scared me so much. I felt bad for him and also myself because it was the first guy I actually had a connection with. I often wonder how he's doing and if he ever ended up ok. There were other significant people I met but that one has always stayed with me. 




 I completely agree with you. 




 We learned the basics of filling out tax forms in our government and economics classes here in my part of Texas. Everyone had to do it.

 My cars name was passed from the person who had it before the person I got it from. It's a white '96 jeep cherokee and his name is Moby, as in Moby Dick the big white whale.

 God you look like this friend of mine from my first year of college I totally crushed on, but you have a beard. Hot hot hot 




 That would be so fun to watch! Hope that happens. Thank you for answering my questions and I love watching you on Getting On. Have a happy new year! 




 Hey Alex! I'm a big fan of yours and I'm so glad to see you doing this AMA. I used to watch MadTV ALL THE TIME when you were on it, no matter what character it was. I just wanted to know if there was anything that you miss about the show and do you still keep in touch with your former cast mates? Do you still do live sketch comedy at all? Thank you for making me and my family laugh all these years! 




 Bear with me, I swear it's all relevant.

I'm a 20 year old gay man who is currently living at home, with a very non existent social life. I've never been in a serious committed relationship where I called him my boyfriend. It's always been strictly physical and I just always went along with it, anything to hopefully have a relationship. I know how that sounds and it took me a whole to realize how ridiculous it is. A guy I was seeing last year (let's call him Bill) ended things after 8 months. During the entire time I thought I was going to get committment from him but it ended on heartbreak. I blame myself for anything I did to make him not want me.

Fast forward and we're good friends. I forgave him, and after a nice break from him I got over my feelings for him. He started seeing this girl and I was fine with everything. He said he wasn't into going full on with a guy. This past Sunday he says things didn't work with this girl. It was too bad because he liked this girl. Later on he shows me a letter and says it's to his "boyfriend." My heart actually sunk and I snapped. I went off. He said they'd been seeing each other for two months and then he asked him to be his boyfriend. I was shocked. Literally. He's free to do what he wants, it's just the only that bothered me was that he was so quick to commit to this guy he met two months ago. I spent 8 whole months working on him, trying to get him to commit, and it takes this guy two months.

I went off. I cried in anger, I was sobbing uncontrollably for four hours. What did this new guy do that I didn't? Is it me? After Bill, I searched for someone to make me feel whole, loved and like I wasn't hopeless. I had met this guys in September who I though was going to be the guy to commit and after two months he just stopped talking to me.

I think I have depression and I might be bipolar (all of which hasn't been diagnosed because of how afraid I am to see someone). I've never felt lower. I just get rejected and then Bill commits making me plunge. I almost did something drastic to myself. Despite all the desire to end it, I stomached my pain and reached out to my dad. I didn't tell him about being gay, but I told him I needed help. But he tells me that maybe I should "pray more" because "God will fix it" and that I need to "rid [myself] of the Devil."

I finally got the courage to reach out, and it feels like it was made into a joke. I don't consider myself religious. I'm spiritual but I don't believe in God (if that makes sense). I prayed to him since I was 12 to make the desires for other boys go away, and since I was 15 to make my suicidal thoughts go away and to make me not so sad all the time. People say he works in mysterious ways, but making me and others like me suffer so much is plain cruel. 

Despite my dad being an ass, after the holidays, I'm going to make an appointment with my doctor and take the steps nescessary to beat these feelings. Telling him gave me the strength. I just needed somewhere to say all this. 




 I'm not going to entertain a fucking troll like yourself anymore. 




 I never said my theory was right, that's exactly why I said theory. It's my opinion and what I would think would happen in a practical situation. So excuse me Mr. Expert. But dogs CAN deliver false positives in ANY situation. Just because they're cadaver dogs doesn't make them extra special and excuse them from that probability.

I hate to break it to you, but you're also a dick. 




 ...I've done this before :/ 




 They still can deliver a false positive. I theorize that the cadaver dog would not be able to detect any further smells after they expose the dead animal because his nose would be overwhelmed. The police would probably dig, find the dog, conclude the cadaver dog gave them a false positive and move on. 




 I hope you two continue being best friends. I told my best friend during the summer after junior year and he said he still was my best friend and he'll always love me like a brother. I haven't heard from him since 2012. 




 I only met her one time though. I'm confident I won't ever feel sad about her. I feel bad for the ones she left behind, but not her. From what I remember she was a very unsavory person, but now that I know she was depressed, I can see where that image I have if her comes from. I just thought she was a bitter, angry snob. It makes more sense now. 




 I'm confident my sadness or depression stems from me being gay and having to repress it all these years. I haven't told my parents because I know how strongly they feel about homosexuality and I don't want to lose my parents over it. I know that this sort of thing only happens in extremes cases but I would consider it that due to how my parents speak about it. Whenever they have to share their thoughts on how wrong and disgusting they think all gay people are, I do get some comfort from my brother who knows. I want to tell them about the depression and my sexuality but I don't want to be hurt from the very people who are supposed to love and support me unconditionally. 




 She jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge. She was 41, I believe. I never knew her that well. I only met her once in my life back when I was in elementary school. My cousin had been diagnosed with depression some time ago and had been battling it intensely with therapy and medication. I was told by other family members closer to her that she even considered doing some form of voluntary electroshock therapy to cope with the feelings and make them go away. 

I myself have been struggling with sadness and horrible self-esteem issues. I myself have never been to a therapist because I'm too afraid of what my parents might think or say, or if they ask the reasons why I want professional help.

When you hear about someone's death, you're supposed to feel remorse, sorrow, sadness. Typically this is me too, but it was different this time because it struck a chord with me. It angered me. I became jealous of my cousin. She escaped her hell. I'm still in mine because I don't have the guts to off myself or get help. Does it make me a monster for not feeling sympathy? For being heartless? To be selfish in this way?
