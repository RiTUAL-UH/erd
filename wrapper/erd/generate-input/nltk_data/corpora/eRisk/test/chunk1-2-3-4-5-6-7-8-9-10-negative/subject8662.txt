 I'm looking to be the first to get quadrupal depression. It cancels out and I live a perfectly normal, happy, life with the occasional fits of hysterical sobbing. 




 No Michael, an illusion is something.... Wait... Shit 




 BEES? 




 Reddit, I'm in the school library and I have a file saved on the computer next to mine because our student drive hasn't worked for 3 weeks. The guy currently on the computer will not get up, despite being asked politely. What can I put up on the screen to get him to move without getting kicked out of school? 




 Ok, so after flashpoint, I get the how what and why of the new u, and I'm enjoying the non justice league titles. My question however is almost all of the titles seem to be reboots showing the heroes close to the beginning of their careers, which is fine and I get. However, it states that supers have only been around for a few years and based on today's releases, batmans gone through 3 robins and is on his 4th who is his 11 year old son; and the events of killing joke, rip, the year be was dead, return of bw, and batman Inc have clearly all happened, as have the lantern Corp wars.

Is there something I'm missing as to why everyone but bats and lanterns is just starting out, is everyone else lost but an explanation should be coming, or is this "because fuck you I'm grant fucking Morrison that's why?"

Edit: I understand this is not proper reddiquette but who the hell downvoted this? I was literally just asking a question I was confused about. How are there three people who though "there's something he doesn't completely comprehend and needs clarification on... NOOO!"

I understand if this is even read again that i'll get slammed for this but original three downvoters, wtf? 




 You can seek help wherever is comfortable, If you have a general practitioner, you trust, they can absolutely refer you. If you don't, cold calling can be scary and nerve wracking, but sometimes you just have to follow your instincts.

One way or the other, find someone soon. There is nothing wrong with you, but you do sound like you could use some extra support. Until then, you are beautiful and loved, and we are here to help whenever you need it. 









 Very long bad relationship had ended recently and I was interested in pursuing a mutual friend. Before I go on I should clarify that I have clinical depression and very low self worth, which i know is fairly every day for reddit, but it pertains to the story. My default assumption is that everyone hates me. I'm not overstating that, the only people I know 100% of the time that love me are my parents. 

So when I say that it was a big, hard deal asking her out, understand that it was a big, hard deal asking her out. 

But she said yes! I have never been so elated in my life. Even the previous relationship didn't start off with me asking the girl out and her saying yes. So we talked for a few weeks, planning and trying to make the schedule work but nothing ever happened. Things kept coming up. We eventual grew apart over some differences of opinion between my ex and ex's current bf.
On a later phone call with ex, she told me that the girl never liked me, and only said yes because she was scared of me and what I might do if I said no, (my depression was undiagnosed at the time and this was high school so any abnormal emotional reaction meant you were 2 steps away from bringing in a rifle.)

tl;dr My ex informed me a new romantic interest only agreed to go out with me because she was scared of me. 




 HA! YOU CALLED HIM FAT! YOU'RE FUNNY, YOU'RE A FUNNY GUY! AND COMPLETELY IGNORING THAT THAT LANGUAGE IS JUST COMMON VERNACULAR FOR SMITH WITH NO ILL INTENT, GENIUS AND FUNNY. Ass

 I dig Dylan as a songwriter, and Times They are a chanin' is on my ipod. Singing otherwise is not my cup of tea. 




 Yeah, I'm a fine arts major in school so a lot of my friends can be on the hipster side, so I can hear it about country from time to tim. 




 Starting off, I do love Nickleback and don't understand why they are hated as much as they are.  




 His name is Robert Paulson 




 Dell. Fuck everything about them. Two inspiron laptops died within a year of each other. When I sent the first laptop in, it took them 3 months to get it diagnosed and replaced and that was only after me calling and complaining multiple times. Then they were so mind fuckingly incompetent that they "fixed" the old laptop and sent it back to me. I use the quotes because I gave that to my mom and it died within a month.

Never again.  




 This one is a long shot but if I'm ever going to find it, you guys'll do it. Since I can remember, my father's been telling me about a book he once read that had his favorite one liner ever in it. A detective or a cop walks into an ME's office and says
"Well, is it murder?"
and the ME Responds
"Either that or the most thorough suicide I've ever seen"

Google, book stores, and librarians have failed me. I know it's a long shot but does anyone recognize this line and know what book it's from. It'd make a really great Fathers day gift for him. 




 The dreams don't stop for a while. I'll get back to you on when they do exactly, I'm on three years.

If you want for health reasons to loose weight then that's wonderful, but motivate for yourself fuck everyone else. In terms of physical appearance, I'm a writer so I can tell certain things from syntax and word choice, and I promise you that you are a beautiful person. 

Don't give up on mental health professionals, you'll find someone, just keep trying. You need help and you're worth the effort. It may take some time, but you will find the right fit. 




 Yeah, it's the fuckin' nights man. Stumble across a pic of an old interest or even just a couple enjoying each other and it all floods in. 




 I also didn't pick the best of schools I'm guessing. Private university in florida, the preppy to nerd ratio doesn't come down in my favor. I've had more than a few awkward moments in class cracking a futurama joke and getting blank stares....

Thanks for the sentiment though, that's encouraging.  




 You have no reason to care about me or my life and if you aren't in the mood for a long read, by all means skip this one because there won't be a tldr.
Reddit, I don't get it. I suffer from depression, and have for a long long time, though it was only diagnosed a few months ago. But even with that knowledge, there's still so much I don't understand.
A lot of my issues stem from lonlines, which I'm sure is shocking coming from a guy on the internet at 3am. However, I can't figure out what I'm missing. I'm relatively smart, have the ability to make people laugh, I'm overweight but haven't quite passed into ugly. What's the secret ingrediant to finding people that I missed? Did they teach it in school one day that I was sick. I'm not talking about a wife or my soul mate, that will come when it comes, I'm talking about a woman who can spend time with me and say you are worth spending more time with/on. Again I'm not asking for the rest of my life, but I see women all the time in these long term relationships with absolutely retched people, it makes me insane. It's a running joke with my friends that my life is a sitcom but it really is full of stereotypical bullshit that I just don't know how to get past or get around.
Which leads to my other point. The loneliness is saddening and crushing and I don't know why. The fact of the matter is things happen at different times for different people and I know I'll find someone eventually, but it's been twenty two years and while I know that mentally, emotionally it's just like this gorge of sadness and desperation that I can't seem to cross. 22 years and not one girl has ever thought to say yes or ask me out on a date.
I can't figure out how to get past this or why I need to. My time is coming, I know this. I'm smart, funny, cuteish, and can write fairly well, I know it will get there. But till then there's nights like tonight. Stumbling across pictures of the "almost had it" and just sliding down the walls, and I just don't know why.
If you read this, thank you for your time, it means the world. 




 Thank you, I really appreciate the sentiment.The small difference is that I have an a-typically presenting depressive disorder, I find and recognize joy in every day life, but then if a downswing hits I can think on those fondly, but not truly happily. 

If we go back to the gorge metaphor, if I slide down a wall a little bit, I can stop and enjoy the foliage growing on that wall, and even scoot back up a bit, until sliding down a bit further. 




 Warning!!! Downer to follow. I need to rant, maybe exercise some demons. You have no reason to care about me or my life and if you aren't in the mood for a long read, by all means skip this one because there won't be a tldr.

  I was just screwed by my colleges financial aid tacking on an extra semester to school, meaning that I'm going to have to pay an extra 7000 dollars to graduate which may mean more loans as most of my scholarships expire after year four.
I desperately need a job, even more so now that I zerod out my bank account to get my car towed and looked at to determine that the timing belt I had replaced six months ago snapped again, and I don't have money to fix it. But if you don't have reliable transportation, most companies are turning you down out of hand.
My mentor through college is getting laid off because the head of our department is a jelous territorial cunt who can't stand that my mentor is more talented and well liked than her. This is causing major stress in terms of finding work and is severely damaging her marriage to a guy who has become one of my closest friends.
I also recently found out that my grandfather is dying of colon cancer and while he still should have a few good months, probably won't live to see me graduate college, which he would have if this snafu hadn't happened and I was walking in two weeks.
No entertaining stories but I could use a pick me up.

Response: http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2010/8/13/ 




 Please please please please keep this reasoned and cool headed. I just want an actual discussion and finding out what other people think about the dickwolves controversy from the last few months.

How I view things right now.

It was a joke. An off color joke that wasn't meant to offend but was inevitably going to. If you go back and read the original script, it was a commentary on "heroic" gaming culture and there is no conceivable way that it can be read as supporting rape. 

That being said, they could have handled the fallout better. They shouldn't have apologize, nor should they have been asked to, and the follow up comic about the matter was perfect. However, pressing the issue just to press it with the t shirt and all of that was not necessary and shouldn't have been done. 

When it comes down to it it was a joke, a joke I personally laughed at, and I have had rape touch my life in multiple incidents. If you were offended by it, then I'm sorry but sometimes people are going to make jokes that are going to offend you and that doesn't mean that they are advocating the position that did the offending. 

For those saying this issue is done with, what spawned me writing this was going through the back catalog and researching their development for inspiration and I came across timelines and opinion pieces, it's very much not dead.

Just wanted some other people's thoughts and opinions on the issue.

 For light depression maybe but for my case and what I gather to be this man's case, it's a chemical imbalance and outside of Neo level thought control no, you cannot just think yourself happy. 




 Speaking as someone who suffers from clinical depression, I would ask that you stop pimping bullshit pseudoscience and do a little bit of research into how crippling and hellacious an experience it is, and how for 95% of us, it's a bit harder than being stronger and realizing "fear is a facade" or whatever else you heard at that particular hotel ballroom.  




 I grew up in the south, so there were a lot of rednecks and bullies. The rednecks who would throw out hateful speech left and right and assume you would agree with them, and the bullies who strutted around the place thinking they were top shit when you knew how sad they really were but also knew how readily and totally they could fuck your shit up so you just steered clear and had a begrudging respect for them even if you didn't agree with them.

In 8th grade the rednecks and bullies started feuding at it was the most wonderful piece of MADD come to life I've ever seen. Many people from both groups were expelled.

I wanted this to be like that... I'm sad now.


TL;DR I wish a fight from junior high had repeated itself. 




 Isn't a preemptive edit just a post? 
























 Some of the comments seem to indicate it's fairly new terminology.  




 Yeah, it's not the primary probability. We're mainly thinking it was exhaustion since it hadn't happened before or repeated. Also going to my PCP to run some tests to check for sleep disorders and the like.  




 The TR army grows stronger.  




 Hey I'm writing and answering it at work so no shame there. Thanks! 




 *insert physics joke that I'm not smart enough to make*
 




 Internet hug for you. I deal with some minor anxiety, but nothing major. I'm involved in theatre and I worked for my college's res life department so I know quite a few transsexuals and know that in the early years it can be tough. Hang in there and if you ever need to talk you can pm me.  




 I've actually been suicidal twice in my life, to the point of almost acting upon it. What's somewhat fucked up is what stops me is other people. I've always cared much more about the well being of others than my own, and I couldn't stand the idea of someone I love finding the body.

Also, though I'm straight I'm going to co opt this, the hope and assurance that it will get better gives me something to shoot for.  




 THERE WAS NO AARON 




 Much appreciated. I find it funny that I posted this just to start a discussion, saw the cake and realized what the day was, did a separate post to Karma Whore, and that's going no where.  




 Hey I kind of like it. Made for some good jokes between my friends if nothing else. The official diagnosis is Dysthymia with secondary presentation of a Major Depressive Disorder.  




 Which is one of the things that we're looking at. I haven't ever dissociated before that I'm aware of and no one close to me has reported any odd mood/personality shifts beyond the normal, but we are keeping that in mind.  




 It was the driving home that got me. If I had run someone over, would I have even known it? That sort of thing.  




 It does... quite a bit.  




 We can agree to disagree here, I'm not gonna argue about it anymore, I don't want a medical flame war. I would consider a disease with a secondary presentation one diagnosis and one treatment, as did my psychologist, but if you see it otherwise, cool.  




 I'm working my way up to exercising. Apathy is the major symptom at the moment and overcoming that will be the first big hurdle. So said because it's hard and I'm also really really fat.  




 It's just the wording. It is rather absurd. But you have to laugh about it, I learned that a while ago. If I hadn't developed my sense of humor, I probably wouldn't have made it.  




 I was diagnosed a little under a week ago. And I didn't realize today was cake day... 




 Freaked me out pretty good. Hasn't repeated since though.  




 I wish 




 In that I cannot be convicted for it, yes it is.  




 While I am that, it is not the clinical definition no.  




 It has cost me jobs in the past simply by me being too apathetic to get out and look, but at the moment, and I can't believe I'm saying this, I'm luckily broke as shit. I say that because I have two roomates and a dog depending on me, so even when I don't give a shit about taking care of myself, I'm beholden to them so I can drag myself up. 

But yes on a regular basis I cannot bring myself to do what should be basic tasks like getting up and going to class. I take 3 classes a week, I'm in my last semester, and when things were at their worst this year I was missing weeks at a time. 

The exhaustion may be linked to the depression mixed with working a full time job and commuting to school. I'm glad to only have 1 more month of this.  




 INCEPTION 




 Back at you. Taking things a step at a time to learn how to deal with it. Good luck with yours. 




 It's like you just kinda move to an acceptance that you're always going to be the eeyore of whatever group your in until you hit whatever bottom you need to to make you realize it doesnt have to be like that.  




 We'll see. I'm starting off on the lowest dose and will move up after about a month, and keep doing so as long as that's effective. 




 One of my roomates refers to it as my double potions class. Seems appropriate.  




 I can see your point, but just because those precise two words aren't, the condition is so it is a mental disorder that can be diagnosed, and the diagnosis can use a colloquial name.  




 You're absolutely right now that I'm rereading it. Either the psychologist told me the wrong thing or, more probably, I mixed up some of what he was telling me. Thank you for pointing that out, I'll get clarification on my next visit so I don't sound like an ass. 




 At the moment we're starting me off on prozac. We'll increase my dosage until I get to a point where it's not helping or I reach a degree of normalcy. The problem with Prozac is there can be side effects including the little general going permanently awol that may need to be taken care of with other meds, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there.

If I hit a wall with the Prozac, we'll look at moving me on to a more expensive cocktail of drugs but hopefully it won't come to that. Prozac is cheap and effective.  




 You should. As I said above, if you feel like somethings wrong, I cannot express enough ho important it is to see someone. It could just be that your stressed and overwhelmed, it could be that you have a chemical imbalance. Either way it's best to get a helping hand before anything becomes too much to handle. I let it get that far a couple of time and it almost ended really badly. 




 Thank you, well caught. 




 See my quadrupal depression reply 




 It's no problem. I can't stress enough the value and importance of seeking help. Sometimes it takes a while to find the right person, be it counselor, therapist, or psychologist, but it is worth taking the time to find the right fit. In the mean time, if you ever need, I'm here and r/depression is here to lend a sensitive ear whenever you need. 




 They do have different classifications for types of depression like any other illness. The one that I have just happens to be two different categories mixing together.

The thing with any mental health profession that most people don't realize is that a lot of it we still don't understand. We know what does and doesn't work in terms of treatment, but the why of it all, (i.e. why does the chemical imbalance start, why do certain medicines work) is still all in the very hypothetical at this point. 




 Thank you! I'm on stronger medication and things are starting to get better slowly. There are more bad days than good, but the fact that there are starting to be good days at all makes things a little easier to deal with.  




 http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JWdI8aKt8dk/ThRkkgjlyvI/AAAAAAAAAUY/arLCIieDxNM/s400/DontFeedTheTroll.jpg 




 ... Yes it really really is. 

Double depression is dysthymia with secondary episodes of major depression. It's a clinical diagnosis. 




 No but it does come with a large sprite mixed with Holly Hunters tears. 




 It's fairly constant. The way my psychiatrist put it is, we all have good days and bad, but we mostly live at an emotional normal. A center line if you want to look at it like a graph. I'm constantly in the lower hemisphere of that and rarely if ever reach another persons emotional norm.

Put it another day. When an average person comes home after a long day; not necessarily terrible but not great either, and they're tired, somewhat fed up, and just want to lay down and rest? That's the happiest I feel with any amount of consistency. 

The depression itself I would say is worse because I have a fairly good support system that helps get me through. The worst thing though is feelings of complete helpless loneliness. I live with a roommate and their SO. They do what they can, but there's still a puzzle piece missing that neither can provide. At least not without causing a much larger amount of drama than it's worth. 




 A couple of minor things here and there, increased lethargy, ambivalence. The major one though was a few weeks ago I lost 10 hours. I work in a place where my day is split between two sites. I work in one for 7 hours, and another across the street for the last two. A few weeks ago I was gathering my things to leave at 7, and then woke up at 5 o'clock in my bed.

The fucked up part is I seemed to have functioned normally in the in between time. No one mentioned any abnormal behavior at work. I drove myself home, and actually made an appointment with a psychologist, so I must have known something was not right. 

We're not sure yet if that is related to the depression, if it was just extreme exhaustion, or if it's something else physical. More tests coming. 









 It's esentially when you have dysthmia mixed with a major depressive disorder. 

Dysthymia is the more common thing that most people will get at some point in their lives. It's minor and usually non recurring, but when it does recur, it can be overwhelming and crippling. When people say they feel trapped and can never feel happy, that's usually recurring Dysthymia. 

Double depression takes that and combines it with a major depressive disorder. Which has a quicker onset and greater initial impact. So when you mix the two together, it's like taking on someone else's heavy camping backpack while you're already lugging two armfuls of your own shit up a hill. 
























 Lol Thanks. Like a lot of people who got bullied I had develop a sense of humor as a defense mechanism, both for them and me. They punch softer when they're laughing.  




 Thanks. One of my friends cut the trailer together, think he did a pretty awesome job.  




 Repost from earlier reply: That's what I was initially diagnosed with a year ago. At the time it was atypical because I could sleep and find some joy in day to day life. Less so now.

 




 Acting is what I'm weaker at, I'll probably be doing more writing/directing. Thanks for the good thoughts! 




 That's what I was initially diagnosed with a year ago. At the time it was atypical because I could sleep and find some joy in day to day life. Less so now.  




 And you as well

*looks at user name*

I think... 




 Nope, I'm down south.  




 It pretty much goes Friends/family, Dog, complete strangers, unit, corps, God, Country, then me.  




 Lol. It only goes so far, but it's fun when it works.  




 Appreciated, working on moving towards bigger and happier things.  




 That's great! I hope to get there one day. The good days are getting very slowly more frequent on the pills, hopefully one day I'll be able to get it without the pills.  




 Thanks for asking! 




 Oh not at all.

I'm finishing up a degree in Theatre, but I'm going to be pursuing a film career. As for work work, I work in the customer service field in a call center.  




 Ok, I think I see what you're saying. I'll definitely look into that. Thanks.  




 *Honest reply redacted due to being typed at work* 




 What I thought was the proper definition was wrong. I looked it up and realized my mistake. I will be clarifying it with my doctor the next time I see him so I can speak with the proper level of information on the subject.  




 A couple people have said they don't think they'd pull through, but I still say you'd be shocked. 

Honestly the stereotypical emo description really works best. It's like you're walking down a long dark tunnel with water up to about mid-shin. It's cold, clammy, uncomfortable at all times and all you want to do is just lay down and not feel that anymore. After a while, that becomes your reality and the cold clamminess almost supplants the concept of the warm blanket. It's almost comfortable.  




 Everyone thinks I'm quiet when in reality I just don't unleash the full crazy until you know me well enough not to call in the guys with the butterfly nets. 




 I read this after another d-bag had called me a faker and didn't read the don't. Then I was confused by the rest of your post. You're the politest troll I've ever met. 

Kidding aside, thanks a lot, I appreciate that.  




 I'm starting to look at meditation and lucid dreaming. Also reading into some Buddhist ideals. Is that kind of like what you're talking about? 




 I'm 22, fat, white, with bad knees and back from spending a good deal of time inside lockers, this was my only option.  




 Hopefully they will/are. Medication is starting to help.  




 I saw there was a post about what redditors have depression on the front page and I thought I'd get discussion going. There's a difference between starting a discussion on a website where no one knows who I am IRL and seeking attention. I'm not walking around with a Double Depression sandwich board.  




 Yes I'm currently on Prozac and we'll see about adding that/switching it up as time goes on.  




 My only regret is... that i had... boneitis.  




 Running after pay day when I can afford them. Running the full spectrum.  




 Will do. 




 When I'm in a room with more than eight people my hands start shaking, it's not a matter of just punching through a case of the sadsys, there's something chemical in my brain that makes me sad/lonely/anti social that I can't correct with thought power.  




 Is that where not only do I go free, but the state give me 50k to send someone I dont like to a mental ward? 




 That was a many layered comment. Have an upvote.  




 Thanks! Doing my best. This is helping honestly.  




 The difference being those people slogged through X number of years in misery while I have a chance to live out the next 50 happy.  




 That's fine, I'm up for anything at this point. I'm not crazy about the idea of whether or not I remember to take a pill being the difference between happy day and struggling to get off the couch.  




 I know at the clinic they have a neuro psych department, but I don't know much about it so was just following the familiar roads.  




 Not gonna lie, it's a fun way to get out of shit/ask for favors. 

"It's your turn to do the dishes" "But I have double depression!" 




 Yes, when he used those words I started laughing hysterically. I think he might have been inching towards the phone to call in the guys with the jacket.  




 Thank you! 




 You'd be surprised what you can handle but thank you, I truly appreciate that.  




 Lol. It would be much appreciated. Have a pretty small acting role, but put in a shit ton of work behind the scenes, and I'm really proud of how it turned out.  




 Yeah, that was really unnerving and I'm hoping it doesn't re manifest.  




 Ok 




 Just hold on to the positives that you can and know that you are a beautiful person and people do love you. When you're ready, you really do need to seek some help, we can only do so much. But until you are ready, we are more than happy to do all we can.  




 Reference to the it gets better campaign last year. I'm straight but I took it for the purposes of that point.  
























 Helps a lot actually, especially with your username. Live long 




 Thanks for the reply! I started feeling like I do around 7 or 8 so I totally get you.  




 I had friends who had to ask me if it was ok to laugh when i told them. When all that's left is absurdity, enjoy it. 




 You're doctor is the only one who can tell you that. Just remember that there is no magic bullet with mental health. You're going to have good days and bad. Hopefully, by working through the process, the good will eventually outweigh the bad.  




 I really connected with that, a lot of similarities with me as well.  




 It helps a bit yes. I have lonliness and abandonment issues so talking to people helps.  




 Good on you fundamentally misunderstanding a disease  




 Nope, bipolar means you have up periods. I don't 




 This has brightened my day but no my very serious medical condition has not disappeared.  




 The brain is a crazy thing, so it is actually possible. Not saying it's gospel, some therapy isn't as good as others, you just gotta find what's right for you.  




 Ahh, gotcha. My bad.  




 A double horseshoe? 




 And to you. Remember, these are just my experiences, so don't necessarily self diagnose. If you think there's an issue that needs help, I strongly recommend seeing a counselor of some sort.  




 Same here, feel free to pm any time. Thanks! 




 Appreciate that, though being honest I didn't realize it, and when I did, I did do a Karma whore post.  




 Could very well be a major factor. I haven't ever eaten healthy, even when I dropped weight.  




 I can't diagnose you. If you think you might, see a professional for diagnosis/treatment. It's not anything to wait around on.  




 I have two hands.  




 It's what I've been used to for about 13 years now, don't know much else on the emotional spectrum.  




 If you ever feel like you might have any kind of mental disorder; constant sadness, extreme apathy, hearing voices, loss of time, seek a professional counselor for diagnosis.  




 Feel better now? 




 http://500motivators.com/plog-content/thumbs/motivate/me/large/44-oh-i-see-what-you-did-there.jpg 




 I have a friend who's done that and it seemed to help him. I need to research more but I'm not at all opposed.  




 I know, it's something I'm trying to do but it's damn hard at times.  




 It's not overly common and is an explanation as to why standard treatments weren't helping.  




 Some days are easier than others but when it comes down to it, I got out of bed today because of what might come tomorrow.  




 You are most welcome. Most of my collegiate career has been such bullshit I delight in making sure others arent going through the same.  




 Many thanks. Seem to be a stream of people who didn't like this post looking to kill it. But jokes on them, I made the front page, I can live without the karma.  




 I work the graveyard at a call center which is DEAD on weekends so it's been helping me stay awake actually, but I'm happy if it helped at all.  




 Considering I paid a whopping total of 16 dollars to my psychiatrist, probably not.  




 Much appreciated. 

Medication can be a bitch and a half, kudos to you for stubborning your way past when it stopped being effective. 

Relationships take a lot of time and patience, even more so when you have depression, but you'll get there.  




 Listen to Patton Oswalt and eat a tube of circus peanuts knowingly. I must prepare.  




 It will. It can always get better. God I hate saying something this cliche, but it always gets darkest before dawn, (I know, I hate me too) but the fact that you can see yourself happy is a good thing. If you can see it, it's possible. For a long time I couldn't even see myself happy.  




 Not exactly what it is, but this is a true statement.  




 Yeah, it's mostly about getting better for me. Honestly just the name made me laugh when I heard it and has been an interesting conversation piece, which is why I did this.  




 It seems to be fairly new from the other comments.  




 Sounds pretty similar, except I don't have the up days, I'm always on the lower side of things.  




 I'm trying to get into meditation, but my mind races a bit to fast and i havent figured out how to calm it just yet. 

I've never taken any illegal substances, and that's all I will say about that.  




 Is that a Breaking Bad reference I'm not getting? 




 One of my close friends was diagnosed bi polar, so we have that connection that has really helped us both through some tough times.  




 No worries, at my worst I wouldn't wish what I was going through on anyone. Reddit actually helped me a lot in showing me that I'm not alone. If you ever need an ear, we're always around.  




 Very nice. I have to loose weight and exercise releases positive endorphins that can really help with depression so I'm trying to get into the habit, it's just breaking through the apathy. Thanks for the well wishes! 




 You as well. I find it kind of fascinating how little we really know about depression and the human brain, like which meds work with who and why. 
























 I've tried Atkins, LA, Weight Watchers, and a few others. Nothing really took. Came to the realization that when I'm ready, I'll just need to watch what I eat for my own self.  




 I appreciate that but I hope you don't really give up. It's hard to find the right method of treatment, and there is no magic bullet, but you have to keep plugging on to make things better. Let me know if I can help.  




 It's my pleasure. I would recommend starting with a therapist. They generally are more counseling oriented as opposed to medication, but if the two of you decide that's the best option they can recommend you to someone. Generally I think that's probably your best start.  




 Computer, Tv, Playstation, yeah pretty much. I just need to work on my discipline and dedication.  




 I'm not crazy about the idea of taking anything illegal, but I appreciate the advice 




 Thanks for sharing. Prozac seems like it will help, I'm looking forward to feeling like a person.  




 Woke up not remembering doing anything/getting home/sleeping. 




 Oh it has been mentioned. One of the things I was looking forward to when I decided to do this.  




 LOL. No worries at all man. Thanks.  




 I monitor all those things. Drugs arent for everyone, but neither are the alternative lifestyles. Thanks for the good wishes though! 




 Better than being tri polar... 




 Doc advised that prozac can make you go limp, not that that matters in my current life, but that can be treated with meds.  




 I dont precisely know what happened but probably the former.  




 Repost: A couple of minor things here and there, increased lethargy, ambivalence. The major one though was a few weeks ago I lost 10 hours. I work in a place where my day is split between two sites. I work in one for 7 hours, and another across the street for the last two. A few weeks ago I was gathering my things to leave at 7, and then woke up at 5 o'clock in my bed.

The fucked up part is I seemed to have functioned normally in the in between time. No one mentioned any abnormal behavior at work. I drove myself home, and actually made an appointment with a psychologist, so I must have known something was not right.

We're not sure yet if that is related to the depression, if it was just extreme exhaustion, or if it's something else physical. More tests coming.
 




 Hadn't ever heard of them, I'll start dropping by thanks. 




 Absolutely. That's part of why I did the AMA was to talk about different peoples methods.  




 What's our vector Victor? 




 Not saying that at all. There are people who have it much worse. Again, just felt like starting a conversation.  




 And most people do. My weight has fluctuated all my life and I have no doubt taking it off would help, but that's also not the magic bullet for it all.  




 You are both clever and the first one to make that assertation. Good for you.  




 There's not an official way that I'm aware of. Treatment with drugs working to balance things out I think is really the marker.  




 I was the same way until I got to the point where I was thinking about ending it. If you think you might have it and things aren't getting better, I cannot recommend going to see someone highly enough. Even if it's a school counselor, you can't always do it on your own.  




 lol. 




 Not a problem. let me know if I can help at all. 




 Many thanks for the well wishes! 




 Well for one not that many people do but for 2 They are two of my best friends and are usually considerate not to "shove their happiness in my face" when I'm in a lonly swing.  




 I have tried healthier living before, though not to that extent and it didn't help as much. I think if I go back to it with a combination of what I'm doing now, it'll work a lot better.  




 I want so badly to disagree with you...  




 Ok, that's cool. Like I said earlier, saw a topic on the front page and felt like starting a conversation.  




 1. Often. I do not have a good diet, and never have. I'm trying to correct this but habitual behavior and budget tend to get in the way. Will be working on this in therapy.

1b. 330 with a 6'2 Frame. very overweight

2. I've been told I don't snore often. I am getting tests done in a few weeks to see if sleep apnea is a possibility. 

3. Yes. I am in my house roughly 10 hours of the day in total. 

4. Not as much as I'd like, I'm planning a big move in a few months and need to budget better than I have been, however I do treat myself from time to time.  




 I lold in the literal sense. Well done. Have an upvote.  




 Much appreciated! Thank you for reading.  




 ... no 




 Apologies if I've been mistyping, been wading through a lot of replies. I'm currently seeing a Psychiatrist and a therapist.  




 It's a specialized name that will help narrow the treatment field to get me better. Knowing that I have Dysthymia with secondary MDD gives a therapist a better idea of what they're dealing with. 

And I know you were being sardonic but seeing what you know is a beautiful day and not being able to enjoy it can be pretty damn soul crushing.  




 First let me be clear that I am not a medical professional and so my advice should not be taken with the same weight as one. 

That being said, from my experience, those of my friends, and talking to counselors, the normal key things can be triggers, unusual amounts of stress, family problems, relationship problems etc, can all trigger what may have been under the surface for a while.  




 It depends on who you are seeing and if you have insurance. It's a specialized field so it can be pricey, but some practices are more willing to work with you than others. If you have insurance, find out if it covers mental and who is in your network. If not, start looking around. I go to a baptist behavioral health clinic. Those bigger clinics will be more able to help with prices than private practice in my experience.  




 It's a bitch aint it? 




 Whoops, thanks.  




 Yes, Yes, and Yes. Things work differently on different people.  




 Thank you very much, and I'm glad to hear you're doing better. That's encouraging.  




 I'm just starting the meds/therapy. I just developed a really dark sense of humor to help me cope when I didn't  know what was wrong with me which has been a gift and a curse. It can be off putting to some people, but it helps me get by.  




 Unfortunately, as I said earlier, there is no magic bullet. Just remember your family though. Suicide is never the answer, believe me I've been on the edge, maybe over it, you are loved and there is a way out of the hole, it's just a different path for everyone.  
























 When some people find their outlet for management of their disease, it can override everything else. I havent found mine yet, but when people like that do, it's pretty inspiring. 




 If you're over 18 Just insist on confidentiality. Unfortunately without a professional diagnosis there's no way to be sure. The brain is an incredibly complicated thing that even those with decades of training and experience are only beginning to grasp an understanding of. That's why medication and treatment is a truly trial and error process, we don't understand how it works. 




 It's hard to put into words, and unless you experience, comes off as whiny but I'll try. 

I can't picture anything good happening ever. I have hope it will someday, but if a good thought enters my mind, I work out 10 ways it can and will go horribly. I hate myself, my body, everything about me and have a complete overwhelming sense of hopelessness and despair about my life and how i effect those around me. 




 No no. I was originally diagnosed as atypically depressed because I can sometimes find joy in day to day life. Something as absurd as that name, though still serious, has to be laughed at no matter how sad you feel. 




 I know, I completely lost my shit for a good minute. Think I concerned the doc.  




 Elegant though that reply was it missed the mark of what happens with mental disorders completely. There is no test for chemical imbalance. A psychiatrist makes observation and recommendation and you find the right prescription and dosage through, for lack of a better term, trial and error. Think about the topic being discussed a little harder before you flaunt your ignorance 




 Think of it like trying to move a huge dresser up a narrow flight of stairs with just two people. Watching a happy video is like doing the whole thing by sliding it on the carpet. It gets a little further, but doesnt help that much and is eventually going to slide back down.  




 Moved out of my parents house five years ago but sure.  




 Yeah, Ive gone through periods of weight loss where that's been better, just hasn't gone all the way and I fall back on old habits. 




 In my darker periods it can be. Sometimes cripplingly so, to the point where I can't make it from my bed to the couch. Those are the days that I have to really struggle to get through 




 That always does seem to oddly help. I've always put others first and making them happy makes me happy in return. No such thing as a truly selfless act. 




 It's no bore but I appreciate the support, and am going to start working towards it. 




 I understand, and thanks for the support. As I've been saying, I don't want sympathy, it wasn't for cake day, I simply saw a depression topic on the front page, and thought it would make an interesting discussion. Thanks. 




 Lol. Much appreciated. Thanks! 




 Not meaningless at all. And it's not false hope, that's what's keeping me going. Thanks for the good wishes! 




 It does but I'm dealing with it as best I can.  




 Yeah. I was on Lexapro for a while, and it worked good for me for a few months before I plateaud. Made another friend drive into oncoming traffic. There's just no real way to know.  




 We've started me out on prozac but I think Avanza is one of the alternatives we discussed if that doesn't pan out.  




 That was the point of the ultimately futile part of that and why I did my second point.  




 psycho to your panda? 




 It's essentially when you have dysthmia mixed with a major depressive disorder.

Dysthymia is the more common thing that most people will get at some point in their lives. It's minor but it can get overwhelming and crippling. When people say they feel trapped and can never feel happy, that's usually recurring Dysthymia.

Double depression takes that and combines it with a major depressive disorder. Which has a quicker onset and greater initial impact. So when you mix the two together, it's like taking on someone else's heavy camping backpack while you're already lugging two armfuls of your own shit up a hill.
 




 quite the opposite. How are you dealing with it? 




 Anytime.  




 Very cool, I'm glad you found someone who's crazy offsets your crazy.  




 It's cliche but it really is like walking down a never ending pitch black tunnel with water up to your shins. It's cold, uncomfortable, and suffocating. It gets to the point where (unless you also have an anxiety disorder) you don't worry about anything because nothing matters, nothings ever going to pull you out of this. No one's been in your tunnel before, sure they've had their own tunnels but yours is different and no one has a map to it, so you just wander. 

It's not that I'm ok with it, I've just lived so long with it it's a part of me and I had to develop the sense of humor to not open a couple veins in a bathtub lest things get so damn dark. 

Thanks for the question! Let me know if I can help anymore.  




 I appreciate that but it's not always that simple. The way our brains work sometimes it's not something that we can work around with a well timed fuck it. Sometimes it's something baser and chemical.  




 Or my insanity drop to the point where I no longer perceive it and so therefore become paranoid that it's so overwhelmed me I can't know which drives me insane again.  
It's a vicious circle,
Just goes round and round.  




 I want to feel better, not nothing.  




 I will look it up. Thanks! 




 Joking aside, making someone else laugh is the biggest high I've ever gotten.  




 To crush my enemies, see them driven before me, and hear the lamentations of the women.  




 All the time. But labeling it as an illness if you feel that way is destructive. People are very helpful and a 2 or a 1 isn't a healthy way to live. You have to live your life how best you see fit and whatever makes you happy is cool by me, but I would look at seeing how you can work at cranking that scale up a bit.  




 Thanks! I'm taking it day by day to work towards that. And I'd love some recipes, thank you. I enjoy cooking when I'm clear headed it's just motivating myself to get up and do it that's the issue.  




 I think that's fairly normal behavior for everyone, though there are others who could probably answer that better. But as I've said throughout this AMA, if you ever feel hopeless or unsure about that stuff, see a professional. One session can work wonders, even if it's just stress getting you down.  




 Oh I laughed my ass off. It's absurd. Don't be sorry.  




 Haven't ever heard of that. Will look it up. Thanks.  




 Right now no, but we'll see where I end up.  




 Yes it does, but it's also nice to have a reminder, Thanks! 




 I have not but am starting to do research into it.  




 Thank you! 




 Came close a couple times actually. How does it feel knowing you're going to miss everything cool and die angry? Never mind, you're way to clueless to be that self aware.  




 I'm sorry to hear that. I was a sick kid a lot and I can't imagine getting to that point.  




 Very True 
























 Lol, I love you too. 




 But it doesn't have to be. I respect if you feel like you're fine with the way things are, I just think there's a way to bring your 5 in tune with everyone else's. But that's all I'll say about it. Just know, if you ever need to talk to someone, I'm available.  




 Yeah, it's very different with the different cultures and how they look on mental illness. 




 Ok, I've dealt with a lot of these comments and remained civil about it, but seriously Fuck You. You think I haven't tried other means? I've exercised, done various forms of meditation, tried to force myself out of it. You've faced loss? So have I. You think I can't think of anything good? Mother fucker I've had plays performed across the country, I have more creativity in my left ring finger than you have in your whole body. If you were able to work through your shit together good for you, but how dare you come down on someone who needs more help than that. Shame on you.  




 Thanks, I appreciate that. 




 Not a problem. Keep me updated and let me know if you ever need somebody to talk to. 




 Absolutely, the pharmaceutical industry is out to get to you. Now go back to watching loose change and let the grown ups talk 




 Sleep paralysis. None of the other stuff. 




 Psychiatrist, insurance covers it, he's been practicing for almost twenty years. 




 Try reading the thread first next time, and nothing about the original post was misleading, that was the diagnosis as presented to me from my psychiatrist. 




 It's funny aint it? And I don't feel like i've been woe is me take pitty at all today, I just wanted to talk to some people and maybe my experiences can help them even just a little, which i think/hope I've done. 




 Dude, we had this conversation almost 24 hours ago, check the post. My diagnosis is  Dysthymia with a secondary presentation of a Major Depressive Disorder. This developed from my original diagnosis of Atypically presenting Depression. I consider it one diagnosis, people argued with me, I am agreeing to disagree on this. So no I've lived with this for around 15 years so I understand it quite well thanks. 




 I was on lexapro, now on prozac. 




 It's a persistant state, emotional peaks tend to come with bi polar disorder. I'm in therapy and taking meds to combat at the moment. 




 Really sorry to hear that man, but just remember suicide is not the way to go ever. Keep an open dialogue with people, we want to listen and help you out. 




 They may but as we've established double depression is new but very real. 




 HEY EVERYBODY, NOT EVERYTHING THIS GUY SAYS FITS THE EXACT DICTIONARY DEFINITION OF WHAT I WAS TAUGHT SO HE'S A PHONY. Really dude? I'm trying to share my experiences and I think maybe I've helped some people. Fuck off. 




 Very well putt 




 It's like six degrees of kevin bacon but less sad 




 That's their opinion. It's pointless to argue with people who won't update their understanding to the modern world. I look at people who take that view on mental illness as the Westboro Church of the medical community. They're just silly and can't be argued with so it's best to ignore them.  




 Sometimes all it takes is the one person 




 Thanks, love you too. 




 Yeah, wasnt crazy about it. Thanks for your thoughts! 




 I certainly had never heard of it before my last session. 




 If I understand correctly yes 




 No, because I'm not suicidal and my doctor as well aware of my previous condition. I wasn't diagnosed with a major disorder, I was diagnosed with an atypically presenting disorder. 




 Thanks, and it does. I'm looking into meditation exercises that might work for me. 




 Mildly? 




 Thanks! 




 Oh no no, didn't mean it like that, there a shit ton of comments, was just giving a heads up that i was doing copy pasta for that answer. No worries, sorry if i offended. 




 Repost from earlier. i was originally diagnosed with Atypically presenting depression

 That's what I was initially diagnosed with a year ago. At the time it was atypical because I could sleep and find some joy in day to day life. Less so now. 




 Excellent point, but I will be researching multiple methods to see if anything fits with me. 




 It's a very tauist way of looking at things, I can definitely see how that could help some people. I personally feel that if the problem is chemical than focus alone won't help, but again, the brain is crazy strange and powerful so I can see how it may work for some people. That's one of the reasons I'm exploring meditation. 




 I hope not, I'm hoping to be able to ween off them after a few years, but everyone is different so i dont know. 




 If that's how you choose to view it, then that's you're choice, I just know what my results have been. 




 I spent a third of the thread saying Meds arent for everyone and find what works for you. I'm done with your bullshit troll 




 And we're pulling for you. Glad I could help and let me know if I can do anything else.  




 The thing is I'm slowly learning there's a lot more to live for and it's not just the fear that stops me anymore. You have a lot to live for and people love you, if you ever feel like taking action, talk to someone. 




 The first treatment actually made me a lot better, but I eventually leveled out and stopped getting better before I was fully 'normal'. I had to stop seeing that counselor for money reasons and didnt want to keep taking pills if i wasnt seeing the person who perscribed them regularly so i weened myself off of them. 




 You too, I hope the government sponsored aliens don't invade your headspace to take you back on the zany ride. 




 Any time. Bookmark this convo if you can and let me know how it goes. And if you ever need someone to talk, I'm always happy to listen 




 It's apparently fairly new terminology. 




 The joke you're looking for is surplus, and no, but it goes into remission. 
























 I'm a rabble rouser. I rouse rabbles.  




 Can you provide some examples? I'm not challenging you this is just the kind of thing I want to talk about, and need to know about. 




 I didn't know where precisely to put this, sorry if it doesn't necessarily belong here.  




 I have been following everything and I mostly agree with you, though I don't think our generation would ever allow a draft, and I only think 1/2 of our current wars are illegal.  









 The only thing you can do is be there for him when he asks, and maintain cautious distance when he doesn't.  The loss of someone that close that suddenly can awaken some dormant things inside of a person. I used to be suicidal so if you ever need advice, message me and I can let you know some signs to watch out for. Stay strong, for you and for him.  




 HEY EVERYONE! OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HAD THIS SAME IDEA SO IT'S NO LONGER FUNNY! JOKES ARE ONLY FUNNY WHEN DONE ONE TIME AND ONE TIME ONLY! I'M DOING YOU ALL A FAVOR HERE BY POINTING OUT THAT THIS GUY IS DOING A JOKE THAT ISN"T COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY ORIGINAL.

Yes I know it's not been done before just once, it's done a lot but who gives a fuck. I still laughed. If you didn't ok, move on with your life and stop being a dick about it.   




 Cops, Nickleback, and (to a certain extent) Religion. 




 See that's funny. I still just can't get into it. I think I'm missing the seinfeld gene.  




 Well I mean if you're gonna be in the greater Jacksonville area in the next few weeks....


Edit: Unintentional Creepiness aside, i definitely understand, and I'm not saying wait for that perfect moment with fireworks and white wine and all that Hollywood nonsense, just best not to rush into anything you'll later regret. I've had some close calls where I damn near broke rule #1, and it would have been bad.  




 I'm 23 and still a virgin, I feel you. It'll happen when it's supposed to though. I know more people who regret their first times because they rushed it instead of waiting. 




 Some moments of brilliance and then some moments of... not at all. 




 I mean I get it. I have friends who are crazy about it and that's cool, just not my thing personally. 




 Getting this second hand because Elder Scrolls isn't really my things, but it comes from a random NPC encounter that the hive mind exploded over. 




 Frankly your careers been disappointing since Hustle and Flow anyway. 




 Tv: Not really any stand out new shows that I've seen, which is somewhat ironic given the thread. 

Games: Uncharted 3, Skyrim, Gears of War 3, Assasins Creed Revelations

Movies: Harry Potter 7.2, The Hangove 2, X-men First Class, Super 8, Captain America, Rise of the PLanet of the apes, Tucker and Dale Vs Evil, Warrior, Moneyball, Red State, 50/50, The Muppets.

That's what I got. God Bless for what you did over there. 

Anybody else? 




 I honestly recommend going back through it as soon as you're done with you're first viewing. You catch so much more the second time through.  




 That Sucks man, sorry. Can't say Skyrim does a lot for me but I know how freaked I'd be if that happens in march and I miss Mass Effect 3 




 Nice, some good things to come. Also the last season.  




 On the second season, having trouble finding time for it but I do love the show. 




 I've spent the majority of the last three weeks blasting my way through How I met your mother, Parks and Recreation, and starting community. I saw an episode or two of these at the beginning but just never really got into them.

So reddit, what are some of the things that you missed out on when they first started?

 Just because we stop putting out milk and cookies, doesn't mean we can't still hope. 




 I still can't make myself do that. I'm 23 btw...

 Think it was a holdover from their parent. Lack of socks? I don't know.

 She is, she's also ocd. Vengeance is had. Frequently. 




 Right until my roomates start playing the fucking jaws music when I'm having my morning still mostly asleep poorivate time.  




 Read a couple of my previous posts, no... not even a little.  




 I said ridiculous.  




 Got that beat with two words, toilet sharks. 




 Upvote for me not having anything to say... 




 Well the 2nd one is true in the literal sense... 




 This one's a big one for me... Still holding on right there with you. 




 Go on... 




 This is just a question out of curiosity/for fun. Please, please, please, I don't care what spiritual beliefs you do or do not subscribe to, please don't attack anyone else. Just a bit of fun.

 When she stabbed me in my shoulder and then made me apologize. That was a pretty good indicator. 





























 Umm... If this isn't something you're comfortable talking about I totally get that, but if you would be, any change we could get the full story? 




 I moved in with my best friend and his girlfriend last June, my first apartment outside of my parents house. It has not been... great. just typed the following in facebook chat: 
[Tue Apr 24 2012 12:15:14 AM] Verbal27: I feel like I'm going to vomit because I just ate most of a box of penne pasta. Why did I do this? Because I wanted spaghetti but I was out and I noticed [McDouche] and [Lady McDouche] had like 9 different boxes of the same three kinds of pasta, that they clearly kept forgetting that they bought already and kept re buying. So i thought of the snide remark [McDouche] would make upon finding some of his pasta consumed "See you got into the pene there, we were uh... actually lookin at maybe using that for dinner tonight." And I thought of the glee I would feel upon pointing out the hypocrisy and falseness of that statement. So I cooked, and I ate, beyond my capacity. In short, I just hate fucked a box of my former best friends pasta with my mouth
[Tue Apr 24 2012 12:21:58 AM] Verbal's friend: ...
[Tue Apr 24 2012 12:22:09 AM] Verbal's friend: Hate is a wonderful thing

Thinking it may be time to find a new living situation. What are some of your best "Weeelp, time to be hittin the ole dusty trail" stories? 




 My first time seeing it. Get over yourself. 




 I guess that's a matter of perspective. I'm by no means a prude about what i watch online, but the mindset of a person who would want to do that is one of the lower forms of filth we have to offer. 




 Is...is... is that a thing? 




 If I may ask, would you mind sharing your story? If not, I understand. 




 To be fair I was 9 pages deep in res and still on posts from today, that's gonna take a while to get through 




 It's not exactly the same concept. I obviously have no intention of ever having anything to do with him again, but I have deeply emotional and personal memories with him that are all tainted now. It's not just something I kind of enjoyed, this was someone who had a profound influence on my life. 




 In High School, my friend, we'll call him A (I don't give a fuck about his anonymity, you'll find out why in a second, but I do want to keep within guidelines) was the one person who was there for me by my side through everything. We met pretty soon after I transferred in my sophomore year, and were best of friends since then. He was like a brother to me and it's a stupid cliche but I would have taken a bullet for him. We had a bit of a falling out after I went to college and weren't as close but I still considered him one of my closest friends and we kept in touch until about midway through senior year. 

Late last year I found out why we fell out of touch, he was arrested on 16 counts of possessing and distributing child porn. He was sentenced last month to four years in jail, much to lenient in my opinion.

Reddit, I just can't reconcile this. He was a brother to me and all of a sudden he's this despicable piece of human filth. I can't stop hating him for this, when people around me are telling me he has a sickness and I should pity him. Have any of you had an experience like this where your image of someone was completely and irrevocably shattered. How did you reconcile the old experiences with the new person? Can you even?

TL;DR High school best friend turns out to be CP loving scumbad, can't figure out how to deal.  




 Makes sense. Thanks! 




 Don't most novelty accounts also have a primary account?  




 Anyone notice rediquette says don't complain about reposts? 




 I have no desire for his death, but kim jong un is a fascist with no leadership qualifications who will lead his country to oblivion. 




 Just playing Devils advocate a little and this probably won't even be read. 
Also full disclosure, I may be biased because I had already pre ordered the special edition.

This is obviously a marketing strategy by ea and its kind of shitty but ea didn't make the game, bioware did. People who have been crafting this story through three games are the one who built these, and I trust that they wouldn't have anything taken out that was story essential, ala exiled prince or kasumi and zaed.

Just my thoughts but I could be very wrong. We'll see in 2 weeks. 
 




 If you don't have any objections, I'm using that for [/r/MercWithAMouth](/r/MercWithAMouth) first one anyone's suggested that i really like 




 Done 




 We can coexist.  




 ...M...Margaret?  




 Went to downvote, double checked username to be safe, switched to upvote.  




 Have an upvote anyway. 




 Same here. See my Depression AMA. Sorry you had to go through that, if you ever need anyone to talk to... 




 But what happened to the noodles? 




 Dave? 




 Hot glue is the devil. Especially in a public school system where science teachers don't know their subject so all of your classes are building shit.  




 Commenting to save the link as I dont have RES at work 









 Witch! Burn Him! 




 How about Kevin Smith? One of the most influential writers of gen x. Grew as a director from film to film ending most recently with his crowning achievement visually, Red State. Created an entire podcasting network while making a movie and touring the country.

Also seems to be a legitimately nice guy who's very passionate about his work and his fans 









 Absolutely. Not arguing that at all.  




 Afghanistan. An organization from that Country did attack us.  




 Gonna work through it, Thanks! 




 Lol. I'm just contrite when contrition is called for.  




 Yes passed, but I'm talking about lack of a veto.  




 Ok this time I legitimately am apologizing, Just had an asshole customer so was pissed off. Didn't need to come at you like that.  




 I can see that definitely, but support of NDAA and probable support of SOPA, which is implied by signing into law, crosses a line in the values that I voted for .  




 Ok, but in that same school can you take some classes in sarcasm too? 




 My two big ones are gay marriage and his tax plan. Allegedly he's gonna be cutting major taxes to the top 1% of earners. Can you talk about that and where he stands in his tax policy? 




 Sorry I didn't meet your standards. Maybe another time. 

Edit: Was it the one where I talked about trying to commit suicide? Cause I'm sorry but that one kills at parties. 




 Romney is one of the one's I'm strongly looking at, I do have some questions about some of his more fundamentalist ideologies but I do like a lot of hist governmental stances.  




 Sorry, I'll be in the corner 




 No prob, just when you have time. Thanks! 




 What are you basing that on? Again, not challenging, what about these guys leads you to believe they are that fundamentally similar to the bushes etc of the past? 
























 Getting really annoying.  




 Not technically TESD but Bryan's guest spots on Smodcast 85 (Side Chair) and 207 (The Bryining) are particularly hysterical. One of the only podcasts I've ever listened to multiple times. 




 No 














 Confirmed fact vs Allegation.  




 Plastics 




 As much as being a judgemental dick was part of yours. 




 BEADS 




 Beads? 




 "I Know Things Now" is one of my favorite songs and with the way they're altering Red and The Wolfs dynamic, I can't see it carrying the same weight going from "I was just raped" to "I just met some dude who was kinda mean."  




 Studio wants Sondheim and the brand recognition.  




 No no, as with most things, needs more wolf penis.  









 "Love love love the books Mr Martin but instead of cutting neds head off maybe joffrey just sends him to his room for a while and he doesn't get any candy or anything like that but maybe we check in on him every once in a while and he's totally on restriction and stuff but that gives us a chance to have him make a comeback later." 









 Took me six years for my second attempt but I was always a bit slow.  




 On the one hand that's awesome because everyone's alive, on the other hand Who the hell let's an 11 year old play GTA?! 




 But you would say in either situation it's more difficult. Just genuinely curious, anecdotally. Like even if a father is well versed in how the female body works are their struggles when dealing with puberty/menstruation, ditto for mothers with sons?  




 I'm working towards being a screen writer and my father, not raised in the most enlightened of atmospheres, has said he thinks I should do a story about the challenges of a same sex couple raising a child of the opposite gender. I didn't think that would be that interesting as I didn't see that there would be that much difference from a regular couple; he thinks issues of sex and puberty would be more difficult to go over without a member of the opposite sex. What are your experiences? Is it that different from your heterosexual friends or is my dad completely off base? 




 Kev, First off thanks for all that you do, the pods and the flicks have been a huge influence on me.
Second, This is a tired ass question but very important to me right now so if you'll allow, I write screenplays with a partner and we're nearing completion on a few we're pretty satisfied with. I know you're all about the get a camera and do it yourself and we would love to but we don't have the money, time, equipment, or talent pool to draw from. If we're going the "old Hollywood route" what's our best bet for getting our stuff out there and maybe getting some representation/work? 




 Surprised I haven't seen this here but Jaws. Chemistry is just perfect.  




 Literally says who it's by right at the top dude. 




 Actually speaking as someone who works in a customer service line, I have no idea how things work at Comcast but everywhere I've ever worked our priority has always been handling customer calls as quickly and thoroughly as possible. If you don't have a monopoly on a certain area of business your goal is customer satisfaction.  




 Don't know where else to post this story so I'll try commiserating with yall. I ordered a year in time portrait for my mother On Dec 2nd from the website www.plowhearth.com/ after a little over a week I emailed, and received a response stating i had to allow 3 weeks, which was not stated anywhere on their site. After another week and a half I called and was routed to the shipping department (bad sign.) The shipping department said they would leave a message with Service and I would receive a callback tomorrow. This process repeated itself three more times up until today, where they said that it had shipped fedex direct and no tracking information was available. So my gift for my mother has yet to arrive with 30 hours to Christmas. Do not order from plow   hearth if you need your order inside of a month apparently. So reddit, what's your story?
 














 Sorry, this is the hundredth time you've seen this today I'm sure but I just want to say I found your depression post about two weeks after I was diagnosed. You were an amazing help in getting me through the early stages and explaining what I was feeling to my family. 

No questions just, you're awesome.

Also I sent you an email like a year and a half ago that I later realized came off super creepy so... sorry about that. 

Keep getting better.  




 I ever so humbly apologize for daring to post a video I happened to miss a year ago. I was working under the foolish assumption that there might be people who exist who missed it or perhaps weren't even members at the time. I beg your forgiveness.  









 I'm not sure if you're trolling or a moron but if you're a moron: It's playing on the joke of Joel being the reluctant parent figure that makes up the first two thirds of the game. [This is to set up the third act reversal in spring where he finally accepts her as his daughter right after her innocence is lost after the near rape](/spoiler) Grunting and gasping is just indicative of the brilliant sound design as when humans have to climb, run, and haul things, they grunt and gasp.

If you're just trolling: Carry on.  




 For the past few years I've pretty much just gotten gaming news and reviews on my news feed from g4. Since they are shutting down, what are some decent review and news sites that I can look into? 




 Posted on your last AMA, hoping you catch it this time. Can you settle an argument between my friend and I? Do you consider the ending of Clerks 2 to be a happy ending, or do Dante and Randle realize that they regret the purchase of the quick stop? 









 We live in Tallahassee FL, and are looking at cutting ties with comcast but do not want to loose internet speed. In terms of customer service and internet speed, how do they compare?

 Then leave. People like you make reddit so much worse than the things you complain about

 How? How is this a problem? Just move the fuck on. It does not effect your life, it takes you ten seconds to realize you've seen it before an move on. I haven't so I laughed.
