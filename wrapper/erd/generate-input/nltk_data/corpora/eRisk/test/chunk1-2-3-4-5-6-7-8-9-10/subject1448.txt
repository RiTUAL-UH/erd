 HUEHEUHEUHEH 









 Same thing here. It used to happen with me last year, i had 2~3 ''visions'' per day, and I got used to it just like you. My ''visions'' were from minor events of the day, not only when someone was about to call me. Nowadays, i think i have 1 ''vision'' per week, don't know why this happened =/ 




 Edited, lol 




 I'll soon turn 18, and i play poker since i was 15. I really want to invest in my poker career, but i don't know where to start.

EDIT: I played in pokerstars since i was 15.

EDIT2: Thanks for all the answers, means a lot to me! 




 Wow!! That's an amazing experience/writing. In my country, the use of hallucinogenic mushrooms is a very discussed (and studied) thing: the presence of trusted people alongside you, during the trip, is very important indeed to the trip travel safer roads.

One question: do you remember the species (and the dosage that you guys used that night) of those shrooms? It is a valuable information, cause the totality of the trip fully depends of those partcular factors.

Again, nice experience, bro. Would have gilded if i had gold jajajajaja. 




 And you've been high for how long in this particular trip? 




 And you did not feel like trying crack again? 




 Wow, and with such an unusual metting, are you guys still together? 




 All types of drugs are accepted. 
























 Good point, but no one in my family smokes... and that one cigarette had some drawings in it (which my friend had done).

It was, with no doubt, the same cigarette. 




 Yea mate, ain't nobody is american :D 




   Well, so I'm on my class waiting for the last bell rang, so we can go home. My friend, just for fun, puts a cigarette (which is very prohibited in my school) in my ear. I immediately take it off my ear and it falls in the ground.
  But the thing is, we looked down so we can hide the cigarette again, but it completely disappeared. We looked for it for what felt like 15 minutes, looked our backpacks, the ground, everywhere. I even went to the bathroom so I could take my clothes off to see if it fell within me: nothing, the cigarette was gone.  We just accepted it and went home.
  This was 3 days ago. Yesterday, I was using my PC when I noticed, on the top of my desk, the same cigarette that fell on the ground and disappeared. I was like: WTF?!? The first thing I've done was to talk with my parents to see if they found it in my clothes: they didn't. I even talked with my brother who, somehow, could have found it: he didn't. The cigarette just TELEPORTED to the top of my desk (which I am always using) 2 days after he fell into the ground of my class and completely disappeared.

Glitch? Probably.

 BEST GAME EVER! 




 Horse mask. This will improve your night like nothing else. 




 Anything 
























 A while ago in my apartment we had a lot of dishes to be washed. So what we did was take a shower while making meals with the remaining clean dishes. After we finished, we cleaned those dishes in the shower bath, so they would not increase the pile, and the cycle continued. 




 A *motherfucking*   horse mask. 




 **The end, from The Doors.**

Those who already listened to this song will know why. 









 Hey man, you are a very talented musician and your videos are **AWESOME**! Do you have a band or any of the sort? 









 We know very little about the universe. I mean, we do know a thing or two but, in scale, the universe is an unknown for us. So, my theory is that: if a **''never-seen-before infinite amount of energy''** strikes Earth in a fraction of second, destroying everything that we know, we all would be dead so fast that none of us would feel it coming. And this can happen at any time! The universe is infinite, so no one can prove that a disaster like this can't happen. It just freaks me out thinking that we could die at **ANY** moment due to a unknown space event of enormous strenght... 









 WOF. 




 That's definitely a disturbing story, I had never read one that involved something changing it's color. 

Nice site though! 
























   I remember reading this ''theory'' in the internet a long ago. It just came into my mind today, then I thought it is worth to share with this subreddit.

 Ok, by first we need to remember one thing: our brain is *old*. But, what does it means old? It means that, after all our evolution as *Homo sapiens*, we still share the same brain *instincts* with our folks of 20.000 years ago. Yes, in our civilized lives of today, they may be even more hidden in our often occupied minds, but the thruth is: we, as a species, act more by instinct than we think.

  An example that shows how we act by instinct is when we feel attracted to a person. The fact that you felt attracted by that woman in the other side of the street isn't just because she is gorgeous. This is your instincts acting man! When you looked at her, your instincts *tell* you that she could be a capable female that will give you healthy offspring, and this healthy children will be able to expand your genes to the world. This is a great mark that shows how we act as *animals*, even in a such civilized world.

  But, not escaping from the topic: what does the instincts that we still share with our 20.000 years old folks has to do with the casual sightings of ghosts? This can be explained by this example:

  Imagine you're a caveman, 20.000 years ago. It is night, and from the deep of the jungle, you rear a *crack*. You move to the entrance of your cave and try to see, in the pitch black, what has done that sound. Now let's imagine that, what made the sound is a tiger, that followed you to your cave, and that failed in a sneak attack. You can't see nothing and you have no idea what is out there. 

  Now, the thing is: your **unconscious** feels that you are in danger and that he needs to do something to avoid this. The unconscious then, *creates* a image in the pitch black, trying to fool you that there is something out there and that you need to RUN. This is the instincts acting, the instinct of *danger*. When our unconscious feels that our body is in danger, he is able to do those certain things. Now just adjust this example for the actual scenario:

  You're home alone and hear a noise. At this point, our unconscious starts detecting that we *might* be in danger. You start feeling uneasy and nervous, this is just a boost to our unconsious to think that we are really in danger. People often say that they saw something moving in the end of a corridor and things of the sort, but this is just our unconscious acting. 

  For a resume, the things that we often resemble as ghosts are just our brain trying to protect us from a possible danger.
  
  Edit: I'll just like to add that: this theory is not for debunking stories and this sort of thing. I love paranormal stories. I just wrote this to try to clear that many casual sightings are caused by this brain activity, and should not be confused with ghosts. 




 So sorry m8, saw thes video, got so excitd, posted on reddit ayyy lmao 




 Ah sheit 









 What's I spy by the way? 




 Shadow of the colossus. If not the best game ever, it is certainly the best PS2 game. Never a game had such artistical meanings behind it, and the scenarios are astonishing. It really needs a movie. 




 When did black people went to school? At it construction. 




 The best way to get over a relationship that didn't worked quite right is being open for new ones. 




 Absolutely.
 




   I live in the 6th floor of an building, and she in the 3rd floor. We have very similar schedules, for this reason I always find myself in the elevator with her. In the short time we are there, we stay in silence, just summarizing in a ''bye'' after the elevator reaches a certain level where one of us has to exit.
  I really need ideas of how to start a conversation with her, related to our building, her apartment or even college...




TL;DR: Ideas for a conversation opener with a girl I only see in a short time in the elevator. 
























 It worked here.. 




 Any Mt. Everest videos? 




 Wow man, really.. I just watched every single link posted in this thread (even the rickroll'd), but I couldn't watch entirely this one. An poor resistless man... 




 I personally can't stand videos where children is harmed or killed. 



























































 Actually I don't use any mods... this is a screenshot of default skyrim. Also, I will check this ''Enchanced Nights'' mod, it might please me :D 




 Just a picture of my Archmage Khajit. After a long and harsh dungeon, I was rewarded with this fantastic view. 









 Fields club! 









 Point me the errors then, i'm not from an english speaking country ;D  







































 Yeah, I've already tried this. When I unsync the albums of my computer with the phone, the problem is not solved... Those damn albums stay there... 




 So everytime I import my images to my computer, these albums (the ones with the dates on its names) appear in my iPhone. I really need to remove them, for they are starting to make huge space in my HD. How do I do it? When I am on those albums in my iPhone, there is no erase button, but I can visualize the images.

iPhone 4s, sorry for bad english  









 For those who love Spirited Away as I do, what is the meaning of this title? What does it mean being spirited away? 




 Really dont know how the arrow got so stuck in my head... It stayed there for a long time lol 




 Then I got an arrow in the skull... 









 Actually no... just the good old default Skyrim 







































 Yes, gotta love khajiits in the Nightingale set... Especially with the tail popping out lol 














 My Gecko Moria figure action.. 









 Hollow?  









 Reminds me so much of Axel, Twisted Metal.. 





























 Hey Adam, it is true that you and Jamie don't get along, but stay together for the sake of the show? 




 Pretty much every Pink Floyd song. 




 Tortuga: Pirates of the New World (?) 




 Ok I'm really not sure, but as the graphics are cartoonish and you had to collect carrots I would say Jazz Jackrabbit. 




 That's the one (: cheers 




 I am really looking for a homemade christmas music video where four kids, from an nortish european country (something like Norway, Sweden) sang in turns. And it's so ridiculous it's funny... 




 I remember that in this game the ninja fight demons, and when you kill one of the bosses you recover a missing body part, making the game slightly different. 









 The buy-in for this tournanent was 1 million dollars. One. Million. Dollars. 




 Coming to steal ya bitch 
























   At first, I would like to say that this is a real story. I am now 17y old, and don't live in that house anymore.

  I was that ''disturbed'' kind of kid, you know? Had many fears, and always had that feeling that at any time, when I close my eyes at night, the monster in my closet would come to get me. Plus, I lived my entire childhood, and part of my adolescence in my parents' house, a pretty big house I would say, located in the countryside of my state. That house was quite... disturbing. Lots of unused rooms, a big courtyard, almost like a forest, and at night, that place would adopt a profound and eerie silence. That house, in my child's mind, haunted me. I suffered a lot from nightmares, the majority of them involved the house itself. Something very deep inside that big old house tortured me psychologically, especially at night. For all those reasons, as a child, I would only sleep if I was completely under the covers. Some events happened in that house by the time I was living there, and this is what I will relate to you.

  As a kid who loved to stay up late, skype with friends and this kind of shit, and then hear footsteps outside my door, and go and see what caused it, finding just an old quiet empty house, turned to be a customary event. The fist time something really eerie happened, I was having dinner with my family (dad, mom and older brother). 

  As usual, I was the first to finish the meal and did not hesitate to go to my room after it. On the way, when I was near a turn, that would lead me to my room, I felt an enormous fear possessing my body when I heard the unmistakable sound of footsteps coming from the room that I would end up entering. I turned pale as I ran out of action, there was no one in the house except my family who were still in the dining room behind me. I waited motionless, with a scream stuck in my throat, steps before the turn that would lead me to that room. I felt a breathe of cold air. The steps were getting closer to the turn. The light of this room I was about to enter was on and I could clearly see a shadow approaching, in short steps. Seeing that shadow, I could not take it anymore and ran to the kitchen, only to find my family with perplexed and confused looks. I sat in a chair, and could not speak; I remember my father asking me what had happened, but I was breathless. All I could say was that there is something in the house. My father and my brother rushed to see if they could find whatever that was, but they couldn't. ''You're imagining things.'' my father said to me, with a hard look. But I know what I saw; After that, I checked all the rooms in the house by myself, only to find nothing. This experience messed me up a bit, but what happened a few years later was what made me conclude that there is something in my parents house who do not want to be disturbed.
____________________________________________________________________________________________

  Fast-forward three years. I was living in an universitary town of my state and not longer with my parents, which I visited on a weekly-based. At this time I had a musical group in my hometown, and whenever we could, on weekends I was there, we gathered in to make some noise and have fun. I was therefore going back to my parents' house after one of those meetings that went late into the night. I was not drunk or in any other state that would delegitimize this story. When entering the house (I had the key), it was nearly 3AM. Everyone was sleeping, and I know that because I always check if I woke up anyone when I come home after those late meetings.
Tired, I put some pajamas and lay on the bed; But sleep would not come. Something was not right that particullarly quiet night. I browsed on reddit for at least 20 minutes, and when I was done doing that, I put off my cell phone and just tried to think about my life, patiently waiting for the sleep to come. 

  A brief explanation of how my parents' house is structured: there is a part of it where you can find the rooms for the children;  I sleep in one room, and my brother in another. Our rooms are very close, almost side by side. My parents have their own room, whis is quite far from ours, and the house continues with a lounge, and lots of other rooms, which I have already spoken that some are abandoned. The event that took place that morning haunts me to this day;

  Lying in bed, still awake, I heard the TANGIBLE sound of something  running very fast, like the sound of feet hitting the ground, at a great speed. It came from the back of the house, towards me. It passed in front of my door, still running, entered my brother's room and got on his bed (remembering that I have found my brother in a deep sleep when I came to check if I woke him). What you feel at this time is difficult to explain. You enter a mixed state of panic and alert; The silence that ensued after that was absolute. At this time, any noise I hear I would shit myself. My mind was divided into entering the my brother's room and face whatever it was entered there, or lie motionless on my bed, pretending to be asleep. The longest 30 seconds of my life just passed, as I am motionless in my bed, trying to reason what the fuck has just done that. In my room, there is a mosquito net on the door, which is used to prevent mosquitoes to enter the room. It was balancing. Proving so that something ran in front of it. Fear had fully possessed my body, then something happened that broke the silence. 

My brother started screaming. I'm not saying startled cries of surprise, but *panic screams*. Right now, confused in my thoughts, I jumped out of my bed and decided to enter his room and face whatever it is. The door was ajar. It was not that way. When I opened it, and take the first step inside his room, I felt something I can't explain. A very bad feeling, kind of a negative vibe was taken the room. It's hard to explain with words what I felt as I entered in there. My brother was lying all wrong in his bed, his legs crossed, head to the side. His two hands were near his mouth, fingers were moving up, flicking his lips in a continuous move. There was nothing else in the room. But that scene marked me forever. I was at least one minute standing there, trying to calm down of the situation that I had recently witnessed. Then, all of suddenly, my brother woke up. He looked at me with a puzzled look and asked what was going on. I said nothing, only that he should go back to sleep. And so he did. I was up til '6AM, so the sun would come and give me the least hope I was safe, and that it was over. I never told anyone about this.

 Today I live in the capital of this state, nearly 600 km from my small hometown. I visit my parents almost once in two months. My brother also do not live there anymore and we see each other very rarely. I have a few other weird stories about that house that I can share up here, but the post is getting too long; hope you'd like. Sorry for the bad english, not my natural language!

Cheers, LS.

 




 If that little dress is from a... idk, dead child, then it would explain why Molly had those ''childish actions'', like following the tractor and shit. Pretty creepy! 









 Just wanted to highlight the [shovel version] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oeb5LdAyLC8) 




 I noticed this when I saw that this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3cucye/an_old_team_at_reddit/ was up to 20000 upvotes, and now it is with roughly 6000 thousand. Why this happen? 




 Doves! 




 That's right, the smaller one (: 




 Why the fuck my dad would stack these birds?! He found this scene in the wild, while he was photograhing other birds. The bigger one (male) is alive, and no one ever said this is an edited scene, it is natural. 




 They are the same species. The reason they look slightly different is that they are male and female. 









 Little background...  my dad is an ornithologist and photographer. Here's a sad picture he took of these two lovers. All credits to him.
