 I do trust me. The worst part is doing something where you have to lay down on your back, always have to try and stretch my dick out discreetly beforehand so it not pointing up like a miniature golf flag pole. 




 Beats as a company suck. I buy the Pill, the speaker gets blown out within 2 weeks of purchase and they will not refund or even replace it and you cannot buy a separate speaker to repair it. Fuck beats and Fuck Dre. 




 Is that like foreplay?? I normally lay on my side and her on her back that way there is access to all needed areas. 




 Right, wtf is this guy talking about. Sherbet is rainbow coloured sugar. 




 I think people are just swapping the could and I. It's either "could I care less?" or "I couldn't care less". I prefer the first one as it's a bit more on your face because it's a question. 




 First time in my life I have seen that written, thanks buddy! 




 But im more of an "in here" kind of person 




 Stupidity is wearing that tomato-based fruit salad as a hat. 




 I know it's true and it has been tested rigorously but fuck me if there is any magic in this world it's in those doors.  




 Nuclear power and Planes are not really safer. The consequences of either of those two failing are pretty much always fatal and catastrophic and could easily end the lives of hundreds of innocent people in a second. 




 Run into a wall as fast as you can, which ever way you land is how your sleeping for the night.  




 Do the ones form my mum count?? 




 I like the way you think, gonna have to give that try.

"I don't know, am I?"


 




 The clothes hamper in my bathroom is perfect height and size to place your laptop on whilst sitting on the pooper. I've watched so many youtube videos on there, good times.

 I'd like to turn you into a sexual innuendo. 




 When I work out it does it's thing and shrink but unfortunately my balls decide to join it and contract too which in turn give my penis a base for it to rest on so it pretty much lays horizontally on top of my balls making me look like a have a micro penis erection.  




 Don't worry, you're not alone buddy.

 I was wondering if you guys know of any template that exists for a 24 person/team league   knockout table for excel, something along the lines of Champions League if you know what I mean. I don't really know how to explain it any better all I want is an empty template I can fill out but all the ones online already come pre-filled with teams etc. Any help you can give will be greatly appreciated by my friends and I who really want to get this little league started this weekend. Thanks!! 




 ..we still fall for click bait titles? 














 The counter has been going further down than usual lately so I decided to bravely unlock the button. As soon as I clicked the unlock the timer jumped from 51 back to 60 and I subsequently got a huge sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. It was only for a split second, but damn what a long split second that was until I realised the button was still blue.


I just need a cyber hug from a fellow grey right now.

Shortage

 nbsp;

[By Jimmy Carr] 


































 Please help as I am currently phone-less, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/31wjai/i_require_some_assistance_installing_lollipop_on/) is a link to the original post explaining the details.


My current situation is pretty much the same as my last update on that post.


Please reddit, pull through for me I need you!! 




 SO I decided to try my hands at installing the ROM myself with a lot of help from the internet but unfortunately I have come up short.

 nbsp;

These were the steps I followed:


-Root the phone


-install custom recovery system


-install ROM + GApps + SuperSu + Camera Fix

 nbsp;

At the moment I believe I have successfully rooted my phone using Odin and the CF auto root file.


The next step was to install a custom recovery system. Which according to Odin was installed successfully.


Now I have to get my phone into custom recovery mode to install the ROM and other files but this is where the problem lays. Everytime I attempt to get into recovery mode it skips it and goes to download mode instead. 


I've been nearly an hour now trying to get into recovery mode with no success. Please help!!! 

 nbsp;

**Update 1**: Ok so I flashed a new recovery system and I am now using Clockworkmod. I wipe all the caches etc and then go to install the ROM, it installs in seconds [which isn't very promising] and then gets stuck on a black screen with slightly animated piece of text saying "android" and then nothing happens. 


My phone is a Samsung Galaxy s3 Neo i9300i. I've tried various ROMs now, does anybody have experience installing a version that works on this model if so could you provide a link?? 


Also I technically have no phone at the moment so if I could get some answers that would be great!!

 









 I've been told of an app that can warn me about the button running down?? I still have my click and I don't want to use it until it's really necessary. 




 Just kidding, but hear me out. Can someone with the knowledge actually make one to alert us when the button drops below 30 seconds. I want to sleep but I don't want to miss this so something like a siren would be nice [I'm a deep sleeper]. I shall reward you with a thank you. 




 Do not unlock the button until it has reached 30 seconds. This way you can avoid temptation a bit and we can double the current button lifespan!!! 




 I can't help bit feel this is some elaborate april fools joke that OP is hoping lasts all the way to next year...or am.i just being sinical?? 









 My button wont load and I still have my press...what the hell reddit!! 


































 So I've been passing this idea around in my head for a bit and come to the decision to just ask you guys what you think.


My plan is to rent out an entire resort for a weekend of Shreddit madness. There is a Resort on Utah which for $100 each we can rent out the entirety of the slopes for 2 days.


Is this something you guys would like to be a part of??


Lemme know in the comments and I will get the ball rolling. 



















 A little bit of background.

 nbsp;

Last year was my first time ever seeing snow at 23 years of age. I tried snowboarding for the first time and fell in love. fast forward one year and I've bought all my own gear and started adding tricks to my book.

 nbsp;

So far I have managed 180's on flats and jumps, various grabs, buttering, nose press 180 [buttering trick] and tripod [also buttering trick].

 nbsp;

[Here](http://imgur.com/AT4uUv1) is my first every mid-air photo. Hope you guys like!

 nbsp;

Also to anyone just starting out. If I can pull it off with my wonky knees, so can you!!

 ELI5 - The mirror Johnny, the mirror.. 
























 so this happens to me pretty much every time I do arms. The inside part of my elbow tenses up to the point where I cannot stretch it out straight. 


Is this normal?


Is my technique wrong?


Or am I over doing it with the weight? 









 So I finally got bored of my Xbone [until halo 5 releases] so for the meantime I thought I would get myself a Wii U.


Here are the things I'm getting: Wii U Mario Kart 8 Bundle, Smash Bros, Wii U Pro Controller and a Wii Mote.


Is there something I'm missing or am I good with that? Any other games or accessories you guys would recommend??




edit: Thanks guys for all the suggestions!!


Heres my final verdict: 



Battery pack sounded like a good idea but I have a mains outlet right by my sofa so its not a real necessity. 



Deffo going for the screen protector [better safe than sorry]



Mario 3d world seems like a must



Bayonetta 2 and some other games mentioned eg Monster Hunter etc sound like fun but the reason I'm buying the Wii U is more for local multiplayer so I'm going to give those a skip, for now.



Gonna try out that virtual Console thing



I'm sticking with my current controller set-up, only because this way I will have one of each type.



 














 Ok im going to try make this short and to the point.


I've been having interrupted wifi connection problems for a while. Today I decided to uninstall the wifi network adapter in hopes than reinstalling it would solve my issues.


Unfortunately I now cannot reinstall it as I have realised I had no idea what I was doing


When I go to: control panel - networks and Internet - network connections. The only 2 options available are ethernet and bluetooth but no wifi. 


I have tried to the best if my novice ablilty to try and setup a new connection but I cannot figure this one out.


Could some one please help me?? I will provide more info on request. 




 I fucked up bad.I uninstalled my wifi adapter in hopes that reinstalling it would solve my interrupted connection issues and now I cannot reinstal it. 


On the network connections page there is now only the bluetoith connection and ethernet. Ive tried to the best of my ability to set up a Wifi but I cannot crack it.


I then located the broadcom folder and found the driver installer but it will not run. After the first step it message appears saying "wizard was unable to find any drivers for this machine". 


If you think you may know how to fix this please comment and I will provide you with more details. 




 Hi Guys,

Im wanting to set up game sharing with a good friend of mine and I just want to make sure I have all the correct info before we start the set up.



We both want to have each others games on each of our consoles. So my guess is we would have to put his account on mine and set it up as my home xbox and then do the same on his xbox but with my account.


Is this correct?? I  know it sounds like a stupid straight forward process but I just want to be 100% sure that this is the correct way to do it.  




 Looking for boarders to shred with this season. Im from Gibraltar myself and already have a small group but would love for it to expand to the point where we could organise a coach full of boarders to go up for a weekend.  




 It's fair to say I am a complete noob to this but I don't want that from stopping me as being able to create my own game is something that I have always wanted to do. I'm trying to create a 2D sidescroller and want to place a Wooden platform that when the player touches moves a certain amount forward.


I started with:


When: Trigger Zone / Player  Do: Move/ Me/ Backandforth/ #20


But unfortunately it doesn't work. Where am I going wrong??


Thanks in Advance!



 




 ..I asked the receptionist what appointments were available


She said "2:30"


I replied "thats why I'm calling." 
























 Reddit is a community full of weird and wonderful people, unicorns and others, and i'm guessing many of you out there have weird and wonderful Christmas Traditions.

My tradition is watching Nightmare Before Christmas on Christmas Eve.

What have you got reddit??

Edit: MERRY CHRISTMAS!!

 



















 ..and today we all receive this amazingly worded e-mail from one of our work colleagues. It had me in stitches, hope you enjoy!!

"On visiting Jason's cake this morning  to help myself to a piece, I was  aghast though probably not surprised that one of our number had  helped themselves to all of the pieces of Flake that were, as of yesterday, generously decorating the top of it. 

I was left with a sadness not only at the loss of the flake but on consideration,  that one of my erstwhile colleagues could have done such a thing 

On further reflection I think perhaps we should dedicate one of our CPD sessions to Professional ethics with a particular emphasis on birthday cakes


Regards

Kim" 




 ..Staring aimlessly at reddit and clicking every link on the page as one does on a Friday when there is not much work to do when all of a sudden I catch myself staring at a pair of immaculate busty titties. You are probably thinking to yourself "and how is that a fuck up? you've just seen titties"...well unfortunately for me the only woman who works in the office (who also happens to be my manager) was standing within eye shot (trying out a new phrase there). Needless to say she wasn't amused, I have to go see her at the end of the day. Not the best way to start off your weekend :(

TDLR; got caught looking at NSFW posts at work by manager who is the only woman in the office...i think I'm screwed


these are the titties in question, please do not open at work...learn from my mistake!!..


update: link got removed due to violations
update: I thank America for inventing the 3 strike system. I still have a job but a strike against me and a manager who thinks im a perv...got off lightly tbh :)
 














 This is not really a new topic or something I have discovered, we all know about this and how it's getting progressively worse. More and more game developers jump on this money making bandwagon and we "the consumer" are left with a bigger hole in our wallet with each new game release. In most cases we end up paying for the game twice in order to have the complete version. I am just getting sick of it and it is starting to put me off gaming. I know a lot of people will tell me "well you moron just don't buy the Season Pass. You don't need it to play the game". I know i do not need it, but i want to enjoy every aspect that the game has to offer, which is something i do on all of my games. I do not like leaving a collectible uncollected, a map not being fully explored, a power not gained I want to see the whole game, the game i paid for when i went to the shops and bought it. Being a gamer is just getting increasingly more expensive with every year that passes and tbh i do not know how much longer many people, including myself, will be able to fund this hobby. 

Do you feel the same? Do you differ? Any ideas of what we as a gaming community can do to raise this point with game developers? C'mon Reddit lets pull together on this one! 




 ...and has just set off on his first tour. Whilst travelling across the Atlantic just hours after setting off, he starts to panic at the thought of what were to happen if the ship were to sink. Walking around the ship with a worried look on his face he passes by a captain. The captain can see that the new recruit is worried and asks;

Captain: What is wrong recruit?

The Private looks at him and asks:

Gay Private: What happens if the ship sinks??

The Captain smiles and replies

Captain: Not to worry, we would send out a distress call and the US Navy and Coastguard will come to assist us. Now get back to your duties.

The private seems relieved by this answer thanks the captain and continues on with his duties.

The following day they are quite a bit further out to sea and have reached international waters. The private is having lunch when he realizes he cannot see any land in sight, this gets him panicking again. Luckily for him he stumbles upon the same Captain and asks him;

Gay Private: Captain please tell me again what happens if the ship would sink.

Captain: Again? Ok then...well this time seeing as we are in international water we would send out an 
international distress call and the closet vessel to us would come and assist.

The recruit, again happy with the reply from the captain, continues having lunch worry free.

The following day they are finally nearing enemy territory and activity on ship is getting to a high in preparation for entry into the territory. All this hustle and movement on the ship is making the gay private nervous again. He starts searching the ship for the captain so that the captain can reassure him again. 

He finally finds the captain who is extremely busy with preparations and slowly approaches him. 

Gay Private: Captain?

No reply

Gay Private: Captain!? 

He says a little louder, yet no reply.

Gay Private: CAPTAIN!!!!!!

Captain: WHAT!?!?! WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT CANT YOU SEE I AM BUSY??? WE ARE ENTERING ENEMY TERRITORY!!

Gay private: thats what I wanted to ask...

He says hesitantly

Gay private: ...what would happen if we were to sink now?

The Captain, frustrated by this point with everything that is going on around him and the fact that this is the third time he has asked and shouts back at the private

Captain: WELL WE WILL BE FUCKED UP THE ASS WOULDNT WE!!!!!?!?!!?

The Gay private blushes, smiles and replies..

Gay private: I cant wait!!
 




 at work, bored...so feel free to ask me anything about something or other and I shall do my best to reply with a completely unrelated topic.

Edit: Well that was an amazing 15 min. i didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did. the minutes have literally flown by!! thanks for all the support and if you missed me this time round do not worry....i get bored A LOT..

 I know right, assholes. 




 It has to be Ryan Gosling right?? 




 Don't know why you're getting down voted for explaining your situation. I think the same thing, the kinect would be soooo much better if at least the voice controls were integrated onto the headset. 




 exactly this, The Xbox and Wii u controller are ergonomic. They have evolved for modern game where you are using the analogue constantly. Play station for some reason refuse to change their layout and for that reason I haven't owned one since the PS2. 




 I'm in the same exact boat as you are, Ahoy fellow sailor!! 




 Ha things just keep getting better, got EA access just two days ago. 




 ~~Hotwired is fun?? what?? That is the most retarded game mode I have seen in a while, how can you have a game mode where it is required to drive if the driving physics of the game are complete and utter shit on stick. Hiest I would've understood, but Hotwired?? You know nothing. Rant over.~~ Hotwired is fun. Sorry for having a strong opinion.. 




 Awesome, I just got EA access two days ago. 




 I had to close the window after a handful of loops or I would've lost a lot of time. 




 Right!! Your only pant button is just exposed to the world. 




 I just tried it, first result: is Mayweather mexican? 




 If the windshield flies off that means the car is dead.

 gracias!! 




 removed?? any one up to giving us late guys a TDLR?? 




 ahhh the good ol'pinch'n'roll. It's pretty much primal instinct. 




 Is there an article on this story?? 




 "HA! remember that time I put your dick in my mouth and gave you a BJ. I got you soo good man!!" 




 Here's my version of [slutty brownies](http://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=900515035) NSFW 




 YES PLEASE!! You have no idea how much I need the help atm. I'm in the middle of fighting Tahir, I managed to take half his half away before some henchmen came out and killed me. Now I just keep dying cause my weapon is ineffective and I have nothing to repair it with and to top it off Tahir's health has now gone all the way back up from dying so much. I reallyyyyyyyy need a hand, was even contemplating on leaving the Hard campaign and going back to the normal one. My GT is kiwi1990. 




 OK just so you don't miss anything else out, So far we have the salute, the swastika and the first person to the left of the middle of the swastika is black. how'd you like dem apples. 




 Who's the Jesus fellow?


But in all seriousness though IMO modding isn't really gaming and that is why I don't believe it belongs here. Modders could create a sub and have a modding community on Reddit to help each other with mods and show off their work instead of this current circle jerk (that rhyme was free, then next one I'm charging). Also to replay to the actual point you made the answer is simple, the game was new back then...1 and half years ago.

 I guess they could, hadn't thought about it like that. 




 Yeah you're right, thats clears up fuck all. 




 I think you've misunderstood. We are talking about EA access not local shops. 




 When you left things took a turn for the worse. Mother didn't look at dad the same way for not being able to find you, their marriage got rocky quickly. She started having an affair with our neighbour Mr.Bonobo and sadly contracted AID's. She tried to hide it from dad but he found out eventually like he always does. When dad found out he couldn't take it and he left us a note telling us he is going to take a long walk...into the enchanted lake in hope he could join his lost son once more. I told mum that dad had moved out of town to spare her because her AIDs had gotten really bad and this would've just pushed her over the edge. Unfortunately she lost her battle soon after and I was left all alone at the age of 9. No food, or money I did what I had to do to survive, I sold my colours to any one who would take them, how I miss them. They were the only thing keeping me going but survival was more important than living at that point in my life so they had to go. a few years of begging on the streets later I finally landed my first real job in a McKFC, the pay wasn't great but I finally had warm food daily. Slowly but surely I made my way up the ladder and I am now based in the Headquaters on a farm in Kentucky. I have a wife and 2 kids of my own now and I'm finally in place where I fell good about my life. Until you showed yourself all these years later and reminded me of the past suffering you caused you selfish son of a bitch. I'll be seeing you soon....very soon. 




 "Pitbull", killed me. 




 But, but it's white.. 




 I wonder if they will be luxurious beheading's. Like a soft silk pillow to lay your head on for one last time and another one for your knees so they don't get scraped whilst your head is being chopped off.  




 would be cool if the kept building it from the inside then one day just reveal the whole thing like a magnificent butterfly. 




 But you can see people in online fall and get hit and run over in ragdoll why wouldn't allowing the same effect to be done manually not work?? I honestly don't know the answer and I'm quite curios know. 




 Strangely enough though I really want to "catch" them all.......^p^o^k^e^m^o^n
 




 No, if you keep flipping the car you should ride a bike, psht. 




 Well I just bought my years subscription and I'm leaving that baby on auto-renew. 20 a year for a vault soon to be full of games? Don't mind if I do. 




 Dude I live in Gibraltar, one of the smallest most unknown countries on the planet. If I can get it I'm sure you can too.  




 Why are you commenting on everything with "cunt"?? Are you butt hurt today?? 




 They already do this on big farms, guided by GPS. 




 I'm on xbone =( thanks anyway dude! 




 It can't be, is that really you?? Mother told me you got lost that day we went to the enchanted lake by marshmallow forest. I searched for years but all I was ever able to find was a piece of bacon where we last frolicked together. Please come home brother! 




 Yup, he just went R Kelly on that poor thing. 




 I'm tempted not to get the game as a Fuck You to EA but we all know that's not going to happen, I'm weak =( 




 This is currently happening to me in DYing Light. None of my friends game like they used too and I'm left alone playing on hard because I don't like playing with strangers. 




 I'm glad, this sub was getting out of hand with all these stupid mod gifs. 




 Not only that it's become a GTA V Mod gifworld and I am sick of it. We should really have a separate sub for PC gamers to jerk off to their mods in private. 




 it's not a feature online, just like animals and ragdoll and many other features. Honestly I don;t know why they would take it out. 




 Yeah I learned this yesterday, they really do save lives. 




 There were some cars you could swing side to side like a turtle trying to right itself and eventually get it right side up before the flames started. 




 I personally don't like it. It defeats the need to land properly. One of the better "oh Fuck" moments in recent GTA's was the fact that if you flipped your car over during a chase you had to escape and find another car ASAP or have a stand off. 




 Yea but the could shear some wiring which in turn causes a spark, you never know. 




 All she did was have an operation and eat less. not much of a struggle in my opinion. 




 **RKO OUT OF NO WHERE** 




 [Sooooo many questions](http://kobitos.com/en/kobitos/15.html). 




 ....nice try. 




 I mean like [really](http://imgur.com/5GXudek). 




 "Awesome" 




 OOOhhhh fair enough and wow, I'm getting downvoted because I didn't know a racist swear word. Stay Awesome Reddit. 




 I got it for free, but then again im on the other side fo the world so I was up till 5L30 in the morning to watch that..^n^e^v^e^r ^a^g^a^i^n 




 I actually don't, im guessing it's a swear word somewhere but I've never heard it before. I was basing it Southpark. 




 *swoooshhhhh* 




 No not at all If you read my first comment I said it stupid the way they react. What I'm saying is to not be surprised when they react because at the end of the day to them it seems like a provocation.  




 Wait....what?? Thanks!! 




 Woah dude, niceee. 




 That guy's a douche. 




 Fine but Christians do not mind, Muslims do so why provoke? What point is trying to be made? that you can do what you like without consequence? That's not how the world works. I see it just as disrespectful as calling a black man N.... 




 Im not American or Muslim so I have a pretty good outside perspective and yes it does look like bullying, teasing, provoking whatever you want to call it except Freedom of Speech because that's just the excuse being used to hold these types of events. 




 When there's something strange in the neighbourhood, who you gonna call? 




 Why, you trying to hide something?? 




 I'm not religious and I do think the way they react to this kind of shit is pretty stupid **but** to me this just feels like bullying. You know they don't like their prophet being drawn etc then why do it?? Freedom of speech?? No, it's just and excuse to piss them off and feel "rebellious". Then when they react, as they always do, you guys seem surprised. I'm not saying do not do it out of fear, I'm saying do not do it out of respect. Stop poking the wounded dog because it will bite.  




 "I'm a Shirt" 




 It is crazy how saying sentences backwards creates backwards sentences saying, how crazy is it?...I'll go now. 




 That's the plan, if I had one, I'm too lazy 




 Watchdogs I can't say much about but IMO Ryse was a "preview game" to show what the new console could do, it has little to no story and or things to do and AC has basically been the same for the past 8 years now. 




 You know why this **REALLY** pisses me off. Online I have my character in a suit and raccoon mask, I want him to be named "The Coon" and for some fucking reason it's banned. dafuq. 




 ...but why?? 




 I never finished this game, got stuck in the garage with that big monster with that antenna with an eye poking out of its head. Fuck that guy. 




 And I'm here at work looking at it muted =( [also, commenting to remind myself later] 




 I don't want to go down that river. 




 I would make a simple game app and probably make a lot of money if it went viral and provide me with the life I desire not having to worry about money and live each day with no worries, but I'm too lazy. 




 Then OP should make his roommate fork out the cash, simple as. 




 One of my favourite MK's to date, definitely should buy. 




 DLC killed achievement hunting, not that I used to do it much but yeah that happened. 




 You're all wrong. They're call Points and Plasters. 




 You spend hours daily playing AC Unity?? I guess everyone has their favourite games but AC Unity?? **REALLY!?** 




 Meh, once I found out this was going to be AR and not VR I lost all interest. Don't get me wrong it's an amazing piece of technology but let's stop fooling ourselves into thinking this is made for gaming, because it's not. Gaming is one of the last things this thing will be used for and it's a real shame they didn't focus on VR instead. Imagine playing GTA V or Dying Light with VR. As the article says it one of the games it is focused on is Minecraft, a game played by kids who obviously don't have money to buy this thing. I don't know it just feels like they are telling us what we need instead of providing us with what we want. 




 Welcome buddy, add me if you need to some people to play with!

GT:  kiwi1990 




 You wouldn't download a car. 




 Loved this film, was a really pleasant surprise. 




 No one asked you. 




 These onions are really getting to me.. 




 oh the parking garage, I dropped all my melee weapons except my fav two and picked up all the guns I could carry. I ended up with over 20k in cash but as always I'm holding onto it for the "right time" and I will probably end the game before buying something cool.  




 Yeah, then you alert everything in the near vicinity. Nice Job. 




 I wish I would've done this. I started on hard straight away, worst decision ever. Ended up having to train my guy by running around and killing a few walkers before being able to complete any missions. But then again it does make it a lot more fun in the survival sense having to learn from your mistakes etc. 




 chiminea?? That's just Spanish for chimney. 




 yeah european toilets have their downfall too. 


Also, Urapeeing toilets. Thats is all. 




 Only if your not browsing Reddit. 




 Broadband internet by 2002?? I didn't even have dail-up until 2004 




 I'm imagining him saying "good game". 




 Too spoon man. 




 Just as I expected, gaming is on the back burner for this thing. 




 Wow, can't believe you got to meet Harry Potter!! looks younger than I thought he would be. 




 Are we allowed to say that?? 




 The circle of life. 




 I wanted Manny to win as much as the next guy and yes I agree Mayweather's tactics makes for shit viewing but Manny only has himself to blame. I was screaming at my TV for him to throw a left but unfortunately it didn't seem like he heard me. The few times he did throw a straight left instead of jabbing with the right first he would get Mayweather unprepared. It was frustrating to watch because the match was there for him to win but he lacked aggression and pressure. 




 Exactly, just pay your dollar and hope you're luckier next month. No need to go all CSI on the winners and determine if they are worth 1 of your measly dollars.


Play, Pay and Pray. 




 What, you mean those moments my mind replays like a fail compilation every night before bed?


Yeah those suck.  




 I love seeing things like this happen, made my night!! Thanks for being awesome. 




 They're just waiting for player 1 to get to the multiplayer spot for player 2 to spawn. 




 Banana peels!? Are you trying to kill us all!? 




 Plus tax. 
























 I just listened to that song yesterday for the first time since I was a teenager. Coincidence. 




 I'm still baffled as to how you understand what it says /u/FloydMayweatherJr 




 Came here from the repost, fuck that other guy! 




 **REPOST**. Also he is in front of the Apple Stand in the middle of the pile of boxes. Now try and find Reddit....he's in the petting zoo. 




 Is that Hillary Duff?? Haven't heard anything about her in years! 




 WOW what are the odds!?........oh right its only 365/1.

I'm guessing this was at around the same time he momenterily thought he was starring in an Action Movie. 




 Damn I'm 3 hours too late, I was going to say that. Still better than OP I guess. 




 And know I have a work boner. 




 Thanks man  that was a close one. We're even now. 




 I'm going to murder you all! lol joke. Once upon a time...


"Never start an essay with I." 




 I wish the would assign jogging to a button instead of the stick, when trying to pick stuff up it gets quite frustrating when you push the analogue a tad too much and your guy just jolts forward. Other than that I turned the camera sensitivity up so I can turn faster.

 True 0 gravity. 




 I hope you mean Rest In Poo. Only place people like that deserve to rest. 




 DON'T GO TO VACATION TO BRAZIL!! ...I saved your life, now you owe me yours.

 This is the worst ELI5 response ever. What 5 year old child is going to read and understand that?? 




 I could afford to move out of my parents house and buy a decent car. Essentially it could kick-start my life. 




 Exactly this, she just seems like the typical "weak in character" teenager who can't or doesn't know how to say no. Fuck that bitch, get a real woman. 




 Probably profit but tbh it prefer it that way. It's **your** pokemon game. 




 Main reason, there are better games you could be wasting your time with. Other reasons also revolve around me hating the lie that was Destiny. 




 It's nearing 6 o'clock where I am, Monday has had it's toll on me. 




 Why waste the HDD space? 




 Yeah, because this guys reeks of extensive medical knowledge.. 




 OP's Mom. 




 Poor snake is enjoying a post meal swim after gobbling on what looks like an alligator and gets grabbed by the tail by these stupid red-necks. The snake probably threw its food up after this and lost a meal whilst an alligator lost it's life for nothing. Well done you hill billy fucks, well done.. 




 So is OP a bundle of ~~dicks~~ sticks or are we just teasing? I need to know whether or not I should start sharpening my pitchfork. 









 I friend of mine unfortunately lost his life last week. One fo the first thoughts that came to mind was; 

 nbsp;

His life may have ended but his story has just been written.  




 Love your art, hate your subject. Sorry. 




 I'm slightly disappointed that it wasn't home made toilet paper. 




 ~~Seriously, who writes these online articles? They aren't that long so a proof read must be quite easy to do yet this kind of shit always happens.~~

~~**Guy** is being praised as a hero.~~

~~"I'm overwhelmed," **she** said. "I'm just a pizza deliverer, that's all."~~


I just realised her name is Guy, my bad Reddit. Carry on, nothing to see here. 




 how tall are they on average? How many bananas?? 




 **CHEESY POOFS** 




 Nah man this stuff is gold. 




 So what was that pinball game you were looking for?? 




 No you didn't. 




 well...TIL. 




 The same way [this](http://www.sbmania.net/pictures/27b/262.png) happens, it's a cartoon. 




 Same with me and any whisky. Got really drunk, passed out and woke up in hospital. Since that night I can't even smell whiskey without gagging. 




 I've tried over and over again to drink and actually like beer. I'm 24 now and it still tastes like piss in a bottle to me. Don't understand how people can actually enjoy it. 




 II don't know what your talking about, still tastes like piss in a bottle to me and I'm 24 now. 




 Firstly this is more of a lower class computer and secondly the actual opposite is happening. Middle class is not emerging it's disappearing. So yeah this company has little to no knowledge of their target market.  




 Mario Kart?? Go home Dad. 




 You look like a baby Mr.Potato 




 "*Freedom*" 




 This. When something's wrong I go to the hospital, they fix me, I leave. Done deal. 




 Hit me up if you visit Gibraltar!! 




 We do, we only eat a small percent of the animals than we could actually eat.  




 Fucking twat. 




 That both fucking amazing and hilarious, thanks for posting the link! 




 If you watch it a few times it starts to look like she's doing it on purpose and starts getting pretty hilarious. 




 Dang, guess I don't qualify. Story of my life! 




 I was ogling how pretty she was than I had a really creepy thought about how she is probably maggot food by now.  




 This hurts the eyes. I don't know why.


Maybe they were photographed separately and then shopped together?


Because the angles seem off. 




 Amazing!


"**DUDE, YOUR FUCKING ARM!!!**"


"I know man...I lost my tat." *sobs* 




 Nah man, she's too fat for me. 




 Your* These imaginary people are retarded. 




 Not a glitch, a hack. Hopefully he will soon be banned. 




 HOLY MOTH BALLS ON STICK BATMAM!!


My mind had completely forgotten about this game. So much nostalgia, so much good times!!


Edit: and I just bought one, thanks guy!! 




 Don't know why you got downvoted, don't worry I fixed it. I was watching on mute as well and yeah Kevin's face was pretty much a mirror of my feels. 




 I hope she's not. If she is making a living out of this I am done with the world and starting a stream of my own. 




 You glorious person!! Thanks. 




 Nah man, my boner just doesn't fit in the toilet bowl. 




 How do you get a boner inside a toilet bowl?? Do you sit like [this?](http://s-ak.buzzfed.com/static/imagebuzz/web04/2010/3/14/15/how-to-pee-with-an-erection-5075-1268594776-81.jpg) 




 I carefully shave them off, it's a dangerous game though because to get the best results you have to be some what erect and if you manage to cut yourself whilst erect well.... F. thankfully I've managed to escape that horrible fate for now. 


On another note never use a trimmer near your shaft!! I made the horrible mistake once of using a trimmer for my ballsack and I ventured to far up, the guard was on but that was no help. The trimmer caught and sliced a bit of skin under my shaft. I was too ashamed to go to hospital or anything so I put a plaster on it and it eventually closed. That was a really worrying week. 




 I've always wondered, does admiring your own boner make you gay?

 nbsp;

On the one hand you're getting impressed by a dick


~~On~~ with the other hand you're holding that dick 




 He mean's it's in the store, as in you can see it. The game hasn't been released yet though, release date still TBA. 




 although I agree with the notion of letting people do what they wany the whole don't pre order "campaign" on Reddit atm is to try and get people opinions to change, it's not an order but a suggestion. If we keep pre-ordering and companies realise this all they will do is cram amazing trailers and rumours down our throats in order to get all our pre-orders then they really don't have to do much more. They can produce a mediocre game and still make bank. 




 but seriously though, that calf is huge!!!


Edit: Why downvotes?? I may like big calves. I don't, but you don't know. You do now. HOLY FUCK THOSE ARE SOME HUGE CALVES!! 




 I sleep alone in a box, both my wife and dog are dead, these fucking Russians are going to pay. 




 No that's not how you tame a horse in Minecraft. 




 Because imaginary characters can't talk? Or is that not what we're doing here? 




 Would be awesome if it did though, would keep you on top of you game. 




 This has slightly blown my mind, the fact that they've gone through this effort to provide a mini real life Easter egg. The Devs of this game are absolutely amazing, Can't wait for the DLC!! 




 The build up to the finale was pretty intense, the run through the sewers in particular had my heart racing. The climb up to the tower was also pretty good and tbh the QTE wouldn't have bothered me that much **if** it weren't the only bit of fighting in the finale. A nice trap room full of zombies that you had to clear to get to Raiz would've been a lot more entertaining and would've made the final QTE tolerable. I'm not not mad, I'm just slightly disappointed that there wasn't one last final "fuck yea moment" when you finish clearing the room of zombies and stop to admire your work. 




 Anybody have the list of characters in this pic?? 




 I used to work with some who had lazy eyes, I would just swap as to not discriminate. 




 Anyway of getting a list of these people?? it would go along way to dividing the idiots from eh rest of the population. 




 Really? You can sue for some one leaving a note about you? that's seems even more childish than the note that was left in the first place, america is weird man. 




 I know right, there's so many things wrong with this game that I don't even have time to explain why I don't have time to explain. 




 Destiny - like real life, only worse. 




 ps4?? WE GOT A DAYWALKER!!! 




 Dying light has a big open world where you can free run through and smash zombie skulls in. 




 Save your money and most importantly your time, don't bother with this "game". 




 so what happens all the other times? Are they all draws? 




 This guy gets it! 




 I bought it last week at full RRP. One week later and I still don't regret buying the game. 




 [OK!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCvgwsgq6pY) 




 The kid walking away crying to the right is my favourite, he's like "fuck this shit, I'm out!!"


Edit: Or the one that's just realised what's happening and is "noping" the hell outta there pronto. I can't decide! 




 The phantom hand is really unnerving. 




 That Luz Opal is mindblowing, reminded me a bit of the [pillars of creation](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Pillars_of_creation_2014_HST_WFC3-UVIS_full-res_denoised.jpg/982px-Pillars_of_creation_2014_HST_WFC3-UVIS_full-res_denoised.jpg) 









 Plus it's a blatant handball  




 I wish I could see his reaction when playing the video back for the first time. 




 you up for starting a new game on Hard?? I'm looking for someone to see this whole thing through. 









 I'm guessing the dog realised it wouldn't get told off for pooping under the bed, smart dog, and apparently the owner has no nose. 




 The main problem with politics is the language barrier. Big complicated words are used so normal people can't understand wtf is going on. 




 The studs being all uneven is bothering me.

 dumb parents = dumb babies. Maths checks out. 




 I'm just waiting for the "That's my car comment" then waiting for it to be in /r/bestof. 




 Does it work?? If it doesn't I really don't see the point, it would be too much of a tease. 




 Google image search gave me a nice surprise.

 Ohhh so that's why I'm single!!.. 




 Ok but that begs the question, why didn't they build the side walk around it instead of the road? This is just lazyness on top of lazyness. 




 Why was a guy crying in the train station?? I'm a imaging a really drunk guy thinking "oh no she's dead WHY GOD WHYYY!?!?!".

^^NINJA ^^EDIT: ^^PUT ^^THE ^^D ^^IN ^^GOD ^^..... ^^WAIT. 




 Were struck by just how long this went on for and how it touched nearly every part of what FIFA did

 nbsp;

It's like they're actually surprised, people been saying it for years!!!

 




 How though?? I'm on 17 and I've just finished all of Vellens main quests, still have a tonne of side quests, contracts and ? left to do. I'm easily going to hit the early 20's before I make my way to Skellige. Also I haven't played for near as long. I just think you left the game running for a veryyyy long time. 




 Out of curiosity, can't you raise the lower end and make it 39-40?? It may sound stupid but I don't know how it works. 




 It is but at the same time I agree with him/ Although on this occasion, CDR isn't a big developer so they probably didn't have the capacity to optimize it for each console. 




 I had the same issue, got the fake papers to get into Patrons but when I spoke to the guard the dialogue didn't change. I ended up getting the official papers from the Bloody Baron. 




 If I could shout out the sign names for Geralt to actually do them I would be soo happy. 




 [Pretty much self explanatory.](http://i.imgur.com/QYekBuj.jpg)  




 No but sometimes yes. You can play it without a problem but it does reference the history of the series a bit. Do as I did, play a bit and get a feel for what's going on in the current game and then go back and watch some youtube vids or read up a bit on it and you will get the full picture in no time. 




 wouldn't their be a horrible delay? 




 No! To speak on reddit you must either have knowledge of everything or research your question before, or at least that's what iv'e been told on many occasions..assholes. 




 That too. 




 American stars seem to love to come onto British talk shows. I think the fact that it's a lot more 'real' and not as scripted as American shows is a factor but the biggest reason I think is the fact that they drink booze whilst chatting. 




 ...I can't recall and I only got it last October. I need to stop baking. 




 Guess im late to the party, but yes definitely Witcher. Been at it for days and I've barely made a dent in it. Can't wait to go home to chase down that fucking Griffin. 




 just hit the 'proceed to video button' and you're good to go. I don't have the best internet speed and I can still watch without any buffering. 




 I wanna go to China now, see what's it's like to be famous for a bit. 




 [vodlocker link](http://vodlocker.com/2qavggbodkna) 




 Might as well watch The Graham Norton show is was mentioned on. George Clooney, Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, Snoop Dogg and ofc Hugh Laurie were on. Good episode. 




 I think you can't into english.. 




 Ok, I admit when I'm wrong. You can build a PC for the same price as a console. But let's be honest here, who would actually want to play with it? Who would not fork out the extra cash to upgrade a few components? And there lies the problem with PC gaming, it is a never ending hole which you keep chucking your money into. I buy my console once, and for the entirety of that consoles life I will be able to play all the games they release for it, you won't. At some point a game will be released where you need certain amount of RAM or w/e and you will have to buy it on top of the game you are buying it for. I just don't see it worth the time and money just to play with better graphics and mods. 




 360?? Please provide me with a full list of components and prices cause quite frankly I don't believe you. An i7 processor alone sets you back nearly a couple of hundred. 




 If you got a decent PC to start off with, OP doesn't. 




 But Beams fueled by the sun can't melt Steel beams fueled by the sun!


Edit: Half-life 2.5 confirmed. 




 4th Repost on the front page of this in a few days, dafuq Reddit your content is shit lately!!! 




 Or buy a PC which for every new game that comes out you need some new component to run it because you have the wrong graphics card or not enough RAM to run that particular game. If you're looking for an easy and user friendly gaming experience stick to console, that's what they're made for. 




 A PC will set you back a lot more than a console. no matter what anyone says it's just not true that gaming PC is cheaper than a console. Yes you could build a gaming PC on the cheap but you will be on the lower end of performance and will eventually end up buying more and more components to upgrade your PC to handle the next game that comes out. Where as a console will run any game for the reminder of it's life. 




 This is one of the major issues I have with the game. He can take a bitch slap from a full grown Griffin yet can survive more than a 6 foot drop. I just don't get it. Brilliant game otherwise. 




 [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) to video. 




 Boobs. 




 That's weird, I'm from a completely different continent and I thought the right side looked friendlier. 




 2 rekt's one comment. Classy. 




 I know how the internet works. A lot of people don't look at the link right away. Not everyone can be as intelligent as you because you've taken up all the brain powers, share some with us common people please madam.. 




 Well there goes the joke. 









 ....no you didn't. Repost! *grabs pitchfork* 




 Am I too late?? 




 The Government. 




 Repost no.4 in a week. 




 pooposal. 




 Oh. Bulls. Nice 




 Yes I know now. Please read entire comment thread before replying, thanks. 




 Yes I know, it was indeed me who had skipped an entire game. My bad. 




 And that boys and girls is why the chicken ended up flying from a kick into the neighbours yard. 




 You're all wrong because the equation is wrong. Maybe I don't know I got a C in maths. 




 So I can has Cheetah? Awesomeness. 




 Damn it man, just let me die in peace!! 




 *drools* mmmmmm serious hardwareee. 




 Was this interview on film by any chance?? You know for fap material. 




 Fair enough but be honest, a lot of people (including me) didn't know there was one before Redemption so calling it 3 would be a mistake IMO. A lot of people would think they had missed out on a game.
 




 If I could single handedly kill mobile gaming I wouldn't even hesitate to do so. You guys do not understand how much a loathe mobile fucking gaming. The reason being my god damn friends.


Every fucking chance they get they are glued to their fucking screens playing some new and normally retarded game in which all you do is tap or swipe, currently it's MK X. The reason I hate it so much is because it is non-stop, literally any second they have they will be on their phones ignoring every one around them. The worst part is when we are in my house playing xbox, when it's not their turn to play instead of watching the others play and provide some conversation they will bring out their fucking phones to play those stupid fucking games whilst waiting to play another game. It's fucking sickening and I'm really raging against mobile games atm so much that a lot of what I've said doesn't even makes sense. **RAGEEEEEEE** I wish I could punch the creator of candy saga in the face, that bitch/bastard started it all. 




 Fair enough just realised, but if they were to release a sequel I'm guessing it would be a sequel to Redemption since that was the big hit game. The other is pretty much unheard of and will only confuse the buyers. 




 I didn't know you could buy helmets! 




 Why did you skip to 3 if 2 doesn't exist? 




 Ummm, you skipped a entire game. 




 The hair bounce effect adds a lot to the old style of animation, even on Maggies hair when she pops out of the bag. 




 "Your Friends a Dick" 




 Without music she just looks retarded. Hot but retarded. 




 I never heard of Witcher until this game and no I don't think it's necessary to play the game. So far I have understood a lot about what's going on. What I suggest you do is read the little booklet that comes with the game. It gives you some decent backstory. The only problem I've encountered so far is a part of dialogue which I had to recall what I did in certain events in the prior games, I just winged it. 




 I like that though, normally on other games on the harder difficulty enemies just become sponges. Glad they took this route instead. 




 That's because there isn't one in White Orchard It's in Velen, the next town you visit after White Orchard. 




 .....well son of bitch! 




 Dude, side quests!! I did the Eneternal Fire Priest side quest in Velen yesterday and got 200 coins and is was incredibly easy. 




 How though?? every time Roach nears any edge the little bitch gets spooked. 




 The Aard Sign is also pretty useful for big groups of enemy's. 




 4 Hours? try 3 days.. 




 This is exactly the reason I hated english classes. It's always like religion, looking for stuff that isn't there. 




 I hate it how my mum always decides to cut onions **everytime** something sad is shown on the TV. 




 Touche! 




 The one I used to play with my friend was Dynasty Warrior 7, worth a look if you liked the others. 




 I started it on blood and bones but then I realized I'm a bit of a Noob to the Witcher series so I slid that baby down to Story and Sword. Hopefully in a few days once I get chance to sit down and play for more than a couple of hours I will be able to slide that bar back up. 




 Dynasty Warrior Games!!


Edit: Oh right Gamecube, don't know if they did it for that console. 




 If years of soccer moms haven't tarnished the name of GTA I highly doubt the BBC mockumentry will. BBC shows like this actually end up being quite good, take [Come Fly With Me](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Come_Fly_with_Me_%282010_TV_series%29) for example.


Don't get me wrong I'm an avid gamer more so than a TV viewer so I'm still backing Rockstar on this but it does feel like another Redditor said. Rockstar is just doing this so people know they are not invloved. 




 The other cat wasn't even attacking, what a pussy!. 




 The days of bros before hoes are truly behind us. 




 I predict you will have a bad and soggy morning. 




 Its the internet nobody cares about some d bag sitting in his moms basement correcting random peoples spelling and grammar so he or she can feel superior for once.

 nbsp;

It's Reddit, everybody cares about that awesome individual sitting in their parents basement correcting random people's' spelling and grammar so he or she can bask in their superiority. 




 Needs more fire to be Michael Bay approved. 




 I guess Pumba had just arrived at the watering hole. 




 I like to think he just really wanted some cuddles. 




 /u/Konwayz In case you haven't seen this, you were right. 




 Is moments like these that I'm glad I started Redditing. 




 Maybe she shouldn't have the haircut of a 70 year old?? but idk that just may be me. 




 It's nearly the weekend man, cheer up! Also no, the guy had a question so he asked the community for an answer, that's how it works. 




 For me it was dying light, now this. Seems like next-gen is starting to actually kick in now. 




 You can change the control scheme for swimming if you see yourself being in the for quite some time. 




 Wii U, dont over think it and just go for it. That console was made for coach co-op unlike the other consoles which are slowly but surely removing coach co-op all together. 




 Wow dude, on OP's behalf **Fuck You**. You're exactly the type of person the gaming community **doesn't** need. 




 This Gabe guy sounds like a dick, maybe even an asshole but most certainly not a pussy.
 




 I got the game on the release date and I still haven't left White Orchard. Just finished yesterday clearing all the ? marks plus monster nests etc and now I'm finally ready to continue on with the adventure. Amazing game, can't wait to go home today and also long weekend this weekend, the stars have aligned.  




 I do remember that. I also remember how hard it was to catch that bastard but that was part of the story though. I wasn't aware there were a whole bunch of shinies in the game. 




 Well look at you riding pretty on that high Roach. 




 I downloaded a need for speed game form EA access. I drove in total 200 meters, crashed into many walls whilst unwillingly drifting all over the place. I quit and deleted that shit fast. Not sure if driving sims have ruined arcade driving games for me or that game is just complete an utter bullocks. 




 Really?? Those were my favourite and I never realised this. 




 I've been meaning to ask. WTH is Circa?? 




 In GTA V Online My character is always wearing a Raccoon mask so I wanted to name him The Coon. Needless to say it wasn't allowed and it took me about a month to realize why. 




 ohhh I see, or more like I don't see ;) 




 I like to think all people in the future speak like that. 




 I just hope they don't lose the magic of this first season by blasting us with high end sfx. 




 I bet you feeling pretty stupid right about now. 




 NSFW?? I guess, if you work at a children's nursery. 




 He cannot vibrate out. The prison was built for meta humans, he is essentially a meta human. How are people not understanding this?? 




 That scene was fucking heart breaking. 




 First thing that came to mind was"....Dude, just cut your nuts off". Then I contemplated a life without nuts and realised why he killed himself. 




 How about that giant robot foot?? What was that, any ideas?? I'm not well versed in the comics. 




 I actually teared up during that scene. God damn it I'm a man!! 




 His username is Floyd Mayweather Jr. Floyd Mayweather Jr as we all know on reddit can not read. Can't believe no one got it. 




 Next-gen sequel, just to make it clear. 




 OH CRAP I've been duped. I know owe my life to /u/notasinglenamegiven. Well played.. 
























 And I'm just sitting here with a 16MB connection. Asshole. 




 So how is this fallout series?? Any good as the hype?? Never played any of them. 




 And it's about time too! I thought dragons were way bigger. 




 Why don't you call yourself a Glartist? 




 Seriously whats the point?? I really do not get it. The point of digital is not having to go to the shop. If I go to the shop I'll buy the disc since you know it actually gives you something to show for it. 




 You're paying for the internet anyway, a few free loaders won't magically make it more expensive. If so you're doing the internet wrong. 




 I have a bird that lives outside my house. Let's call him a "special bird". He chirps all fucking night long, as soon as the sun goes down this motherfucker opens his beak and does shut it until the sun comes back up. 




 I partied till the end. Yen was not happy, fuck that bitch. 




 If she's good looking, then I completely understand. 




 That guy on the right sure has a huge melon. 




 Okay this makes sense now. As a guy I couldn't imagine the the victims reaching out to the bully. It's normally the other way round for us. 




 Wow what a dick, destroying the family from the inside. Bullying level 9000. 




 You forgot that your clock will start moving backwards. 




 ohhhhhh so that's what I have. I knew I wasn't normal. 




 ..you forgot poop. There's poop sometimes. 




 You are right, now it all makes sense. 




 Woah Woahh, I'm not having that type of language around here. It's called African American Forest Cake..And I'll see what I can do, it's not nigger season but maybe the supermarket will have some. 




 Don't tarnish Jesus's' with OP filth!! 




 ofc there's cake, what's a birthday party without cake!?..I'm guessing it's the same except without cake but we have cake so don't worry. There's no clan though, unless you want to start one. We can call ourselves the crimson duo and stop all the bad guys in our neighbourhood. Although my neighbourhood and your neighbourhood are different neighbourhoods so one of us will have move. Unless we can convince our respected towns to change the names of the street our neighbourhoods are on to Crimson street. Then we can both fight crime in Crimson Street but none of us will have to move. but first lets have that cake...it's a crimson cake. 

 nbsp;

Hope that clears it up for you!
 




 No! I will never feel bad for Roach. She is a **dick**. She has left me stranded countless amount of times. Fucking un-loyal lasagne filler.


Edit: Changed Roach's sex. 




 Aha!! Gotcha now. There was never any clan!! Now you **have** to come to my birthday party!!! **MUAHAHAHAHAAH** ...I'm a genius! 




 All we ask from you is your willingness to help the clan on their ultimate goal for a better tomorrow

Come, join us. We have cake!! 




 My fair guess is that they have moved on to the Witcher 3. This game was awesome but it never felt like something you could play for months on end [IMO ofc]. 




 My pleasure! 


Bonus tip: Also works when your sailing and have monsters hanging off the side of your boat.  




 I hope in the next anchor man he loses his job and needs to take up Ice Hockey commentator as a job. I'd watch that. 




 "ewww you got cooties, gay!!!"  




 Well maybe I was trying to place and underlying message in this meme saying the female of any species is "Roach like". I mean I wasn't...but it could've been. 




 Welcome brother to the crimson clan

 Apmayune fools, pshhttt!! 




 I got a comment on a post I made on /r/gaming because of this post. As a result I ended up coming just in time to save the button and land myself a red flair. You're welcome grey army, I sacrificed myself for you!! 




 This is my first time here in a few weeks. The only reason I came back was because of a random comment on a post I made in /r/gaming which only read but /r/button. 


So I decided to click it and come to have a gander at how things are going. As soon as the page opened it was at around 20secs so I decided to unlock the button just in case. 


Thanks /u/Jafas2000 you glorious bastard! 




 You beautiful glorious bastard. I just got a 0.something click thanks to your reminder. As soon as I clicked the link the clock was at 20 so I decided to unlock the button just in case. I love you man! 




 Still not worse than my fuck up. I killed the blonde bitch, don't even remember her name and because if that you automatically fail a quest near the end of the game. I'm going to have to replay this game ...there goes another few weeks of my life. 




 Shoot them with your crossbow. One hit kill underwater. 




 You're right it does only show the "hold" option but like you said it should be obvious seeing as they are the only two modes of transport in the game. 




 Amazing scene through out. I'm guessing everyone went all the way in this one and got dressed to call the lodge. 




 Really guys?? It says so on the bottom right of your screen whilst playing. I don't want to be a dick here but if that got past by you, you are going to have a hard time playing the game. Detail is key. Happy hunting!! 




 Original pic came from /u/gmaknz [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/386t2v/dammit_roach_look_at_the_camera/) 









 That's an actual character in the game. Vernon Roche. It's a bit weird the used the same name twice. 




 This side-quest is quite funny. My favourite part was waking him up. He gets up with that thousand yard stare and flips you the bird. 




 OP's mom when she rolled over. 




 ....fuck. 




 Love how you really committed to the whole Witcher thing. Had to zoom in to read that text. 




 Smart baby. 




 You misspelled boredom and frustration. 









 looks like it was struck by lightning. 




 First post I've seen about my home town on the front page and it's about inter-species "sexual assault". Nice. 




 I still have all three in my inventory in case of impromptu masquerade ball. 




 That's not what society says. 




 You know a good way to avoid microtransactions?


 **STOP PLAYING THESE RETARDED MOBILE GAMES, THAT IS ALL THEY ARE FOR!** 




 The game was a well built game, incredible gun play, good visuals, nice classes and interesting weapons but the non-existent story was too much to just let it slide. They built this entire amazing universe from scratch and told us little to nothing about it. 




 Yrden is key! I wasn't too fond of it at the beginning and thought is was one of the more useless signs, boy was I wrong. Fought a Cyclops yesterday and Yarden was a life saver. 




 That's amazing work, Kudos!! 




 The Rock of.... 




 Yup, still have this baby and the pirate ship somewhere in storage, good times! 




 However, both the Xbox One and Playstation 4 editions of the game are now behind the PC version of The Witcher 3, which is currently live with Update 1.04.

 nbsp;

I hate when articles have no idea what they're writing about. Yes PC has had one more update than console has, but that's because there was a problem with the PC version that console versions didn't have. 




 I feel you man, I had to go to my [only child] cousins house to play with stuff like this. 




 Pandas, and good riddance. Free loading good for nothings. 




 How did he even manage to pee with a camera on him a friend standing right behind him and a stick up his butt?? I can't pee when there's someone in the same room! 




 www.southpark.cc.com works for me like it always has. Don't know what OP's talking about. 




 "GwG!?"... () ^^^Y^^^^a^^^^^y  ...*clicks*..() 




 I wasn't scared of snakes. Now I think I'm scared of snakes. Thanks. 




 I chose the other path, Baron dies and now I have the sidequest failed. Apparently you can still pick the cards up form somewhere. There's a post near the front about it. 




 I love reading posts like these after getting bombarded for being a console gamer xD 




 I'm here with you buddy! 




 I'm on level 17 at the moment and my next story quest is Skellige. I still haven't gone over though due to the fact that I want to finish all sidequests etc in Velen and Novigrad. My fear is that I'm going to end up way to high level for the actual story missions. Should I continue clearing Velen and Novigrad or should leave them for later and go to Skellige. What do you guys suggest? 




 Yea but you still end up failing that side quest, damn. 




 You're clearly doing something wrong. Where are you storing you controllers? Do you leave them facing up? 




 Doesn't matter if you're black or white. 




 Firstly, welcome back!! now onto the matter at hand.


Games: I don't know what type of games you like but I suggest Witcher 3 [obviously] and Dying light. With those two games you have a solid month of gaming ahead of you. Also Sunset Overdrive if you like the outlandish type of games. EA Access is also a really good idea to get, 20 a year and you have access to all the games in the vault (currently includes FIFA 15, NFL 15, NHL 15, NBA Live 15, BF4, Plants V Zombies and a few others) plus 10% discount on all EA digital purchases.


Accessories:Adapter for headset if your using a third party headset, plug and play kit **and** thumb grip for the analogues (I cannot stress enough how much better this makes the controller).


Happy gaming! 




 **MILF!!**. No but seriously keep up the good work, looking great! 




 Mental picture is now complete and what a glorious sight it is!!


 Full blown bear man in a drunken crying rage in the middle of a probably very echoy train station, wailing like a Wookie "WHY GOD WHY!? TAKE ME INSTEAD!!! *sniff* *sniff* All in a matter of a few seconds.

 I believe the word you're searching for is **REKT!**

 This kid shows promise, but lets not put all our eggs into one basket. 




 [deleted, because I'm a moron sometimes] 




 That's absolute gold, must have been amazing to witness as a bystander. Glad your adventure turned out ok :) 




 Wow. Getting downvoted because of a joke comment, lighten up assholes!!

 nbsp;

Edit: Forgot to answer your question. No I have not read the books, but that has nothing to do with what I said. I'm not arguing the fact that Geralt is an established character with a lot of history. What I'm saying is the way I play with Geralt is different. Am I not allowed to play the way I wish to play? Because I'm pretty sure that this is the reason for the game being multiple choice with many different outcomes, so that the player can play the way he/she desires. 




 If the pay's good the hours are short and I can play a lot of games in between, sign me up!!

 Awesome thanks!


This just goes to prove though that the map needs a bit of tweaking. That's clearly a merchant symbol. Loving the game though! 




 If you could stop popping to the top of the page whilst I'm trying to view the video that would be greeeaaattt. 




 People do want them back. We've just been over this same topic too many times on all the posts about the upcoming Call.of.Titanfall/AW Ops 3. 




 Well yeah but the one's inside city's tend to pay more, I've got stuff multiple items worth 200 crowns (not that I bought for that amount but what it says in the stats) and blacksmiths in villages only offer from 50-80. 




 but that 100% thoughh!! I ended up doing it twice, both on 360 and one. You could say I have a bit of a problem. I'm glad though that this time around the nuclear waste wasn't needed for the 100%. Fuck me that took forever and with no sea life in the last gen it was the dullest hour of gaming I've had in my life, but then again 100%. 




 I do remember Hatorri saying some one was controlling all the base materials he needs for crafting armour. Perhaps I have to complete the sidequest and take this guy out before other blacksmiths show up. That's the only reason, apart from IGN maps being wrong, that I can think of. Still a few levels away from being able to even attempted that quest though. 




 These new mods are really getting out of hand. 




 He's not the only blacksmith in Novigrad that's the thing, there are others that I've used and they appear on this [map](http://www.ign.com/maps/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/velen-novigrad) but for some reason they do not appear on my map. Maybe my game has bugged out a bit?? Not sure what to think tbh. 




 Really?? well that sucks. He isn't even a blacksmith in my game yet he's still making dumplings.  




 There a dwarf and a wife willing to craft really good armour for you if you get the tools for them. Unfortunately I cannot remember where or if he was a master but a little Google search might help. Good luck. 




 Is Gwent really that good?? I just find it way to be a lot of time wasting. There's already enough to do in the game without having to worry about my card collection at the same time. It's just a bit too much for my liking. 




 FTFY: Well


Not the direction I was heading in buddy. Just saying my version of Geralt does things a bit differently to the "real" version. 




 We should all get together and make a company where we make money by browsing Reddit;

 nbsp;

Step 1: get together


Step 2: Give company a kick ass name


Step 3: ???????


Step 4: All the pancakes we can eat aka profit. 




 Geralt really isn't the type of guy to just murder anything that's a monster.


My version of Geralt and you version of Geralt are veryyyy different.

 nbsp;

Edit: To make it clear, I'm not arguing with the real history or Geralt. Thats just not how I play with him. My Geralt cuts the head off anything monster shaped (i.e All the downvoters moms). 




 Team Triss ftw! tricked that hoe bag into staying yesterday. 




 Seriously, we're already looking at the next game?? Come on guys enjoy what was just given to us before looking for your next fix you bunch of crack whores. 




 I don't know if it's just me but a lot of the stuff (i.e merchants, blacksmiths, barbers etc) just do not appear on the map. Only when I'm near them do they appear and as you can imagine it's not very helpful.


Is there a map I have to pick up to update mine or what am I missing?


My map looks too bare especially Novigrad the biggest city in the game has one blacksmith showing in the whole of it, which to top off, is Hattori who is unusable unless you do his sidequest at level 20 something. 




 I'm currently at one level over my story quest but thing is I have a tonne of sidequests etc to do before I move onto this main quest. I see myself having to up the difficulty because it's just gonna get to the point where im one hit killing nearly everything. 




 A chat?? I would get straight fired. Yesterday I spent the entirety of the day browsing Reddit. I think I may have a problem. 




 ..it does. 




 The only thing I hate about Novigrad is the blooming map. For me it doesn't show where any of the merchants, blacksmiths etc are, only when I get near them do they appear then disappear soon after. Apart from that 10/10. 




 All that comes to mind is, fucking cunts. 
























 It's whatever they feel like in any given situation. They're basically covering their asses as much as possible with these "regulations". 




 **PLEASE READ**

 nbsp;

Please don't give this game any more promotion. They are already trying to sell us exclusive DLC which gives paying players an edge in battle with extra weapons and equipment. We as a community have to stop promoting such bullshit practices by developers because if we don't no one will.

 That's gotta be fun at wartime. 




 Man, im glad I'm not that John Doe guy. He's always in all types of pickles. 









 Up the butt finger? 




 That's not a grappling hook. It's more of connectshittogether gun. 




 I don't know how many people I'mg goin to reply to on this thread but it does work.


Source: I plugged in my N64 a few days ago. After 30 mins of inserting the cartridge with nothing happen I blew on it. worked instantly. 




 Now you don't. I hooked up my N64 a few days ago and after about 30 mins of removing and inserting the cartridge I said "fuck it I'm I'm doing this old school" even though I read it was bad for game and console. Guess what, it worked instantly. It's like magic. 




 I got my N64 out a few days ago and was for a while trying to get to work. the only way it worked was after a good blowjob to the game and console. 




 It took me way too long to realise, I'm done for today. 




  ..no reason to praise them for something so small


A small gesture can go a long way, especially in today's money grabbing environment.  




 Their wrestling games were the best ever. These new ones reallyyyyyy suck. 




 Nah man you guys are missing out! The bananas is where it's at! 









 Wait, what? no split screen?? That's kind of killed the hype for me. My favourite part is completing the story with friends. Normally hook up 2 xbox's together so we can have half a screen each. 




 Strange old lady walks up to me and says "I don't like Michael, but don't tell him" then walked off. To this day Michael doesn't know.

 Apparently my boners are really impressive. Nearly every girl I've been with says "wow, big dick" or something of a sort. Happens 80% of the time, 100% of the time but still I don't believe them. Being a dude is complicated sometimes.

 




 Gets them every time! 




 I had a phone-call yesterday where I had to relay a code. One of the letters was F and my mind went blank, the only thing I could think of was Faggot. Thankfully the guy on the other line saved my ass and said "F for foxtrot?". That could've turned into one uncomfortable conversation. 














 I'm curios as to what type of work you do. I'm guessing something to do with stocks etc or?? 




 You make it sound like OP is the cause of all the problems.  




 You forgot to duplicate Crinfrid Reavers Dragon Hunter, good attempt though!


Edit: He is - Northern Realm Archer [5 points] can double attack power with a duplicate. 




 looks to me like the makings of a new death for 1000 ways to die. Why not find a window that's, I don't know, on the ground floor perhaps? 




 Not what you are asking but my most recent and surprising glitch was in Witcher 3. **SPOILERS AHEAD** It's when you are travelling through worlds with Avallach [Ciris elf friend, not sure how to pronounce his name] and come across the world with the deadly gas. If you manage to get down onto the lowest level [there are various ways of doing so] You can explore the world, there's nothing there but you can have a run around the ["titty mountains"](https://account.xbox.com/en-gb/screenshot/cd36820b-eed1-4b83-8067-3c73fe5d6465?gamertag=kiwi1990 scid=de360100-3ae5-4fd5-a7da-9d3d6b481c3d) as I like to call them.

 nbsp;

Also my favourite was in World at War where you could go under the map on that tank map and kill everyone from below whilst guarding the glitch entrance with claymores etc. 









 What button? 




 Yeah turns out I'm really dumb sometimes hence why I deleted the post. Also the diagrams were missing because I had the enhanced versions. Mondays can be roughh! 




 ikr what moron is paying $1000 dollars for 5 lines of code and a fancy skin?? Please let me know cause I have this amazing opportunity for him for the low, low price of $50,000. 




 Don't know why you are getting downvoted, you're on point IMO!

 This is just extremely good work, 10/10 on IMDB

 For me it was an ex. 




 Nope, so far it seems non existent. Still have a few treasure quests to do so who knows! If I remember I'll post an update if I find anything.

 HAHA! HAPPY BIRTHDAY SEOR POOPY PANTS!!  




 ..and most don't have beards! 




 Yeah the main story line in Skellieg was a bit of a let down. I went over on way too high of a level, did a couple of main quests and was already being told to got back to Novigrad. 




 The outcome is not the same. My play went off without a hitch, people applauded and I bowed like a boss.

 P^s^^s^^^s^^^^t, ^^^^^it's ^^^^^a ^^^^^she. ^^^^^I ^^^^^made ^^^^^the ^^^^^same ^^^^^mistake ^^^^^and ^^^^^got ^^^^^crucified. 




 Definitely got the moves like Jagger. 














 Just because something looks like it may be a threat does not give the officer the right to murder a civilian. The police have to completely change their manner of conduct to keep in par with the military style of policing that they seem to love so much. Before a single shot is fired you must confirm that the "enemy" is armed and dangerous. A good way of doing this would be making an officer confirm with his partner before opening fire. Instead of just thinking he's a gun totting bad ass sheriff saving the town. 




 This is my theory. A lot of these cops are pussy's. They are constantly scared and will react to **anything** they think has a slight possibility of endangering their lives. 


"OMG he's turning around, he *might* have a gun!"


Another thing I never understood is why carry real ammunition if your main objective is to arrest a suspect. Rubber bullets will stop a man in his tracks and guess what, they don't kill. 




 If he's not Homeless RCMPolice then who is?  




 I think you meant Cervezaa!! 




 If it were to have the actual PC components built into the keyboard then I would be amazed. This is just stupid. 




 Ayyy lmao. 




 I'm not from the states so I had no idea it was supposed to be a mocking jay, I've always seen a man doing the Hussain Bolt but now that you mention it, yes, it definitely is Johnny. 




 spend less than you make


Is this not common knowledge in America? 




 If you have a decent PC to begin with. 




  I've been a PC gamer for 5 years now, in that time I've gone through 3000 worth of hardware. Why? It's my hobby, I like doing it. Do you need a 3000 PC to play games? No. No you don't.

 nbsp;

And this is exactly what I mean, you will end up wasting more money than if you had bought a console. Yes I know he claims it is his hobby **but** that is exactly what it becomes for everyone and that my friend is where the money goes, you will end up upgrading parts and spending a lot of money.
 




 I agree about the prices for games and subscriptions, they can be a bit outlandish but I'm happy to pay it if it makes gaming a simple and enjoyable experience. Also don't get me wrong either I have nothing against PC gaming, to each his own. What gets me is when people claim PC gaming to be cheaper than console (strictly talking about the rig). I paid 350 for my console and that will last me for the next 5 years or so. I highly doubt you can build a PC for that price which will play all the games that come out in the near future without having to upgrade a few components. I just don't see how it can be cheaper apart from game deals and subscriptions. 




 Buy the time I have to buy my next console you would have spent the same amount on parts on your PC. PC gamers are constantly swapping out parts because the next game they play requires a better graphics card or more RAM etc etc. Don't get me wrong I have nothing against PC gaming, I just don't like it when people argue that it is cheaper than a console because at the end of the day it really isn't. You could future proff your PC at fit in top of the range parts and then yes it would last a very long time without needing an upgrade but for that price (around 1500-2000) you could buy the next 3-4 generations of consoles. 




 I wanted to take my finger off but I just couldn't. 




 Care to explain how this simply is not true? And don't give me a list of cheap parts that barely get the job done. 




 It's gotten to the point where I really don't care any more, nothing is ever going to change. The rich will continue to get richer whilst stealing from the poor. It has been happening for millenniums and it sure as hell is not going to stop now. This is the world we live in. 




 We know it was actual game play, that's why it looks crap. CGi trailer would've been better IMO. 




 So play it with the camera panned out is what you're saying? You cannot defend the graphics in the trailer, they are crap. Only reason you would do so is because you're a fan boy. This would have been any other game and the trailer would've gotten Rekt, but since it's a Bethseda game, let the Reddit circle jerk commence. 




 Reading that has fucked with my eyes. 




 It is, I haven't played a game that took me this long to complete the main story line in very long while. I was obviously doing some fucking around but most of the time I was questing. Just finished the main quests yesterday and I still have a good few days of content left if not more. 




 ...except a huge hole in my wallet where my money used to be. 




 Don't know why these fan boys are down voting you. I've never played Fall Out so I can't say much about the series. But I can comment on the trailer I saw and it was just meh. The visuals are crap to say the least and this is a trailer, which will always looks better than the actual game.  




 Buy a console, problem solved. 




 Buy a console. You'll save money in the long run.

 ...and this is why I don't buy digital, can't trust it. No internet, no game. 




 This and the ability to deselect quests so I don't have to remove it entirely from the HUD. 




 Oh well I ended up just leaving it locked. I'm guessing either the devs forgot **or** it may be a treasure hunt quest and the key is elsewhere. 









 Ok so I'm in the Elven Ruins collecting the Sunstone. I have obviously had a good look around and picked up a tonne of loot. I have opened all chests, except one which of course is locked. I have searched everywhere, been doing so for a good while now but no luck in finding the god damn key.

 nbsp;

It is the chest in the room with the door [The only room with a door in the entire elven ruins] and also had two ghosts protecting it, but none had the key. Does anybody know where this key is?? 




 Not going to uni, I'm 24 now and feel like I will never get that "going away and discovering myself" stage of my life. 




 Any body else read that in a Mexican accent?? 




 ...and to top it off it's a repost. Scum Bag OP. 




 Some one call the facts police cause /u/Lawnsrevenge just got checked! 




 Disney basically paved the way once Walt died. 




 Hey OP I have an idea for the inventory if you would like to add it in. Drop Down lists like used in the Bestiary and Alchemy tabs. They could still keep the same format as now (i.e weapons and armour, usable items etc) but just add subsections (i.e Oils, bombs, potions etc). That's my two cents, nice list hope they see it! 




 might be a bit late but be careful though they might not stay forever. 




 Thanks!, I'll test it with a few misc items and see how it goes. 




 I'm at work now but I'm pretty sure it's that one. The description says something along the lines of "Gerlat found this letter as soon as he arrived in White Orchard and proceeded to read it". You may be right by saying it's bugged because i know for a fact the I have raped White Orchard. There is nothing left to do there except this quest (and I hate leaving quests in my quest tab). 




 It's like asking how many bowls of your favourite cereal you've had in your life. 




 No fucking way, did you record me playing?? I did this exact thing yesterday whilst on this exact quest. 




 I'm with you on this. Now I'm going to be extra vigilant for loading screens just because they promised. 




 does it stay there indefinitely though?? Cause if so I'm going to find myself a nice little abandoned house or cave to use as my stash house. 




 Ok so I have a treasure hunt which you receive in White Orchard. I never read the letter as I was new to the game and had no idea what I was doing. Now I'm nearing the end and have this treasure quest I cannot complete because I must first read a letter I found at the beginning of the game which I sold not knowing it was important and ofc I have no idea who I sold it too. So yea just keep them, they weigh 0.01 so there is not point in getting rid of them. Hopefully the will update the inventory menu and make a separate section for notes   books.

The farm they were on was ***3.2million acres***. My "country" is 2.5 square miles (circa 1600 acres). You can fit my entire country 2000 times into that one single farm.


Australia is fucking massive. 




 Many places in the world. My local police force only carry batons. We do have armed officers at the airport, but that's it. 




 They could just make more.. (I don't want one or anything, just saying) 




 This demonstration is a few years old, just saying. Don't be fooled by the upload date on youtube. 




 I came here to assure myself I wasn't the only one. Thanks! 




 Motherfucker stole my moves! 




 Serioulsy how do you guys take pictures of random people?? I can't bring myself to do it, I feel like an idiot when I do. 




 The day someone actually makes a fully functional one of these things I'll be impressed, till then please don't waste our time and crush our hopes. 




 **NSFW** 




 Those are the ones that are available right now for preview members. More will be added in the very near future once Xbox can strike a deal with developers. Aslong as developers say yes we should be seeing fully capabale backwards compatibility with all games in the very near future. But before any of this happens we need Windows 10 on Xbox. So we're still a few months away. 




 You're looking at the wrong list buddy. The list you're referring to [Rare Replay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_Replay). An Xbox one game which brings 30 classics back to life. 


Backwards compatibility will hopefully allow you to play any 360 game you own, natively on your Xbox one (provided that developers give Xbox their permission to use old games for free on the new system). 




 It made me buy a charger for my long forgotten Ipad. 




 I did them all...don't. Found maybe 1 sword I've kept, all the rest is lying at the bottom of the ocean floor beside the chests. Still it's nice to see you're map completely greyed out. 




 Picture of frisbee please OP. 




 That was better than I expected, they seem to have a really cool bro/sis relationship. 




 Ayyyy! 




 This, but let's make it another school just to be safe. 




 No he means like the French flag. 




 Next stop, The Pitchfork Emporium. CHOO CHOO!  




 I tried getting online yesterday, still not working. 




 That's a really cool way of putting it. I tired my hand at it once with a deck of cards. After a week I was still dropping cards everywhere, that was pretty much all the commitment I could muster.  




 17 hour work days?? *Poor* people. 




 I've read a bit into this before. Answer is as simple as practice makes perfect. In this case it is a tonne of practice, way more than I can even imagine to have the patience for. 
 




 Can I jump on your magical gold train?? 




 [MRW](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/mind_blown.gif) I read that. 









 You're a serial killer too?? What are the chances! We should totally live together. 




 Willikers you're right!...Gosh darn it, can't believe I didn't know that. 




 Do you want to be haunted by a ghost phone?


Cause that's how you get haunted by a ghost phone. 




 I think it's too late for that. 









 I had to get one 2 months after getting the console, it really is worth it. 




 The graphics are gorgeous. Just goes to show you don't need hyper realistic graphics to have a really good looking game. 




 God damn it, Now I'm going to have to stop by McD. I'm hungryy. 




 Fuck that, guests in my house is why I need my own controller. 




 Really? Xbox controllers are always built extremely well. A lot more durable than Sony as the evidence shows. 




 How many times is this joke going to be made?? I think this is the third time I've seen it near the front of /r/gaming. We know Yenns a whore ha, ha. 




 **SOME CONTENT WOULD BE FUCKING AWESOME, THANKS!**


^^^not ^^^all ^^^of ^^^us ^^^where ^^^able ^^^to ^^^watch ^^^E3 




 No exact date yet, it will be in Fall though [gaming season]. My guess is somewhere near the beginning of Fall so you can ready yourself for the plethora of new games which are going to be released. 




 I'm guessing it will be possible once we get the new OS. 




 I can only begin to imagine the barrage of request you must've gotten, good luck and thanks for doing this!! 




 I never made such a claim. 


Found the guy who pulls things out his ass. 




 Yeah, and now we can blame trickle down economics for it. 




 Found the rich stock broker.


Edit: it's a joke, calm down people. 




 I'm so glad I never got into it. Sorry for your wasted time. 




 I bought Monopoly and Risk on Xbox this past weekend. Amazing games to play with some friends. Only down side is no physical dice. If Hasbro could make some sort of mat and dice combination that would be awesome. Anyone want to start a kick-starter with me? 




 Baby girl's a Queen, 


But a Queen is just a pawn with a bunch of fancy moves. 




 My gamer tag is ...



Please don't send me any more friend request haha


What were you expecting? lol. 




 ..and that's when mods become DLC. 




 Sounds like was destiny ~~is trying~~ failed to do.


 




 I came here to poke you guys with the proverbial stick and complain about how such an advanced piece of technology is being used on a build a block game. Then I saw the video, that's actually pretty impressive. Still don't see much use for it with real gaming but yea still pretty fucking awesome. 




 I never like these videos. They claim it's fast but never actually show it being fast. Whenever they are going through the UI they move once every few seconds. That's not how you're going to be using it. They did the same last time. 




 It's been happening for years, won't make a difference. 




 All I can think about is the amount of sick days I'm going to have to take later on this year. 




 This controller looks insane, seriously can't wait to get my hands on one. Great stuff this year! 




 Seriously what the hell do you guys do yo your controllers? I have 4 all working fine including the one that came with the xbox. No drift or anything. Do you perhaps leave them upside down from time to time? 




 They already make a solid controller for 49.99. So by that maths the new controller will be 3 times as solid. 




 On behalf of everyone in this sub: Thank you /u/MajorNelson and the Xbox team for what looks to be like an amazing year of gaming to come. Great stuff! 




 You're willing to give your only inch up?? Brave man. 




 That's amazing news!!


Thanks for the quick reply. 




 Awesome stuff, but what about physical copies?? All of my 360 games are discs. 




 "So where are we going today Snaps?"


"Not sure RC, wherever the current take us"


*banjo rift* 




 Took me a while to realise there were more pictures, it's a very slow sunday. 




 It looks like something straight out of MTV Cribs. 




 mother put the wrong date



You keep telling your sister that. 




 So do I, but with a gif you know you don't need to listen. 




 [MRW opening the album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr8-WiJabBc) 




 Gifs = no sound, so I know I can enjoy it at work. 




 I agree the UI needs changing but that isn't the way to go about it. On console it would take you forever to get to your current gear as each tab take a second or 2 to load.


The best method would be drop down lists like they have on the bestiary, alchemy tabs etc. This way you can select the category you need without having to load everything else up on the way. It will give much easier access to your current equipment as you would only need to flick right once and you can add many categories without it looking like a cluster fuck. 


They were so close, yet so far. They had the idea just didn't implement it where needed.


Any ways that's my 2 cents. 




 Yeah I found out yesterday. As well COD zombies [the only reason I will be buying COD] will only be 2 player split screen. The 2 games I love to play coach co-op on with 4 players have been stripped away from me in one year. Assholes. 




 **LEGO GAMES** enough said! 




 Welp I know what I'm buying next. Love these lego games!  




 I just don't understand this credit thing tbh. Where I live you use what you have in the present, not use what you will have in the future. Credit cards are just weird to me and I don't understand why someone will willingly get a credit card knowing you will end up paying more for your purchases. 




 Why give mods so much gold? Don't the like have it for free anyway? 




 I need one of these for my house....then I need my friends to actually use it. 




 One of my mates fainted


Bravo, bravo. The icing on the cake. Girls screaming and this kids faints.

 Fair enough, can't knock a guy down for hoping! 




 I would save every single time before diving into the water. Even with the Killer Whale potion it can all go horribly wrong extremely quickly. 




 *lowers pitchfork*


I hope you're right.. 




 TBH I hope I'm wrong and you're right. I'm just finding very difficult to trust EA lately. 




 Not the same thing really. That was giving you extra in-game money, this is giving you exclusive weapons that deal more damage. You could make 1,000,000 in GTA in a couple of hours, you will never use these weapons unless you get the pre-order bonus. It will kill the pvp especially since it's at launch, a few players will have better gear form the start because of this bullshit.


 




 The fact that people who pre-order will be getting weapons and equipment that deal extra damage on online matches. That's my problem, unbalanced pvp matches. 




 This is exactly the reason I posted this. I don't mind skins etc as DLC but when you're paying for better weapons it kills the online gaming experience. 














 This is just getting out of hand, and making jokes about it isn't going to help the situation. I'm not from America but it pains me to see that the "leading" country on this planet can't even get it's own police force under control. You're out waging war with half the world when you have fundamental problems in your own country that just get passed by and swept under the rug. Go to the streets get your voices heard, enough is enough. 
























 Chick teacher. 




 Never finished this game, got stuck in the garage with [this](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20141025190101/the-evil-within/images/8/8b/Amalgam_alpha.jpg) mofo 




 Kill it with fire, seriously. 




 A senior student fucked a teacher up the pooper and when he pulled his dick out he swore he had a piece of corn stuck on his dick.


And so it was that Ms.Cornhole was baptised. 




 ooooo 117 days to my cake day! 




 **DING** **DING** **DING** WINNER WINNER, CHICKEN DINNER!! 




 Never that long, by day 4 I would've gotten a couple of matches in at least but not too many. You seem to be severely affected. 




 It lets me open the app and do a "search" but it never finds any videos and there's none on the home page either. Been like that for months! 




 Unlike the women officer, screams in fear when he gets the gun out and whilst she's escorting him outside "do you wanna know what page we're on? Step outside, that's what page we're on".....what? 




 That answers that then. ^^The ^^more ^^you ^^know^^^w^^^^w^^^^^w 




 You go America!!! hopefully Europe will follow soon. **FUCK PROHIBITION!!** 




 **ONLY AVAILABLE IN US AND CANADA** ...what a stupid move. 




 **WHERE IS THE GAME?** I can't find it on the xbox store.. 




 I love cuttlefish but after seeing a documentry on them I fell a bit bad about eating them. They are amazingly intelligent and delicious creatures.

 All i know is I would be soooooooo pissed off if my brother and I got that and I was stuck with the boring top bunk. 




 Sonic has been in the wrong *game* since the sega days. 




 So my youtube app is basically broken. I've uninstalled and re-installed millions of times with nothing to show for it but a broken youtube app.


Anybody else having the same problem?



Any solutions available? 




 Now if only my youtube app worked... 




 Muchas Gracias!! 




 Dude I just realised your username...I live on your cock. 




 I'm event hesitant on pre-ordering that one since the fuck up with MCC, but I really want that statue...decisions!! 




 I'd still prefer the standard black, for $150 I don't want a design I'm going to get tired of. 




 I knew I'd seen it before! 




 Step one: acquire windows 10...



....anddd I failed. 




 I would not pre-order. I'm in the wrong post aren't I? 




 **FTFY** Researchers find **that** flatworms plunge their penises into their own heads to inject themselves with sperm.


 




 He's not saying it doesn't take time and effort to build. He's saying it seems cheap and I agree. It's like bringing a gun to a knife fight, it's so over powered compared to all the other battle bots weaponry. It should be made illegal or like I mentioned further up the thread regulated so the props can only be of a certain length therefore removing these helicopter like monstrosities.  




 How about you regulate the size of shafts on a rotating axis (ie if it's going to be spinning around, it can't be longer than x inches) You would still have spinning robots but not these ridiculous land helicopters of death. 




 You guys keep bringing swords to gun fights. 




 If you play with your friends the Hasbro games are quite fun. Risk, Monopoly and now Scrabble has just been released.
 




 The vault isn't "wow" I agree but there are still some good game to enjoy. What else do you want for $30 measly dollar a year?? You lose more than that in change every year and for that price you're also getting 10% discount on any up coming games, it really is a no brainer if you're a gamer. 




 I get it randomly, sometimes it pisses me off so much I just bash out the campaign but yea I still get it more often than not. TBH I'm done with MCC, hopefully 5 will not be this much of a mess. 




 Any preview members fancy inviting me to the party?? 




 **Only works for the Americas.** Outside of the continent you need a code. 




 Have you guys learned nothing? 




 On a side note, how is the coach co-op on this game?? Are the tiles visible to all players looking at the screen?? 




 Maybe you were just unlocking the achievements and she wasn't (i.e you were doing all the steps required and she was just kinda there?). I don't know how it works just stating a possibility. 




 It's been in our lives for so long that I'm sad to see it go, maybe we should throw it a going away party. ^^^^^^^^/s 




 i would recommend ESO. Destiny imo you need to play with friends to ~~enjoy~~ make it bearable. 




 Of course, people will take anything if it's free. More than 3/4 quarters never played after the first 5 minutes and I didn't even open mine. 




 Apart from Banjo-Kazooie I'm on the same boat. Can't freaking wait!! 




 I'm currently hooked on Risk and Monopoly and definatley going to buy this one but how will this work with coach co-op? Could you let me know before I purchase?

 




 That's awesome, I'm currently hooked on Risk and Monopoly but how will this work with coach co-op? Could someone let me know before I purchase? 




 There are already, gun, clothes and cars. We want something *new*. 




 That **and** the Los Santos Customs money making glitch. You would sell you car, exit to Story mode then quickly go back to online. You would find yourself outside the LSC in your car with the money in your pocket. Rinse and repeat.


Money was really no biggie when the game first came out, I had millions stored away in case of a rainy day. 




 At least you sold it, I just dropped it on the floor in front of him. 




 I'm a tiger, roar.

 I was like that last year, now I'm on Xbox everyday like I used to be. Change it up a bit, play games you wouldn't think of playing. Right now I'm hooked on Guacamelee and Risk believe it or not. Before that it was a couple weeks of witcher 3, you just gotta keep it fresh or take a break. The bug will bite again soon enough. 




 I got one of these calls last week. I pretended to be the Prince of Nigeria, good times.

 Thing is I was used to it. I was an avid Halo 3 player but it has been a veryyyyy long time since I played and I had forgotten it didn't have sprint, threw my game plan off. 




 I'm probably going to get massacred with the downvote blade of death but I've grown not to like Halo 3. The only reason being, no sprinting. I had forgotten that Halo 3 didn't have sprint, ended up dying so many times because instead of running into cover he was casually strolling in. I really don't know how I used to play. 




 I'm not a fan but my friend is. Came to my house yesterday and explained how he screeched like little girl when man bat showed up.

 Black Flag is the only game I think they did right apart from the first 2. For me it is the one that looks most different to the other and therefor gives it a different feel. 


At the beginning of Assassins Creed I was really excited for the series. Imaging every game would be set in a completely different time period and country (i.e Egypt during the reigns of the Pharaohs, China during the Ming Dynasty, England during the Industrial Revolution, America during the Revolution etc etc) but every game from Assassins creed 1-3 felt the same. They took too long to realise the potential of the series.


Also on another note, wtf is up with Abstergo Entertainment?? I hope it really hasn't come to that, I hop I have to take them down in the end (Haven't finished the game yet).

 EA Access is worth the $20 a year. Should give it a look. Also Risk if you like those sort of games to play with friends. Another one is Dying Light, not an exclusive but a reallyyy fun game. 




 Fine, but I'm still not happy about it. 




 Too bad it didn't last. Didn't even get to try it. I'm hoping they had to take it down because CDPR has something in the pipelines but who knows. 




 Awwww mannnnnnnn, I didn't get a chance to try it out. Why has it been taken down? Did CDPR get in touch? Do they have something in the pipeline?? 




 Damn I just paid 18 in the UK. That around $25....I think we need some freedom over here. 




 Fantastic? You just beat the system to a pulp, it's more than Fantastic..It's like Super Fantastic, um yeah that's it. 




 You sir, you are the Real Batman. Muchos thanks! 




 Ok fine it's not the worst one made, yes I was being a touch dramatic but it was just really infuriating because it felt like a step backwards instead of forward. Now though since it wasn't included in the last game they are more likely to not have the option again in this game. Match customization was a big part of the game for my friends and I so I apologise but I fell quite strongly since the WWE games have been a part of my life since forever. 




 I keep seeing this everywhere expect my Xbox Store, argh!!! I want it (but not at full price) can someone link it?

 I check the Xbox site and Batman is still full price, where are you getting these from? 




 I just hope they bring back match customisation, wtf were they thinking. WWE 2k15 = worst Wrestling game ever.

This 2K series has killed the franchise for me. No match customisation in the last game was the last straw.

 Ouch, the knees took a good slamming. 




 I'm no Marine Biologist but my theory is it's fishing. Let's it's tentacles hang like that and if any fish is stupid enough to swim into them he will have hi way with it. But like I said, it's just my theory. 




 It's Monday, it's early. I'm sorry. 




 Thanks! 




 Since we're on the subject on making the sub better and with less cluster could we please **Insert title of game into Post Title!!** Thanks! 




 Can't wait for summer to be over! 




 What's the name of the game please??


Edit: I know, it's in the title. It's Monday morning, give me a break!

 IDK about you but I would lose my appetite if I knew I was going to die too. 




  watching ladies in tight clothing shake it.

That's what push your over the edge isn't it??

#Edit: I JUST FOUND OUT WHAT HASHTAG DOES 




 I was coming to say the same thing. OP's a douche but great Confession bear material. So I guess he's even. 




 The cost of "freedom". 




 Saw it saw Jupiter as it approached Jupiter? I don't get it. 




 What do you think is keeping my water in the bottle? Sneaky sneaky double currency. ;) 




 So basically you won the house Lottery, and extra room for free. Congrats!
 




 I got gilded once, didn't really see the use of the extra features etc, just used Reddit as normal. I really don't see the point. 




 And gold wouldn't?? who the fuck would care about gold if shit hits the fan?? You're better carrying around a couple of litres of water. 




 We should all take to his twitter to call him a "corrupt heathen". Just saying, it would be fun to see his reaction. 




 Awesome, now can they fix the "downloading latest playlist" thing so I can actually play? 




 Here's what you do, stop supporting Bungie. 




 My love grows more intense with every article. 









 It's just you're trying to defend a game which is blatantly bad. The only thing that game has going for it is the gun control, that's it. The rest of is is a grind with very little content to keep you engaged. I was as excited as the next guy for that game to come out, and as disappointed as the rest when it did. 




 But where's the challenge?? 




 Can anyone explain what's going on?? I just woke up. 




 What I don't understand is the fact that they are trying to build a file on this guy. Why is she trying to get his prints? He also claims she asked for his number. 




 You're welcome! Hope we get to see more soon :) 




 ....dude. *stands ups and claps* 




 What the hell is with the guy in the Land Rover? 




 But that's logic, we don't do logic.
 




 That last comment was a nice conclusion.


"Not smart." 




 Wasn't it with every copy?? not just pre-ordered?? 




 I was hoping for the AC series to be completely different. i.e what they hinted in the first game in Desmond's room. I though each game would be set in a different time period in different parts of the world, granted it technically was but they all felt the same. I was hoping for one in China during the Ming dynasty, another in Egypt during the time of the Ferros etc etc. Instead we got the crap that they spewed out Abstergo Entertainment **FUCK OFF** 




 [Gears of War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccWrbGEFgI8). Enough said, close thread. 
























 Am I the only one getting 10? 




 I would just watch it free on BT Sports so I'm good. 




 #Repost. 




 You don't do that! 'The pass of Death' is frowned upon where I'm from. 




 Now if only the could actually get the App to work, that would be great!



I've been able to use the App for a couple weeks now, ended up deleting the sonofabitch. 



















 You should join a class or hobby you would enjoy, it's the best place to meet completely new people. Become a regular face then try to make some friends. 




 Dude, and I just started playing this game too! 




 *I'll Just Post This Code Onto Reddit*

*Aannddddd It's Gone* 




 ~~Nice~~ Neat Work FTFY 




 The superiority complex is strong in this one.   




 No no, Jenny only did besos. 




 TBH, Ive lived under noisy neighbours and it does get your blood boiling also add the fact that this family is grieving I can somehow understand where she is coming from. The racist remarks of course make her lose all validity in her argument however she is from a different time, it's hard to change. [I'm a young male snowflake btw] 




 For all you Arkham Knight fans, keep playing the game. My friend told me you will get a little surprise on your 3rd or 4th play through. 




 I was more interested in who did 911. Last I heard is was some band named Jet Fuel. 




 Fiestaaa!! 




 He's a shittier English version of Remi Gallard. 




 I did this once as well, got stuck in the save for most of the day. 




 What's worse is that the only reason this has come to light is because of the Andres Iniesta Instagram account thing that happened over the weekend. 




 Hodor?...**HODORR** 




 I'm currently on an early naughties binge. These feeds my nostalgia trip. Thanks OP! 




 Donde esta la biblioteca? 




 It's like a black hole just manifested off the view camera 









 I take a vacation day every year. It's a good excuse to have a day to do what you want to do that isn't confined to a weekend. 




 You  just have to hold you're breathe and wait for it to blow over. Oh and crap your board shorts of course. 




 Buying clothes with ease is pretty average. 




 The 80's. I mean they probably won't, but I wish they did. 




 Cuttlefish are badass!! Too bad they're really tasty as well. 




 Gibraltar back to back Word War Champs too!! It's funny trust me, look Gibraltar up. 




 ^^^^Hi ^^^^guys, ^^^^room ^^^^for ^^^^one ^^^^more? 




 I was just trying to confirm. *Casually* *strolls* *away..* 




 Why can women use sex toys with no stigma and men are confined to our hands? This is BS! Where are our equal rights!? 




 Illegal or legal, do you really care? Do you really think they police are going to bother with this bullshit?  




 That's cause im not in constant fear that ill go bankrupt if i fall ill. But hey what do I know right? Im just a stranger on the internet with a different with an outside perspective at the comedy show you call health care. 




 Anyone can go to a hospital in Cuba and get treated for free, by better i mean better in a real world sense, not on spreadsheets and charts.
 




 What the point if no one can afford it? The rest of the world really appreciates it though!  




 RemindMe! 2 days Donation for /r/millionairemakers WOHOOO!! 




 YOu guys really claim to have the best healthcare in the world? That's the most deluded statement I've heard in a while. Come to Europe and see how the real best healthcare in the world works. I never have to deal with the hospital in a financial sense. If I break, they fix me, job done. When do I pay? I've been paying my taxes since I turned 18, there's my contribution.  




 This shit really sounds crazy. How can a 1st world country have a health system that's so broken? Cuba has a better health system than America. 




 Guy Fawkes was killed. This is a new guy. 




 I'm not a woman either so I thought I'd share my FU in this thread. At a festival, girl starts rubbing her ass against my dick, I apologised and walked away.. 




 Soo many leaf bits. shit supplier. 




 I would love to make enough money to be able to give awesome gifts. It's an awesome feeling especially when you know they deserve it. I'm currently trying to save up to get my grandparents a car. It's fucking tough but it will be worth it seeing their faces in the end. 




 FINALLY!! Thought I'd never get my answer. 




 "Hey Moustache!" 




 Do they want Guy Fox?

Because this is how they get Guy Fox

 Hijacking Top Comment because somehow no one has mentioned


#Wacky Racers 




 Awesome work OP!!, Just gotta do the same with your wallet now, buff that motherfucker up take it to a surgeon and get him to cut off the excess. Job done!! 




 Meh, worth it. 




 Dude, they better not be playing. You don't mess around with Bacon flavoured stuff. 




 Try it with bacon next, that's all I have to say. 




 Anybody have a transcript?? I'm at work :( 




 I have the ability to solve any problem or win any argument, about 3 days after they've happened. 




 I'm normally they guy demanding more zombie killing prowess from my friends. 


It could be on of them instead, but they don't take the time to actually learn what must be done to complete the game. It gets heated sometimes I must admit but it's an amazing time none the less and spent in good company.


Seriously can't wait! 




 Can't blame you, it's the obvious choice. I think UK when I see sterling too. Same with dollars everyone thinks US but you also have Australia and Canada etc .Although they're technically different currencies as they have different value. Then again however you have the Scottish pound which is less than and English pound. 



Money is weird concept. 









 I don't live in the UK I live in Gibraltar. Alcohol and Tobacco are really cheap here (surprisingly though there are very few alcoholics). On the other hand our food prices are pretty high when you compare our Morrisons to one in the UK. 




 Same here, the only thing I hate is that it's only every other COD game which has it. Some of the best coach co-op there is around today. 




 #RESTING INTENSIFIES 




 I don't how much that is but in comparison where I live I get a full litre bottle of Smirnoff vodka for 8. ~The world's a fickle bitch. 




 I was under the impression it was legal over there already. Guess my trip is waiting a couple of years! 




 I just like having a clean inbox. 




 It's Amy Schumer OP, good luck trying to get upvotes. Bleh. 




 I almost cried. I'm at the office, that would've been weird.  




 And I'm struggling to put money away to be able to afford a car, fuck this world. 




 Danger Dolan. 




 You're a moron. 




 Not only that. They were waiting for the cops to arrive to give the description of the bike that was stolen, he was probably confused as to why he was seeing the ends off two barrels. I know I would be, but then again I live in a place where cops don't carry guns and somehow still manage to do their job efficiently so what do I know. 




 Rubber bullets. They're obviously not mentally skilled enough to acknowledge a situation where lethal force is necessary so it should be removed all together.   




 Mucho thank you! 




 I had no idea things were this bad in America. wow. 




 I still can't say it. 




 I'm currently trying this, had a setback in a small festival this past weekend but not gonna let it deter me. There's another small outdoor festival this weekend so going to just forget this past weekend and hope for the best this coming one. It's tough but it's got to be done. 




 Where is season 2 being aired?? ITV aren't doing it anymore and it's driving me crazy trying to find it. 




 Maybe he was just trying to show how he can crash too? 




 In my country I pay around 20% Tax in my monthly income (single no kids). I can go to the hospital for anything with no problem and if they don't have the equipment required for a certain operation/test one of our neighbouring countries will put you in their hospital which the Government will pay for. It's a good life, can't complain. 




 Never thought of that. Will give that a go later. Thanks!

 This is why we can't have anything nice. 




 No no, didn't you know these are warehouse turtles? They look similar to forest turtles and are very identical in almost every way except that the warehouse turtle only live in Chinese Warehouses, silly western man. 




 TIL I have no original thoughts. 




 I'm white and don't even live in america yet this was childhood. 




 I don't mean make it only work via headset but when the headset is plugged in it could use the headset instead of it's internal mic to pick up voice commands. It would be a lot easier for the user to give the command and for the console to hear it. The camera in the kinect is still used of course to identify the person giving the commands.


It';s just a small thing that will make the experience a lot nicer. People wouldn't have to be shouting across their living room, instead they could speak into they're mic.  




 Edit: thanks for the downvotes guys. #progress.


So for people who use the Kinect, they know that when the TV is a bit too loud the Kinect cannot hear you, which is understandable.


My solution is simple and could be done with a software update. Allow Kinect to hear your commands via the headset.


I would make the Kinect user experience a lot more tolerable, as a lot of people enjoy blasting game volume to get immersed and not being able to use the Kinect properly when doing this can ruin a game if Kinect commands are allowed within the game.


It's a small thing I know but it's a small thing that will make the console feel a lot more responsive. 




 Uppity Bitch....I like. 




 Whoever topples it has to take care of it! 




 Sweeeet. 




 If you manage to take North and South America you're in the money. 10 troops per round and only 3 borders to defend. 




 Terrible signal up there. 














 Thanks for the informed reply! 


Hadn't really thought about the fact that it would have to be 3 separate 1080p displays, I was thinking more along the lines of one big image chopped up into 3 (I'm a moron). 


I see myself getting a PC quite soon tbh, see what all the hype is about! 




 For a long while now I've been wanting Xbox to make multi-screen a feature on it's console. [This latest image I've seen](https://i.imgur.com/HJ0QMju.jpg) makes me want it even more.

 nbsp;

Now I'm not sure about the capabilities of Windows 10 on Xbox One but is this something that could be done? Or is it more on the hardware side of things? Maybe an official Xbox multi-screen HDMI splitter?

 nbsp;

I'm just brainstorming ideas, but if anyone has any info on the matter it would be much appreciated.

 nbsp;

Edit: Damn. Thanks for the info guys! 




 The Captain heard the protest 



from this "pitiful pile of waste"


Line him up against that wall


And with his life, make haste.

^^^^Too ^^^Dark?
 




 Well that's just like your opinion I guess.


If his story is true (which tbh is believable compared to other stories on the internet) then he got screwed over by bad/ negligent customer service and Gamestop should correct that.


But then again, that's just like my opinion I guess.

 




 OP is just looking for his Xboxone. Let him be I say and good luck! 




 It's not more than a random gust of strong wind at the beach. If you someone managed to get stabbed I think it was Darwin's doing. 




 Searched competitive larping. So disappointed. 




 Can't adjust the lighting though. 




 Kick him in the head. 




 The fish at the beginning is not the same one that gets eaten. Seems like a different place ll together. 




 [Relevant near the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08c0BXTVpfs) 




 That's why we ended up doing 2 player on each TV. On four players it would crash and an error code would appear (don't remember the message it gave but it was pretty random)and that's not what you want happening when you're trying to do the story. 




 This is the only reason I will be getting it. Zombies is the most fun couch co-op you can have!!


I believe this one will only be 2 player split screen though. Thankfully that's how my friends and I play. LAN party woohoo!!! 




 I was actually planning on getting a mini fridge for my room but I don't want to go back on my never pre-order rule. Decisions! 




 I thought the same at the beginning but the game play demos have got me curios. I'll wait a couple of weeks after release to see reviews etc and make an informed decision. 




 That's an awesome pic. Wish I had some friends that were into this type of thing. Luck cunt! 




 Well it's got one thing right in that PC Gamers are mostly alone. **BRING ON THE DOWNVOTES** 




 I'm not religious but I like this man. Finally some one who actually seems to be in touch with the real world instead of the make believe one we have created for ourselves.


Edit: Any reason why I've been downvoted fro saying I like him other than you guys being assholes?. Didn't think so.
