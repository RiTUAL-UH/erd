 Yea these rock. I use em for methadone sometimes. It makes a really nice fine and airy powder that absorbs nicely up in your nose.
 




 On this topic of having money and its dry... That really is ALWAYS the way, I dont know why, maybe supply and demand. I mean if you get a paycheck everyone else is getting a paycheck also and you would think dealers would be re-uping but I guess its the opposite. Anyways hope you score soon man, good luck.  




 Well there's the obvious which is if you eat them and throw up your removing the drug from your stomach. But if you snort them or boot them I dont know why your high would go away unless you weren't high to begin with. Not sure if that is any help. 




 Yes I have come across these a few time's. I think there great. Sometimes I actually prefer doing 3, pink 10mg oxys because it kinda tricks your brain into thinking your doing more than just 30mgs cause you have more powder. But yes these pink 10mg k-56's will have the same effect as a blue 30 if you do three. The extra filler doesn't add up to much. Enjoy!
 














 Haha Probably both 




 Title Should have been Taming instead of training... my bad 
























 They do have a version for the Wii but I haven't played it. Anyone try that one? I wounder if it is as awesome 




 This store in my town called 3D games buys and sells every kind of game and console. Its like a pawn shop. I just pawn my old games for credit for my new ones. They pay good money too. 




 I remember I went to movie gallery or blockbuster and printed off my best pics when I was a kid and that game was still new 




 And the pokeflute that made them dance! 














 Your not alone kind sir 




 I do this almost ever time I'm on the pooper. 




 Oh ok that makes a lot more since. Yea i am offering the complete collection  of the first 3 sets or what people will offer. Its still not that valuable
 I havnt got an offer over 20$ 




 Yes. 




 Exactly. Your mind takes over 




 no, I didn't mean to lead you on. I didn't realize these sets have hardly any value. Its been about ten years and all the cards are in mint condition. I assumed I could get at least 100 or more but someone said they saw a set on amazon for 7-9 dollars. Guess I'm going to have to wait until they become more valuable.  




 Yeah I have seen these sets too. I am offering all three sets though but I guess I'm going to have to wait awhile till they become more valuable. I've never seen a set that low but I have seen a fossil set for 20  




 I would but that's about the shipping cost

 You obviously have no idea how rare a complete collection of all three base sets are. there are individual cards worth more than 40 dollars 









 I am looking to sell my collection of Pokemon cards. I have every card from the base, jungle, and Fossil sets (all Pokemon and all trainers). I have a binder that has keep all my cards in mint condition for the last 10 years. There is a mix of fist edition, promos but I have every Pokemon from each set. If there is anyone interested my e-mail is test_subject201@yahoo.com Please feel free to asks questions or anything. Ebay suggests to sell each card individually to make decent money but i don't have the time or patents. I'm willing to sell for a cheep, reasonable price. I am hard up for money right now so any offer would be pondered. I can send pics, lists, or anything for any serious inquiries.

 Awesome answer. 




 Who the fuck would down vote this!? 




 Thats a comic on its own. Maybe that will be my next one. 




 would be a lot easier to read and maybe a bit funnier if the spelling was better. But still a crazy story worth telling 




 my mind has its own mind! 




 That would make an awesome meme. I would use it. 









 The bear is the best. I FUCKING TOLD YOU! 




 Yeah man. This incident was when I went to see NOFX in road island one year. I was so fucking star struck. I bet I looked just like that 














 Yea there defiantly are. And their face looks just like that 


































 [RUCKUS](https://www.facebook.com/artist.ruckus?ref=hl) is my alias.
 









 The artist [RUCKUS](https://www.facebook.com/artist.ruckus) made a facebook page and has been adding some of his work to it. Check it out! 




 I know, I love this picture. Shes almost 3 years old now and still melts my heart. *tear  




 Very rare indeed.  









 I don't know man. I guess these people think their art critics or they dont approve of stencil work.  









 She's almost [3 years old now](http://imgur.com/rapbStW). we have 2 JRTs and there like our kids. I love when they dream of running or swimming and there little paws start moving. 




 I have some blue and pink peony right now but haven't got that far into the project to decide. 




 But... blowing stuff up is... fun... 




 Anyone have any good ideas for some good names? 




 why yes they are! But I am more interested in seeing a (self propelled)  mortar launch out of a rocket in mid flight and also address the challenge of making it successful. What I think may happen is once the mortars launch out of the rocket, the rocket and the mortar will push against each other and just push apart, making the mortar go up a bit more and the empty rocket shaft go down. Kinda like repelling magnets in zero gravity. Also this is just a first draft of simply an idea. I thought it would be cool. 




 I still have a lot of kinks to work out. This is pretty much a first draft of a cool idea I had, so not much effort went into the physics of it yet. Thank you for your concern for my safety. I already play it very safe and you are very right about a fail to lift scenario. That would really suck but I would treat it like you said, as a loaded gun. Maybe I will even go as far as launching it from inside my jeep and film it instead of standing next to it just in case.  




 Its nice to hear some support! Everyone is like... bad idea, illegal, wont work. Like I said, this is just an idea I thought to draw out so I wouldn't forget. I wasn't really planing on making it but now I want to make this or something similar . So far I have some great ideas for how to make it work and work safely. Also yes, it wouldn't really matter if the mortars ejected properly (especially at night) because the main goal is to just get the mortars up in the air with fuse lit, so wasn't really planning on being able to recover a (still in one piece) rocket. Even though that would be nice. I will make a video when I get the time to make this happen! 




 This would make an awesome pic for r/photoshopbattles 




 I am a man with a kids mentality. Get it right 




 Thanks for your words of wisdom. This was just an idea I drew up one boring night. I've posted a lot of these ideas but for some reason this got a lot more attention maybe because of some controversy. But I pride myself on being safe and I probably wont end up making this. If I do something like it in the future I will think of your words. 




 yea good call, thanks. I just did this as a cool idea and I love the feedback. Ill prob start off small with a 1inch mortar and a nice strong engine and long nose. If anything im inspired to make it work now. And of course take all the safty precautions.  




 haha im imaging that happening and my inner pyro is happy. And awesome idea on the double one casing mortars btw. thank you kind sir 




 Thanks ill check that out
 




 [Yes](http://imgur.com/gIuMpJ5) 




 This is just a glimpse into my twisted mind. Probably not something I would carry through with for a few reasons. Not sure if its legal and its defiantly dangerous. And yes I would need to do some real world calculations when it comes to weight and other factors. This is just a concept I though would be cool. 




 If its made out of a shopping bag its parashoot. haha Thanks bud 




 Yea it probably wouldn't work with a c6-5, if at all. The idea of a longer rocket is something I overlooked. I got to caught up in the concept of how to get the fireworks in the air. 




 Yea I understand. This is just an idea I had that I probably wont go through with. I really have no idea if this would work but this is a glimpse into my mind.
 









 Much appreciated! 



















 As you attorney I recommend to wear this on halloween. 
 



















 I don't understand. why can't you use those terms? I see them everywhere.  




 Hey thanks for the heads up. I rely to much on spell check and the rage maker doesn't underline misspelled words. my bad... my bad 




 What the fuck is this? I know its a dick but how is it relevant? 




 it was the *not bad* face that got me. 




 haha thank you. 100% true. Holding in that laugh felt like an eternity.   









 No, I didn't! but thank you for that link! His lyrics are so deep and meaningful backed with some of the most relaxing and soothing music. I can spend hours reading lyrics. LCW is a great album and I kinda got that feeling it was about that. Thanks again for the link man!  




 Modest Mouse for me is awesome when im in deep.  




 We've already talked talked to our vet and they said it would  be fine to breed her with a small stud. she is an english jack and normal is between 9 to 14 pounds so she is in the norm. We also have a 13 pound female but prefer the temperament and looks of the 10 pound. We plan to keep most of the puppies ourselves and only give a couple to close friends that we know would have time and the love they need. If they need round the clock nursing there is not a problem, I am home all the time and if I go out my wife is home. we don't leave our dogs unattended. and yes the vet would do shots, tail docking and dew claws and any other care they may need from a professional. We did a lot of research be fore we bought our dogs the ten pound is 3 years  old and the 13 is 2.  The breeder we got them from is no longer breeding and we would like to have more like her. we have looked for other breeders for english jacks but they are not very common where we are. we have thought a lot about this and would not do anything to harm either of our babies. I hope this answer all of your questions. 




 I have a 10lb female English Jack Russell Terrier. She is a pretty small Jack and me and my wife are looking to breed her. We live in Maine and are looking for a Stud but we want to find a small male because we are worried about her small size and that the pregnancy will hurt her. Does anybody have any advice on breeding small dogs and or know of any place to find a small English Jack Russell stud? 





























 thank you! you can see more of my stuff [HERE](https://www.facebook.com/artist.ruckus?ref=hl) 




 Don't tell me thats a little Jack Russell. I have [TWO](http://i.imgur.com/d5H00OI.jpg) this brings tears to my eyes. You should do a painting or something and invest some time and make it awesome. 









 He looks very annoyed that he can't even make nachos without getting his picture taken. 









 yea but thats not all stencil work. Most of it I hand painted. Tedious work. I'm glad my friend took the picture because the wall was taken down a week later. But the photo lives on! 




 (Repost, from *persons name*)should be put in the title so the person dosent "accidentally" take credit for the image. 




 [NOW](http://i.imgur.com/74ck31h.jpg) its a desert with black bananas falling from the ocean sky 




 Yes I agree, I thought you were already an artist that has done stencil work before. But for leaning purposes your right on when doing it is simply the best way to learn, so it doesn't matter the content. You can feel how the paint and stencil react to each other, thinness in your card-stock, many things that you don't even consider. In the end just do what works best for you. Just because someone might praise one way of doing things might not mean it works for what your doing. That applies with anything really. I didn't mean to come off harsh I just really hate when people take someone elses work, cut it out, then call it their own. Keep it up. If you have any questions feel free to ask. I like to help. Check out some of my work [HERE](https://www.facebook.com/artist.ruckus?ref=hl) 




 Why don't you be creative and make your own art? This is a Banksy piece and its very well known. When people see it (if they know of Banksy) they are going to just think to themselves that someone has no creativity. Please do us a favor and not recreate other peoples art. Can you honestly not think of anything original?  









 I don't know why you had to waste your skills with a painting of fucking Miley Cyrus. She shouldn't have anything to do with art let alone BE art. And if you consider her an artist, you need to be euthanized immediately. 




 The wind ended up lifting the stencil up outside when I was painting it and lost its definition, and the more I tried to fix it the worse it was coming out. So then I was just like fuck it ill blindfold her. You can see her eyes so it doesn't make since but it kinda looks cool. [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/5LDXapC.jpg) is what I was going for. Check out more of my work [HERE](https://www.facebook.com/artist.ruckus?ref=hl) and like the page if you could. 









 First we bought one plan at our local skate store but it was too expensive and too big. After looking everywhere online I stumbled onto this plan. It was so detailed and perfect for what we were looking to build. I couldn't tell you where to find it but it was perfect because it was just big enough and if I recall just under 500 dollars. But we had a bunch of left over plywood we stashed under the half pipe. So the best advise I can give is try to find something in your budget, have some friends help you, and get all the material before you start. And make sure that shits level. The surface is 2 layers. First plywood, then skate-light or something similar. Let me know if you have anymore questions.   




 I found a really great plan online. So we started saving some money but my grandma ended up paying for it as a x-mas gift. She also let us build it on her lawn. Shes a cool lady.
 









 Awesome pun sir 









 Check out my Facebook and see some more art by Maine Street artist Ruckus [HERE](https://www.facebook.com/artist.ruckus) need some likes 




 Not as bad as you would think. Really fun for some high school kids in the dead of winter. 









 Holy monkey balls. 




 Man, your set. Even got the snickers handy. Smart man. 




 Thank you for that information. 




 Oh yea and about the strings, I was using my acoustic all day. Even tho I use Erni Ball acoustic Reg. I dont care who you are, after playing all day with heavy strings your gonna loose some skin. If I was playing my PRS, no problem, can play that shit all day. I took a shower after and the tips of my finger peeled off, but that happens to all of us. 




 Honestly man, if you can actually count how many songs you know then your not as experienced as you think you are. Ive been playing for 10+ years and I couldn't give a fuck how many songs I know. If your truly a fucking musician than you of all people should know thats its about having fun and making music. I don't know why your acting like douche but your ego is far bigger than your guitar skills my friend. Boom.  




 Man, I sincerely feel bad that this new generation won't grow up with old Disney movies and game boys. And those Disney movies were works of art, everything down to watercolor and sound effects. You know? 









 Dick^ 




 [Here](http://imgur.com/a/5xOuD) is some pics of us building the thing. 




 It deserves lots of love indeed. Man, the hours I spent on the school bus playing that. Remember how awesome and new it was to have a lighted screen? 




 Oh the irony... Kid makes a statement by smashing a PS4 yet just handed sony 600 dollars. good effort?   
 









 Where's the fun in that? Fuck long finger nails. If you can get those fuckers to bleed treat it like a trophy. Also acoustic guitars do way more damage. No offence. it doesn't matter how you play it its all about what you can produce. Take Hendrix for example, right handed guitar played left. 




 I have no idea why I found that so funny. but... just great. ahhhh 




 A wise man once said guitar is easy to learn but take's a lifetime to perfect.  









 So many questions... So fucking many.
 




 Thank you sir! This deserves more attention in this sub. 




 Haven't been able to find the video. It must exist because the pics are screenshots from a video. Maybe someone will find it
 




 Holy actual shit... 









 Let me let you in on a secret. Most religions (especially Christianity) are a scam... A fairy tail of heaven to make old people less scared and hell to scare young people into believing. This universe is infinite... having no beginning and no end. This means you are also infinite... Our bodies are like hermit crab shells that we shed after death. Have you ever wondered what the afterlife is like? It is a lot like being born. You don't remember because live is never ending and always finds a way. I figured this out over time and through wise people, and I wish I would have known this as a kid like you because once you realize this (and many other things you will come to learn) you will know true happiness. Life is love and we are all here experiencing ourselves. I have been in your shoes but let me tell you how lucky you really are. You are alive and you have a future believe it or not... and you live in a time and place that is a gem in our universe so take advantage of it and don't listen to these fucking church goers. Find something or someone you love and loose yourself in it and always remember you have an eternity to find piece and happiness and believe me son, you will. I hope this helps. 




 The [Stencil](http://i.imgur.com/Djvwy4e.jpg) to this piece. 
























 let me know how you do, dont burn the house down. 




 This was from about 10 yards. I started out from farther back but ended up moving in closer cause I wasn't doing well. Its really fun. I noticed the flame goes out if the pellet is at lease about an inch away from the flame.  




 Agreed, Title sucks too. 









 I really dig your style. My last name is also Turner and I also have a similar style. Turners rule. 




 You should post this to R/wallpapers.
 




 This is pretty cool. Nice find 









 I think it helps to turn the brightness down on your TV. If that doesn't work try sitting father away from the TV. Or maybe try some motion sickness pills? 




 No problem 




 I ended up making that tutorial. I broke the one in this picture and figured it would be good opportunity to show the process. [ENJOY](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiklhUbSCVg feature=youtu.be) 




 The vics where just some extra pills I got. I usually do methadone and Xanax, that's my thing. And oxys and anything else good when I can get my hands on it. I try to stay away from APAP but these vics where free. 




 Believe it or not, those red speckles are the hydrocodone. The rest of the white is all APAP. I've been board before and tried to separate them. Long story short. Not worth it.  




 Thanks, only certain people recognize that when they look at my table. Theres all kinds of stuff like that all over it. 




 I don't but I could make some and post it. Now that I think of it I really should share my plans because its amazing how effective it is. The difference is like popping a balloon with a pin and untying the knot and letting the air out slow. PM me if you need the plans asap. But I will make some and post it on this sub. 




 Defiantly let it pass through. I did a lot of research/ trial and error before coming up with this. What happens when the bullet travels through the tube air is escaping out the holes and you want as much of that air to go away as possible so do away with the inner tube. Tried it and it works way better. 









 Yes the silencer is functional and work VERY well at suppressing the sound. It is modeled from how a real suppressor is made and works but with much less expensive material. The barrel is made from 3 aluminum cans (short v8 cans) and the 3 air breaks are made from 3 aluminum energy drinks that have a screw on cap. I also hot glued cotton around the chambers to further reduce the noise which works great. Its amazing the difference. It fits nice and snug with no screwing thanks to a sharpie pen that fits into the 1/4 inch hole after the muzzle. Anymore questions let me know. 




 Thats for taking the time to take the picture! Thats a sweet set.  



















 I got the shaker and glass from a friend that gave it to me when he moved but thats all I got, no shot glasses. What do those look like? I use it all the time/ Best free thing I've ever gotten. 









 I think its fun as hell. It has 3 fail/safes and isn't stupid. Maybe a little dangerous but that's what makes it fun. You rocket guys on here are all so stuck up. Apparently I'm the only one that thinks this is cool.

 One of the fastest ways to cool off hot food off I've encountered yet. Its right up there with holding it out of a car window driving down the interstate. Without the risk of getting bugs in it.

 [Cat Attack!](http://i.imgur.com/Zi8QxC2.jpg) 














 This is really amazing. I've never seen this before. Thank you for sharing the link. 




 Thanks you! People can be really harsh with their critics on this subreddit sometimes though. I hate when I just finish a piece that I put so much time and effort into and then just get down votes with no comments or reasons for them. I guess what i'm saying is keep your chin up if people want to be dicks. I know I have too. I think your really talented with your digital brush. Keep it up! 




 It's great that you took in consideration to blur the snowflakes. It gives the piece movement and makes you feel the womens chill from the wind. Nice job. I use Photoshop and paint and do stencil work but from what I know this takes mad patience. 




 This is exactly what I got today. 4 subs and everything! Care to share what they cost in your neck of the woods? there pretty expensive in my area. 




 [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/NauyCcj.jpg) is what I started from. I'm not sure what your referring to. 




 I prefer the cap for my type of work. I like the angled spray for stencles and obviously regular caps for actual graffiti. I'm a street ARTIST not a penis maker. I use what works I find it funny that krylon supports anti graffiti campaigns because I steal there paint and do it anyways. And as far as drips go, if your experienced enough you can control it. Go fuck yourself. 





























 I think we got them at wal-mart. The brand is Chuck-It. They last forever and are a smaller size so they fit in our small dogs mouths better. You can also get bigger ones. There awesome. They never seem to loose these ones out off all there other toys they have. 




 same here. My two Jacks each have one and they are the only ones still standing. This one is the same way, she will put the ball on any part of my body so she knows I can feel it. She likes to put it up against my lower back when I'm sitting because she knows it drives me crazy and I will keep throwing it. It amazes me how smart this breed is! 




 I'm so happy that she had a positive effect on your evening. They say having a pet (or in this case an adorable picture) can lower stress levels, blood pressure and related illnesses. I hope tomorrow goes smother for you! Deep breaths.. 



















 I actually posted a few picks of splatter from this in the Art Sub. and everyone was so fucking mean to me. Calling me an idiot, gay, my 2 year old can paint better than this. just mean shit. Thanks for the kind words. 




 your pretty close. I try to keep my good gear away from stuff like this so it dosnt get ruined. 




 Never took a video of that. I really should have but the snow is mostly gone where I live and Its back to being a regular bandit again anyways.

 Hes putting in a VW 




 From Plans. I believe its a sonex 2 seater. 




 Yes I believe so. Its come a long way since these pics were taken. I just haven't seen him for awhile. 














 Thats a fuckin samsquamch 




 Maybe that has to do with what kind of opiates you use. I know different types have different itch levels (with me at least). May I ask what you use primarily?  




 That actually sounds like it would do the trick. You have a dog im guessing? or did your teeth itch too one night? 




 I broke my head cherry at a bed bath and beyond... There. I said it. 




 Mines called a bear claw. It puts rolling on the floor and itching your back on a corner to shame. 




 well, I was entertained. 




 Yea for sure. The jeweler that cut it off said to wait a few weeks until her finger is normal again. Then she can have it fixed and sized.  




 That's a great story. Sad she didn't get to wear a ring for so long. That's what my wife's ring is made out of, white gold. Damn that thing was expensive but I love her and I think its her all time favorite thing. She is sad she has to wait a few weeks for the swelling to go down before she can get it fixed and sized. She defiantly couldn't wait 40 years haha.  




 It is REALLY dull but its so dull that it is perfectly flat because its basically been sanded down overtime moving over mirrors. Even with new razors it leaves little streaks where the new razor isn't perfectly flat. 









 I shall name it... The bat razor. Making lines and fighting crimes. 









 Heres an update! We ended up going to the jewely store today. Got the ring cut off professionally and it can now be repaired and sized. [HERES](http://i.imgur.com/72R5CHd.jpg) a pic of the ring. And one of her [FINGER](http://i.imgur.com/VeWTRWW.jpg)

 Who does this 30 minute shipping? Amazon? Are you telling me you can buy stuff online and have it shipped to your house in under and hour? teach me! Tell me! I bet its expensive tho 




 Yea that's what were going to do. Unless the swelling doesn't go down in the next hour I will be taking her to the ER. 




 If they cut the ring off at the ER do you think the ring can still be sized and come out of it looking fine? or does it really screw it up. She has 3 expensive rings soldered together and She wont do anything that will screw up the ring permanently unlessl she was gonna loose a finger or something. Its not bad like that tho.
 




 Well the swelling went down yesterday after we tried just pulling it off with dish soap. The swelling went down that night then tonight we tried the Floss trick and that almost worked but it made her finger swell up even worse. But we will take your advice tho. If it goes numb, looses feeling, or stays swelled we will go to the ER. Thanks for the help! 




 This is actually what caused her finger to swell like it is. We thought the trick looked like it would work awesome but didn't work that great. Now her finger is swelled like in the picture. Were gonna wait to do anything until the swelling goes down 




 We will go to the jewerly store tomorrow and see if they can do it first before I buy a cutter on amazon. Its not like this happens enough to need to own one. Thanks for the info tho! 




 This is what we will most likely end up doing. She needs it re-sized anyway. Her finger has feeling and is fine but thats the kind of advice I wanted. Thanks 




 she is not loosing feeling, we tried yesturday and it got swollen then too.  




 Yea no luck. Its swollen because we tried the trick with dental floss and it didnt work. 


































 I'm really surprised this isn't a thing or at least an option. Lets sell our own brand of needles with this on them. We just need a sweet name. 









 Well you can fuck right off then. Everyones thinking it 




 Did you also do the video editing? I do street art and video. Just curious if you also did the video too. Nice soundtrack btw. 




 That was good, thanks 




 I'm sorry but this... (From #12) "In this world there is room for everyone and the earth is rich and can provide for everyone." is the most false and ignorant statement ever.

 Yes, in the rare and right context but women can also use these in very evil ways. Are you a women? If you are you just wouldnt get it...
 









 Yes true, but it says they only had a glimpse of it. Just enough time to see something and jump to conclusions. Then question everything you know. 




 Is it not possible a person went skydiving, gilding, or something similar without reporting it first? The other 2 thoughts I had was it could be a R/C Plane or kite (yes Very high, but still. Look at the link). Or a metor in the shape of a person.

 Believe it or not that was a mechanical pencil. Look real close. 




 This was an assignment when I was in college film school. The person is not me in the video, hes a friend of mine. This was shot about 5 years ago. The assignment was to combine video and music together so they complement each other.  




 Damn that took a lot of work to get that shot. The lighting had to be just right. Pain in the ass for less than a second of screen time. 




 The use of slow motion and speeding up shots really helped in giving it that real feel. 




 Yea that's my favorite shot. I was constantly spraying my friends face with a spray bottle of water to keep the cold sweat look going. 




 Yea It fits really well

 Yea for sure. I have been using streamers lately but they do hit hard but like you said its worth it when you don't want to loose it. Ive been using OpenRocket and it really gives you a lot of info I can use for better launches. Thanks a lot for recommending that! 




 Thanks for your advice. Your definitely right about there being to many variables to be able to predict landing area. I was hoping there was some equation where you input thrust, height, and wind speed and come up with a 10X10 foot estimate. But like you said, it wouldn't be something you could do on the fly. 




 I'm looking for some basic math on how to figure out where my rocket will land (with or without parashoot) Right now I'm using basic C6-5 Estes motors so I can look up all the statistics online for the thrust. Any advice would be appreciated.   




 Nobody cares about your birthday.  




 What a waste of time watching this. THIS IS NOT FUNNY! AT ALL! 




 Why is this funny?
 




 Agreed. Those titties took me by surprise. 




 Its not. downvotes all around. 









 You can actually visualize sound traveling in this gif. As people are hearing GO! it takes a moment for sound to travel to someones ears. So the people in the front go first and everyone else follows. 





























 Agreed. poetic and insightful. It must have took awhile to write it.

 I can see this dude being about 400 pounds with no neck and a learning disability.  




 Or maybe its a trap to keep selfi taking, duck faced people off the streets. 




 That a good point. I feel like we would break them if we told them that. Their face would get a permanent confused look forever. 
























 Jesus Christ! If you want to be an asshole about this whole thing then lets take a look at your beautiful very polite post we have here. Not a shred of reasoning to disprove anything. I thought this was a safe place with knowledgeable individuals. Put down the bong? Really? All I was doing was throwing a theory out there and hoping for intelligent people to explain why this definitively could not work because I sincerely want to know. None of which you addressed. like the idea of that dark matter and black holes may be linked which is probably non-since but I guess ideas (even exotic ones) are worthless to you. I have studied astrophysics, graduated, and somehow I still manage to not be a total dick. I just wanted to throw out a crazy idea that I wanted others to disproof and talk about. After all isn't that the basis of new ideas? Thank you for your very awesome post that will surly incurage me to be less open minded. Much apreciated 




 ^Great ^^white ^^^bufflo 




 Does anyone out there have any ideas what might be in the Cincinnati box in the Hot Tub Time Machine movies? I just watched the second one and they mention the box a lot more than the first movie but still no clues to whats in it. If you haven't seen the second movie please still give some ideas because like I said you know just as much about the box even if you haven't seen the second movie. I read that the writers of the films may be trying to make another movie that starts off with this mystery or is based around it but I got the impression at the end of the second movie that they won't be making anymore. Please comment if you have any knowledge about this as well. Remember that the Cincinnati box is a shoe box so whatever it contains must fit in it (or does it?) I'm curious what we can come up with. 




 Thats badass then. Nice work. also dig the gauges
 




 why no love here? I think this is badass. Is your hair really green? 









 Came here to say just that! 




 Thanks a lot man. I appreciate you taking the time to help me out 




 How would I wire up a balancer circuit to my charger. Most R/C battery's have a wire you just plug into the charger? Any Idea? 




 Thanks for the info, I understand all those terms. I have a R/C car battery charger that charges every kind of battery and has build in voltage protection and lots of other features. Would that work as a PCM. Im not an idiot. Its not like im plugging the thing into a wall socket. I have my charger set to charge 2 cells with the combined MAh of both battery's. Now would that work?

This is what I have... http://i.ebayimg.com/images/i/131355448556-0-1/s-l1000.jpg
 




 [Here is a pic] (http://i.imgur.com/SGMgzxp.jpg?1) 




 So I have 2 battery's vertical in there battery sled. One battery with its positive side at the top and the other with its negative side at the top. At the bottom there is a wire connecting the two. If I connect a battery charger to the top of the 2 battery's will they both charge equally? or do I need some type of balancer. These are li-ion batterys.  Thanks in advance if anyone can give me the answer! 




 I was expecting a bit more with the decent album cover and then... Holy shit this is absolute garbage. 














 Well thank you fellow vapor! I'm a perfectionist and have a lot of patience. That's the key to clean builds. Taking your time and not rushing things.    




 Oh I see. For me my comfort zone is 0.2 to 0.6 so those lower ohms for me are on the other end of the spectrum of this build. Didn't mean to go 101 on you haha 




 Compared to harsh hot builds that give you great clouds but sacrifice on flavor and smoothness of the vape. This build gives great flavor with a smooth vape but im not blowing huge clouds.  




 Thank you, I wrapped them around a micro screw driver that's the same diameter as a .093 (42) drill bit. 









 nice. I do the same. I have 2 vapes, my RBA for the clouds and then my Evod2 for the taste and just to sit and puff all night on. The duel must really take the ohms down. But your also using 24 gauge so maybe its mostly that. 




 Nice build! Can you tell me if the juice flavors are harsh or weak with that kind of cloud and low ohms? 




 Its not rocket science, its VAPE SCIENCE! and yea dont be a dick. There is a lot to building coils when you want to know what your doing. But if you want to just loop a wire and stick it in a tank then, yea its not hard. 




 Thanks for clarifying that for me. 




 Thank you for taking the time and writing that up. Its really what I was looking for. My knowledge before vapeing was R/C stuff so I know a lot about Battery safety, wattage, voltage, ext. but terms like Resistance, and Ohms are new terms to me. I am reading all about ohms law right now but would you (or someone else) explain Resistance to me? What aspect of vaping does Resistance effect? Flavor? vape? Heat? 

Edit: Sweetleef took care of it. Thanks! 




 1. What is the advantages/disadvantages between tight wound coils and spread out coils.
2. How does the amount of wraps effect heat, vape, ext... (Is is more wraps less heat?) Im looking for a simplified answer even though I know this is a very large question.
3. What is the effect that larger wraps (aka macro coils)and smaller wraps (nano) produce?

Ive been looking for answers to these questions and its hard to come by straight forward answers because I know its not a easy question, but if anyone can simplify these answers I would REALLY appreciate it. Thanks guys! 




 Find a corner, go under a blanket maybe?, yea a car, maybe the floor in a good spot. I'm sure you can find a spot. A good way to test is to softly let some vape out your mouth and see how it moves. If it just kinda lingers thats fine but if it moves find somewhere else. 
 




 You would be amazed of how little air flow can REALLY effect vape smoke. Even when I blow rings over my laptop they dissipate fast because of the computer fan even though it blows down on the desk. My advice is find an area with no air flow and give it a go. Remember to get the smoke in your mouth not your lungs and not to push them out to hard. I use a combo of clicking my jaw a bit and a little push with my tong. Good luck. 




 Those are awesome. So many ideas I got from them. Thank you!
 









 Reminds me of that true life episode *Im a rap artist* (or some name like that) where the kid dresses like hes already a rapper and thinks hes going to get a huge record deal then they show him at a show and theres like 8 people there and hes so bad is hard to watch. 




 FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! NOOOOOO 




 HAHA, Is that on a piece of printer paper?! 




 That's what I thought and always known. Thanks. 




 I also read somewhere that Suboxone added the Naloxone to its recipe just so they could patent the name because just bup was taken by the brand subutex and that bup itself is the primary blocker and the low dose of the Naloxone doesnt do much at all. If what I read is right then suboxone and subutex block opiates the same way and you can't feel a p30 on eather. Please help me guys cause I thought this was common knowlage but my friend thinks hes 100% sure. 




 My friend swears up and down that you can take subutex and do a p30 right after and feel both of the drugs. Anyone have any input on this? Is he right? I thought the Buprenorphine was what does most of the blocking and Subutex is just Bup. I need some advice cause that would be awesome if my friend was right but I dont want to chance it without knowing. 




 man, its an honor. (Hope your not just messing with us.) I'm going to buy a print off that site you provided. I didn't realize you went through so many images. How did you have your camera setup? was it on a timer? did you take a picture every half hour even at night? (wouldn't that be a waste?) just curious, thanks! 




 The Earth is breathing. 




 Dude... Whoa
 




 I did the same. And thanks for the upvote! 














 I've used a box filled with an old sweatshirt, old jeans, and duct tape to hold it together and my .22 pellet rifle wont go all the way through. Pretty simple to make. I'm sure you can figure something out. 




 This was really interesting to listen too. 









 If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, Infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro' narrow chinks of his cavern. -William Blake
 





























 I actually went there to try to find it and was like da fuck? 




 My bands name was Afghan Banana Stand. We got a picture of the bass player holding our album in one hand and a beer in the other that night. I tried to find the picture but the last time I saw it it was on myspace so yeah... 




 [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIlwIuN-z2g#t=55s) is the part where the mouse drives the car... 




 I actually got to open for these guys in Portland Maine about 5 years ago with my old band. We got to hang out with them after the show hand an awesome time. Nice post 




 I about shit myself when that part come on. 




 Is it wrong to feel hatred towards these type of people or should I feel sympathy for them? This whole damn world just really saddens me... or at least 90% of it. 




 A NOFX FAN! Nice to meet you kind sir. 




 Free ham 




 Fat Mike makes that joke somewhere on [THIS](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqv3qm9In01qfzrl3.jpg) album. Its after one of the songs. 




 No. Not really.  




 YES! I was really hoping someone would pick up on that.
 




 They must serve Hitler brand ice cream. It has little tiny nutzies in it. 




 And they still have a baseball league! 




 [Reminds me of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIaFtAKnqBU) 




 Dude, I love your sense of humor. In the modern times we live in there is no fucking need to have 19 kids. Nice job! 




 Classic aunt paddy. 




 Hes like a tiny hillbilly Mainer I tell you what bub.
 




 As a graduate in new media the shots were very well done as well as the sound and content. Nice job with the rocket take off shots too. Did you use a drone to get those shots?  









 I was sitting at my desk and heard some drops of rain on my air conditioner a few hours ago and it made me happy. A few hours later I went for a drive by myself and Pink Floyd's song "wish you were here" came on and I smiled. That was a perfect moment and I was happy.  




 Les is the shit. He doesn't go into this with a bias like other shows. He has the mind set that he has no idea whats out there and just wants the truth. Compared to other shows where they hear a twig break and yell SQUATCH!  




 This is a good point but I feel like I might get harassed for asking such a touchy subject in a religious sub. Ya know? maybe not.  




 I understand your reasoning and thank you for your input but wouldn't that mean human nature or nature in general is more powerful? Thats how I interpret it. 




 Lets say a religious person is in a situation where they are close to death but still have a chance. Why does the will to live usually win the battle when the other option is heaven or what pertains to that individual. To me this means that within even the most hardcore religious person there is a fraction of doubt. How would you translate this contradiction? What are other peoples thoughts on this. 




 bingo 




 I hear ya man. About their juices tho, he makes some of the best juices Ive tried. The Cirrus is the key lime pie in the chassing clouds series and I like that one a lot but next time your in try the stratus. I liked that one for a long time but moved on. Right now im vaping crunch berry he made. Its not out to buy yet but if you ask theyll make it for you. What you usally do for juice?
 




 Yea thats the one I go too. What did you think I love that place
 




 Thank you! much appreciated man 




 Yea, do I know you? 




 Its on there cause its my local shop and represent right? Its just blank wood underneath. As you guys pointed out the sticker is pretty bad looking so when I get some time im going to take it off and do some more wood burning. Any ideas design ideas? im trying to stick with a rustic almost ancient look but im open to any suggestions.   




 Thanks man! Been watching to much CKY. IM talking like em now! 




 Ha yea it does. The stain has been rubbed off from so much use, Its been dropped, and Ive also had to fix it a few times. But overall the patina looks cool. 




 I swear I was!  




 Im a perfectionist so when I look at the one I already made I see every damn thing thats wrong so I kinda just want to do the same type of mod again. Plus it would be fun to do some more wood burning. 




 Oh yea, another thing thats good is If anything ever goes wrong I can fix it myself. I know every grain of wood in that sucker haha
 




 You would think that but it dosn't. and When I hold it my hand isnt near it
 




 This is my hand made variable wattage OKR wooden box mod I made myself. It includes a master on/off switch, fire button, potentiometer, blue LED, and a 5/10 thread to mount any RDA. The internal components include a battery sled, 2 Sony VTC5s all copper wiring, zenor diode, an OKR 1/10 variable wattage chip, a few capacitors, and 4 rare earth magnets to hold on the lid. The wood is hand cut and worked using mahogany and I used guerrilla wood glue to attach the corners. From there I sanded it and stained it.Then did some wood burning  As you can see its a bit haggard from lots of use. It isn't perfect but its something I made and have pride in and something no one else has. This is the first one I've built so the next one I build should be an improvement. Anyways I thought Id share. Open to any questions or critiques.

 Then why does it say Cincinnati on the box? Maybe it is a artifact or something that has to do with time travel but they found it there instead at the ski lodge. 




 It doesn't take a scientist to figure that one out. So far your very credible. This is called sarcasm. However, I will answer this... JUST BECAUSE your not being rude *as much*. No I do not think this theory is 100% fucking correct. However plausible because we can not see inside a black hole. Maybe someday we will create something that can pass near the event horizon on a rotating weak black hole and I will be proved wrong (probably not). Until that that day shut the fuck up and stop trying to prove yourself on a fucking Reddit comment section. 




 I do believe. I DO I DO I DOOOOOOOO. -- Also Very scientific. 




 ...oh wait --- this. SCIENCE! 





























 Like being weightless and in space isn't awesome enough we try to send them holo lens.  




 Thats my boy! 




 This is [him](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-i5kdLvxIycU/UB6HsjiZQBI/AAAAAAAAAMg/_Bp9fkarvmg/s1600/dog+tv.gif) when you ask what hes up to. 




 I have the same sigelei . is that the 150w? I love mine. I use that case to. Feels good in the hands. 




 I found my Sasquatch hair on a fence. I had top scientists examine it n they said it was baby sas fur. Caught a [pic](http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/4uz_sFueG80/0.jpg) of it too. Ether way ill take on your pubes any day. I barely need juice cause theres magic n shit in dat hair. 




 Don't get me wrong bro, polar bear fur chucks tits but my Sasquatch hair don't require boiling. Just got to pick out dem bugs n shit. 




 Proof that cats = up-votes. No title, low action, cat, 4010 fucking karma. 




 That's awesome. Nice job.

Edit: woah, somehow I stumbled upon this website that has the same location as your time laps. Did you take these as well? Also I thought Jupiter was the brighter star on the right side of the moon but thats actually Venus?  




 I live in Maine and had such a beautiful view. Half the sky was dark with stars the other was a sunset with a bright moon and Jupiter. I really wish I got a pic. Was it Jupiter that was on the right side of the moon? Im pretty sure it was, super bright. Is Venus on the upper left of the moon?  




 Apparently he has no reply to that. What a fucking dick. So if I spell something wrong that discredits my point? Debunk that fuck face. 




 Yea pretty much. Way to many questions. If you read it with a Indian accent it is very clear. 




 Man Im really sorry for your friends. I had to read the email a few times to catch the red flags. My first thought was aw his poor wife but Im glad I took a closer look. 




 I replied to his email and tried to be polite and asked some of these questions without making him suspicious. Ive yet to hear a reply. I saw this was a scam pretty quickly

 Well this seem legit. It must be real cause who would make up a story like this!? It also says the word god a lot and I like that I must like and share to claim my prayer. 




 I saw an interview with one of the actors. They said that the box was originally just a joke but they kept bringing it up and it grew on them. But if their making another movie it will probably revolve around the box so the contents might not have been written yet. 




 I like your thought process! Those are all really good points. I bet it is a drug of some sort when you put it that way. 




 Hey thanks a lot. At first I thought it was something that condensed vapor clouds so rooms don't fill with fog. I didn't take much time looking into it and there wasn't much info on that site. Much appreciated!  




 That looks very time consuming.  




 Check out PLEX. It lets you stream any videos you have on your computer on your Roku. I use it and it doesn't slow your computer at all. I have an older computer and I would never be able to watch 2 videos at the same time. Also the app automatically adds the cover art of your videos and TV shows. Its really the closest thing I can think of that your looking for. 




 Finally a real friggin date.  




 wow. Thats an amazing picture. Thats all I have to say about that... 




 Curl your tongue so the tip of it is touching under your tongue and pull in to the back of your throat kind of pulse it so it pushing air out and bring it back to where it started. The whole time keep it curled. YOu dont even need breath when you do it this way but its all preference. Some people do one or the other or both together. 




 Do the lip curl thing for sure. I actually combine the tongue push with the cough to get a little more distants and consistency. Also it helps to kind of push out your lower jaw a bit until you find a sweet spot. Another trick is to look in a mirror and try to make a perfect O with your mouth then its all about the push out. But yeah, keep practicing. 




 I feel your rage. Personally I try to stay as far away as I can from people like this. You can't fill a cup that's already full... 




 Instead of balls it comes like a rope. So you just cut a piece off, split it in half and wick. Its so convenient. The package says Organic pharmaceutical cotton but its not as soft as normal organic cotton. I love what it says on the package... "hunted almost to extinction by crazed sub-ohmers, the elusive yeti is sought after for its fine absorbent fur." 




 I have a Sigelei 150w. Thing blows my mind. YOu can find them for under a 100 online. Thats my 2 cents. Have fun, be safe. 




 That looks pretty got for hand twisted. Nice job man. Never tried doing it by hand ive always used a drill. What are the pros/cons for hand twisting? IM just guessing more work? 









 cool man that's good to know. Im not in that band anymore but I still play everyday. alone or not. You still playing? 




 whos ohmeohmyke? 




 Dude that's awesome you were there. I had so much fun at that show. We did an awesome job but I remember people where getting antsy for streetlight towards the end of our set and was being dicks. Not cause of our music but cause they couldn't wait for streetlight.  




 No it was kinda an inside joke. In high school when we first got together we tried out a band name generator and Afghan banana stand was one of the results. We hated it but we would keep referencing it constantly so it stuck. Quick story time! We were writing lyrics one day that said something about pushing the principles car into traffic and got sent to his office. When he asked what our band name was our guitarist said Brazilian bikini tan as a joke and so he didn't know our real name which ended up becoming our album Afghan banana stand presents Brazilian bikini tan. 




 So if there going to premier it I assume shortly after that it might be coming out. Thank you for the info! 




 Before anyone asks the banana was our mascot way before the whole Banana for scale thing started. 




 [Here](http://i.imgur.com/fNHimyw.jpg?1) it is. Everyone loved our album cover haha 




 Fatty tweeted that its coming soon and there wrapping up production almost a year ago and I cant seem to find any info on it. They keep saying its coming but Ive yet to see any type of announcement or anything. Anyone know anything? I don't know about you but I CANT FUCKING WAIT!!!! 









 AzcStee saves the day!  




 That clears things up a bit. Thanks for your response. I have 2 married sets that Ill only use then. I'm deff glad I asked before I did some real damage. Ill keep my odd batteries for other things. Thanks again. 









 I actully found that [pic](http://i.imgur.com/5kUtlq8.jpg?2) 




 Im going to go watch season 8 again. Forgot how much I liked that season. 




 Actually I think this is a good idea. I think if your going to see a band live you should just enjoy the moment and listen to the music. You can fuckin tweet meaningless shit later.  




 That would be awesome. You mean kinda like people do with beer bottle caps? It wouldn't take a B M long to do this ether. 
























 Its ok. I was there and we went through it together.  




 god damit.  




 Somewhere out there is a props guy that could help us answer this question... Maybe he uses reddit. That would be amazing. 




 maybe they just forgot the corner piece? I don't think they would put all that work into something thats on screen for a few seconds when they can just find it at the old props warehouse.  




 maybe the props department were just re-using old stuff. 




 I admire your shamelessness. Keep it up. 









 This is what they're saying... 

Him: Its big

Her: HOW BIG? 

Him: 10 and a half 




 Good, good. Hows Franky fat face? Oh that franky, always grabbing dudes balls. ahh good times. 




 Ron? Is that you? I thought you were in jail. 




 I just upvoted fucking casual.  




 We exist in a small corner of reddit known as /r/nofx . Decided to mossy on over to jokes to post this one. Nice to meet you. 




 I tried to see if I could recognize any buildings but had no luck so they must have filmed that scene in Pennsylania as well. 




 I'm also from Waterville. When I first saw that sign I was excited too. Glad im not the only one haha 









 I pride myself in thinking I know it all when it comes to NOFX and then you show me they have a beer. Had no idea. Thanks for sharing this!  




 Stick control comes with practice. But I used to put some headphones on and play with my favorite songs for hours. I liked to practice with jam bands like Phish cause they change tempo and rhythm and its a lot more fun than just pop songs that's just one beat for the whole song. 




 This is a big one. Usually very true. 




 Thank fuck its outside your window. I would set my house on fire if it was inside. 




 thanks for the heads up! Ill check em out. 




 Haven't tried the IPv4 but I approve of the mutation! 




 I love it man. you wont regret it when you get one. 




 my wife was with me when I was adding it to my juice and shes like "your gonna vape that shit!? Its fucking hand moisturizer!" 




 oh ok. Deff shitty ecr material though.  




 Honest question. What would be wrong with using this? My friend bought some of this and I added some to a 50/50 pg,vg juice and I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. 




 That would look sick as tits, black and white or not. What color is your Sigelei? If its black, black and white is the way to go. But color would look cool to. If you do this I would love to see it! 




 Yea that's much more satisfying.  




 Thank you kind sir. 




 I think I've seen that one. Nice man! 




 what concert? 




 Found the sticker at a record store and cut it myself and it worked out great. I think it was meant for a bumper sticker so its also a high quality sticker. 




 Thanks man! I thought it improved its looks considerably.  














 same thing was said about gay marriage. Could happen. 




 yea that's a good idea. I think schools should at least teach both equally. When I went to school we didn't learn much about the metric system at all except in science class but it was still minimal. 




 This is the best explanation for this problem I have ever seen. So simple yet so dead on. No farther commenting required. 




 Size 14 shoes are the basis of the american measurement system. Right? This must be right. It explain's everything.  




 I have size 14 shoes. How many times do I step? is that 14 inches?!? WHAT DO I DO!? FUCK! 




 Well, Americans aren't really cool with change. People would flip out if our system was changed to metric. 




 yep. 









 I'm surprised it still works, I've played the shit out of it. Only NOFX vinyl I have though.  




 Nice dude! [HERE'S](http://imgur.com/a/dg4CL) mine. I think I got this in 2007. Played the shit out of it. 




 id imagine if you added the oceans it would be round
