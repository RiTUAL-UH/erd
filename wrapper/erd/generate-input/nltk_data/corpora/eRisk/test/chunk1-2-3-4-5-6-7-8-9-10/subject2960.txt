 This is some excellent advice. My intelligence has made me bitter and jaded, I'm unfortunately a bit of an idealist so when the world doesn't live up to my ideals I become bitter about it. It's something I've really come to terms with, that it is better to be humble and kind than intelligent and cold. I hope it is something that I only get better at as I get older. That being said I really need to work on myself socially as I still see social interaction as a mechanical thing that other people find organic. 




 I have a ridiculously high standard for myself too, perfectionism is something that often leads me to depression. I have similar mechanical thinking when it comes to social interaction. What comes easy to other people, simply talking, small talk I guess, is a painful thing for me. I have to try to perform small talk. I remember being maybe 12, and attempting to analyze the way the "popular kids" spoke to each other so I could maybe mimic it.  I just can't function it seems. 




 Yeah it brought up a lot of problems in my last romantic relationship when I started experiencing depression again. I have it twofold people like me when I have my shallow mask put up, this fake person who likes what everyone else likes and goes with the flow, but as soon as I ever open up and talk about something "deep" with a person they usually remove themselves from my life. So I just expect people to leave now. 




 I should be in my third year, but I've dropped out because of depression. I was undiagnosed until July this year, which is miserable considering how long I've been suffering from it. At least I'm on the road to getting better now. 




 This is exactly my school experience. I was always beaten down for being ahead of my classmates. It was pretty miserable being a ten year old and having no one else around me understand what I was talking about. 




 Yeah, my family moved at very key developmental stages where I lost all my friends and any kind of social circle I may have been building. I'm more of a failed extrovert than a true introvert. My social life is screwed up. 




 Yeah I know how that feels. I mentioned in another comment how I have a numbing existential pain that follows me around no matter how happy or content I am. 




 I like it a lot, it's very underrated. It's all about the characters in the story, not so much the campy scifi that surrounds it. 




 So far all it has caused me is absolute pain. I'd say I'm socially stunted as a result of intelligence, which has lead me to not trust people. I've dropped out of college not due to lack of success, but because I don't trust myself. I would gladly trade my intelligence for happiness. 




 I relate with everything you just mentioned. Even before I was diagnosed with depression I had this subtle knowledge that felt like I wasn't meant to be happy. I really appreciate the quote at the bottom too, thanks. 




 I like Kurt Vonnegut, he has a sad, uplifting, and absurd way of looking at the world and why people do things. I'd recommend Slaughterhouse-Five. Anything by Mark Twain too, especially his short stories and novellas.  




 I've never been tested, though based on my performance I'd guess I'm considered well above average intelligence. I sympathize with what you're saying at the end. I've ruined a lot of close relationships, I'm isolating myself, and I've dropped out of university (not because I was underperforming just because I can't take life anymore.) I feel like I'm either going to beat this and be the person I've always wanted to be, or I lose and kill myself.  




 It's always at the back of my mind, it's like a numbing anxiety that just leads me back to depression. 




 I was like that through highschool, I grew up in a rural town quite literally in the middle of nowhere. All my teachers always thought I was the smartest kid in the school, and I showed it in the last year, came second highest g.p.a. in my grad class. I spent most of my grad year not depressed, so that may have helped. 




 That's very interesting! thanks for sharing. 




 I like a lot of art films. Andrei Tarkovsky, and Wim Wenders are two of my favorites directors. I think there's a lot in their works that speaks to the INFJ mindset. I especially like the movies Stalker, and Wings of Desire. In mainstream films I really like Bladerunner and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind.   




 Recently my therapist brought up the possibility that I may be gifted. I suffered from depression during my childhood and apart from periods where I was too apathetic to care I did excellent in school. I've heard it said that depression is common amongst people with high intelligence. I just wanted to ask amongst this community and get some perspective.  




 Due to some recent circumstances I've started seeking counselling. I've gone to see a psychiatrist and have been diagnosed with depression and some obsessive compulsive tendencies. From what I've read I think I may have BPD.

I'm a 20 year old male. Since I was little I can remember having serious mood swings. I feel very needy when it comes to other people, I'm also very afraid of them leaving me. I've had attacks of anger or crying when someone leaves me or when big plans change at the last minute. I've lied about random things because I feel insecure. Stupid things like going to a certain concert or something like that. During worse parts of my life I've had suicidal ideation and mixed with feelings of abandonment I have almost self harmed. I have threatened suicide, and have a dramatic streak when I feel I can no longer cope. I have had paranoid thoughts about almost anything you can imagine. I drink to self medicate. I always think that people close to me are just looking for an excuse to bail out of my life, and if they do leave I have major panic attacks. There's has been a pattern of people walking out on me so I'm always ready to drop someone else first, this causes problems in my relationships. I always feel a compulsion to impress people that I meet for the first time. I have fairly idealistic or black and white world views and will devalue people who disagree with me. I've been physically violent with people close to me in the past, and sometimes throw things when I'm angry. When I was younger I had a bad habit of acting out in an attempt to get others to accept me. I was bullied a lot from 8-14, partly because I believe I was already depressed at that age.

 




 I can remember from a young age having spells of crying, or on the verge of crying. I can remember having spells of this even up to around the age of 17 or so. I've always just felt overwhelmed by negative emotions at times, and have gotten inappropriately weepy at times. I'm new to my diagnosis so I'm still trying to find out what fits into my description or not. I can say with confidence that I've suffered from depression and anxiety before this most recent spell, but is this not being able to control negative emotions during circumstantial events fall within the realm of my depression? 




 This entirely, it's such a viscous cycle. All I can think about is how I've been weak and failed in the past. How am I supposed to build confidence when I have such an awful track record; then it just feeds into the next bought of depression.  




 Yeah I get that way too. That's when I can take a lot of work load, it's kind of like "buckle down, weather the storm, you should be in a good place when the feeling comes back just do these things in the mean time." Then it doesn't work out and I end up angry and frustrated.
 




 Thanks a lot for the response. I'm not holding any illusions as to continuing this relationship. The thing that bothers me the most about the whole situation is how out of character this was for me. I've never done things like this before and it makes me sick to think that I ever even got angry at her for anything. I'm just trying to get back to who I was before this year with the added experience. I want to be stable longer before I date anyone else let alone her. She does matter a lot to me and if I've lost her for ever than so be it, but I think that things might be better for the both of us if she knows what's happening with me.

P.S. Thanks a lot, it's been really difficult so far, but at the same time it's good to know where those emotions came from in the first place. I've got a long road ahead of me, but I'm taking off time to make sure that I never act like this again. 




 The people who are suggesting counselling are correct, if you have not yet tried counselling than that is a good direction to go. Anger is not a good way to communicate in a relationship and there needs to be healthier ways to go about it. Anger is generally a sign of other issues, it is not okay that he takes this out on you but both of you should seek counselling. If he doesn't seek counselling or seem to make any improvement than you should start thinking of ways to leave. 




 I've been there before, just many years ago now. I'd say this time was a bit different being out on my own though. University can do a number on you. 




 already did, looking for wider feedback.
 




 When I wasn't actively being depressed it would come out as anger in general. I was overly judgemental to a lot of people and was generally dissatisfied with everything around me. 









 I'm a 20 year old male. I've been suffering from major depression for years and only over the past few months have I actually been diagnosed. I've found with my depression I have periods of anxiety that lead to depression, which I eventually push down so I can actually function. So I'm severely depressed at the same time as being able to maintain a fairly substantial work load. That being said I can only focus on my work load anything else is too much. Eventually my depression starts coming out again and the facade that I put up cracks. It usually starts to break down after a few months with angry outbursts, crying randomly and then suicidal ideation until I'm full on depressed again.  

So has anyone else felt this way before. That you can push down your depression for a period of time but it ends up coming out again as anger, anxiety or frustration? 




 Thanks a lot for this. I'm not looking to get her back, I'd be lying if I said that's not what I would like, but I'm not expecting anything and I need to get healthy before I can date anyone again. I just want her to know that I'm sorry and that nothing that happened was her fault. She didn't mention any of this stuff when we broke up, even though I asked. I guess she didn't feel it was needed. Anyway, I'm sure she knows something is up with me, it was pretty obvious looking back, but for me it wasn't at the time. I just don't know how to talk to her about it. I mean calling her up and being like "Hey haven't talked in a while, I've been diagnosed with a mental illness, sorry for all the garbage I put you through" seems a little forward. Thanks for the response. 




 Me and my ex dated for 2.5 years we broke up in april; before we started dating we'd been friends for 3 years I'm 20, she's 21. I didn't take care of myself and I treated her like garbage. She has so many completely valid reasons to never want to speak to me again. I became completely focused on school without any regard to anything else, it was all I could handle. I had what I would call an existential crisis that triggered clinical depression. I went to a counsellor early on when i was feeling a lot of anxiety, they told me I should speak with a philosopher. I wasn't sleeping at night, wasn't eating, was missing showering every other day, and falling asleep in the afternoon or in class. Lost interest in everything I enjoy, was a snob to my friends, and walked around with a chip on my shoulder.
 
I did so many things that were absolutely crazy, and obviously signs that something was seriously wrong with me, but I didn't do anything about it at the time. I became a complete misanthrope, I hated everybody and criticized everyone including her parents. I became dependent on her. In the last few months we ended up fighting a lot and I almost hit her, like raised my hand and said I wanted to, but didn't. I did end up shoving her once. I'm so ashamed about what happened. But wait there's more. I became kind of semi-controlling and I was jealous of one of her guy friends, who I probably was right about but I let how I felt affect me too much. I definitely crossed the line with that too, I just felt like I wasn't good enough at all. I didn't do enough for her birthday and valentine's day. It was just dinner, flowers, and a gift but I felt I should have done more. During all of this I was spending a lot of time playing video games because without realizing it I couldn't deal with my own life.

During a panic attack I had I almost cut myself, I've never done something like that before it was crazy, she stopped me from doing that. I was off handedly mentioning killing myself like an "maybe I should just kill myself then I wouldn't have to deal with" ____ whatever problem I was having. 

After she broke up with me at the end of the school year, I didn't leave my apartment for 2 weeks, I just cried. I couldn't piece things together, I didn't talk to anyone I was just dead. It took me a month to realize how messed up I had been. I've since gone in and had pscyhiatric assessment done. I've been diagnosed with severe major depression. I'm seeing a therapist and am on medication.

I've never been like this before, I've always been a patient, caring and loving person. I was the one who could take the pressure in our relationship, but I lost it. This past year has been so out of character it's difficult to describe. Apparently my friend's and family has been very worried about me but didn't say anything.

Me and my ex haven't been speaking very often since the break up. She wanted to stay friends (for some reason I don't understand) but I told her that we both needed space. She said that she'd be there if I needed anything. I told her I wouldn't. Anyway, now I've dropped out of college for this year while I get my head back together. 

Do you think that I should tell this girl why I acted the way I did? I'm feel so ashamed about what's happened, I have a hard time believing it myself.  She was my best friend for five years and the last 9 months have completely ruined that. 

TL;DR: I've been diagnosed with severe depression. I've acted like a monster for almost a year, my ex left me with good reason. I feel like I should talk to my ex and at least give her an explanation for why I acted the way I did. 
























 When I reach rock bottom with a depressive episode I find that my social boundaries almost completely disappear. I talk to people I wouldn't otherwise talk to about pretty deep, or personal stuff. It's almost as though I just have to dump my negative thoughts on people close to me, to help me carry some of the weight. Most of the time it's alright I have people who I can talk to but I often have a hard time internalizing those horrible emotions when I'm at the lowest of the lows. Do any of you experience this too? 




 yeah I understand that completely, I'm 20 and have been called an old soul so many times I can't count it. I'm not a religious person and don't actually entertain the idea of reincarnation, but I've always identified with the idea of having been around the block a few times.  




 Yeah I did the same thing, it was always trying to push it as far down as possible. I think that by doing so at a young age it actually caused my depression to be worse now. I can remember doing some things in school that were really not alright, and just biting my tongue so I didn't cry sometimes. I've been trying to work very hard at exercising as a way of wasting the energy those negative emotions cause. 

I'm really sorry to hear that you have a problem that makes exercising dangerous. I can't imagine how I'd manage without. 




 Wow that's horrible, I'm sorry to hear it's taking so long. I don't know how I got an appointment so fast. 




 I've become much more empathetic since realizing I was struggling with depression and seeking treatment. Before that though I was about as bitter and jaded as you can possibly get. 




 about a week and a half. 




 Really?, I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and an anxiety disorder after my first appointment with my Psychiatrist and I'm from Canada. 




 Thanks a lot for the recommendation. I have to say that now that I know I'm depressed and that I've been seeking treatment I don't feel as cold and jaded as I did before. I know where those negative feelings and coldness was coming from now so I can manage it better. At the same time there is a degree of realism in the way I thought before. For instance most people feign empathy for things happening in other countries, though it is almost impossible for them on a human behavioural level to actually care because they have no invested interest. I guess it's kind of stuff like that that still hangs around in my head, but I've been trying to empathize more as a part of managing my depression. 




 Oh man I understand where you're coming from a lot. I am absolutely polite and helpful to almost everybody, even when I am having a major depressive episode. People have a tendency to take advantage of me this way. I'm very jaded about almost everything though, politics, philosophy, everything. When you read enough, the world becomes horribly small and rather depressing, especially when you read a lot into sociology and philosophy. 

I think that more often than not I'm myself only around strangers, or drunk. Everything else feels like maintenance a lot of the time, I feel like I need to keep a facade to keep friends. 
 




 For me it may have very well have been a lot of anxiety I had as a kid. I can just remember very clearly either saying horribly cynical things, or just crying in class. I got into fights every now and then but I never started them. I just remember being incredibly weepy at times, or over emotional. I didn't cause a lot of trouble, but I did and said some pretty morose stuff at a young age. 




 No it was just about the way I felt about it, that I was pissed off enough about how stupid I felt people were that I felt I had to go talk some sense into the people handing out stickers, instead of ignoring it. Perhaps that wasn't the best example, but I did things like shot people down in class discussions and was just a huge asshole about things. I'm not like that when I'm not in a depressive episode so I was just wondering if other people shared that experience. 




 I relate a lot to this. I'm not out of the woods, but I've definitely been an ass to people close to me. 




 My depression has definitely left me a bitter and less empathetic person than I was before I became depressed. I've become sort of dismissive of most things that other people seem to get very swept up in. I honestly have admitted to myself that I don't have the emotional resources to care about what happens in the rest of the world anymore. I know it's not good that there is war in Syria and drought in Africa, but I just find myself not giving a damn. I actually have started thinking that most peoples empathy for these sort of things is just a big show they put on. 

For example, with the whole Kony 2012 thing, I ripped into that like there was no tomorrow, being bitter and jaded at what seemed like sentimental schlock. It wouldn't usually bother me, I'd ignore it and let it go, but I actually went to the booth some students had set up at my college and basically drilled them to see if they knew what they were talking about, mostly they didn't. 

I don't know, I just feel more bitter, jaded, and down right cynical than ever. Do any of you get the same thing? 




 I've recently been diagnosed with depression and looking back on my personal history I've been depressed since a fairly young age. Probably since I was 9-10. My Psychiatrist and Psychologist both agree that I experienced childhood depression. I can remember being just randomly irritable at times where it wasn't appropriate, or acting out in other ways. I remember just having fits when I was younger that looking back corresponded with periods of anxiety and depression.  




 Yeah we've talked about it quite a bit now, and have decided to talk on a semi regular basis. This was her idea not mine, I've already told her I have no idea why she'd want to speak to me again. So I guess that's good, she's the one who is really pushing to continue at least a friendship. Though I'm not trying to use the depression as an excuse, I think it's fair to say that I only ever behaved in that way while depressed, never before or after. She says that it doesn't bother her and that it's nice that there's some explanation there. 




 Yeah, I went in again to have a visit with the psychiatrist I've been seeing, he was able to better explain what he thought my issues are. I'm still not 100% on it, because I know I've had weird hyper/irritable episodes in the past, but he said most of them seem to be driven by anxiety rather than a mood state. I'm going to keep an eye out for symptoms regardless, and I've been mood charting for the depression that I have been diagnosed with, so I guess time will tell. Thanks for the response. 




 I often feel that humans live very unnaturally, that humans aren't supposed to live in massive groups of hundreds of thousands. I wouldn't say that I'm a primitivist, just that I feel the way things are set up which is for a maximum productivity society hurts the human mind that it influences. Things like television and consumerism, too much information always bombarding you even if you try to avoid it. Humans are built for living in smaller family groups, not giant grids with thousands. I guess that's why living in an apartment building feels like a prison to me. 




 Just that it seemed that these episodes were driven more by anxiety than anything else. I made it clear that I felt the anxiety was more of a symptom than a driver, but he said it seemed the other way. I can't see how an inflated self esteem and grandiose thinking could come from anxiety. In some cases I'd agree with him, not so much in others. 




 Some have an evening, others have lasted about a month. 




 Yeah I make a lot of comments about my intelligence. Yeah, no one suspected that I was depressed, maybe a bit neurotic, but nothing more than that. I built a persona that was the opposite of how I was feeling, I made comments about my looks and intelligence, and was pretty haughty sometimes. It was all just made up to counter the scales. 




 Totally agree. I'd say I come off as very high strung and full of myself, **especially** when meeting new people. I figure that I have to come off as a dominate personality as a confident type personality, but it's all just an act, it hasn't done me any favours. 




 I think we're on the same page, I just took it to a bit of an extreme. I think there's a certain level of depersonalization that goes along with it. I know I just feel like a pit behind the "face" that I put up, and recently I haven't been able to muster the energy to keep it going, and when I could keep it up. When I could keep it up, it would just be the most fake, arrogant, manufactured face you could possibly imagine, as soon as I got home it just disappeared. 




 Yeah that's kind of where I am. I've just spent a year acting kind of like this without really realizing what I was dealing with. 




 I've discovered that I show a fake kind of self confidence in an attempt to hide how horrible I really feel. It's almost as though I'm trying to convince myself I'm someone impressive when I know that I'm really not. It sort of happens more often during periods where I feel horrible about myself. I can convince myself to act self confident even though I'm not. It feels like an equal and opposite reaction to the depression, sort of like well if you feel like crap inside act like you're not outside. Actually it's more in line with the feeling, if you feel horrible inside, devalue everything around you so you feel better. I end up being horribly judgemental and condescending.  




 It's actually terrifying how much like the people in Brave New World a lot of people really are. I'm a horrible idealist who tortures himself with thoughts of "real happiness" or "true beauty." I'm very much starting to believe those things are unattainable and are just fantastic delusions of what's really possible. Off topic, but it does cause me a great deal of strife and unhappiness. I wish I didn't think about these things, I wish I could be content. 




 Actually I brought this movie to my exgirlfriend, saying how amused I was at the concept. That's when I realized I'd become one seriously bitter, angry, misanthrope, and it wasn't 3 months later that I started going to therapy. 

edit: I suppose I should actually reply to your ideas. I've learned not to hate the people who I think are awful and greedy, most of the time they don't know any better. Is it something to lament? yes, is it something I can change? probably not. You see, the world has become a very ugly place, and, I believe, people by and large have also become that way. We live in a world where there are weapons that can destroy whole cities in the blink of an eye. The situation, overall, has become rather bleak, cheap, and ugly, and many people have adapted to reflect this. There are reasons why I find art so lacking in it's ability to provide me comfort or catharsis, it's because there is no group of words, images, or notes that can extinguish the existential anguish that comes from living in our time. A time when everything could be moving toward a hopeful, beautiful future full of peace and promise, but so often falls short of that ideal.  So, while I used to resent those who act horribly or choose to distract themselves and ignore, I now simply lament the state of things.  




 I used to say even worse stuff, I'd off handedly mention killing myself without realizing that saying something like that is inappropriate. I find that trying to keep a positive frame of mind in general has helped, I don't say stuff like that anymore.  




 I'm 20 so I've spent some time in university, but all of my professors knew my name in classes of 50-200. In highschool a lot of my classes like Literature, History and Religion were more or less dialogues between me and the teacher. 




 When I was ten I read the lord of the rings to myself and understood it. I can remember being in grade 6 and reading 1984 by george orwell because I was done all my work. My teacher "made an example of me" and sent me to the principal's office where I then told them I had been sent there for reading in class. I spent the rest of the class happily reading in the comfy chairs at the principal's office. I remember trying to explain the roman senate to a bunch of eleven year olds in a social studies class. 

In my highschool years I basically had free roam to come and go as I pleased because most of the teachers knew it was a waste of time for me to actually attend class. I had a real problem with accidentally talking down to people which obviously didn't gain me any friends. 




 I just don't think that society has the infrastructure to tend to the needs of people with exceptional intelligence. People with higher intellects are usually more emotionally sensitive as well. So when an intelligent child, teenager or young adult experiences the turmoil that comes along with a generally uncaring world they have nothing to truly help or steady them. 
























 I had more or less the same thing happen to my relationship with my ex. She actually did end up leaving me for someone else and now I have lost my best friend. 

OP I would caution against it based on my personal experience. I'm sure that it could work out for you but for me it ended really badly and led to a lot of resentment. She just could never truly see me as more than a friend and I spent the last half of the relationship feeling like a place holder. All the best, good luck. 




 thanks, I was feeling a little of it today, but not as much by any means. I just felt really out of sorts last night and was irritable and scared so I went to the hospital. I probably wasted their time, but I was feeling pretty bad last night. 




 Right on thanks for sharing. I know personally that I have a lot of the symptoms of a person suffering from bipolar disorder, but like you they seem to think my agitation states are anxiety based. I'm having a bit of a hard time taking their word for it because they even admit there is a similarity. My pdoc has also told me that I'm probably Obsessive only OCD. 




 Do you mind if I ask what your diagnosis is? do you just have depression? I'm sort of afraid that my reaction might be a result of something worse. 




 I started the abilify about a month ago at 2 mg, but they bumped me up to a couple of weeks ago. Since then I experienced exactly what you did, feeling like the bones in my legs were trying to escape or that my skin was crawling. I couldn't sit down because my legs were jittery. I have an appointment with my Pdoc on thursday, but I'm not taking any more ability till then. I didn't take it after getting back from the hospital last night and I've had no restlessness or irritability. 




 Went to the hospital last night because I was having a severe panic attack and couldn't stop my legs from moving. I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and have been prescribed 5mg of abilify and 45 mg of mirtazapine for anxiety and depression. For the last few days I haven't been able to get my legs to stop moving and have been having terrible anxiety that's keeping me awake. You know the kind where it's everything stupid you've ever done all at once. Anyway I had a panic attack and drove myself to the hospital because I felt very out of sorts. They prescribed me seroquel on top of what I'm already dealing with so that I could get to sleep. I was just wondering if there are other people here who have experience using anti-psychotics to fight depression and anxiety. Do my doctors think I have something worse and are just not telling me yet? Do you have any experience with abilify or seroquel? 




 Yup, that's what it's like exactly. I felt like I no master what me and everyone else did it was all trivial 




 Hi /r/depression. I've found during my battles with depression that I tend to devalue everything around me in an effort to manage my negative emotions. I criticize family, friends, my own interests, basically everything in an effort to bring things down to my level (not on purpose but it still happens.) Have any of you experienced this? I think it's a kind of anhedonia where I not only don't find pleasure in things but I have to devalue them as well. Sort of like there must be a reason I don't get pleasure from those things or people anymore. If any of you share this kind of behaviour I'd love to hear from you. Thanks. 




 my bad, was meant for /r/depression  thanks
 




 Hi /r/depression so here's my story. Me and my ex girlfriend broke up last may, it was a bad split she started dating again very soon afterward. I was dealing with a serious episode of depression that I'm still fighting and was made worse by the breakup. Towards the end of the relationship there were a some bad fights, suffice it to say my depression had a lot to do with why we weren't working. 

Since then I've moved back home with my parents so I can get my head on straight. After months of not talking to each other me and my ex are working on our friendship again and seeing where that goes. She brought up if I was seeing anybody else and I told her I wasn't, that I needed to get my head on straight first. I also told her that I might be moving back to the same city as her and she seemed excited by that news. 

The conversation really got me thinking, will I ever be okay enough to really be in a relationship with someone else? I feel like my partner consumes me and I become a codependant mess. I didn't even know who I was after me and my ex split we'd been together so long. 

It really scares me, I have bad anxiety too and I can't stop thinking of everything I've ever done wrong, even going back to kindergarden, my memory is a real curse. I want to be able to be there for someone else and have a real relationship someday, but I'm afraid I'll just fall apart again and won't know it until it's too late. 

What am I supposed to do? I lost my perfect girl to this disease I'm fighting, I don't know what to say to people when they ask how I'm doing, I feel cloudy all the time because of the medication I'm on. 

I suffered from depression and anxiety as a child and through my teenage years, there may have been one year in the last 10 that I haven't felt depressed (basically 10 onward I've been struggling) I don't know what normal feels like, am I so broken? I just don't know what to do or say anymore. 

I wish I could fix things with my ex, but I need to fix me first, and I don't know how long that'll take. I wish I could go back to school but I'm afraid the stress might kill me. I don't know it's all too much.

If any of you have been in a similar circumstance please lend some advice, I'm so far up a creek without a paddle I'm pretty much looking at the ocean.  




 wasn't indoors, was next to the garage. still bad. 




 I have depression and have been thinking about everything I've ever done wrong so here is the whole god damn fucking list of things I can't get out of my head.

Number 1. 
- When I was younger I was really really insecure and wanted to impress other kids, especially moving to a new town and not knowing many people. I never hit anyone but I did get in a few scuffles with kids who didn't deserve it because other kids were egging me on. Man I felt so bad, because I know what it's like to get picked on. FUCK. I'm sorry. 13 years old

Number 2. Told off some kids at soccer practice because they were being jerks about another kids accent. I was super mean and one of them started crying. Their parents heard me.  8 years old

 
Number 3. Made fun of a handicap kid once because he was acting out and making a scene. His sister heard what I said and started crying. FUCK FUCK FUCK. I'm sorry. 11 years old

Number 4. Once I went on a trip to Europe but our plane got delayed for stupid reasons so I missed a day on the trip and I got pissed at the lady at the airport who seriously couldn't have done anything about it. Didn't make a bit of a scene. FUCK. 16 years old.

Number 5. Trying to impress people, I cheated in my fourth grade chess tournament. Everyone knew I did too. Still lost. 10 years old.

Number 6. Made fun of a kid in front of his mom (who was a substitute teacher) she made me explain why I did that to her. Didn't know she was in ear shot. FUCK.

Number 7. Had a stupid obsession crush on a girl when I was fourteen. When she went to the dance with another guy after turning down my invitation I cried in the bathroom. damn it.

Number 8. Moved again, trying to impress people. Told a bunch of lies which include. Saying I had a friend who committed suicide. Saying I had friends who did all kinds of drugs before moving. I'm such an idiot. fourteen years old.

Number 9. Lit a copy of "The Pearl" by john Steinbeck on fire (with gasoline) for being too straight forward with it's meaning and just a miserable book. Almost burned down my parent's garage. 16 years old.

Number 10. While drunk described to my ex girlfriend's mom how I would have liked to beat up my ex's childhood friend for being such an ass on the school trip to Europe (It was holocaust tour he was an ass). Made a horrible impression. 17 years old.

Number 11. Spent a summer at my Aunt's place was a moody angry teenager the whole time. Watched porn on the family computer, which they all completely knew about. Lied about where I was going sometimes. 15 years old.  Damn it.

Number 12. When george bush visited my state I was in class and watching it on tv, when the motorcade went by the cameras I said "common snipers!" teacher screamed at me. I was a very opinionated 12 year old. I got sent to the principle's office. 12 years old

Number 13. Got drunk and chased my friends around, got sick and made a scene. 16 years old.

Number 14. Lied about going to a concert, when asked about specifics by someone who went I lied and they called me out on not going. So fucking awful. 19 years old.

Anyway that's all I've got for now FUCK. 




 yeah I'm on medication now, and I've been feeling much better. I've also been exercising and doing mindfulness meditation so I can be very aware of how I'm feeling. 




 I guess I'm really trying to figure out which part of the anger was "me" and which part was caused by the depression. It was very out of character for me to act in that way. I accept that I'm always responsible. I guess I'm more interested in cause and identity. 




 I was hesitant starting off, but I'm feeling a lot better about it. My thoughts are clearer, I'm sleeping better, I have an appetite again, I'm not being overly irritated or angry at my loved ones and I haven't experienced any side effects that I've noticed. So it feels great to not be as angry, I feel like I'm getting back to my old self. The therapy is helping a lot too, but I'm functioning now in the meantime.  




 yeah I'm in therapy and on medication. Since I've been on medication I've been very collected and haven't gotten angry whatsoever. Everyone says that it's so out of character for me. 




 because I feel guilty and embarrassed. I know I'm responsible, but more is it objectively a result of the depression. I was never like this when not depressed. I guess I'm just trying to figure out where that behaviour came from and to hear other people's experience with it. 




 You're entirely right. 




 I've had a few anger/rage episodes which both my psychologist and psychiatrist have said are a result of my depression. I've lashed out at some people close to me and I feel a great amount of guilt about what happened. I know it's not an excuse for my actions by any means, but how responsible do you think we are for anger as a result of our depression. Is it really "us" or is it the depression? 




 Seriously, depression can cause this, my depression caused me to be a complete asshole for almost an entire year to my now ex-gf. I honestly didn't know what I was dealing with, I was too busy/stressed to care. I didn't take care of myself, was agressive, and generally frustrated/pissed off. Seriously talk to him about this, I know for me a lot of my anger was a kind of call for help. Don't jump to conclusions, but sit down and talk to him about it. Seeing a counsellor would probably help the situation either way. 




 Hey man, we've got similar stories. My depression and the anger it caused definitely led to the end of my relationship with my girlfriend. I had a whole week were I basically fell of the face of the earth after we had some fights. It's a rough road man, I wish my girlfriend had come back, but at the same time I don't think I'm in any state to date right now. 




 I feel like I'm a different species all the time. The only way I can function is by putting up a front, it's pretty miserable. 




 I'm dealing with pretty bad depression, that for the most part stems from those kind of reactions. I always think of all the stupid things I've done and it just brings me down.
 




 Yea, I'm much more reeled in than I was at a young age. Unless I've been drinking, but I think that's just because it takes my anxiety away. 




 yup that's it exactly, I would be really hesitant to meet anybody but as soon as that passed I'd be overly friendly and energetic. Usually resulting in being called weird or annoying. 




 Has your anxiety ever caused you to act out? I can remember from a very young age always trying to impress other people because I felt a huge amount of anxiety regarding "fitting in." I'd do stuff just a little bit over the top so that people would recognize me, or I'd inflate stories in an attempt to get people to like me. All of my acting out of course led only to more anxiety. 




 It feels like a weight pushing down on me just enough to make me hate everything. It makes my thoughts loud, cold, and for the most part logical. I don't cry, it's just numbness, it feels like pressure. You know that feeling you get when you know you've hurt yourself badly like a deep cut or really bad bruise and it's so bad you can't even feel it, well it's like that all the time. Sometimes I get sick of feeling like this, I can only take stuffing it down so long, I used to get angry quite a lot, not these days but I used to. It was just a horrible alternative to feeling nothing. 




 I have a very hard time relating to people my own age, it's pretty miserable. I can remember being 10 and the only people who I really enjoyed talking to were my teachers. It's still sort of that way, I've been asked to have coffee and chat by a few of my professors because they don't feel I'm operating at an undergraduate level. I can't really relate to the whole "college life" experience or people my own age because I feel like  I've already moved passed that part of my life.

I'd probably trade the intelligence and wisdom/hyper-awareness for better sociability and happiness. I'm not sure that I can have both intelligence and happiness, I just wish I got along better with people. 




 Classical piano for 15 years. I need music as a stress relief and have realized that it has to remain that way for me. I tried some university education with music and although I did very well my perfectionism ruined it for me and I couldn't listen to music for almost a year afterwards.  




 I was going to say "My body is a cage" but it was already posted. "If I Ever Feel Better" by Phoenix is pretty accurate.  
























 I can understand why someone would be hesitant. I was always very against taking medication personally but I hit a very rough patch this summer and saw how horrible I'd been acting. At that point I was willing to admit that some medication would help me. 




 all of my mental illness has come from times where I was alone. I've had deep existential self loathing from times where I been more or less isolated. I don't think I like myself very much and it can be very frightening.  




 It's awful, it gives you hope, but you know what's happening and you don't want to be alone.  




 I was to put it lightly a jerk to everyone I know. I was condescending, cynical and sometimes belittling. I've worked on it a lot I lost a lot of good people in the mean time. I've found the medication that I've been taking takes the edge off of my "chip on the shoulder" attitude. 




 I think we both "liked" each other for a long time before we actually started dating. We were best friends because we were both sort of a little outcast from everyone else in highschool. We were both art types so we got along really well.  I asked her out at the end of grade 11 and she said no, so I went on and met some other girls had a really fun summer, I come back the following fall and she hijacks me in her car and basically tells me that we're dating "before any other girl snatches me up." We lost our virginities to each other and I seriously doubt I could find another girl like her.

We dated for two and half years, she was someone who I felt like I could be in my own skin around. We went to school in the same city and spent almost all of our time together. Then my depression and anxiety started, I ended up taking it out on her (jealousy, anger, general insecurity) which wasn't fair and she deserved so much better. It's difficult to show love and trust to someone when you don't love and trust yourself.

She fell in love with someone else and now they're dating. I'm still pretty wrecked up about it, and the worst part is knowing that it's all my fault. I moved home because I need to get my head sorted so we don't live in the same city anymore. We still talk every few weeks over skype, but I feel incredibly insincere and guilty. I miss her every day. 
 




 I spent about a year on a high horse because I started using biting ice cold rational to criticize basically the way most people go on with their lives. We entertain and distract ourselves to death and I refused to participate for almost a year. I tried to better myself because the only other course of action was passivity. My rationale was supported by a lot of academic research and personal experience. Having this depressing hypercritical worldview did make me quite the elitist because no one else would bother to do the research and work that I'd done to achieve what appears to be so evident.

I'm not sure what to make of my ideas anymore, they seem true and seem like the right course of action, but they isolated me from all my friends and loved ones. I've now decided to tone myself down so that maybe I can be happy again someday. 




 Pushed everyone away and definitely not for their own benefit. I thought that everyone didn't want or need me. My ex left me ( she'd been my best friend for several years) and I've now moved across the country to mostly isolate myself. I'm starting to make friends here now but I've had months alone. 




 I'd definitely participate. This sounds like a great idea. 




 Me and my ex broke up in May of this year. We'd been dating for 2.5 years and had been friends for 5. We were each others first relationship. It was a bad split, I was dealing with depression, we weren't communicating well, I took my depression out on her and said/did somethings that were highly inappropriate, I'm pretty sure we were both feeling trapped. 

She broke up with me and I really tried to keep a persona of being cool and alright with the breakup, that I was doing alright and moving on. The truth was that I hadn't been sleeping or eating and that I started seeing a therapist to get my depression under control. My ex started dating someone else a few weeks of us splitting up (I'd had my suspicions about this guy before we split up) 

Over the summer I did the shitty ex thing and sent her an angry letter telling her she was selfish and that she never cared about me in the first place. This came from a very unhealthy place and I regret sending it a lot. I was really miserable. Anyway, I decided I wasn't going back to university in the same city as her and that I was going to take the year off to pull myself back together. 

When she heard from friends that I wasn't doing well she called me and asked me point blank if I was alright. I told her straight up that I wasn't, that I'd been dealing with a lot of guilt about how I'd treated her in the last few months of our relationship and how wrong headed I'd been. I told her that I'd been dealing with depression and that I hoped it helped to explain some of my behaviour. 

Since then she contacts me fairly often and we have long conversations like the kind we had when we were together. I also find it odd that she regularly calls me on a Friday or Saturday night and talks with me for a whole evening. A few weeks ago she texted me 4 times and then finally called me because she wanted to send me a christmas card.

There were problems in our relationship, there were things that I wasn't happy with and obviously there were things that she wasn't happy with, but I feel that our relationship fell apart as a mix of hitting a 2 year down point and my depression. This time last year we were talking about moving in together. I think a lot of what happened was us failing to take our relationship to the next level. There were times where I was almost ready to break it off with her too.

We still talk, I don't know whether she's still dating that other guy, I don't think it's appropriate for me to ask. I'm doing my best to step away from the effects of the breakup, I've made new friends in the city where I'm living now, I've gone on dates, I've been seeing my therapist and have been making progress with fighting my depression.

I need to work on myself, I need to meet new people, date new people, I need to drive back my depression. But, at the same time, I'd be lying if I said that I don't have any sort of small idea that me and her might try again some time, when we're both at better more mature places in our lives.
 
The only thing is I can't be sure that she isn't just contacting me out of pity. Would you keep in contact with someone just because  She seems to be fairly genuine about things as they are. I guess I'm just looking for a bit of input on why you think someone would stay in contact with their ex the way she seems fairly adamantly trying to stay in contact with me. 

TL;DR: Had a bad split with first girlfriend, she left me and started dating fairly soon afterwards. Months later we are trying to stay friends and she is definitely making an effort to keep me fairly close. Why do you think that is?
 




 You need to get somewhere safe and away from him. I'm sorry, I'm sure you love him on his fair weather days, but what he is doing is not okay whatsoever. For your own well being. 




 I do it all the time, in fact, I'd go as far to say I've created a charming, funny and extroverted character that I use as a buffer between myself and the outside world. I smile, I joke, I flirt, I wouldn't say it's manic like in bipolar disorder, but it's a falsity that I use to protect myself.

At work today a customer told me that I do such a good job making people happy, that I'm a positive for everyone that comes into the cafe I work at. I spent most of my day fantasizing about killing myself. 

Sorry, this probably hasn't been helpful at all. 




 Yeah, that's unacceptable behaviour on his part, make it clear to him that if this doesn't improve than you're gone. Accusing you of cheating without the smallest piece of evidence is ridiculous and dramatic and you should tell him that. 




 Yeah.. I think relationships are a little more complicated than you make them out to be. Not to say that his behaviour is acceptable, it isn't, but I think you're stretching a little bit.

 Should she be careful incase his behaviour doesn't improve. yes. Is it helpful to tell her that this guy *will* destroy her life, probably not. 




 I will agree with other posters that your boyfriend's behaviour is unacceptably invasive, but at the same time I do, as a man, sympathize with that kind of insecurity. I'm of the school of thought that most single males have less than platonic goals if they start showing interest in a girl who is in a relationship. It's an easy assumption and more often than not it's right. 

All that being said you're boyfriend is obviously not just being the normal level of defensive, he's taking it way too far. You shouldn't have to show him all the past of your electronic communication if you don't want to, that's a boundary that you've set.  I'm not usually one to dish out the "break up" advice which is often given ad nauseum on this subreddt, but if your boyfriend doesn't seriously take your feelings on this into consideration and continues to freak out, I don't think you'll have many more directions to take. If you've communicated your issue with his behaviour to him, and he hasn't tried to compromise to achieve a healthy middle ground than it's probably time to move on.

This is coming from someone who's ex-girlfriend actually left me for a "guy friend" so I hope that I'm a tempered response.  




 Seriously, you're both wrong, you pushed him, he hit you in the leg. Learn to not fight like children or don't be in a relationship, simple.  




 People with depression, particularly males, often do exhibit increased aggression or irritability. If OP's bf is depressed his behaviour isn't entirely out of place. 




 I have isolated myself. I've moved across the country to live with my parents in a city I don't know. I am alone, the only people I talk to on a semiregular basis are people from work and my exgirlfriend. She left me for someone else, I was a shitty boyfriend, I was desperate and afraid. I've told her about my depression, and how I wish I'd known I was depressed at the time. I wish I could talk to her more often, or open up and be candid with her, I really miss her. I know I won't find someone as unique and special as her. I feel cold and alone. I imagine this is a similar feeling to being caught in the wilderness, knowing you're going to freeze to death, but having no way of stopping it. I've tried so hard to get out of this, I've been exercising, writing, seeing a therapist, taking medication, I just can't make it stop. No one values me, I think my ex only talks to me out of pity, I'm unneeded, replaceable, and unhappy.   




 I miss you, there isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about you. After all of these months of putting together the pieces, like an expert piecing back together a plane after a horrible crash, I finally have a good picture and can say that this was all my fault. If I could see you now I'd hug you and tell you how sorry I am, and that I don't really know what to do or who I am right now but I'm trying anyway. I never imagined that we'd end up this way, or that I'd be where I am right now. I know you've found love with someone else and all I can think is how much you deserve someone who's better than me. How were you ever supposed to love me when I can't love myself?, when deep down I'm so fundamentally twisted up inside. You have a good heart to have ever been able to love someone like me. You probably don't think too kindly of me these days, the only person to blame for that is me. 

These days I don't know if I'll ever be able to stand on my own two feet again. We talk now and then, but I don't know if I've let on how beaten out of the race I really am. So many "what ifs" run through my brain everyday; "What if I hadn't gotten sick?" "What if I'd been more patient" "What if I wasn't scared." We both wish I could just leave it in the past and move forward, but I just can't. I'm too afraid.

I miss coming home to you, I miss watching movies, just talking in the shower and going for walks through the nice end of town. I miss how we'd snuggle close to each other before falling asleep, how your legs and arms would get cold so you'd curl around me. I miss when it was just me and you under blankets in the backs of cars and listening to songs from the 80's. I miss you calling me late at night to ask if I wanted to go smoke cigars in the rain and then waiting for me to kiss you. 

All of that seems so far away now, like a dream, like something that never happened. I've lost you, you're so far away now, and I'm so afraid that I'm losing myself too. All I feel is guilt, anger and remorse, it's only fitting that I'm the source of my own misery. I'm cold, bitter, and a worse man than I was before, maybe I've always been worse. I really hope you find real happiness, and no matter what happens to me, if I don't pull myself back, and can never stand by on my own again, it's not because of you.



 




 Yeah with pop music (rock, trance, top 40, any of that stuff) they'd be somewhere between bored and revolted. 




 I've started smoking over the past year because, A) I really like the flavour, it's relaxing and lets me think alone and B) I know that it might possibly kill me one of these days. I've never self harmed, but this is a much more passive way of doing so I suppose and that seems to suit me. 




 I'm actually a he, and was dating a she. I was feeling very well at the time, I was beginning my last year of high school felt like I finally had something to look forward to. She was my best friend and I'd started to have feelings for her. We were together for two years, I became depressed during my first year of university, started hating myself, didn't treat her as well as I should have, this was before I was diagnosed. She broke up with me, and with good reason. I've since started getting help and am trying to do better, but I'm in no condition to be in a relationship with anybody. 




 Sounds a lot like depression to me. I've been diagnosed and can really relate to the completely not feeling anything, as well as the rare anger episode. For me, the anger feels like something other than the nothingness so it's difficult to control when it does happen. If you're feeling this way please go talk to someone and find some help. 




 Well from my own personal experience I was experiencing a brief period off feeling normal when I started a relationship with my now ex. I had my most severe episode of depression and was entirely undiagnosed. It really did screw up my relationship, I've done so many things that I regret. I don't know how I'd even go about starting a relationship now.  




 I ended up resenting my ex like crazy, which was a painful situation in and of itself, while we were dating. Coincidentally, she was really pushing for us to move in together earlier this year, but I said it wasn't a good time for multiple reasons. I'm glad that I didn't have to struggle through a living situation as well, just the emotional turmoil. I hope things work out for you. 




 I was just on the receiving end of this with my ex. She wasted my time for 2 years when I could have been meeting new girls and having fun in college. She led me on for a very, very long time and then ended up leaving me high and dry when someone else came along. You want to fuck someone up badly, do that. Please by all means break up with him, just don't be surprised if he never talks to you again. 




 I think death by spiders is fairly high up there on the list of ways I don't want to die. 




 Yeah, I find when I'm low I usually get pretty paranoid, especially about spiders. I actually slept with the light on for a few months because I was terrified there would be a spider somewhere near me. I've always had trouble with paranoia and falling asleep though, I'm a 20 years old and more or less scared of the dark, when I'm depressed anyway. 




 It's strange actually, me and my psychologist have both brought it that I probably don't know how to conduct myself in a normal way. I'm dysfunctional even when I am feeling alright because I don't know how to manage not feeling horrible. I've lived with depression so long that if I ever want to be healthy I have to learn how to conduct myself when I'm not feeling that way. 




 Yeah, that'd get you started. I really don't have any answers for you, all I can say is don't be too hard on yourself, don't let it consume you, realize that even if there is no grand scheme objective meaning that you can still apply meaning to things and people. Hopefully you come out of your crisis on the other end a more complete and aware person. 

The best advice I can give is to be aware of your limitations and realize the potential you have. As a human you are limited and it's a difficult thing to accept. Best of luck. 




 Well it'd probably help if you describe your existential crisis a little more. I mean, what started it? have you been reading philosophy/literature? 

 I don't think it's something everyone goes through, I think it requires a certain level of introspection that a lot of people lack. There is a difference between that phase where you're trying to figure out what you want to do for a career and an existential crisis. 

I will say that if you're having a full blown existential crisis then you probably won't find a solid answer to your questions. What you will find is a cornucopia of different thoughts and ways of conducting a life. Take what you find enriching and leave the rest 
























 I'm sure I've hid behind my intelligence in the past, but don't think I'd go so far as to say I use arrogance as a coping mechanism. I always figured I was probably pretty bright, but in the past 3 years I've had both psychologists and professors (several of each) tell me that I fit the bill of someone with a gifted level of intelligence. I can make small talk but I'd prefer to have a discussion. I don't assume that others are stupid or boring and am usually up for talking to just about anybody. That being said, I don't think its a stretch to think that a lot of people's interactions are pretty superficial.

I can also say that I really don't think most of the things you mentioned bother me, I'm comfortable in a crowd (I never have to withdraw or become overwhelmed) don't have any problems with loud noises or bright lights, Sometimes interruptions and disappointment can irritate me, but that's rarely and usually when I'm tired, hungry, or something else is impairing my judgement. 




 Hi /r/aspergers lately I've been going through a bout of depression and have been seeing a therapist. A few weeks ago I mentioned that I think I might have aspergers and he agreed that I do have "some" traits. The thing is there are a lot of things that seem so fundamental to the diagnosis that I don't seem to have. For example, I've never been over stimulated by sound, crowds, bright light, I have above average emotional recognition ( had this tested), I don't have any particular order of doing things and am very flexible as far as my daily routine is concerned, I'm not usually clumsy and apart from when I was growing never had any trouble, I don't speak in a monotone ( though I do sometimes raise my voice when excited), and I've been told that I have a very expressive face, people can read how I'm feeling easily.

At the same time, I've always had problems with social interaction. Extended eye contact feels intense and uncomfortable, I've always had a large vocabulary and constantly have to "dumb it down" for small talk, if I don't I sound pretentious. Sometimes a conversation will catch me off guard and I'll stumble over my thoughts (probably the worst part.) I also feel much more comfortable talking about weighty topics like literature, art, music, philosophy, history, politics, and science then I do talking about people and what I did on the weekend. I have an awful knack for steering conversations in the direction of these topics and can sometimes be pretty argumentative. I haven't had myself tested but my therapist and psychiatrist both agree that I probably have an IQ considerably above average. When I was younger I had a very hard time getting along with other kids because I didn't want to talk about sports and games I wanted to talk about big concept stuff. In addition I sometimes smile when people are crying around me, I'm good at comforting people but I have an instant smile response that I've never understood.

I think the thing that is probably most in line with the aspergers diagnosis is my obsessive compulsive tendencies. I'll get obsessed for a period of time about some concept or another and be stuck on it. These obsessions can cause me a lot of pain and when they were really bad would take over my life. Mostly they involve obsessing over philosophy and the meaning of my life. I have a few other past obsessions as well, for example I know a lot about Star Wars and its extended universe from when I was a kid/ teenager, probably more then anyone else I know. I'm not so interested in it now but I was when I was younger. When I was younger I had a huge interest in history and could describe a rough timeline of colonial north america, the world wars, and the rise and fall of the soviet union by the time I was 12. When I'm drunk or really tired I sometimes make irrelevant, or comments which the people around me might not understand referring to the knowledge I have about world affairs, philosophy, art, literature, etc.

I have had episodes of frustration and anxiety in the past, but this could have just as easily been a symptom of depression as aspergers. These episodes of frustration haven't gone a way particularly but often were the result of disappointment or (when I was younger) social rejection. 

Anyway if you've read this far, let me know what you think. 




 Yeah I know, overall it was probably a positive that they know how I'm doing now and that there are other people in their lives dealing with the same problems. That being said, I feel like I need to learn to hold back a little bit, I don't like getting into the habit of having these sorts of conversations because they tend to get put off most people. I find I'm only really like this with people like my parents and my close friends but I've had people distance themselves from me after these kind of conversations in the past. 




 I used to open up to people who I probably shouldn't have but have since gotten a lot better. I think I still have trouble letting conversations sort of get away from me, where I'm talking about subjects that might not be appropriate in a given situation. I'm especially cautious of the relationship between me and my close friends just becoming a commiseration group, or that I'll say too much and not realize it. 




 Recently I spent a week living with some close friends and am having a lot of trouble with how I acted while with them. It wasn't very long into the visit that me and my two close friends started talking about the very personal stuff that's happening in our lives. I'm suffering from depression, and during a conversation that my friend brought up I told them that I'd been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. They then told me that they were dealing with similar issues and were seeking help. The thing is, that this was more or less our conversation topic for the remainder of the week while I was there. I feel like I was a little too open with my friends and that I may have said too much. I mean we had a full blown conversation about suicide while out at a bar (while pretty drunk) and I don't know what to feel about that. 




 I feel like every time I'm out with people I end up being too jokey, or too loud, or too eager to keep the conversation going. I don't know how this happens, but it always seems as though I'm joking around or participating more actively in conversation than those around me, silence amongst a big group just freaks me out a little so I feel like I almost need a to keep a running commentary going (not quite but sort of). How do I change my conversation style so that it encourages others to keep conversations going or joke around. How do I check myself when I'm running the conversation a bit too much? 




 Yes exactly, "Oh why did you tell your friends what happened?" maybe because you did the worst thing you could possibly have done to me and you deserve to be chastised by people who used to care about you. If you cheat on somebody you're a traitor and that's the worst there is regardless of gender. 




 Honestly, fresh wounds burn deep. Of course you aren't over the breakup if it happened the other day or the other week or what have you; a few years and then yeah you're dealing with some issues, but being bitter in the short term after a breakup is obvious. 




 I'll put on my nerd cap for a moment and user a tolkien analogy. After frodo spent so much time with the ring and after being stabbed by an evil blade he recovered but every year he'd become I'll and melancholy afterward. Some things never heal all the way. 

I feel that for those if us who get better from depression the wound heals but there'll always be a scar. We'll always remember what it was like to be depressed, so it never totally leaves us.

Just my take 




 She's the only complaint I've had. 




 yeah, at least I can be confident about that (she isn't the only one who's told me this)

edit: I've had others make a comment about size, not complaints.  




 Let me count the list of things my ex said to me in a single breakup conversation.

- I only stayed with you because I was afraid of being alone.

- There's someone else, I cheated on you.

- I don't think I've ever been attracted to you.

- My parents think you're lazy and don't think you're good enough (translate: I think you're lazy and aren't good enough) 

- Sex with you always hurt, sex with other guy doesn't

- I don't know why you're so beaten up, I'm not going to lose any sleep over this.

- You were my best friend


Great things to hear from the closest person in your life especially when dealing with depression.  




 Oh, this one I know. 




 In my personal experience, I had huge level of existential anxiety before my current depression. I'd say that I went through an "existential crisis" that was on and off for about half a year, the depression really started when I began applying it to my life. 

All that being said, I'm sure that it can happen the other way too.  




 For the past few weeks I've been feeling better about myself, I was starting to feel I might actually have some worth or someway out of feeling horrible. Then this week was my ex girlfriend's birthday. She left me for a tall, handsome, talented, socially comptant engineer. All I've been thinking about is how unappealing I am, every horrible thing that I can think of about me. I'm short, scrawny, have acne, am socially awkward, insecure, argumentative, anxious, needy and boring. I basically have every unattractive characteristic there is. 
       I screwed up everything to the point where she was the only thing making me happy anymore. Things were looking good at the beginning of last year, then I went and messed everything up. We were even planning to move in together sometime this year, now I'm more alone then I've ever been.

I though I was feeling better, I thought i was moving past this and putting that relationship to rest. That's obviously not the case. 




 I have an awful time carrying on conversations via text messaging. If I'm not planning on meeting up with someone the whole conversation usually just goes absolutely nowhere. I find it limiting and almost impossible to have a decent conversation over any kind of instant messaging. Its seems to me that other INFJs might have similar difficulties and am curious what you have to say. 




 My depression fluctuates between insomnia and fatigue. At the moment I'm experiencing quite a bit of fatigue, sometimes I don't even notice how exhausted I am, but I can fall asleep at almost anytime and anywhere, it's not really helpful while in school. 




 I haven't written a poem or piece of prose in weeks, I keep meaning to perform at my local poetry nights, but I just don't have anything coming to me. Not to mention I haven't touched my sketch books in almost  a month. So yes It makes me feel creatively suffocated.
 




 I think I'd have liked to have been born in the late 19th century/ early 20tu and have been living my prime in the 1920's.  




 Sorry didn't mean to imply that this doesn't happen for women also, just from what I've read that behaviour appears more often in men. 




 I like it for the first few drinks, but after 3 or 4 drinks I'm all filters off and usually get a little ranty; not about anything in particular but I do sort of go off on tangents. In the morning I usually feel a little embarrassed about some of the stuff I talked about, I don't like letting those filters down. 




 Everything I've read on the subject has said this. It's not every male. if you'd like to show me otherwise please do. 




 Yeah I think it's one of the biggest things that should be discussed in the depression community. I walked around j for months absolutely frustrated and resentful, then had a month or two with a very bad temper.  It's definitely a bit of a different beast and I think it would help a lot of guys dealing with depression to know that male depression can differ from female depression pretty drastically. Males are far more likely to become consumed in work/school and try to distract themselves by running themselves ragged. Males are also much more likely to channel their depression into anger than necessarily despair. 




 Have to say I think this is one of the biggest misconceptions of depression. Depression, as depicted in the media is much more similar to the symptoms of female depression, male depression can be quite a bit different. 




 Every time someone writes a comment like this I feel that it's more about the commenter than the O.P.. Don't get me wrong, I see where you are coming from, but the way you worded your response seems very personal.. 




 I've been trying to surround myself with down to earth, well grounded people. I've been trying my best not to distract myself all the time, but escapism does offer itself easily as a way to distract me from anxiety/depression. I will out right admit that these thoughts consume me the most when I'm alone, especially when I don't have a lot of people around (I.E. friends go home from college.) My mind just tends to wander in this direction every time.

I have to disagree that the answer is simply "doing things" when nearly everyone around me is steeped in things that make my perceptions painfully evident. I've considered the possibility that I may have arbitrarily skewed the framework of my perception to fit anxieties that I'm having, but most evidence would suggest otherwise.

I interact with very few people on the internet so I think your comments on meeting people here are a little misplaced. Though, I have been working on meeting new people who do not share my hangups and it seems to be helping my situation to a degree.

Thanks for the reply. 




 I feel like "drinking the kool aid" is what it's going to have to come down to , either that or become a complete pariah. I just find that this conclusion doesn't completely satisfy me and its depressing that the way I perceive things will only cause me pain. 
      What you described, the whole investigation into semiotics and postmodernism, is almost exactly what I was getting at. To sort of paraphrase Nietzsche I feel like I'm wrestling with monsters. I don't fault people around me for not choosing to do the same. In fact I feel that this problem is the root of my depression, even though it is probably one of those questions that does not have an answer. 




 I've been having severe anxiety about my life for the past 2 years. Basically along the lines of how I conduct myself, how I spend my time, wether I'm living a life that is worthwhile and productive. Sometimes in the last 2 years it's been to the point that I wasn't going outside much and spent a lot of time reading.

My biggest issue was that I was having a great deal of anxiety regarding the media and how it affects people. After reading books like 1984, and to a greater extent Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, I became really fixated on how the media I consume affects my mind. I know this sounds paranoid, believe me many times I've felt I was losing my mind with how anxious I was, but many, many very well respected and intelligent people have written about exactly what I'm talking about. People have written whole books in fact

ex: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death]

I now get very anxious about what I read, watch, listen to, and generally participate in. I've become very aware of which popular news papers are directed at which audience and its not a very difficult thing to do. Writing style, content, advertisements are all indicative of the sort of people that the publication is being directed to.

In general I feel like I'm being shoehorned into a specific consumption and that my life is full of distraction. I feel as though me and everyone around me are being distracted which prevents us from reaching our full potential. 

I've tried so many times to get out of this thought loop but I fail every time. I can't stop feeling anxious about it, I'm so afraid that I've wasted my life and that I'll never reach my potential because I'll always be driven to distract myself. The worst part is that every person speak to about this, college professors, my therapist, all agree that my observations have a great deal of truth to them, so I can't be completely deluded.

I wish I could stop thinking about it but I can't, I wish I could go back to not thinking about what I consume and just live a life of ignorance. I don't know, does this sound as off the wall to you as it sometimes does to me? Is my anxiety founded or am I walking a thin line of falling into an even darker arena than anxiety? I don't know I just can't seem to escape these thoughts, they're so fundamental to my life and how I'm going to live. 




 Laying in my old car with my ex, in the middle of winter at night. We'd driven to an camp ground that was empty for the winter and were parked next to a lake surrounded by trees. We were just looking at the stars. I've never seen stars like that before. 

 




 despairing, angry, overly emotional. I was feeling fairly numb and I'd do anything to feel something so I acted fairly extreme, if I felt anger I just sort of went with it. The rest of the time I was just ice cold cynical and negative, about everything. I had some pretty serious anxiety and angst going on as well. 

Since I've been on the medication I've felt like I have more of a floor to stand on and that there's less chance the bottom will fall out of my life. I feel a little hesitant to say this but it might be that I have a little bit more hope these days. 
























 I like a lot of indie/alternative, and some electronic stuff. Some of my favorites are The Arcade Fire, Joy Division, Grizzly Bear, Radiohead, Purity Ring, and The National. 

As I've grown older I've fallin in love with classical music, especially Romantic and Impressionist composers. My favorite composer is Debussy. There's something that I've found in his music that I can't find anywhere else. 

[Debussy- Arabesque 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28Qi4jLtigc) 




 The other night I was out with some new people who'd I'd never gone out with before. They asked me a lot of questions , and I was a little caught off guard having to talk about myself so much. I'd been drinking quite a bit, and I know that didn't help, but I just couldn't find interesting things to say about myself. I pretty much just threw my hands up and said I'm boring. I'm taking a year off university and am living in a city I'm unfamiliar with. I don't know how to make that sound interesting. I wanted to get the spotlight and have them talk about themselves a little bit more. Talking about myself made me feel vulnerable, and I think I should come up with some prefabricated answers about myself to just spew out when people ask me. What's the best way to talk about yourself without sounding like a complete narcissist? 




 I've come to the point where I think I've realized how much self-consciousness is part of my character. I just can't help being and acting self-conscious all the time. I just went out with friends, and I'm thinking about how I drank too much, talked to too many people, and danced way crazier than everyone else. I'm trying to get myself to go out and meet people, realize that I'm going to make mistakes (sometimes overdo it) and then learn from it, but I just can't seem to pull myself out of my ingrained self-consciousness. Half the time when i joke around it's at my own expense and it's just frustrating to see myself do that again and again. I guess the only way to get over it is to keep going forward and learn from my mistakes, but I wish there was an easier way. 




  Thanks! It's been a little strange. I was having real problems with the sedative affect that Mirtazapine had, I always stuck in a brain fog, but now I'm feeling quick and judgemental. It's a funny combination of feelings; I guess I'll just have to wait to see how things balance out. 




 So I've got my prescription reduced from 45 mg every night to 15 mg. This is the third day on the lower dose, and I think I'm still adjusting because I've been in a funny mood. I've all the sudden become really judgemental, but unlike before I'm not teetering on despair. It's like being lucidly aware of being in a crappy mood, so I'm sort of laughing about it.  I'm being a bit more outwardly negative, but I only feel a little bit worse than I did before. I was wondering if any of you have experienced anything similar when switching doses. 




 I'm on 45mg of mirtazapine. It really helped me when I was at my lowest; it  gave me something solid to stand on and gave me the motivation to work on myself. Now that I'm doing much better I'm going to see about getting off of it. I think it's affecting my speech and ability to think clearly. Also, it will knock you out, and for me the sedative affect doesn't wear off for a few hours after I wake up. 




 It's actually what makes me doubt my psychologist. I get very emotionally invested in fiction.  I wouldn't say that I get 'attatched' but I feel what the characters do and enjoy that a lot.  




 I've got this story that I keep telling people, and I just wanted to run it by /r/socialskills to see whether or not you think this is one I should keep to myself. Everyone who has worked customer service has their own war stories to tell about the people who they've had to serve. I used to work at a video store that rented a lot of porn and I have lots of weird stories about the kinds of people that'd come in. I'm just wondering if those stories probably comes off as a bit creepy or as  funny anecdotes about working customer service. I told it to some people tonight, and it seemed to go over well, those stories might be off putting. Just looking for some input. 




 I'm on 45 mg of Remeron. I'll make sure to bring it up to my psychiatrist. 




 Anxiety is making me trip up every time I talk to someone. I often pause and get caught up midway through a sentence. It's making my social anxiety even worse than it already is, because it's usually better if I just don't say anything. I know what I'm trying to say, but when I'm trying to say it I usually stumble. When I stumble I usually defer to longer words and it just comes across very awkward. Now that I'm thinking about how I speak all the time it's just gotten worse. Do any of you have any advice for managing speaking anxiety while avoiding putting too much pressure on socializing? 









 I've started reading poetry aloud. It's really good practice.  




 I've always been really impressed by people who can express themselves without saying a lot. It seems to me that this is a really important social skill that would help make conversation more fluid and interesting. I tend to over think what I'm saying, and have noticed that I sometimes ramble and stumble over myself when I'm trying to convey an idea or opinion. Do any of you have any advice for speaking more efficiently? What are some ways to stop over thinking what you say while still being conscious about what you say and how you say it?  




 I often feel like it comes worst at times when it feels like it's appropriate to say something, but I just have nothing to say I have some idea of what I'm going to say, but by the time I get to actually saying it it comes out a mess. For example, I was trying to relay to my brother what I thought about a business idea he'd come up with and why his educational background gives him an advantage in the field he's hoping to go into, but it just came out a complete disaster and made the conversation awkward.  




 I used to monologue a lot, but I don't as much now. Even when I'm having a seemingly normal conversation with other people it seems like I get cut off a lot. I don't know whether it has to do with the rhythm of my speaking or if the people I spend time with are just rude.  




 I've noticed lately that I'm having trouble transferring thoughts and concepts into speech. Sometimes the words get confused and come out wrong, and other times it feels like I haven't fully put together an idea before I begin speaking. It often ends up sounding like I'm beating around an idea without actually saying anything. It's like I have it all sorted out in my head (generally), but when I actually go to tell other people about it it just comes out vague and sometimes nonsensical. It's made conversations more awkward, because sometimes I take a moment to recollect my thoughts, and other people think that that's an opportunity to cut in. This is incredibly frustrating, and I'm having a lot of anxiety about it.

 Have any of you experienced this? Is this an AS thing? 




 The other day a co-worker stopped me and asked if I was alright. I asked "why do I look upset?" She stopped for a second and said " It's just that when you're not serving customers your eyes look like you're on the verge of tears." I was caught off guard. I told her it was just the weather and that I hadn't been getting enough sleep, but for someone to read me like blew me away. 




 I'm not all together bad at talking to strangers when they are 100% strangers, but when it's someone who I have a social obligation to talk to because of the friends of friends thing I have problems. It doesn't seem like they take much interest in me either, so I'm always the one trying to find something to talk about. 

Sometimes I have trouble talking with strangers, but it's nothing compared to talking to acquaintances especially when the conversation is 1 on 1.  




 Man this is something I've always struggled with. How do you become friends with your friend's friends? I said goodbye to some friends' at the airport and was in a group with their friends. I'd met those people a few times before, but I never became "friends" with them. After we left the airport one of them said they could give me a ride home. That was the single most awkward moment of my life. I tried to make small talk and talk about our common friends, but i failed miserably, and that's why I'm asking this.  




 I've been taking my medication (45 mg of Remeron) since July, and for the most part it's been a great help. There are a few days every month where I don't feel quite like myself. I feel foggy, like my perception is clouded, and I'm pretty sure it's the medication. 

 I missed a dose of my medication last night (I got home really late and forgot about it), so this evening I've been feeling very irritable and self-conscious. My evening was spent complaining to my family and being really self-conscious about what I was saying. I was running a meta-conversation about how it's not normal for someone my age (21) to be candid about his problems. To say the least, missing my medication made me act oddly, and quickly caused my symptoms to come back.

Have any of you experienced a fast reemergence of symptoms after missing a dose of your medication? Is it normal to have such a strong reaction? 




 Major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety with obsessive traits. I have social anxiety sometimes. 




 I think that I like it in concept. There's something appealing about just having a one off encounter with someone, or just no-strings-attached sex. I've been in situations where I could have had casual sex a few times, but every time so far I've passed it up. There was a lot of social reasons I didn't have casual sex with the women I could have. I didn't affect other friendships or make things messy even in a no-strings-attached situation. 

I've always thought that it'd satisfy me in the short term but leave me feeling alone. Part of being an INFJ is sort of having an idealized view that's difficult to make real. I used to wish true love existed, but I don't think I can or want to anymore. I've tried to separate sex from affection, because it seems easier to cope with relationships that way. 




 Lately I've been trying hard to stop talking about myself unless someone asks. I've stopped giving my opinion or making statements and observations unless someone asks me directly. I've even stopped sharing relevant experiences I've had even when it wouldn't be entirely out of place. 

My conversations have improved and people seem to be responding to me better than ever before. The conclusion I've come to is that most people have no interest in what others have to say, most of the time, and to become a better conversationalist you have to say and ask really general things. Any kind of definitive statement, observation, or opinion slows down most conversations so I guess to be a better conversationalist it's best to avoid them.

Do you agree or disagree? I'd like to hear what people have to say.

 




 I'm like you, I can make easy banter with strangers almost no problem but friends/acquaintances/people I'd like to get to know I have more of a problem with. I think that the anonymity of talking to strangers takes off that social pressure edge and allows me to be a witty, flirty and overall charming person. When with friends on the other hand I feel like its some sort of serious balancing act. I'm always questioning how I should say things; is the conversation going to be idle chit chat or are we going to discuss our lives and feelings, what things should I keep to myself, should I ask some more personal questions? I feel like when I'm invested in another person I have this pressure to impress. 

I think trying to strike a balance between casual conversation with friends, and real deep meaningful conversation is really important and easier said than done. Personally I've had relationships turn to only deep conversation and each time I'd hang out with those people everything seemed really melancholy. I love engaging, in-depth conversations, but I've tried to limit how much I have them lately. They can always lead to someone getting offended or it becoming a bit of an argument if your not careful. If someone else initiates them I'll give take part, but I usually don't bring weighty stuff to the table anymore because it makes most people uncomfortable. 

Small talk isn't usually really about anything in my experience, it's more about socializing with other people, reading their body language making them laugh that kind of thing. It's more of a go with the flow kind of social bonding. I think often there's more socializing going on when people participate in small talk than when people are talking about weighty things.  

 




 I have a horrible habit of being sarcastically self-deprecating when I feel awkward in a social situation. For example me and some friends were joking around about some of them visiting each other when a few of us move to another region of our country. Anyway during the conversation no one seemed to mention for a few minutes that I was going to be living there too (everyone else is moving to a town just outside of the city I'll be moving to) anyway everyone was making plans about visiting that city and staying with friends they have there. I was about to mention that people could stay with me when someone else did for me saying it in a tone was like, Oh how could we have forgotten that test_subject2960 will be there too!. I laughed and played the obvious oversight off as sort of "Oh I don't really matter anyway don't worry about it!"Very Sarcastic obviously joking, but I don't like that sort of self-deprecation and I have a tendency to react in that way without thinking. How can I learn to stop doing this and work on playing things off in a more confident way? 




 Lately I've been trying to improve my banter with other people but its made my interactions so awkward I barely want to leave my house. Its like I'm analyzing my own thoughts and speech as I'm talking. Its making me trip over really simple sentences, or give really long explanations for simple things because I'm in overdrive trying to think of what would be the best way to say something. 

I'm want to be more confident and comfortable in the way I interact with others. I'm trying to watch what I say, keep things casual, banter, and be funny, but by trying to be more savvy with what I say and how I interact I'm messing up more than ever. Really I try to think of the best way to respond in a conversation, but the overanalysis is just weighing me down. At the same time if I don't pay attention to what I'm saying I'll say something stupid.

For example a coworker the other day mentioned that it was Mother's day in the UK and said she'd wished her Mom happy Mother's day. I knew she had lived in the UK for a few years so it wasn't completely random, but all I could come up with was asking her if there were any other "holidays" that were different there then in North America. That's a stupid question, I probably should have asked her something like if she's still doing something for her Mom for north american mother's day or something like that. Later she was talking about some neat little piece of tupperware she had and all I did was say it was neat  and that I probably need to start collecting neat little things like that because I'll be moving out on my own soon. 

Those are just two examples, they don't seem too awkward there but it was weird stilted conversation. On top of that anytime that I open my mouth I feel I need to psych myself up and what comes out is usually just really confused speech. Like trying to talk to one of the registrars at my university about a form I lost myself mid sentence and pretty much had to apologize and start over. I don't know what to do, it's like there's a mess between my brain and my mouth and I can't fix it.

Anybody got any ideas?  




 My therapist has recently brought up the possibility that I might have aspergers syndrome or another mild form of autism. Looking at my behaviour and the way I interact with people, I don' think this is entirely out of the ballpark. As far as I can tell the advantage of getting a diagnosis would be that I'd be realistically able to know some of my limitations and understand why I interact with the world the way I do. If there are any other reasons why I should or shouldn't pursue a diagnosis I'd like to hear them

 I don't really know where to start when it comes to getting a diagnosis. so I'm just fielding this to see if any of you have any advice on where to get started. 
 




 Since I started working on my anxiety I've noticed something about myself and was wondering if others have similar behaviour. I find I vent my anxieties to people close to me almost compulsively. It's such a weight off my shoulders to ask my family or friends, but sometimes I feel like I'm holding people hostage in conversations. I feel like I need to get some stuff off my chest and I don't know how else to go about it. I am seeing a therapist and I'm on medication, and while those have helped few things give the instant relief that talking to my parents or close friends give. I don't really like having this need, and I hate feeling like I'm pushing my problems on other people (its really selfish and self-involved). I also feel it makes me incredibly vulnerable and makes me seem weak.

Do any of you experience the same thing? Do you have any suggestions to limit or completely stop the need to vent?  




 Yeah, this seems to be the main thing that I need to work on! 




 Tonight I was out with some friends and we were having a few drinks (definitely not helping the situation) and one of them asks me some questions about what I'm planning on doing when I go back to college next year. I felt like what they asked for was a pretty tall order because I've sort of been bouncing between a few different things ( the old do what you love or do what makes money thing) Anyway I felt like I went a little too in depth with my describing what I've been thinking about doing for school. 

That's just an example really, I don't go on long winded monologues but often times I feel like a conversation gets focused on me somehow or what I'm up to. I feel like the conversation is reciprocated but I feel foolish giving my opinions or input all the time. I don't know why it is but I feel other people don't open up as much as I do and when I give my opinion or add a relevant story to the conversation I end up feeling like I've said too much and it makes me feel unappealing and vulnerable.

Do any you have any suggestions for reining in how much personal input I give, or how much input is appropriate when I'm just bantering with people? 
























 How are supposed to act when you, not necessarily in a bad way, are the subject matter of a joke? Today  some coworkers were teasing me about the fact that I use both my first and middle names (I used to go by my middle name, but got tired of explaining it to people) asking if the reason was because i was in witness protection, or if I was an escaped criminal. One of the girls said "Here we are thinking Heavyheartwolf is a nice normal guy, when he's actually a criminal on the run from the police." I played along and said "Well you know they say sociopaths, that they always seem so nice on the outside" She laughed, but I felt maybe it was a little an awkward or strange thing to say. 

Is it best to play along in these kind of social interactions, or just play it off in some other way? 




 I don't know what you should say, but she's giving you a, not so subtle, indicator that you talk about your ex too much with her. I'm only starting to read into seddit and it seems like not talking about exs is a good rule.  




 I've found that it helps a bit, especially when you're meeting someone for the first time. From my own experience, people like to interact with others who are like themselves and have a very fine tuned sense for detecting otherness. Using a different diction can be alienating to people, because in their subconscious they identify you as not like them.

 I know I default to more complicated language, and it can be off putting to people who aren't familiar with that type of language. In casual conversation being concise seems to work better. When I'm speaking with close friends, family, or a formal setting I don't worry about using my diction because it's appropriate and accepted there.

 I'd say try be aware of it in casual conversation, but don't let it stop you from speaking well. Knowing your audience is a good thing to be aware of in a social setting. It's certainly a hard thing to do (because if you're anything like me some of your wording is second nature), but it's a good skill to have, and it'll help you communicate better with people who might not have as large a vocabulary as yourself.  









 I've just come out of a depressive episode a few months ago and have been steadily improving since. I'm still a little shook up from the episode that lasted almost two years. What I'm finding is that my motivation is taking a long time coming back. I've been leaving things till last minute and being generally pretty irresponsible. Anything that has the least bit of anxiety attached to it, like studying for a test, I just try to avoid like the plague. Has anyone else experienced this? 




 I'm going to school for journalism and creative writing. I've become very interested in story crafting and film, so I may go to film school when I'm done my degree. 




 For a long time I've been thinking about a tattoo, but could never find something that would mean enough to me to have put on me permanently. I've been reading a lot of old literature, and while reading up about Goethe's Faust I found some book illustrations that were exactly what I was looking for. Faust's moral about how you can lose yourself in the pursuit of knowledge is a meaning that deeply resonates with me. [this](http://payload.cargocollective.com/1/2/88505/1527676/02-clarke-faust.jpg) is what I'm thinking about getting. 




 Lately I've realized that I've spent years talking about myself. When I was young I spent a lot of time alone and became very introspective and self-conscious. Now, in my early 20's I've begun to try to change my behaviour and engage other people more, but I'm running into some road blocks.  I'm not very good at asking people about themselves and engaging their interests into general conversation topics. I'm really interested in getting to know people and connecting with them, but I draw blanks as to what I should ask them. I also don't want to sound like I'm snooping into their business, just that I want to get a little closer to them. How do you come up with on the spot, thoughtful, and interesting questions to ask people? Everyone asks each other how their day was, but what are some good ways to get passed that without the conversation becoming heavy or awkward? 




 Yeah it definitely feels like a fog, and it makes it difficult to connect to other people. I haven't always been this way, because I can remember having my emotions flow normally. When I sit down and think and try to relax I have an easier time identifying how I'm feeling and becoming grounded in the moment, but it takes conscious effort. 




 Interesting, I'll have to look into this if I'm not diagnosed as asperger's. But, seeing as how the symptoms are very similar there's certainly things I can gain and contribute here in the meantime. Also, as I said in another comment in this thread, I do have similar traits when it comes to special interests, so a diagnosis of asperger's isn't out of the realm of possibility.
 




 Yeah, I guess that I should say I'm alright at picking up on other people's social cues, but there are sometimes where they just fly over my head. I have other things that seem more autistic than just social anxiety. I've don't really know what to talk about with people outside of my interests. Haven't been diagnosed yet, but it's a possibility, and at the very least I have a lot of the same characteristics as someone with aspergers.  




 Lately, I've found that my anxiety is causing an emotional cloud that makes it difficult to make sense of my other emotions. If I'm experiencing another emotion it feels like it's just blurred by that tight feeling in the pit of my stomach. It feels like I'm out of touch with myself all the time, and because of this I feel like I'm not really interacting with the world around me. I think I've felt like this for years, 




 Thanks , I'm glad you think I handled it alright. I've never been very good at handling these sort of awkward/confrontational situations, and have only lately started to change how I deal with them. I've been finding humor and taking things to their logical end in an absurd way has been working well. It takes the momentum away from an awkwardness or confrontation, but it's taking some getting used to, and it doesn't always fly. are trying to be confrontational or passive-aggressive.  




 I got a 32, I haven't been diagnosed yet, but I have a lot of traits ( told by my psychologist) I'm good at picking up on other people's social cues, I just don't know what to say to people in real life, generally.  




 I was going to say this Stalker specifically, but many of Tarkovsky's movies fit the question. Everything about stalker is so carefully done and beautiful. It might just be my favorite film. 




 Yeah I definitely did it with the appropriate body language and chuckling. I wasn't just mumbling to myself or anything. I just felt (like always) that I could have dealt with the situation better, I need to think on my toes more. 




 I know, it was bad. I just can never think of something properly clever to say or when I try it comes out half baked, like that. I'm horrible at defusing situations like that. I can never keep a cool head. 




 Today at work I had what was quite possibly the most awkward encounter that I've had in months. I work at a coffee shop where I usually get along well (albiet awkwardly) with my coworkers, except my assistant manager. She's a naturally passive aggressive, in your face sort of person, and she just sends my social anxiety through the roof. Sometimes she's fine and we can have a pretty good conversations, but other times she just saps all my energy. Last week she put in her resignation and the week after next will be her last week working. I'm not particularly pleased about this, more relieved that my anxiety won't be triggered so much at work. Today she was joking around about leaving and said "Well I know HeavyHeartWolf won't miss me!", and this caught me totally off guard and I just said whatever came into my mouth. 

The exchange went something like this.

I immediately (without thinking) said in a sort of joking voice and a smile "ah Assistant-Manager that's harsh, you've got me figured all wrong!" To which she responded "haha don't you be thinking that I don't know what goes on in that pretty little head of yours" Then I turned and said "it is a pretty little head isn't it?" I didn't mean to come off as an ass, but I feel like I did anyway. Every time I'm thrown into a situation like this I just say the most idiotic things, because I don't know what else to say. Silence probably would have worked better looking back. 

What can I do to get myself socially on my a-game for when things like this come up. Every time something like this happens I feel like I botch the whole interaction and leave everyone feeling awkward. Do any of you have advice for getting better at this? 




 Yeah, I haven't seen it in a few years, so I my opinion of it might have changed. I think the idea of just going out and trying to authentically connect with people outside of the expectations that society places on us struck a chord with me.  




 I suppose if I'm diagnosed with asperger's then I'll have to learn to accept that I have some limitations socially and work on coping strategies to deal with and accept them. If it's not autism then it seems to me that what I'm dealing with is probably a result of severe anxiety and that I'll need to work on ways of building confidence and managing the anxiety through therapy, exposure, and medication if I need it. 




 Yes definitely, if I don't receive a diagnosis there are still a lot of things that I need to work on personally. I know that I have trouble socializing with people sometimes, I have a lot of anxiety, and I struggle with some obsessive tendencies. I'm really looking into Asperger's because it could explain a lot and as far as I'm concerned it's something that either is on the table or isn't, but I need to know moving forward. If I an aspie then there are some realities that I'll need to work with, if I'm not, then there are other reasons for some of my characteristics that I need to explore. 

I've been trying to find reasons and solutions for some of the things that are causing problems in my life. I don't think there's any harm in taking a look at the possibility of being asperger's. If I am I learn something about myself and move forward in one direction, if I'm not then I'll reassess somethings and move forward in a different direction. 




 If I get a diagnosis then it'll mean I have to manage my problems one way, if I don't get a diagnosis then it'll mean that I manage them another. What it really comes down to is finding out whether or not autism is on the table for me. I know I have some trouble socializing, I know I have some obsessive tendencies, but I'll be dealing with them in very different ways and mind-frames depending on whether I receive a diagnosis. 




 I'm currently pursuing an official diagnosis and have been dealing with a lot of anxiety about it lately, so please, bear with me. I've been being treated for depression for the last year, I had what I call a nervous breakdown and moved back in with my parents. I've been seeing a psychologist and brought to him the possibility that I might have either bipolar disorder or asperger's. He told me that I don't show many signs of bipolar, but there are some behaviours and thinking patterns that I have that might indicate asperger's. 

Now I've been studying up on it and while some traits are me in every colour, some just don't seem to apply. I've asked to do some screening tests with my psychologist, and have founds some credible ones online. The results of the test don't seem to indicate that I'm an aspie, actually I scored fairly low in a lot of categories. I can apparently read people's emotions better than average and am fairly good at deciphering people's intentions. 

It's a really confusing mix of indications, on one hand I fit the bill in many ways, but on the other I just don't seem like someone with asperger's. 

Did any of you who've been diagnosed deal with mixed indicators before getting your official diagnosis?  




 I think Into the Wild is close to what I'd consider an INFJ movie. I've that there are more films that involve similar themes in foreign cinema. Wim Wender's film Der Himmel Uber Berlin (Wings of Desire) and the films of Andrei Tarkvosky spring to mind. If you're the kind of person who doesn't mind subtitles then I'd recommend giving those a watch. 

For english movies I'd say that Spike Jonze and Wes Anderson are two directors who explore a lot of themes that INFJs can relate to. Where the Wild Things Are is one of the best children's films I've seen. 




 I've been told that I'm a bit intimidating on first introduction, but only because (I've been told) I look and sound like an intelligent, confident person. I was surprised by this at first, but I take it as a real compliment. I've had people tell me that the reason I seem intimidating is that I'm an attractive young person who seems to talk about things and hold stronger well thought out beliefs than many people my age. I actually have quite a lot of problems with being self critical and insecure, so the idea that I can seem confident and collected means a lot to me.  




 Actually, I wrote this entire post about how I'm really self-conscious and actively avoid sounding like a pompous elitist in my everyday life by bringing in topics that don't interest most people. I don't reject other people or their interests. In fact, I could listen to someone talk to me about their passion almost regardless of whatever that passion for as long as they were willing to talk. 

I think you read my post thinking I have no interest in the people around me when that's far from the case. I'm not resentful of other people or have low expectations of them, I'm just trying to avoid being condescending or seeming pretentious, because I know that sometimes I can be unintentionally. I tried to make it understandable in my post that I like to interact with people and chat with them about things and other interests, but I haven't found a way to incorporate this large piece of my life into socializing without seeming like I'm doing it just to flaunt.

I hope that makes sense. I didn't mean to imply that other people are inferior to me, just that a lot of people have no interest in that sort of thing. Other people reference things like TV shows in everyday conversation all the time, because those around them can relate to those things. My problem is that some of the things I'd like to reference aren't as easily accessible and I have to check myself before throwing references to things that it might be difficult for others to relate to into a conversation.  




 Over the past year I've be recovering from a depressive episode. An important piece of healing from my depression has been socializing with people and developing my social skills. While I think I've made a lot of improvement, I've been having trouble staying true to myself while trying to expand my social circle and become more open. I wouldn't call it an obsession, but I have a fundamental interest in the humanities (Philosophy, Literature, Art, History, Politics, Language) that a lot of people don't share. I'm drawn to the humanities because, like many of you, I have a need to try to find meaning. It's the study of being human and, because of that, I've read a lot. Unfortunately, the wealth of knowledge makes me feel alienated from others who aren't interested in finding meaning. 

 I don't mean to say that that's all I have to talk about, but there doesn't seem to be many people who have much interest in these things. It's not that I'm dying to have conversations about these things either, it's that I have to censor myself and not let my knowledge about these things cause social friction. For instance, when people ask me if I'm reading something or what I'm reading, I usually don't answer with an in depth description because they probably don't want to hear it. I don't like people knowing that I read philosophy, poetry or foreign literature, because most people don't read those things and can't relate. How am I supposed to answer what my favorite film is when my real answer is it's an existential Russian film that can't be summed up in a sentence? I've found myself really skirting around these kind of questions and straight up lying by giving generic answers. Even when I have something to say in conversations about politics or history (which I never start now) I usually keep it to myself because whatever I have to say often shuts down or hijacks the conversation. Another example, some friends were having a conversation about how great they thought the idea of communism is, but they were pretty new to the whole idea. Throughout the whole conversation I wanted to give my researched opinion that contradicted theirs and would have derailed the whole conversation. 

I have this whole other side to me that isn't appropriate to share. I can't share my interests because they won't be accepted or engaged. It's almost like living two lives at once. I like socializing with people, I like to talk about what's happening in the day to day, have drinks, go to parties and have a good time, but I feel like a whole side of me is never engaged. I've tried breaching these deeper conversations with people who'd seem interested, but I haven't had a lot of success so I've become more reserved with what I talk about. I know that I can't justs drop philosophical tidbits into conversation and expect people to engage them, so I have to censor myself, but it's causing issues.

Do any of you feel the same way? Do you have any experiences to share?

  




 Both of my parents are working professionals. My mom took ten years off after finishing her degree to raise me and my brothers. For the first ten years my parents were very loving and involved. After my mom went back to work she become completely focused on her professional career, and me and my brothers have definitely suffered for it. We moved towns a few times because of my parents work, they never really had any concern for our development or whether we were okay. We lived in a series of small towns where it was difficult to fit in socially as an outsider. My teenage years were spent in an isolated, northern rural town.  My parents basically stopped being invested in me and my brothers when I was 10 and sort of left us to our own devices. Now they're surprised that me and my brothers have problems connecting to people and all suffer from anxiety and depression. I've been struggling with depression since I was 12 and my parents tell me that they never noticed anything until I had to move home to get help.

 So no, my parents weren't abusive, but I feel they emotionally abandoned me and my brothers to focus on their careers. This involved throwing us into a lot of bad environments because they didn't do their homework i.e. really crazy babysitters and subpar schools. They never made much effort to make sure that my brothers and I were socializing normally and that we were emotionally alright. I can only guess that I've become an INFJ because I had to deal with loneliness and sadness for a long time without much emotional support. Maybe it's that I turned to religion, literature, and music at a young age to try to manage my pain. I've since become an agnostic, but I can remember taking solace in religion when I dealt with depression as a child. Now I'm a little jaded, a bit poorly adjusted and have a lot of anxiety, but at my core I'm very empathetic and yearn for a deeper connection and understanding with people.

It wouldn't surprise me to hear that other INFJs have suffered some form of desertion early in their lives. Maybe it's why INFJs want deeper meaning and connections with others. 




 I've noticed that with certain people I always end up having the same conversations. It's great that we have similar interests and that we get along, but I really want to get a little deeper and talk about something other than just our common ground. How do you start a conversation that doesn't seem obvious, and how do avoid getting stuck in a conversation rut? I like talking about the things we talk about, but sometimes I wish we'd talked more about each other rather than just things we enjoy.  




 I'm like that. It makes me feel good to share my passions, experiences, and opinions. Lately I've become a little self-conscious about sharing too much because I'm trying to engage other people about themselves more. 

With money and possessions I share too much. I buy for friends sometimes just because I like too. If I have extra money, most of the time, I'd rather spend it buying drinks for friends than buying things for myself. I like cooking people for people. There's something primevally communal about making a meal for friends.   
























 I've been seeing a girl for the last few months who is absolutely amazing, and who's caught me off guard. We've been dating casually knowing that I'll be moving away to go to university on the other side of the country. We've only been seeing each other for two months, but I've really started to develop feelings for her that I didn't expect, and she feels the same way. Also her friends are great people who I'd really like to get to know better and I fit into their group very well (something that I often don't find easily)

I took a year off of university because I was dealing with depression and needed time to live at home and recollect myself before moving back to where I was going to university. Moving back to where I was going to school feels like it's the adult decision for me. It's me taking control of my life again and taking responsibility for myself. There are also a lot of great opportunities at the university that I'm going to that I wouldn't have if I stayed in the city I'm living in now (scholarships, professors that are invested in me, academic publishing, social contacts, etc.)

I planned on moving away before we started dating, but she and I really connect and I have some very serious affection for her. She's always known since the very start that there was a good chance I'd be moving away and that we'd only date for a few months. Also with the idea that we'd work hard to remain friends after I go back to university. 

There are some problems though if I stayed. First and foremost she's christian and I'm an agnostic, which is a problem for her. There would be problems in the long run because being in a long term relationship with someone who isn't religious could be a dealbreaker for her. Secondly, and related, she's a virgin and I am not, and because of her religious convictions I would feel bad about taking her virginity even she wanted to at the time. I've sexually escalated things with her (making out and being physical. both of which are new to her). Not being able to have sex with her would be a problem for me. That being said, knowing her, if we were to go forward with a long term committed relationship I think she'd be open to having sex. I wouldn't pressure her to go outside of what she's comfortable with, but sex is important for me in a relationship.

She's amazing, definitely very serious long-term girlfriend material. I'm really debating just dropping my plans and staying for her, because that's what I feel I want to do, but I know that in the long run going back to my university on my own gives me so much opportunity to succeed and grow. I really care about her and want to make sure she's okay when I go, and I'd be lying if I said part of me doesn't want to stay. 

What's your opinion, is it worth it to drop my plans to stay with a girl who I'm starting to have very serious feelings for? Or is it better that we go our separate ways, stay friends, and both look at our dating as a learning experience?

TL;DR: Unexpectedly developed a relationship with an amazing girl while taking a year off university, now that I'm going back I'm having some serious reservations about leaving. Should I consider dropping my plans to pursue a relationship, or is it better that I just let it go?


EDIT: I should just say that if I stayed in the city I'm currently living in that I'd continue my education here, it just wouldn't offer me the same opportunities that I might have if I move. 
 




 The mind's eye one is still broken, I just did it and scored a 4, when I've done similar tests with similar pictures and scored much higher.  




 I'm a writer and a musician. I used to write short stories and was working on a novella, but because of anxiety and depression I have a hard time creating new characters and imagining what they look like. I still write, but for that last year I've written only poetry, because I can create an emotion or a thought and don't have to create a person.  




 When my anxiety was at its worst I got into the habit of humming to myself when I thought no one was listening.  




 Yeah poetry has always been a fascination with mine. Lately I've been reading Rainer Maria Rilke, and I'd recommend him to anyone interested in poetry, especially on this subreddit.  




 I'm sure you know this, but most NT people don't usually follow those if there's no immediate reason to do so either. Most people don't follow arbitrary rules if there is no reason to. Lots of NT people would jaywalk if there were no cars coming (depending on the street of course) for instance. 




 The angst and sorrow are much too familiar for me. It might be an INFJ thing that we don't actually grow out of those feelings, but grow into and around them.  




 I have the same problem and am finding that writing every day yes helping me come up with and articulate thoughts better. 




 He seems like a good example of an unhealthy infj 




 I think Gandalf is the more INFJ of the two, but I'll certainly throw in my lot and say those characters have a lot of INFJ qualities. 




 Here's a quote from Andrei Tarkovsky's film Stalker, that I've always felt described music (and my feelings toward music) in a beautiful way. 


"Are you awake? You were talking recently about the meaning... of our... life... unselfishness of art... Let's take music... It's really least of all connected; to say the truth, if it is connected at all, then in an idealess way, mechanically, with an empty sound... Without... without associations... Nonetheless the music miraculously penetrates into the very soul! What is resonating in us in answer to the harmonized noise? And turns it for us into the source of great delight... And unites us, and shakes us? What is its purpose? And, above all, for whom? You will say: for nothing, and... and for nobody, just so. Unselfish. Though it's not so... perhaps... For everything, in the end, has its own meaning... Both the meaning and the cause..." 




 Yeah for MBTI I usually test an an INFJ but I've shown up as an INFP a few times. 




 More or less. I think the social functions of both are very different.  




 I've been getting a lot of comments in this thread assuming that I can't make general small talk. That's why I tried to preface what I was saying by mentioning that I'm fine with everyday conversation. I don't drag people into deeper conversations, and very rarely begin them because I know that I'm very analytical in them. Maybe I didn't write that clearly enough. I would never hijack someone else's conversation, and I know when it is and isn't appropriate to talk about certain things. I think you assume that I'm someone who forces intellectual conversation on others whenever I open my mouth, but that's not the case. 

As far as I can see, intellectual conversations are a level removed from everyday emotion based conversations. It's hard for me to see how an intellectual conversation could be separated from any hint of debate, even people with similar beliefs will disagree on some issues. I don't understand people who think they can lightly engage a topic like politics or philosophy.  




 That's where my problem is I can't see most intellectual conversation as regular conversation. Everyday chit chat is how you get to know people better, deep conversation is the trading of ideas. Chit chat is about participation, intellectually engaging conversation is about ideas.  




 Lately I feel like I'm starved of intellectual conversation. All day I participate in small talk, I talk about all kinds of things, I don't have too much of a problem, but I find deeper conversation much much more engaging. This is not to blow my own horn but to give context. I've always performed far above average academically, and have scored well into the gifted category on professionally administered IQ tests. 

The difference between my small talk and my intellectual conversation is night and day for me. I enjoy small talk. Talking about light interests, each other, places to go, things to eat, cracking jokes, I like it a lot; it's how you get to know someone better. On the other hand, deeper conversations on politics, morals, ethics, philosophy, literature, history, and science when I'm talking about the concepts and not just what's in the news is often another a whole other situation. I get very intense in these sort of conversations and I don't really know how to turn it off. It's not that I want to be right, but that when talking about these things I always want to dig deeper, and more often than not the other person or people don't want to. I feel like I do this because I almost never get to engage about these things in a meaningful way and when I do I try to keep the conversation alive for far too long. I don't have these conversations often outside of my family and very close friends, so it's not as though I'm badgering acquaintances with these conversations. I get over invested in intellectual conversation and it often makes me feel foolish when I try to keep a conversation about an intellectual topic going. 

What can I do to stop being too engaged in these sorts of conversations? 




 It's quite the odd thing to feel like an extrovert sometimes, even when you're not.  I know I prefer small conversation oriented groups,  and to be able to contrast that with how I can be at large gatherings is something a lot of people wouldn't guess about me. 




 It's definitely something that is a balancing act that I haven't totally figured out yet. I find that I especially try to adapt the sense of humor of a group, which can be difficult and awkward. 




 I'd recommend some Albert Camus, and Nietzsche. I know they are two very different philosophers, but Nietzsche gives a good explanation of why things are the way they are, and Camus' philosophy gives ideas on how to live with it. 




 I feel the exact same way. It's a confusing paradigm, and I'm still not too sure what to think of it. When I go to parties I often become the center of it, because it almost feels like I pick up on the "group feel" and adapt to it, but as soon as I'm away from the circumstance I go back to my own self. Sometimes I feel very out of touch with who I am. 




 Yea I have an intuitive (and sometimes annoying) ability to slip into the mannerisms of other people. I've been finding it very frustrating and a little distressing lately, because sometimes I feel that my own personality is "overwritten" by anyone else I interact with. It's something that I try to stay mindful of. 




 When I'm participating in a group I intuitively change my behaviour to fit in better with a group. The problem with this is I begin to lose my own identity inside of a group dynamic. I'll be honest that I have self-esteem issues, and that that is a certainly a big part of the problem. Every time I'm in a new group I subconsciously conform(sometimes unsuccessfully) to their behaviour instead of adding my own to the dynamic. 

How do I maintain my own identity and add it to groups instead of conforming to theirs? 




 Tonight I was out with my friend and their friends, we were laughing having a good time, and really we having great conversation. One of them pointed out that I fit into their group like I'd always been there. Anyway we had really long conversations about a lot of different things and I participated in all them very well and with no trouble, but I couldn't think of things to talk about myself.

 I seem to draw a complete blank when it comes to generating new conversation topics, or being able to change a conversation to a new topic. This is something I really need to get better at because I like talking to people, and am pretty good at it, but I just can't come up with new things to say, in fact I get a lot of anxiety trying to figure out something new to talk about. I can jump from someone else's last topic, but I can't start a conversation to save my life.  What can I do to get better at generating conversation topics and engaging people with them? I seem to do just fine in conversation outside of that, but I just can't seem to start my own topics.  




 Yeah definitely. I think the thing that I've been trying to do with "noun-ing" is going for things that dig a little deeper into their personality. It's a great way of finding conversation topics, and it's helped a lot with keeping conversations going. 




 I'm glad that my conversations are getting some flow to them. It was something that was really lacking, but it's getting better. I'm trying to work on getting a little more out of my comfort zone and "leading" conversations, but I've got lots of things I need to work on. Thanks 




 Today I went out for lunch with a friend, and the conversation went pretty well except that it went into some strange topics that left both of us wondering how we'd brought up that topic. We were at a restaurant and having a conversation about rats (not the most appropriate conversation to have where people are eating). We were talking about what kind of animals we'd seen or had lived around, she brought up mice, and then I told a story about the cat sized rats that lived near the harbor of a city I used to live in. It was a little weird and left us both asking how the conversation had gone in that direction. I

What're some good skills to work on when trying to change topics, or segue into something more interesting? 




 I just want to say that, for the most part, we're in the same boat. I've tested as being "gifted", I've had friends who are in art school tell me I should model, and I have many talents and interests (play three instruments, write, competitive sports, reading, cooking) and yet I have little faith in myself. It's been hard trying to gain confidence. I have a lot of reason to be confident, but it's almost as though I can't convince myself. 

I hope that you find out the trick to unlocking that confidence. Changing your own perceptions is one of the hardest things you can do but it's well worth it. Best of luck.  




 I quit games and started my self-improvement project. Whenever I don't know what I should be doing I either start reading (I've written a long reading list), go to the gym, or ask people if they want to do something. Setting goals for myself and identifying what I want really helped me to fill my time. 




 Thanks for the response, those are some good responses and I'll try to play up that sort of response in the future.  




 I think keeping a straight facial expression and not acknowledging the teasing would make you look like you can't take a joke. How could you seem dominant without looking like you have no sense of humor? 
























 Yeah I've still been doing deadlifts. The trouble isn't so much the joints themselves, but that the doctors don't want the muscles to overdevelop in the wrong direction and then be more difficult to correct after the surgery.  




 I'm having joint trouble in my knees and because of that I can't do squats until I have a surgery. I know it's a really useful exercise to build core back and leg muscles, so are there any more isolated exercises that I can use to get similar results? 




 Hey I just wanted to ask where you guys started seeing muscle growth first when you started making gains? I've been at it for a month, and while I've started seeing gains on my arms shoulders and chest, I've gained a lot more muscle on my back then anywhere else. Did you find that a certain muscle group developed a lot faster than other ones did when you started? 




 Yea I'm finding it really sobering. I knew I had depression, but had a feeling there was something more to it. Somethng else interesting that came up after she diagnosed me is that I'm not an introvert, I'm more of an extrovert whose being limited by symptoms of ptsd. I also don't have traditional social anxiety, it's more rooted in years of traumatic experiences and problems trusting people. Really the diagnosis makes a lot of sense when I look back on things.
 




 I recently moved to a new city and have been seeing a new therapist to manage my anxiety and depression. For the last few sessions we've been going over my difficulties and getting used to each other. For the first few sessions I described my problems with interacting with people, feeling unable to connect with others, problems with concentration, and "brain fog." For the first few session she said I definitely have social anxiety and suffer from depression. This is pretty much what I've been told before, and that's fine I knew what I had to work on.

That is until the last few sessions where we spoke about more specific issues. It came up that I actually have dissociative issues with my appearance and identifying or experiencing my emotions. It's to the point where I almost can't describe myself. I started talking about bullying that I experienced as a kid, moving to different towns several times, babysitters with mental issues, and the rejection that I've had from other kids growing up. 

Some examples; Literally my first social interaction that I remember outside of my family is a neighbour kid jumping on my back (with no provocation, the kid had issues) and biting a chunk out me. This happened when I was five, it was a deep bite and I had to be on antibiotics for a while. When i was ten another kid with emotional issues in the neighbourhood tried to crush me with a washing machine that was lying around. This kid had it planned out and booby-trapped. It would have permanently injured me or killed me easy. Had babysitter who'd leave my brothers and I outside for hours in -30 weather for hours and refuse to let us inside. In highschool I lived in a very isolated community where I never really fit in to the very small town community. I can remember taking so much shit from my "friends" then. People who unfortunately still manage to keep themselves in my larger social circles. 

Anyway, when I was talking about my highshcool "friends" with my therapist I was clenching my jaw the whole time without realizing it. My therapist pretty much stopped me and told me that I almost certainly have C-PTSD and that most of my anxiety, body, social, and depression issues stem from it. It's almost refreshing how much it seems to make sense.  




 This is my personal example.  I have an ex-girlfriend (who I've been friends with for years)  who's been confiding in me a lot about her depression and feelings of loneliness. I have experience struggling with the same problems, and I have a lot of advice to share, but I know I can end up talking about my own depression. I don't really know what to tell her when she says something like "I just feel empty," other than "I feel that way a lot of the time too." I've told her that I don't know how to deal with those problems myself, so I'm not the best person for her to talk to. I do listen to what she has to say and I give honest input, but I feel like maybe I should just not talk and listen more. 

Is it better to give input and try to share your relevant experience and feelings? or is it better to just sit and listen? I'm just looking for advice on how to be a better comforter 




 I've been playing guitar for years, but have only recently made the effort to start writing on it. I'm a piano player and I have my theory down, so that's helped a lot, but I find I'm stuck on strumming chords. It's really difficult trying to make a song sound more interesting when I'm just hammering out some chords. How can I learn to play and write more textured guitar parts, instead of just strumming chords?  




 Whenever I get "stuck in my head" (as my friends and family have started calling it) I look at the ground. I just completely check out and let my thoughts go, and I'm only vaguely aware of what's happening around me when I'm thinking like that. I've had to make a conscious effort to walk with my head up and shoulders back, so that it looks like I have some self-esteem haha.  




 I just started physiotherapy to correct knock knees and hyperextension. My physiotherapist has recommended that I don't do heavy squats as part of my workout routine, until we make some progress with correcting my knees. Pretty much they don't want my knees strengthening in the wrong direction. What are some other exercises that I can do that'll work similar muscle groups as squats, but in a different way? 




 I know! haha I've just got to go to relax about it, but I think I'm still getting over getting this attention in the first place.  




 Over the past few months I've been working hard on building up my confidence. I've been working out, meeting new people, and being a more assertive person. It seems like it's been working, because I've noticed that whenever I make eye contact with girls I'm passing on the street, or around campus 9 times out of 10 I get an insanely cute and genuine smile. I'm not used to getting such open body language from girls and I need to how to approach them.

Does a "hey, how's it going?" work or should I say something about their appearance/smile. Day game is new territory for me, so I need your advice to get me started.

 




 Do you still get the benefits of the boost after the 7 day mark. I mean other than turning me into a horny animal, I'm concentrating better and getting way more things done, so it'd be great if that stays. 




 I'm 21 and this is the second time I've made it to one week and I'm finding it horribly difficult. I'm horny all the time, I stare at girls constantly and just can't stop thinking about fucking them. I spent a whole three hour class today imagining what the girl sitting across from me looks like when she cums. I only slept for an hour last night because I my heart was beating like mad and I was sweating. When I woke up, I was UP, it didn't feel like I missed any sleep because of the feeling of adrenaline. I've been hitting on my friends constantly and I can't seem to help it. It just blurts out like a natural response. Pretty much if I can make a sexual comment I do, and I mean it most of the time. 
I've also been having whole days where I just wake up in a rage/depression and stay like that all day.

A big problem is that I haven't been meeting a lot of people at university since I took a year off and I'm having a hard time making those social connections that would lead to meeting women.

The worst part is I live off campus (not too far) at my university, and all day I'm just feeling resentful of all the people who are just hooking up in dorms and meeting women through the campus community. 

I've been hitting the gym hard, but I'm trying to gain weight and muscle so I'm only going a few times a week so I don't burn off all my extra calories. So going for runs is pretty much out of the picture. Meditating's been fine, but I have to fight my way from sexual imagery.

I feel nauseous and like I have a headache constantly, but I can't fall asleep and feel like I'm rushing with adrenaline all the time. 

Do you have any advice to help me push through this? 




 I'm my experience, the best thing to do when someone snubs you is to just leave the conversation and don't contact them until they contact you. If they're actually interested they'll get a hold of you and be more accommodating next time. People who think they don't need to meet you half way in a conversation are wasting your time.
 




 Yes! Your last line is a really good way of putting how I feel after work. I work at a coffee shop and I know I go into an autopilot mode to get me through the day. By the time I leave work at the end of a shift I feel really scattered and can't collect myself till I'm away from work and doing another activity. The only other time I feel like how I do when I'm finished a long shift of repetitive tasks is when I'm waking up or over tired.  




 I can't take mundane activities, but other people around me seem to manage them just fine. I work at a coffee chain and an 8 hour shift is often too mind numbing for me. I get off work feeling numb and drained, because my brain stopped working half way through it. I find most of my coworkers manage the grind of everyday better than I do and don't let it outwardly get to them. 

How do mundane tasks or jobs affect you? 




 nope I just had short term dating and out to make friends on my profile, so there's no way to mix that up there. 




 So I had a really great night with a girl the other night. The date went great and we had sex afterward, it wasn't great sex as we'd both been drinking a bit. I don't think I'm really too physically attracted to her and I'm not really interested in anything serious. What's the best way to communicate that I'm sort of "playing the field" and that's kind of where I am right now? 




 NT people talk to themselves too. I mean they try to hide it as much as possible, but especially under stress everyone talks to themselves.  




 Was for a while. It was a sedative too, so I didn't feel like I could get any creative momentum, and it gave me some pretty serious brain-fog.  




 Almost every person I've ever been close to tells me that I overthink things. The thing is that, especially in social situations, I have an uncanny ability to know what is going to happen or how people are going to act and react. My analyses usually bother people, especially in personal conversations, and frustrates me because I feel like they don't have the same investment that I do in whatever we're talking about. 

I do actually overthink things sometimes, and I've got myself in some pretty serious thought loops that caused really bad anxiety. I'm more aware of it now than before, but I still struggle with it. I usually keep my opinions and thoughts to myself, because I usually go much deeper into my analysis than a lot of people ever care to.

Here's followup answers.

- I was talking to a friend who I've occasionally been romantically involved with about how our relationship is a lot more complicated than what we like to admit to each other. She told me I overthink things ha. 

- Not for a long time. But I don't often share a lot of my opinions or thoughts, because not many people want to get as in-depth into things as I do. 

- I suffer from depression and anxiety. I dealt with existential depression for about a year, and still struggle with general anxiety. I've had depressive episodes for years, but as I get older and understand it better I feel I'm starting to manage them. 

- The female form is honestly the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. I'm a straight male, but even aesthetically there's just something pleasing about women. 

- My biggest dream is to write something that means something to people beyond myself. 

- Biggest fear is to lose my mind. 

- We can't, but I don't think that matters. 

- My day felt very long, and I have a headache, because I drank too much coffee. 

It's nice to overthink sometimes, especially when it gives you a chance to sort out whatever it is you're thinking about. 


 




 I've noticed that when I'm tired I'm terrible at socializing. I make stupid comments, I mumble, I can't think of anything to say or what to talk about (unless it's something about myself), I complain about things, I can't hide my emotions, I stumble over my words, I don't listen well, and I'm not as aware of how the people around me are feeling. It's embarrassing and I feel like I don't deal with it as well as other people around me. 

I find I have a lot more trouble with this at work than anywhere else. This is a real problem because I work at a coffee shop and being tired really kills my ability to interact with customers and coworkers. I can't hold a conversation, and it makes it difficult to connect with the people I work with when I'm having trouble halfway through an eight hour shift. 

When I'm feeling good and energized I'm usually pretty quick on my feet and friendly, but being even a little tired makes me dull and anxious. 

Do any of you have advice for staying socially energized? or being able to maintain when I am tired?

EDIT: Posted this after a long shift at work; Just look at that title.  




 It's a very safe, very relatable topic that almost anyone can feel comfortable participating in. Everyone knows what the weather's like, what it's been like and how to compare it to other weather they've experienced. It's also a good transition topic to other things like where someone is from or where they've travelled before. The weather is most people's go to because it's easy and they prefer talking about it to silence.  




 Knowing everything about your sexuality might be unneeded, but from what I can gather, sexuality is a large part of most people's psyche and development. There are things in your development and behaviour that he was probably looking for. Just me hazarding a guess. 




 I've been thinking about how I speak and come across to others.  I've been looking for alternatives to the generic slang terms I've been using since I was a kid. Terms like "cool", "awesome", "sweet", "what's up?", and calling friends "man" or "dude" seem childish and outdated. I especially fall back on these terms when I'm feeling anxious, and it makes me feel like people see me as immature.

I'm not sure if this is even a thing that other people notice or not, but I'd like to hear your input on it. Do you think it's something I should work on What do you think I could do to developing different default default language.

Just to give some context, I'm 21 and male.  




 When I'm anxious and trying to talk to someone I think I come across upset and impatient. I default to a lower voice, and don't have as much control over my intonation as I usually do. This can be really off putting, especially when I didn't start the conversation anxious, and then gradually slip into seeming impatient and angry. 

Any advice on how to mange this better? 




 Sexuality is a large part of most people's behaviour. If a psychiatrist doesn't understand your behaviour, how are they supposed to help you? 




 I find that whenever I'm tired I don't talk much, and get into a very bad mood. This has affected how I act at work, especially early morning shifts. I know I get remote and impatient, but when I'm really tired I can't seem to help it. What's the best way to manage being over tired when you have to be social? 




 I've moved to a city with a very lively night life, and because of this I have to deal with a lot of drunk people walking around at night. I'm a 21m and on any given night I might have to walk past scores of drunk people to go to and from pubs or friends places or walk home from work. A lot of drunk guys my age show off by screaming at and trying to belittle any other guy who's walking by them. I'm in shape, and dress well, I usually look put together, and I'm beginning to feel like that's a factor in how aggressive other guys are when I'm walking alone at night. For example I was walking home tonight and a couple guys just start harassing me for drinking a bottle of water as I walk by, I literally got a "You like that bottle of water faggot?" shouted at me. I had a few comments I could have thrown back, but nothing I felt would be really affective. Is there a way of dealing with them without starting a fight? I feel like ignoring them is a too passive, but confronting them could end up with me picking my teeth up off the sidewalk.  




 Haha I'd like to think that's how someone would see it 
























 Thanks. I get where she's coming from somewhat. I just want this to be resolved one way or another. If she doesn't want me around I can put it out of my head, if she does want me around great, but the different reactions each time I see her is getting tiresome. She probably won't want to talk about it face to face, do you think just texting her to initiate the conversation will work?  




 This is true, I mean we'll probably see each other sometime this week. It's just at this point a relationship probably isn't going to happen so I'm not getting my hopes up. I'd just settle for things not being weird and us being consistently one way or another.  




 Well it's been going on for over a month I think she knows how I feel about it. Do you think giving it some space this week might help and then gauge it for the next time we see each other? 




 What do you think I should say. Would shooting her a text be alright? I don't want this to be a high pressure thing. It's going to be uncomfortable obviously, but I think she'd just try to avoid the uncomfortableness if I tried to get her to meet up. Maybe I should just wait out the week. 




 This situation with this girl I was seeing before the holidays has gotten pretty complicated since we got back to college. Early in November this girl couldn't spend enough time with me, whenever she was free from work or school she wanted to do something or was texting me. She was getting very emotionally invested in me and I got invested in turn (we were dating pretty seriously) We were starting to have 'relationship talks,' and she confided in me about her problems with anxiety and sometimes depression. We stayed over at each other's places, I met her friends and roommates she met mine. I wasn't someone she was trying to hide.  

Then it was like a switch flipped in her head and she decided to be really cold and standoffish with me. We were still hooking up and seeing each other, but it just seemed like she didn't really want me around as much. By middle of December she had me doing the chasing and when we got back from Holidays she broke it off. She just told me she's having a hard time and is completely emotionally unavailable, but still likes me. 

We see each other pretty regularly because we work at the campus bar together, but things are weird. Some nights she actively avoids me, or acts uncomfortable around me and other nights she responds to being flirty and teasing. 

There was a night a last week where we were hanging out in a group at the bar listening to music and just hanging out. I was talking about a show I'd played that weekend with my band and she got upset with me that I hadn't invited her. I also haven't been texting her, because every time I've asked her to hangout she's been busy or 'busy' and she never initiates texting anymore. She asked me to hangout longer when I thought about leaving. Later when we were alone for a minute she was giving me this pouty face and I asked her how she was doing. She just said terrible and looked me in the eyes, so I kissed her and she reciprocated really aggressively. Like push me against a wall making out. We only got interrupted by a friend bumping into us. 

I asked her to hangout over the weekend and she told me she had a lot of work to do (plus she works weekends so I don't know). She does seem to be back to avoiding. She talked to me for all of a minute at a party we were both at the other night and just hovered around her friends. When she's acting cold/uncomfortable I just give her space and kind of pretend she's not there. I know I should just let the whole thing go, I'm honestly a bit hung up, but I'd like to clear the air with her so we can stop awkwardly avoiding each other like we are now. 

What do you think? Should I go ahead and just talk to her about it? I just want to ask if we've just decided on being weird with each other now. I haven't been this confused about a girl in a long time, so any advice is appreciated. 



---   
**tl;dr**: I was seeing a girl before the holidays, and it seemed like we were moving into a relationship. She admits to having anxiety issues. After the break she tells me she's emotionally unavailable and can't date right now. She's been bouncing back between avoiding me and being very affectionate when I'm around. I don't want to awkwardly avoid each other anymore because it sucks and is much more uncomfortable.  




 I'm an INFP male and I always feel a little outside of the modern gender dichotomy. The way that I have framed it is that I am more drawn to classical ideas of what it is to be a man than modern ones. It seems to me like many men probably would be. I strive for perfection and admire it, so I love classical music, good wine, great food, fashion, classic literature and aesthetics in almost any medium. I think it's relevant to say I'm heterosexual and identify completely as a male.

I think that maybe we're just prone to more classical tastes and that might come from tendency to be introspective. It's only the popular culture that tries to portray neutral (and often masculine dominated given the history) things like classical music as feminine. I think that there is a much more subdued and mature version of masculinity that should make a comeback. I pictured a mature male INFP as sort of gentlemanly kind of character, but that's my take on it.  




 I am wasting my potential. I'm just watching all of my opportunities pass me by and I'm not doing a thing about it. I am in a constant state of being frozen by my own fear and I've spent years trying to overcome it, but I just can't. I'm 22 and I'm stuck in the mindset of a 19 year old. I see so many people my age doing great things and taking charge of their lives, but I'm stuck in neutral with the pedal to the floor. Even though I'm in college and studying something I like, I'm not where I could be. I took 2 years to figure out that I hated what I was studying in college, one year being alone and depressed, and two since then trying to piece my early 20s back together. 

 I'm a musician, but I haven't written a whole song in more than a year and it's killing me I'm so trapped in my own anxiety about actually writing something. I'm classically trained on piano and have taught myself 2 other instruments, but I can't even write a fucking pop song anymore. I'm so stuck I can't even feel things anymore. I see kids just out of their teens writing great music and really starting to get some good shows and I feel like I've wasted so much time and that my time is running out. 

Every teacher or professor I've ever had has told me I'm one of the smartest students they've ever had and I've tested as highly intelligent on every intelligence test I've ever taken (if you take stock in those), but I can't seem to figure myself out. I can never find any traction in my life, I feel like I'm just floating along. Everything feels completely hollow. 

Instead of being creative, instead of building lifelong friendships, instead of getting in shape, or writing an album, or a book. I've spent the last 2 and 1/2 years depressed, drunk, and jerking myself off. I should be writing music, I should take account of myself more, I should just *feel* more, I shouldn't be as skinny as I am, I should be writing more articles as a journalist and getting my name out there, but I can't and I don't know whats wrong with me. I've seen therapists, but most of them have told me I'm almost too smart to treat. They tell me I know too much about their methods or too much about philosophy for them to treat me in the way they would normally treat someone and we never get much further than that. Great I have all this intelligence potential, but it doesn't do me any good. 

I'm so afraid I'll spend all this time figuring it out and by the time I do all my opportunities will be behind me. I don't know what to do and I'm terrified. 

(unedited) 




 Her friends aren't my main friend group, but they're people who I'm becoming friends with through other mutual friends and events pretty quickly. I just don't think she's going to let it go. 




 Eh I mean, I'm still feeling raw from the breakup. There was a lot of potential there and she was the one who couldn't discuss anything and then just gave up, so I'd be lying to say I wasn't angry with her. 




 I've tried to be friendly, but she just tries to avoid me when I'm around, so I've taken up the same policy. I'm also not actively trying to get involved with her friend group, it just so happens that we're often in the same places and get along pretty well.  




 I wouldn't be rude to them. I'm actually kind of confused about how they feel about the breakup. Most of them have just been very warm, and from talking to them it seems like they think I was a good thing for my ex.  




 We never really were friend before. It went pretty quickly from casually dating to having sex, and then soon after that a relationship, so there wasn't a pre-friendship. 




 Nah she split up with me. I thought we could have talked it out. I haven't been caring too much what she thinks since she dropped me pretty harshly. I just don't want to be overstepping my bounds, and her friend's and I are getting pretty chummy. 




 My ex-girlfriend split up with me a few weeks ago and since then I've been keeping myself as busy as possible. I was pretty hurt by the breakup, but I really realized that I didn't want to fall into a slump because of it. My ex had serious problems communicating, she couldn't differentiate between a serious conversation and an argument, so I feel like a lot of responsibility for the relationship ending falls on her. This has helped me move on faster than I have in the past. 

I go to a small university where almost everyone knows everyone, or are in each other's social circles. Since the breakup I've been going out a lot, going to every party I get an invite to, and going to plenty of shows. 

Hard part is, a lot of my ex's close friends, and their friends, go to my school, so we see each other all the time. My ex doesn't go to this school, so I go to a lot more of these social events than her. I was really awkward about seeing them in the first few weeks, but since then I've actually been hanging out them quite a bit when we end up at the same event. They're great people and I think we get a long really well, in some ways I think I get along better with my ex's friends than I ever did with her. The thing is sometimes she shows up at events and I don't know how to navigate that. Should I just back off when she's around or keep up being social and friendly? I really don't feel like talking with her much. She's a very judgmental person. 

It's a tight social community, but should I keep up social contact with my ex's friends, even though I don't think either of us want the other one around right now?
---   
**tl;dr**: Ex broke up with me. I go to a small school with most of her friends, and me and her friends end up at a lot of the same events. My ex doesn't go to my school, but she's around since her friends go there. I like socializing with her friends, but I don't really want to be around her. What do you think can I do to manage this situation? 




 It's a dystopian future for a lot more people than just the Nazis. Not saying everything about how culture has changed is bad, but there are a lot of things about the globalist society that are dystopian.  




 Your dad sounds a lot like mine. He's an engineer who's great at his job, but emotional stuff just gets by him. As soon as I get on the phone with him, he'll talk about work for hours using technical details there's no way he could possibly expect me to understand. I think he's gotten better over the years, but with everything other than work in his life he's a bit absent-minded. I don't know if he's as awkward as your dad, but mine definitely has hi moments. I was having flashbacks during the whole time I was reading your post. 

All that being said, I know he loves my entire family, and he'll always do his best to be there for us.  




 I'm trying to avoid Canada Goose, just because it's what every other person wears here. I don't really want to stand out, but I've never really liked big labels on my clothing. 




 I'm looking for a parka that can keep out the cold. I've seen plenty of people recommending fishails, but I'm going to need something that can really keep the wet cold out. My upper limit for price is $500. Can you give me some suggestions? 




 This is completely anecdotal. I'm an arts major and top of most of my classes. I've never met a STEM student who wasn't struggling to keep their head above the water in arts courses. Both of my parents are successful mechanical engineers running large projects, and all my life they've told my brothers and I never to become engineers. From what I've learned from them and the people they work with, most people who go into engineering either go into it because they didn't have enough security to take something else, or they have poor social skills and are more happy looking at designs and blueprints than dealing with people.

 




 Actually really interesting you mentioned Boards of Canada with reflector. I've been getting a BOC vibe from the second half of Reflektor. Awful Sound has a that guitar part you mentioned, some of the textures in It's Never Over, the chimey synth sounds in the chorus of Porno, and the last 6 minutes or so of Supersymmetry. I'd say Arcade Fire have definitely listened to some BOC. 




 There are people from all over the world that share that list of qualities. I think what you just described is largely how humans behave when they don't think about what they're doing. Unfortunately it's easier for most people anywhere to not think. Making wide definitive statements that you only have personal experience to support is ignorant.  




 Yeah it's pretty much just exam time that I have a problem with, time management isn't too bad other then that. 




 I'm coming up to exams for university, and I have absolutely no time to get to the gym. two hours out of my day would throw off my schedule and make it difficult for me to complete the work I have to do for school. What can I do to help me manage exercise while I just don't have time for the next few weeks? 




 I don't have trouble speaking so much when I'm nervous about a certain thing but when I have a lot of background anxiety. The days where I feel like I'm on high alert all day for no reason I sound like I have a speech impediment. I stutter, mumble, and speak quieter than I normally do. I'll mix up my words or take a long time to find the word I was looking for.  




 Yea, I know what you're talking about. I definitely get that "click of a switch" feeling. 

It's not that there aren't people around who like you, it's that there aren't many people who think the same way as you. I don't think many people think about weighty subjects like; existence, religion and political ideologies that often.

I know that I think about those things a lot. So much so that it's almost as though I have a huge part of me that few people see. It's like there's a side of me that I hold back from most people, because they aren't interested in seeing it or are unable to engage it. Lately, I've been noticing how few people have serious opinions or have ideas that are important to them, and it makes me feel very detached. I can be in a crowd of people who like me, and have a great time with them talking about superficial things, but when I think about how much I internalize it makes me feel alone.  




 I don't have aspergers or adhd, but the symptoms caused by PTSD are very similar to those diagnoses. My parents weren't abusive, (though my mother could be emotionally I suppose) but they are serious professional types and were very emotionally neglectful. My family moved around a lot and I was left with a series of unstable babysitters, and was bullied severely by other kids. 

I started dissociating and dealing with that by just distracting myself with hobbies and pop culture. I had really deep knowledge in things like history and literature from a young age because I used those things to occupy myself from strong emotions and dissociation. These interests might have looked like "autistic interests", but they weren't, they were some mix of stress and being above average intelligence. I had anger problems and seriously over reacted to things through my preteen/early teen years, which definitly could have been mistaken for the "meltdowns" people with aspergers have. 

I had problems with concentration, but that was probably a mix of dissociation and stress. Blank stares and not being able to identify your own emotions are common symptoms for PTSD and Aspergers. 

All these things made it difficult for me to build relationships with other kids growing up. Not being in touch with my own emotions, dissociation, poor self-image, chronic escapism, anxiety and depression are all things I have to deal with because of my PTSD. 
 




 It really helps hide how much oatmeal there is in a smoothie. I usually put oatmeal and milk in the blender first, then I put a banana in and blend those three together, and once that's almost pureed I put in mix fruits and sometime some peanut butter. 

 




 Yeah I agree with this one, I just super blend 300g into 2 smoothies everyday. I've done 2 cups of oatmeal in one smoothie, I just had to let it soak in milk for a few minutes before blending. 




 Nuclear weapons. My brain just can't process that there actually exists weapons that can level cities and kill millions in the blink of an eye. We have the capability to ruin the whole planet if we wanted to, and I don't think we're capable of comprehending that.  




 I don't think men and women can be friends in the same way that they can with the same sex. I think sexuality really does get in the way of simply being friends with people of the opposite sex and similar sexual orientation. If people are single there's always the "why am I not having sex with _____?" or "Why would ______ have sex with ____ but not me?" More often then not someone develops feelings for the other person and then it's not really a "friendship" anymore and more  a relationship of unrequited feelings. I think having sex with friends really changes the relationship and usually messes it up.
