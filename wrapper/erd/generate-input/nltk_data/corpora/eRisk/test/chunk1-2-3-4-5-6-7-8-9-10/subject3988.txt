 From a design perspective, the 'For your home, business, family' and Get Started button need to be moved upwards a little. I'm not too into the photograph you used at the top of the page either, the edges look a bit scruffy. Other than that, not a bad design.  




 Can't tell if troll.. 
























 When you say you woke up and had to recall who the people in your house were, was it as extreme as having no memory of them at all or did you just feel strange and out of place, like it only just 'clicked' that each of them were members of your family? If you had memory loss and that still happens these days then you *need* to get it checked out. If its the latter though, I still occasionally feel like I'm half in my body and half out of it and everything seems out of place. You shouldn't worry about that too much.

Life can be pretty tough, believe me I've been through some shit. When you have real overwhelming depression the very concept of changing yourself and making your life better seems like an impossible task- I'm at college too and in darker times I've had days when I could barely make it out of bed and to the fridge to feed myself, as pathetic as that sounds, but the first step to recovering from a slump is to forgive yourself for any bad choices you have made and any time you felt too weak to make a change. You didn't gain any interests as a little kid, you never had a relationship, you feel like you are not in control of your life? That's ok! The past is the past, there's not a person alive who doesn't regret not doing a few things differently. 

As well as forgiving your past mistakes you need to be fully aware that there are some things you have control over. The very fact that somewhere deep down you would *like* to change is the biggest hurdle in many ways. Depending on your circumstances and how much motivation you can find you can alter your life more slowly or quickly, just try to do something rather than nothing. The 'no zero days' post on reddit really helped me (look it up!) I found that the biggest flaw with most motivational techniques is that they can pump you up and make you want to change the world but that feeling burns out pretty damn fast. The key is baby steps, make a little change each week and stick to it. This time next year you will have completely reshaped yourself.

So what can you do? Your mood is crap, you don't like the fact you are skinny and you'd like to find yourself a girl? Working out is a pretty decent remedy for all of these things. I'm not saying you should run out of the door now and sign up at your nearest gym. Just commit to doing some exercise. Whatever you are comfortable with- 10 push ups and crunches each morning before you shower, go out for a real short run after you get up. And slowly increase this. Think about your diet too, what you put into your body makes all the difference when it comes to your mood and appearance (again, baby steps, but stick with it). Take a full body picture before you start, take it today even, and then you can always look back on it and see how far you came.

You work six days each week, that leaves the occasional day off. Do *something* with it. Its important that you rest when you can but if you want more of a social life then go for it- call up old friends, join a club, ask people if they'd like to hang out that day. Find something to live for and look forward to that day. Similarly try to structure your daily routine so you have an hour or two each night to chill out, no excuses, you work extremely hard and you deserve that.

Thirdly, take some time to find direction. It doesn't matter what it is. A job you would like to do, a business you would like to start, a home you would like to have. Anything that you could aim for that would make your life a happier one. If you don't want to be a software engineer- fine. There are literally millions of people with degrees unrelated to the field they end up excelling in. The fact that you have a degree in a respected subject will help you, and the skills you learn may well become useful later down the road. Very few people know what they truly want to do in college, don't worry about that.

For anything you absolutely can't change, just keep in mind that everything will eventually pass. You have to struggle through college with no free time? In a couple of years college will be over. All you have to do is wait, your circumstances will change and you'll have a lot of free time to fill with any wild post-college plans you make now!

You have it rough, its understandable that you feel like you have a terrible life but I believe in you. I know you are going to get better, we don't know each other but I am counting on you to do something here. Plus, you may not realize it but you have a few really great weapons in your arsenal. You are nineteen for a start, you have barely begun. You could count the number of years in which you have actually had some major decision-making-control over your life on one hand. There is so much time for you to alter your course, just start now and you can absolutely do pretty much anything you set your mind to. You still have both of your parents- I'm 21 and have no real family around me, I know that you can use them somehow, even just for a shoulder to lean on now and then. You're in college, that puts you ahead of most people educationally. You have work experience that is going to look really good on your resume. It may seem like its all just a drag but take whatever you can from every shitty experience you have.

If there's one thing I've learnt from my years with depression its that no one's life is as good as it looks to the outside world, never compare yourself to others because its very rare that anyone is willing to reveal their dark side. Hey, if you looked me up on facebook you'd probably think I have a pretty awesome life. I'm at an ivy league university, have a few pictures of me hanging out drinking with friends and spent the last summer break travelling around the world with my girlfriend. Months later my depression was triggered badly and I couldn't leave my apartment, was self harming and came close to suicide. During that time I found out that a good buddy of mine was also self harming and extremely stressed from the workload. I recently took a psychology class where we did an anonymous test for depression and eating disorders. In our ivy league class of supposedly successful students over three quarters gave results that indicated moderate to severe depression and around fifteen per cent were classed as having an eating disorder. Don't sweat. I know that you are going to come out of this a great person. If you need anything at all feel free to PM me, I'm not on reddit as often as I'd like but I'll always get back to you. 




 I have started doing this recently. We just have to keep in mind that there is a difference between getting *drunk* and having a couple of beers after a hard day to help you keep pushing through. Set limits. 




 You are right, this is not ok at all. If they are being this unhelpful now they are probably not going to be reliable in the future- as a general rule I wouldn't keep a psychiatrist who didn't give me a means to contact them and receive a reply within twenty four hours, communication counts for a lot. 

If you only care about getting meds after one or two appointments this person may give you a repeat prescription (in which case it would not be particularly important to have regular meetings with them anyway) but a good psychiatrist should be more than just a guy who gives you access to drugs so I would keep reviewing your options and find out if there is any way you could see someone more accessible.

In any case, contact the office again and stress that it is extremely urgent and you need to be seen as soon as possible. No one should have to wait for months and months to be seen. 
























 Every young guy gets overly hung up on the idea of getting laid and kissing girls. I won't deny that it is fun, but it is nowhere near as important as society/the media makes it out to be. The annoying thing is you won't truly accept that, regardless of how many times you are told, until you get laid, look back and see for yourself. Vacations are also fun experiences, but there is no need to feel suicidal if you haven't got to travel yet, it will just come later. There is so much more to life.

What's more, it isn't as if *everyone* around you is getting laid like you think. That's just another misconception- sex is sensationalized to such a degree very few people your age will openly tell you they are virgins even if they are. I can think of a few guys I know in their mid 20s who have never had sex and there is nothing wrong with them, they are decent looking, have normal social lives, college degrees and good jobs, it just didn't happen yet with them. (Thinking back I had short, sexual relationships with two women before my current long term girlfriend and if I would have chosen to stay at home the night I met these girls, or approached other, less interested, people instead there is every chance I would be in the same situation as you). Don't be too hard on yourself. 

Having said all this, there are plenty of ways you can increase your chances of finding yourself a girl. Get out there more and increase your social circle by going to local events, classes or bars with your friends. Go to the gym and pay attention to the clothes, shoes, hairstyle etc. that you present yourself with. Have hobbies and interests outside of just hanging out with friends/girls so that you have other things to focus on while you're single and something to talk about with your girl when you eventually meet her. Hell, there are even apps now that let you speak to girls in your local area who rate you as attractive! Use them for practice if anything.

The best advice I can give you is to chill out. Don't be obsessed with girls, don't be obsessed with yourself (as this shooter was, though obviously that was a problem with his own mental health) and find a few cool hobbies that will give you something else to do and make you look interesting to the girls you meet in the future.  




 I think people from Europe generally have a completely different perspective from Americans when it comes to timescale. Growing up in England my childhood home was built in the 1840s, and that isn't at all uncommon. The school I went to was founded in the early 1600s. European cities often contain buildings that are *thousands* of years old so we can truly appreciate how short our lives are in the grand scheme of things. My mum knew people who were around at the same time as Abraham Lincoln.. its really not that long ago at all.

Edit: Just did some reading and found out that if my old school was in the United States it would be the 11th oldest building in the country and my town's little church would be top 5. Crazy. 




 Hey man, you're right, life sucks real bad sometimes. We've all screwed up at some point, we all have regrets. Its not healthy to keep thinking back to the past. 

I have a little experience with what you've been through. I messed up and my best friend, the girl I thought I'd be with forever, broke up with me aged 18. It was hell on earth at the time because she cut me entirely out of her life and for a very long time I thought about her every single day. Looking back, the fact that we had no contact after the break up is one of the best things that could have happened for me. It may be tough to hear but it sounds like she really doesn't want to be with you, and that is her choice. You are young. There are literally billions of other girls in the world and if you keep pushing through things will change. You will start to move on. It may take years, but you will find someone else and you will be happy again. And when it happens you can look back and thank yourself for holding on in the darkest times to allow a better future to arrive.

She'll always have a place in your heart. The first girl you fell in love with will always be a special thing in your life, you'll never really forget her but you will slowly move on and the strong feelings will pass. Trust me when I say there is someone else out there who you *will* love in the future, they *will* love you back and, if you want to, you *will* spend your lives together- and it will be far more special than this first girl. 

Cut her out of your life. Allow yourself to slowly move on no matter how long it takes and how much you want to give in. You will have a bigger chance at love. It happened for me and everyone I know, it will happen for you. You just need to eventually find the strength to go out there and get it. 
























 There are thousands of entrepreneurship blogs, forums and websites- general ones, like this, to niche ones that serve specific fields. Why is yours special?

Please realize that your question is the equivalent of asking 'I am thinking of starting a restaurant that is strictly for Greek food, what do you guys think..?!'. That's why you got the responses you did.

 




 Britain's losing ground in recent years is largely a result of its economic structure, the fact it relies heavily on financial services- an area that was obviously shaken hard by the recession. Now that we are exiting the downturn the UK is definitely not losing ground anymore, in fact it is growing faster than any other western economy, has had GDP forecasts increased and will shortly overtake France, perhaps I overestimate the rate of growth but there is little dispute that the UK will be ahead of France in the next few years. (See recent IMF reports, laid out with some quite nice graphics [here](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/10752204/UK-will-be-fastest-growing-economy-in-the-G7-this-year.html)!)

Obviously it is more difficult to forecast economic conditions further ahead but various sources suggest the UK will lead Europe's economies. [The Centre of Economics and Business Research](http://www.cebr.com/reports/cebr-world-economic-league-table/) comes to mind among others.
On the assumption that the Euro holds, Germany drops from the 4th largest economy in 2013 to the 6th largest in 2023 and 2028. For France the drop is more precipitous  from 5th in 2013 to 8th in 2018 to 10th in 2023 to 13th in 2028. Similarly Italy drops from 8th in 2013 to 15th in 2028 and Spain from 13th in 2013 to 18th in 2028. 

Interestingly, if the euro broke up Germany would fare rather better in the analysis. 




 Huh? Are you writing this from 2002? I'd never vote for le Front National and I enjoy some of the EU's benefits, but not *even* Greece?

The fact that the euro has one interest rate that's too high for some places and too low for others has hugely prolonged economic decline and mass unemployment at one end of the spectrum and encouraged bubbles in the Spanish and Irish property markets at the other end. 

Even putting the economy aside, in the midst of their crisis Brussels made a joke out of democracy in Italy, pressuring the EU commissioner Mario Monti in as Prime Minister and *cheering* as he appointed a new government that contained not a single elected politician.

A Civitas report last week showed that the United Kingdom (I don't personally know what the deal is for other economies) has not seen *any* more trade advantages as an EU member than it would have as a non-member.

The EU has its benefits, but what you say about it being good for every country involved is just not true. Plus, the UK economy will overtake France's this year and is on a trend to be the leader of Europe by 2030, with the pound. 
























 It takes more muscles to have your mouth open than to keep it closed!

First time that fact has actually come in useful for me..! 




  Kick yourself in the ass to get up, be positive, and look at today as a whole new day of opportunity everywhere you go! No one is going to do it for you. You are the only one in your way. So what are you waiting for?

I'm 99% sure that you are not a working psychologist, though there must be a few bad ones out there. I'm 100% sure you have never been through depression. That is absolutely not how it works.. you are telling someone who appears to have a chemical imbalance in their brain to 'snap out of it'. People with depression will struggle desperately to get out of bed, take a shower or do some work for hours. OP even tells you he struggles for two hours each day to stand up- if he could just get over that don't you think he has tried it already? 

As someone who was clinically depressed I thought I was lazy for a very long time, but it didn't make sense to me because I tried so hard  and wanted to do so badly the things that I used to do with ease. Shame on you for not admitting your ignorance and possibly making this guys struggle even worse. He needs medical help and therapy to assist that medical help, not this pseudopsychology 'just think positive!' crap. 




 As someone who has actually gone through clinical depression and generalized anxiety disorder, I think it is fair to say that for most people it isn't laziness. I have had days where I have sat in front of a computer trying to will myself to work for twelve hours straight and just can't, full on wrestling matches with myself in my own head to try to get out of bed. After a while of this stuff piling up you deserve to acknowledge that you are mentally ill, give yourself a break and not be labelled lazy. I'm not sure the 'psychologist' really knows what they are talking about, no serious psychologist/psychiatrist I have seen has ever gone down that route with me.

Take some time for getting better. Keep working out. Try meditation for focus (its easy to learn a few techniques online and it helps to train you to take control over your own mind). Get into a daily routine as best you can. Most people go through 4, 5, 6 different medications to find one that works for them because everyone's brains develop differently so keep going with that. Most of all, stay positive. It will pass eventually, try not to focus on your depression too much, keep treating it and eventually this will pass no matter what shit you have to go through between now and then. Maybe you'll have to take a regular job for a short while, who cares? You will always have time to start another business in the future. 
























 Five (though possibly more to come) schools, containing in total over 1000 pupils, were found to have been 'taken over' by Muslims with extremist beliefs. The classrooms were covered in posters written only in Arabic, they were heavily pressured to fast and there are reports of any non Muslim children being insulted by teachers, particularly regarding the way they dressed. Islam was covered extensively in the curriculum but Christianity was never touched on. Known extremists were brought in to speak to the kids. Some school governors have been removed but there are fears it's a lot more widespread as parents have now made hundreds of accusations. 




 Thats the thing about depression, it wears you dowj and takes away your hope of recovery. I had a really bad reaction to lexapro and refused treatment for a while after that, but most people I speak to say medication eventually helped them once they found the right one. You dont want to live the rest of your life like this so consider leaving all treatment options available, particularly ones that are known to have helped millions of people like meds. All I can think to recommended other than that is a book- Self-Coaching: The Powerful Program to Beat Anxiety and Depression: How to Heal Anxiety and Depression by Joseph J Luciani. I haven't read it personally but a friend of mine did a few months ago and swears by it.

Good luck 




  We don't have a contract yet

That's really what it comes down to. As far as I can see through what you have written you have no legal protection. What work have you put into the business exactly? 

Unfortunately it is looking like you've messed up big time by getting other people involved and still not doing any legal work at all. Technically, the idea isn't yours. He can use it and produce it as his own business, its a shitty move but it happens all the time.

As others have said, threaten to sue. Talk to anyone who could help you put together a legal (or even legal looking) threat about this and generally scare the shit out of him. Tell him that you will ensure any investors are aware of these legal threats. 

If possible perhaps you could quickly set up a competitor (I guess you understand the business better than him and coders are easy to find). 
























 A leaked report regarding Park View school has been [obtained by the BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-27757987) 

 This highly-critical report found a classroom culture in which Park View School was not welcoming to non-Muslim pupils. It described a "madrassa curriculum" in PHSE (personal, social, health and economic) lessons and "posters written in Quranic Arabic in most of the classrooms visited"... and there were claims of an inappropriate external speaker being brought it to talk to pupils.

If you Google it there are plenty of pictures of the classrooms on the school's website too. 




 The vast majority of schools in the UK, regardless of if they are fee paying, have uniforms. The schools involved are all non fee paying, taxpayer funded. Blazers (in the summer) and headscarves are not a compulsory part of the uniform for obvious reasons but the few little girls who didn't totally cover themselves were openly referred to as the 'white prostitutes'.

 'Matthew 5:17 Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.' The new testament by no means conveniently invalidates the old testament, Jesus fully supports the old testament and often refers to it.  




 How about Ericsson, HM, Skype, Spotify, Soundcloud, TicTail, Electrolux (the worlds second largest home appliances manufacturer), AstraZeneca..? on top of your IKEA and Volvo. When you take population size into account Stockholm is one of the most entrepreneurial cities on the planet. The rich are taxed highly, but still have luxury lifestyles and the highest standard of living in the world, and the money is spent responsibly to help the poor and unconnected become successful too instead of leaving them out in the cold.  




 Nope. Carlin is right. IQ tests use 100 as the *median* score. Half are above, half are below. 
























 .................. 




  fulfill

to realize, perform or do, as duty; obey or follow, as commands 




 "Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets.  I have come not to abolish but to fulfill them.  Amen, I say to you, **until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest part or the smallest part of a letter will pass from the law, until all things have taken place**." 

Jesus breaking old testament laws while he claims to be here to fulfill them is just another case of the bible's contradictions. That's pretty amazing mental gymnastics to spin that as a good thing for Christianity!  
























 What has happened in your life that you can read the stories of child abuse victims and decide to write comments picking on their vocabulary? 




 I didn't say they are all victims of child abuse, I'm sure many are not, but its clear to see there are lots of people there who are. The whole 'Nmom' or 'Ndad' thing is used in all kinds of psych forums and support groups to highlight the abuser, I just found it strange you felt compelled to say you found that to be 'crap'. They need help and support not a slap in the face.  




  I also hate the whole "N" crap 

You hate the short hand terminology used by victims of child abuse to discuss their experiences..? That's what you took from that sub? What the hell.
