 Having a good friend who spent a year trying to find a job after getting a BS in Ag   Biosystems and then an MS in BME, probably not, go for the full PhD.  However, the BME program at my school has a habit of kicking out PhD students who are "under qualified," "problematic," or that they "just don't like" making the MS degree relatively worthless here.

On the bright side, my friend is now studying for a PhD with full funding in Barcelona, Spain.  

The best advice either of us would give you is to not do something too specific.  Do not pigeonhole yourself into a technique that is so specialized and useful in only one way that you're a grain of salt in a pile of sand looking for the other grain of salt.

 They should use this book instead of the sex-ed course materials.  Students would learn something.  If not about sex, then about the world around them as an engineer sees it.

Though the students may be laughing too hard by the end to pay attention if they did learn the engineering parts. 




 In my experience as a Biosystems Engineering grad student, BME students just go to grad school and focus on microbiology or optics a lot more than anything you've talked about.  If you want to do prosthetics, find a professor at a different university and consider the field that his/her appointment is in (whether it's EE, ME, BME, etc).

The two things you mention are very different, so you may want to decide on smart prosthetics (going to be more EE and ME oriented) or the medical substances (probably more BME or material science engineering). 
























 Prosciutto pizza!?! That's pretty classy

 Just came across these recently and my molecular bio isn't as strong as it should be.  Seems like a new way to treat antibiotic resistant bacteria and other things like Marburg and muscular dystrophy.  How does it work  and why is it better than antibiotics? 




 If only the ISS would test this... 




 This is true. I've seen some truly messed up models as a result of humidity in the support and/or the model material while it's printing.  All you can do is get a new spool and reprint. 









 It'd be nice if they didn't have to use a laser to create the surface.  What I mean by this is that they have to post-process the material after the sheet is made which is going to add to the cost.  The process by which the metal is 'cast' does not produces this surface. 




 In my experience with 3D printed materials, the layers are not laid down perfectly flat on one another and there is a capillary force that pulls liquids through (this applies to FDM, I have no experience with other technologies).  It's possible that if the plastic was heated a little bit closer to being in a liquid state rather than closer to being in a solid state as it is laid down that this might solve the problem, but then things might get runny. 

Also that there is a scaffold interior instead of a solid material isn't going to help with the out gassing problem (I'm assuming you mean the gas in the interior of the part is coming out of the part not the material itself is off gassing). Perhaps if a part was printed solidly it would be less noticeable as the space would be filled with material. 




 How would you adapt today's technology towards medical applications that require sterilization either of bulk material or the final printed product such that they can be FDA approved? Are new materials that aren't currently printed with necessary or is something like PLA that is widely used capable to fill this void? 




 Do you mind some old PDFs from when I took a SolidWorks class?

 So this seems to be kind of an odd problem that is currently driving me crazy.  Basically what happened is that my school (university) converted all student email accounts to the Gmail based ones that are great and last forever.  When I graduated, I was hired temporarily by my adviser while I hunted for a job.  Because of this, my email account was converted to a Microsoft Exchange account.  This means I log into an Outlook Web App to check my email instead of going through the Gmail login.  On my phone, I can't add the new account as an exchange account because it makes a duplicate.  Now I have to use multiple email clients on my phone despite there now being support for Exchange.

The reason I don't just delete the account now that I have a job and don't use it much is that I have all my purchases, subscription (All Access) and that sort of stuff tied to the old Gmail account that I used from my university.  

Is there any way to have the account on my phone, but get the Exchange emails (which may or may not go back to the Gmail account, no one seems able to tell me)? 
























 Not exactly. UV-A refers to UV closer to the blue spectrum while UV-B refers to wavelengths slightly shorter than the ones considered UV-A and UV-C is in between UV-B and X-ray I believe...wikipedia...http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet#Subtypes
 




 What would be a theoretical time scale for something like this occurring? (not in real life, but if the gif were in years, how many?) 




 You'll get better at it as you go, so start with what you can manage, then do something else. As you work through it, what you can do will probably increase. Also, not knowing your major, you don't always need to read the whole article to understand what they're claiming and how they did it. This is a big time saver.

Also, organize your stuff. Whether it's Mendeley (my favorite), Endnote, ReadCube, or another program, don't just have a folder on your desktop or documents folder with PDFs floating around. You'll never be able to find anything or you'll take too much time organizing it for it to be effective. 




 I worked with the base uPrint model in grad school and we went off the service plan and there were a ton of issues. I replaced the print head, the chamber fans, the tips (this is more of a they need it eventually thing), and I've even taken the print head off and put it in an oven to get support material that leaked to soften enough so I could hit it with a hammer while it cooled so the thing would switch between the two heads.

When they work, they work great. When they don't, they're awful.

The thing that happened at the base is surprisingly common I would say. Also, the base plates are reusable. Completely. You can either dissolve the material off or take a chisel to it (carefully) and any material will pop off. 




 After spending lots of time on here (and time elsewhere such as Google) I've come up with nothing. 

I'm looking for a 3D printer that can print in wax and ABS/PLA (not necessarily at the same time and not necessarily both ABS/PLA) for work. I know there are printers that will do one or the other, but I haven't found anything. I think the closest has been one of Stratasys's printers but those are ridiculously expensive and my experience in Graduate school left me jaded (Dimension uPrint).

Any help would be much appreciated 




 I had SolidWorks available to me in graduate school and would always add material properties to stuff until it looked the way I wanted and then I would have SolidWorks render the image in 3D and it always looked nice, but may not be as great for chemistry type figures 




 Here's a link to the abstract for anyone who wants it. I haven't been able to read the article yet, but will be doing so sometime today:

Edit: Ok, so I read through the paper and it is interesting, and it does work quite well, but I'm a bit concerned that they're using 1 L of blood as their sample. The tests were compared with traditional tests and found results of sensitivity and specificity that ranged from 100%-77% and 91%-82%.

It seems like a good platform, and yes, current tests today may be less than $34 each, but the start up costs and training are what are the problems IMO. They also said that after clinical trials they were able to improve sensitivity by increasing the antibody spotting concentration on the gold nanoparticles, but that seems kind of obvious.

First time ever. Also watched the movie. 




 Thanks for the review. I'm generally a fan of what they do, but recently it's been a bit of a struggle bus.  It's unfortunate this one didn't live up to their past work, especially V and The Matrix.  Guess I'll probably wait till Netflix or RedBox have it 




 Knowing people who did it and paid for more than I did (I had auto insurance/cell phone covered by parents cause it was convenient and didn't cost them much extra) it's quite possible.  Basically make your own food as much as possible and avoid going out, don't get TV; stick with Netflix, avoid movie theaters.  Traveling is kind of out of the picture, except maybe once per year as is new technology.

Also, live somewhere cheap.  I lived in Tucson where the $15K-$25K stipend is enough. If you pick a place like New York, it won't be and that'll be difficult.

 Sometimes I wonder if more cities (or civil contractors) talked about strategies to deal with what weather does to roads and other infrastructure we'd have a lot better roads. Example: Phoenix has great roads IMO after living there for 18 years. Tucson does not, after living there for 7. The climate is nearly identical and the road quality is significantly different. (Yes, I know, taxes pay for roads and Phoenix has more)

 Fewer threats does not mean more secure 




 After working in college tech support for students, I found that Macs were not more secure, just malware writers didn't give a fuck about them because they couldn't make as much money because there weren't enough of them.

 Sorry, this is long, but here goes:

Recent grad here, just finished my PhD in Biosystems Engineering and found a job in industry (on the other side of the country, it's snowing. It's not supposed to snow in March.)

Anyway, I probably had a very different graduate school experience than you are having, but let me tell you about what I do. During my undergraduate time I started working with my advisor (academic) and told him I was more interested in working in industry than academia. I continued to work for him as an undergraduate for about 2 years before getting my BS. I was planning to go to graduate school. That was always part of the plan.

The work I ended up doing in his lab my senior year ended up carrying into my graduate degree and that helped me get through it a little quicker. My first year I had some crazy hours. Shitty pay, that never improved. One calendar year I received a full graduate student in engineering stipend. After that year, I settled into a rhythm a bit and got started on a new project. Which was good, as I was over the one that had carried on from undergrad.

After about 2 years on that project I was fucking done with it too. It was going nowhere. Another guy in my lab had been working on something similar for about a year before I started and his seemed to work better (from a fundamentals thing as I was working the alternative design). Finally we got enough data (we thought) to publish mine and that would represent my 3rd paper (I'm leaving one out because it was a side project that ended up working really well.) My committee decided I should graduate in the middle of June and I defended at the end of July. July sucked. A lot. All during this my advisor was very results oriented. He knew we got paid for 20 hours. He didn't care if it took us 10 hours a week of work to get something done if the results were real and what we were hoping for. Sitting around reading meaningless papers is a waste of time

I eventually found a job while working on some random stuff in my lab and helping them move from one building to the next. I was lucky, my advisor was willing and able to pay me.

The new job, me in a totally different climate, going from hot as balls to cold as fuck has been very different for me. There still are proposals, but your role in that can be as much or as little in the writing process as you want. Backing up a little, I work for a small company now that relies largely on SBIR grants and that sort of thing. The goal is to use one or more of these to get something that works to market and sell infinity and drop the mic. It scares me a little (scared me moving 1800 miles) but they're attached to a slightly larger company that's been more stable as they've been around for 30+ years. Now, at my new company, I'm expected to work 40 hours per week. Not 9-5 or whatever, just 2 weeks that average 40 hours. I have a ton of flexibility with my schedule. Meetings are expensive, especially when there are 7 PhDs present.

A few things to keep in mind:
Your advisor sounds crazy. I have a friend in BME who has an advisor a bit like yours (mostly with the random fucking e-mails). Basically you have to get across to him that you plan to do what he asks, in a reasonable time frame. Him expecting you to have work done at 11 that he asked about at 9 on a Sunday is not a reasonable time frame. If it were a weekday, sure, maybe.
2-3 meetings a day is incredibly inefficient. Do everything you can to cut that back to like once per week for 2 hours if necessary.
Why do you feel the need to keep the same hours as him? He gets paid a lot more than you do. You get paid for 20 hours/week (usually). Keep that in mind. Also keep in mind that you need to get your work done to graduate, BUT without killing/burning yourself out.
In my experiences working with PhDs from industry (we got more industry backed funding than anything else), you get a bit of both worlds. You have some who absolutely dont take their work home and some who obsess over it. Both are successful.

TL;DR: Post academia can be pretty much what you want it. I had a reasonable advisor and managed to find a job that gives me flexible scheduling. Your advisors an asshat who doesnt know how to manage people. 

Start looking for a job now. Dont necessarily tell him cause he might freak out

 I recently moved from Arizona to Ohio. It's good. This shift is meaningless, though at the moment I'd prefer "savings time" rather than standard time just because it's not quite sundown when I go home around 5.

 I used to always buy Intel, and it worked great. Still works great. My 7.5 year old laptop still runs very manageably for most things, including 720P video (1080P is a bit of a struggle). Then I read an article about how much of an asshole they are when I was working on an HTPC about a month ago. I went with AMD (they also have better integrated graphics IMO) and it's been running amazing and was probably half the price of a comparable Intel chip 









 Yes, exactly 




 So is this original theatrical edition, special edition, or special Lucas edition? 




 This seems cool for the elderly and those with lower leg muscular diorders/degeneration/other.

As an example person: when I was an RA in my undergrad, we had a girl who was usually in a wheel chair, but we would occasionally see her walking around (mostly just the building) with the elbow supported braces. Once she decided to walk to the Student Union. Not far by healthy individual standards, like a 2-3 minute walk. We had to call medical services to have someone pick her up/take her scooter to her because she was so exhausted by the trip she couldn't get up.
This would have helped her a lot, especially when she over exerted herself. 




 Why don't they ever combine these sorts of things with a battery rather than trying to replace the battery? Seems like you could store the charge in the (super)capacitor, let it discharge into the battery to charge that or be used by that in real time to slow the discharge.

Seems like if that worked all you'd have to do is tap your phone on the wireless charging mat for 5 minutes to load the (super)capacitor then walk away as it slowly discharges through or into the battery 




 Better farming practices would include implementing drip irrigation systems instead of flood irrigation where most of the water is lost to evaporation. Sure it would be expensive to implement, but the water savings and should pay for it quickly and the yield would not be diminished. 




 I can honestly say books are a part of the reason I'm with my current girlfriend.  *The Name of the Wind* and *The Wise Man's Fear* specifically. They kinda helped kick things off and get us to really start talking 




 No, it doesn't. If, for example, an army base has no walls or security than another army base, but people are trying to get into the other army base more often, it does not mean the first base is more secure. It means that fewer people want to get in. While that does mean a lower chance of being compromised, as you say, that does not mean more secure.

More secure means that if there is an attack, or whatever, you can block it and not be compromised. Maybe that's through being more difficult to infiltrate or some other method, but a simple lack of attacks does not mean more secure 




 Being in a rental, I think I have only CFL or LEDs, definitely not incandescent. I'm not sure how to tell the difference cause I can't see the inside (where the CFL coils would be) cause they're all frosted 




 The problem is that the studios won't accept the message that is being sent. To make it easily accessible and affordable does not make sense to them. If they did that, then RIAA and MPAA would be meaningless because people would actually pay a fair-market price and they'd have no one to sue. 

Also, based on the current model of people buying stuff they wouldn't get as much money, because more people won't buy a cheaper product (according to them). The same exact number will, cause that makes sense based on price. 
























 The post says they're from Beacon. Makes me think of RWBY, which then makes me sad

 Here's the original article (through 2 links, the article above cites another news article)

 Maybe, organs have to be healthy, and people have to die. We're getting good at preventing death while not being healthy. 

TBH, every time I've had to go to get a new driver's license since I turned 18 (so twice now...AZ licenses expire when you turn 65), I've been verbally asked if I would like to be a donor (which of course, is yes). I'd be interested in seeing how many organ donors there are in developed nations to put this type of "we need an opt out system" in perspective. 




 I think some people may have religious qualms. Such as: keeping the body together after death (putting them in an urn is considered together). I remember hearing that spreading your ashes across some space (ocean, space, etc) was not considered a Catholic burial in high school 




 In all likelihood this study was funded before the original paper had been debunked and thus the money was already "spent." While unfortunate that funds are allocated this way, it does help maintain normalcy. 




 I get shocked a lot, despite moving to a much more humid climate 




 Having been shocked by 1200V and 15kV sources (separately) that run in the microamp range, you'll fucking feel it, for hours. Just an odd tingling sensation after the initial "Oh fuck that hurts!" as it's burning you goes away. 




 That was going to be my exact comment. 




 Honestly, I can never get through all those carrots (seriously, most other things I can). Maybe this would allow them to sell in smaller quantities so I don't waste it 




 How does this help with produce? 




 Usually the factored in cost here, with regard to human cost, is [quality adjusted life years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year). At least that's according to those in public health, so who knows if they have people's best interest in mind?/s 




 So I had the same adviser for undergrad and graduate school and went straight through to get my PhD in Biosystems Engineering. In undergrad I told him I wanted to get a PhD and was open to both options. When I got into grad school I told him that I was more interested in working in industry. We worked a lot with industry. In fact, they were our primary funding source for most, if not all, the time I was in grad school.

He always tried to steer me a bit towards academia, but I always told him, and my committee, that I was more interested in industry. We actually spent a fair amount of time talking about it, which was very valuable. One of my professors spent a large portion of his career in industry and then moved back to academia when he was older and I'd say he's one of the better professors for having that experience.

One thing to keep in mind is that while publications don't necessarily matter in industry, getting them in grad school does matter to industry (if that's the track you take. I had a friend to an MS in aerospace that never published and it was totally fine because he did a big design project or something). The thing is, it's a good experience, IMO, to have some less than random person who is supposed to be anonymous rip through something you've worked on for months-years in an attempt to make it better.

Now, when it came time to graduate last August, you can bet your ass I was looking at Academic Keys for a PostDoc position as much as I was looking for a job through Indeed.com, BMES, etc. I ended up getting a research/development job in industry that, so far, has turned out quite well. Everyone told me "Remember where you came from," when I told them (I also moved 1800 miles), but also congratulations. I think being open with them about what you hope to do is going to benefit you because if the professor(s) have been around for a little while, they've had a student with similar, if not identical thoughts. 




 That's what I've never understood when IMF/WB/US go into a country that has comparatively 0 GDP. Why not work with them through investments that actually lift people out of poverty so they can then ask for more money to build nicer things and make everyone more money. I know this is extremely simplified, but it seems like a win win. 




 I ask my friends "can't or won't?" a lot. They all watch Archer and usually it's both. 
























 This isn't legal everywhere. In some places only one person has to know they're being recorded (I'm looking at you AZ) but in others, both do for it to be legal.

 Well, they don't "procreate" as we experience it. This is part of why it's difficult to classify them as alive or dead. They increase in number, like something alive,, but require a host to make the copies for them, unlike something that is alive. In this way they are somewhat like parasites, except those usually increase in number through their own means and just use the host for nutrients or some other way that benefits the parasite.

 It's very interesting to me how increasingly often, recently, we'll target the body's pieces that are being taken advantage of by a pathogen rather than the actual pathogen. The body isn't about to change to blockers like the pathogen can in response to antivirals or antibiotics.
