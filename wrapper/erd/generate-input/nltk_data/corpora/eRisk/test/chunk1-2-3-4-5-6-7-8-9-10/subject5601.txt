 Haven't watched it, but will try in the near future.
 
























 The thing I don't understand is where they got the idea that it wasn't a good pizza, I thought it was good, and would have been better if I had paid attention to the recepies an cut the dough in half. I lost the old recepie I had when I moved about a year ago, so now it's experimenting till I find it or stumble across a new better one. Thanks for the offer I'll keep it in mind in the future.  




 Who said this wasn't a good pizza? I liked it alot, the only screw up I had is I didn't read the dough recepie right and didn't cut the portion in half. So my pizza is about 1 1/2 inches tall, otherwise  SOOOOOO fucking good.

 It's a old horror film so the legality falls to them 





























 This is mainly an experiment to begin with, for this size Aerogrow big plants aren't recomended but I want to see how small I can keep the big plants through trimming even if I force it low and over to the side I'll be happy, but if things start not looking good in a few weeks I'll transplant them out and put the bigger palnts in some pots I have as backup. Then I'll just put them out on the balcony and just let them be for the rest of the season. From then on I'll just stick to the recomended plants for the contraption. I've been gardening outdoors since I was a kid but I wanted to see what I could get away with indoors. Later I might try some dwarf varieties to see how they will fare.
