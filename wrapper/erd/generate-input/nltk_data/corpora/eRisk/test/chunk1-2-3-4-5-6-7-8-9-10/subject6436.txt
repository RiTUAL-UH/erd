 I would rather have a friend who has problems with self pity than a friend who had a dark triad personality with no self pity. 




 Using a blue spectrum hydroponic grow bulb is the solution to treating MRSA infections. Treated my last three infections this way.  




 You too buddy. Over and out.  




 Thanks for link. New to redditt. Love it. Find smart and weird people. 




 Language is the greatest invention of mankind but it is also our biggest brainwasher. I like to close my eyes and think of ideas, abstract concepts,and thought experiments through visualization.
It uses a different part of the brain than language
 This overcomes the limations and creative blocks that language puts my the mind under. I invented several ideas with  this method. Tesla use to do this. Would be neat , but not sure how possible, if in the future visualization could be incorporated into language. 









 Forgot what we where talking about.  Where you talking about bypassing laguage or entering black hole to another universe in the next couple hundred years? 




 Have an abstract idea how this could be done. 




 That is near black hole not in black hole. LoL. Do you think black holes could be connected to other universes. Known Quantum math doesn't work in Black holes so I am asking questions just to ask questions. Have any crazy ideas.  




 I know stupid question but a least I understand topic a little. 




 Thank you link. I will check  it out.
 




 Good response. I should have made question with out serious.  I think maybe our universe it connected to a black hole of parent universe. Not sure. Just crazy idea 




 Who is Jayden? New to reddit. Is this inside joke. 




 I think science is wrong. It is not cause and effect but causes and effects. Science is the best we have but don't sell me that the cause and effect solution 100% reflects the real world. I call science a "good enough" tool. Correlation is not causation. 




 Language is flawed. 




 Is there time in a black hole?

 




 Good answer. Just making sure you where not a fundamentalist. 




 I am 99% sure of many things but am not 100% sure of anything. 




 Is that your opinion you seem so sure you are correct. Half my mind says yes the other half no 









 I think the way to fix our campaign finance laws is for there to be a law that states only a US citizen can give money for the campaign of his/her district. Why should someone like Donald Trump, the Koch brothers, or George Soros be able to give to a represative of Montana. Also, these donations should be made Public record. No donations from international organizations like corporations or unions allowed.

 Well said. New to reddit. People seem smart here. I think I might have found a new addiction. 




 Show zero fear. Then calmly say, " Go ahead, but you will spend the rest of you life in prison if you go ahead with this". Most killers are physchopaths and enjoy inflicting pain on emotional people. You have to show no emotion and remind him what will happen to him if he goes ahead.  




 I would say odd are that this is not true but this idea would not go against quantum physics.  




 I would say most likely no also but I had a crazy dream where in my dream I thought this was true. In my dream, I realized that the moment of the big bang was the moment of formation of the black hole of parent universe.  




 Crazy talk or possible? 




 In the future, 3D printing will be useful in making  space structures in orbit around the earth. Printing a bridge is a cool first step toward using 3D printers for use in building structures in orbit, the moon, and mars. 




 How can it be a "leaked" document. I think this language is a little over the top. The term "leaked" is primary used  to describe documents that are given to the public that contain things that organizations or governments want to keep secret. Not the church's pre-mature release of doctrine, policy, or future speechs talking points.  




 It is about truth in advertising and freedom of choice. I don't care what the expert opinion is on GMO's.  Many health related issues that where considered fact in the past  are now called into question. Also, the genes of humanity are not monolithic. Some people have rare adverse reactions too things of which the reason is not currently understood. For this reason, labeling and having GMO free places too eat like Chipotle is a good thing. 









 I wonder if a food company could breed these ants, grind them up,   extract the chemical that produces this smell, and then use it as a food additive. Never know, someone might convince high society it is the new status symbol food additive.
 




 Many people say " I don't do anything wrong so why should I care".
There was a film about east germany when it was communist. In the movie, one of the local party bosses had the hots for the wife of one of the films characters . He told the secret service to spy on him to find some "dirt" on him so he could lock him up and have his way with his wife. He couldn't find anything so he used the private information of his phone conversations to frame him. 
" Power corrupts" and " absolute power corrupts absolutely ".
So get a warrent unless you want to live in a police state. If you don't think this couldn't happen in the United States your fooling yourself. Would you like all your phone calls keep in a central database where even your local sheriff could listen to them. This is where this is heading in the future if not stopped.

 Don't need too understand the language to get the point. 









 I used a combination treatment of 400nm blue spectrum light from a hydroponic grow bulb, a topicial mixture of bezethonium cloride and epson salt, and alternation hot and cold. Each of these ideas have some known medicial benefit and are covered in peer reviewed scientific papers. My idea was to combine all three and get the 400nm blue spectrum light from a 1000 watt hydroponic grow bulb. Treated my last three MRSA infections  this way.  









 Someone should talk about the lady who helped these dogs. Bravo lady.  




 Please be civil people our furry friends would want us too be.

 




 If China can regulate population through there one child policy surely they can regulate the treatment of dogs. They lack the political will. The west should force policy change and connect trade agreements with policy change.  




 There was a scientific study that concluded that for every dollar we spent on NASA we received over 9 dollars on long term GDP growth. 




 This is a perfect example of why we need to fund large national scientific projects. This is why we need visionary leadership who understand the long term return on investment on projects like CERN.

 Good positive story. 




 Kitty need some love.  




 Work of love. 




 Does not look good. 




 Please do and give me the results. Google 400nm light and look at the peer review research. It is called blue light therapy. It is already FDA approved for the treatment of acne. 




 I used three ideas that are known to have some useful benefit but when combine together work amazingly well for me. I am trying to get the scientific community interested in idea. Don't want any money. Jonas Salk style. 




 Yes it is a combination of three things. I invented it myself. Check out link. http://mrsafoundation.com/matthew-mcpherson/ 




 There is peer reviewed studies that say that 400nm light may help kill MRSA. I am the first person too think of using a grow bulb to produce this type of light.  Works like a charm. 




 It is a blue spectrum grow bulb when used in conjunction with bezethonium cloride treated my last three mrsa superbug infections. I am not joking. 









 Please no trolling  









 Yea and he will save 100 million in labor costs over the next 10 year from lower payed undocumented labor.

 Super creppy. 




 True. Balance is hard in today's world. I just don't like to follow absolute advise. Life is messy but that is ok.  




 In my opinion, the body language is different in a dark triad and sometimes the eyes are a tell. 




 Dark triad personality people think normal emotionally healthy people are fools. What they don't realize is that they are the ones who are emotionally defective not humanity.  Sure the dark trial is better than average with logic but the universe is not governed solely by linear cause and effect logic. The emotion of love transcends logic.  




 But many caring genuine people are charismatic and caring. Can you tell right away or does it take time. If you can, how.

 They are my kids.  




 The mystery of life. I am not 100% sure of anything.A couple of years ago, I  had a near death experience from a mugging. The feeling was beyond words. It was like I was one with the universe.  




 Our universe could be one of many. There is a strange new theory that our universe is in the center of a black hole. In this theory, the big bang was the moment of formation of this black hole. If this theory is true, that means we live inside a black hole of a "parent" universe. I don't know if this is fact but it would not go against the known mechanics of quantum physics. 




 Awesome video. 














 Should have titled video: Caitlin/Bruce in 1980's McDonald's commercial. 




 And when your a kid. 
























 I read this peer reviewed study and others like it. This 470nm light is produced by the blue spectrum hydroponic bulb. 




 "Don't eat bats". Thank you for the heads up. LOL 




 I agree with you. There is news stories of the mid-ages recipe of cow bile mixed with garlic.  




 I am not worried.  I have ideas though my new theory of multiple factor science which could make the pharmaceutical drug companies a lot of money. I am not religious but like this quote one  of  Martin Luther King Jk speechs.

 Great.  




 He is such a good boy.  




 If that happens, it will probably be quick.  




 Thank you. Bleach baths don't work for me also. Wish you a MRSA free future. If your immune system figured out a way to get rid of it, you will be immune from mrsa in the future.  




 The common assumption is that man domesticated wolf's not that man and wolf affected each others evolution.  We would not even be the same form most likely if it wasn't for dogs and wolfs. Some even go so far as to think that wolf domesticated man not vise versa. I would not go this far. I think we domesticated each other. 




 Also check out my video of a retired microbiologist commenting on my mrsa treatment idea. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1nITz-sww 




 Cool. I am serious about changing the way that mrsa is treated.  




 Did you check out my half-finished patent-free mrsa infection prototype medicial machine video.  




 My half-finished patent-free mrsa infection prototype medicial machine. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9FX8HK4pqpw 




 My half-finished patent-free mrsa infection prototype medicial machine. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9FX8HK4pqpw 




 Research 400nm light then look at the spectrograph of the hydrolux blue 1000watt grow bulb. 




 I tried manuka honey and colloidal silver. Both didn't work for me. May work for some people though. Everyone is different. 




 Even though I treat my reoccurring mrsa with my method, about a month ago I saw an infectious disease specialist too see why I was getting reoccurring mrsa infections so often. She told me my reoccurring mrsa was most likely not from an external source but rather lived on my skin. She also told me , assuming it didn't kill me first, my body would eventually figure out a way to remove it from my system. I could have no more outbreaks or a 100 more outbreaks. Sounds as if you your doctor found proper drug plus your body figured out how to get rid of it. Good luck. 




 Glad you are ok now. You are  lucky to be alive. What drug did the CDC give you. Been on vancimyicn 3 times. Rough stuff. 




 Not sure what you are saying. Explain. 




 That's cool. MRSA does grow fast and is not a joke. You could use this method in  conjunction with antibotics if you were worried about this alone not being effective. 




 This man has guts. 




 I hope not but this could happen. Just hope bear don't have a bad day.  




 Yep. Got the idea. 









 Must obey hal.  




 Combining 400nm blue spectrum light from a hydroponic grow bulb, bezethonium cloride mixed with epson salt, and alternation hot and cold.  Go to Blackwell synergy, a peer review search engine, and research each of these ideas. Each of these ideas have been peer reviewed to help with MRSA infections. It is combining all three ideas together and geting the 400nm light from a hydroponic grow bulb that is my idea  and has produced such a rapid and effective respose. People have claimed to treat mrsa infections with 12 watt blue spectrum LEDs. It may work for some people but was a failure for me. My idea, which no one is currently doing, is to obtain the blue spectrum light from a 1000w hydroponic grow bulb. Combining this with the two other methods produced a rapid and effective response to my reoccurring mrsa infections. Before this method, I treated over a dozen mrsa infections with antibotics. After inventing this method, I treated my last three mrsa infections with this combination method and without antibotics. I am giving idea away patent and compensation free. Hope this helps. 




 Never heard of them. Thank you for suggestion. 




 I e-mailed over 500 microbiologists worldwide including every microbiologist at OSU. Had a couple of responses but was told the FDA would never approve of this idea even if it worked. The learned helplessness of PHD doctors was shocking. 




 Would like the medicial community to do a research study on this combination MRSA treatment. It is not science until it can be replicated in many different people. Then this scientific research could be submitted for peer review. This is my dream. Inspired by Dr. Jonas Salk and a special French woman. 




 Manuka honey didn't work for me but it may for some people. This is the reason pharmaceutical drug trials are done on so many people. What works for some people doesn't work for others. 
  




 Don't know much about it. New research project for tonight.
 




 Is that the treatment used in Russia.  




 Agreed.  




 On youtube there is a dozen other video's. Videos are under patent-free MRSA. Read book "Missing Microbes" and read about the negative effects of antibotics. 




 Thank you for feedback. 




 Thank you for link. 









 Need other options in the democratic party besides Hillary Clinton. 




 Taxi drivers not doing there cause any favors. I am sure more french citizens will use uber just because of this poor behavior of taxi drivers. 









 Awesome.  
























 Thank you. 





























 Thank you. 




 That is your opinion.  




 If it can't be patented even better. I will just raise awereness for this mrsa treatment idea. I do believe I am the first person to use a hydroponic grow bulb to produced the 400nm light necessary to treat my reoccurring mrsa infections. Google hydroponic bulb mrsa 




 Because nobody has ever used a hydroponic grow bulb to produce this 400nm light. If it can't be patented even better. I will then just raise awereness for this MRSA treatment method.
  




 Maybe. Could turn into an interesting  court case. 




 They don't. Don't even know the people who run this website.  




 Someone has some common sense. 




 This is why I am posting information. Would like the scientific community to research my mrsa combination treatment. 




 This combination therapy combines known infection methods to produce an effective respose to my mrsa infections Also, I am the first person to use a blue spectrum hydrolux  hydroponic weed grow bulb to produce this 400nm light. This bulb is new technology.  Google hydroponic grow bulb mrsa.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3438385/ 




 I don't think this is a guaranteed to work. Would like idea to be tested and hopefully replicated in a lab. Then idea could be submitted for peer review. 




 I hope so. I am a nerd not a lawyer. 




 No alcohol makes mrsa worse. Will provide link in a min. 




 True. If my idea works may be an interesting court case.

 Give me a minute. I will provide links. Also my friend is a retired microbiologist. I have a youtube video where he comments on my mrsa treatment idea 




 Almost lost my leg. When I was in the hospital they sent me a chaplain because they where not sure if I was going to make it. Last year 700,000 people died worldwide from this flesh-eating eating disease. By 2030, it may be as high as 10 million. 




 Give me a min and I will give you links. My comments are going crazy. 




 Google 400nm light infections. 
 




 Understand how to read peer review medicial papers even though I am not a doctor. Plus light and radar are basically the same thing just a different spectrum. I am a nerd. 




 It is already too late. My youtube video's have been viewed in over 60 countries and shared in over a dozen websites.My videos have been even download and shared from Russian and Chinese websites. 




 You get the idea buddy. I already have over 2500 views on my youtube channel and idea has been shared on over a dozen website. 




 Because I don't have the 10- 100 k to the 
get the medicial patent.  




 Look at the peer review papers on 400nm blue light then get back with me. 




  Jonas Salk gave away his polio vaccine patent-free. 




 Because I am not a doctor.I worked on the AEGIS Tomahawk cruise missile radar in the navy so I understand how this technology works. 




 It is not a cure but a treatment for my reoccurring mrsa infections. 




 This is not my website. The MRSA foundation just shared one of my youtube videos. Look at the peer review research of 400nm blue light. My idea was to get this 400nm blue light from a hydroponic grow bulb. Hope this helps. 




 Then go patent it buddy. 




 Feel free. Just realize I will be your companies worst PR nightmare. 




 That's the rebel spirit. I guess the system failed to teach you "learned helplessness". 




 The hospital has treated over a dozen of my mrsa infections with antibotics. After I came up with idea, I have treated three MRSA infections without antibotics. I almost died from this flesh eating disease. I agree it is not science until postive results are replicated in many different people.
Would like scientific community too research idea further. 




 I hope they can figure out what the problem was. All new technology has problems.

 I bet the amount of data that this rockets computers have to compensate for is impressive. 







































 True but my idea is not a cure but rather a treatment for my reoccurring mrsa infections. I get your point though. 




 The MRSA foundation, a California based 501 non-profit, has a website not a blog . Also don't take the word conspiracy so seriously. Most /r/conspiracy posts are not true conspiracy's but rather  is a subreddit where people can post unconventional ideas and have open minded people look at them . Think abstraction not literal. 




 When post cools down I will get a hold of you. It might be tomorrow. 




 I am a creative nut. What can I say. 




 No problem. 




 My naval education background from 2.5 years of electronics schools which are all MIT based and taught by lockheed Martin instructors gave me an educational backround which helped me come up with idea. Plus I am a strange nerd. On my spare time, I read peer reviewed scientific papers on all subjects. It's fun.Proud Veteran. Have a problem with it. Your problem. 




 I put a MRSA foundation web page not my youtube video on r/technology so I don't understand what you are talking about. 




 Tell it like it is. Proud Veteran. ProtoDong can't bully me. You are correct it is just reddit.  




 Ok moderater get the point go back to r/technology and leave us "crazy" people alone. Ok. Over and out 




 /u/ProtoDong what makes you the gatekeeper. Your job as a moderator should be too control trolling not the free flow of ideas. I have treated three MRSA infections with my idea in the presence of a retired microbiologist . Let the people decide. 




 Sorry moderator /u/ProtoDong  giving truth not dark triad manipulation. 




 That is why I use a 1000 hydroponic bulb. You are correct though on lower wattage bulbs. A 1000 watt bulb gives the necessary skin penetration.  




 My idea also helps lighten scar tissue which would help military IED blast victims.  




 Hopefully my youtube video's will go viral before the FDA shut's me down. 




 Good idea.  




 Reddit is awesome but needs new leadership. The purpose of the moderator's should be too enforce no trolling rules not to be the gatekeepers of new ideas.  




 Ok. What % upvote should be a veto proof %. Any suggestions. 




 Good one. Remember too be civil. LOL  




 Google blue light mrsa and look at the peer review research.  




 Thank you for reply. I am sorry some people are so bitter that they can't believe me. I am both a patriot and care about humanity. The inspiration of this video comes from my little brother in the Marine Corp and a special French woman  I meet while in the Navy. She was and is a secular saint. Love you girl. 




 Or I could just quit technology subreddit and post in conspiracy section from now on. I have found smart people  in this subreddit. 




 Youtube doesn't update views in realtime. They do this too verify views are real not bots. 




 Something dark triad personality types will never understand. 




 Glad you liked idea.

 Thank you for your advise. I am new too reddit. I would have been top post on r/technology  if I wasn't deleted. There need to be a rule, assuming post is legal, that if up votes are above a certain % that moderators can't delete posts. This will prevent censorship.

Something some of the nasty people on r/technology don't understand. If you don't agree with me downvote me.
 




  "Learned helplessness" is not something  this Veteran respond's too.

 I worked on the AEGIS Tomahawk cruise missile systems when I was in the Navy. 




 MRSA foundation just shared my youtube video and story.  




 I have tried that doesn't work. 




 I love reddit but what they did too my successful post was uncalled for. Also, unlike this post, I posted a MRSA foundation webpage not my youtube video.I may have an idea which could save millions of lives and save governments billions of dollars. Last year 700,000 people died from mrsa, I know how to treat it. If you disagree with me than down vote me. Don't censor me /u/ProtoDong. US Navy AEGIS Tomahawk cruise missile veteran

 Thank you. I hope idea can't be patented. Then I can spend my time raising awereness for this mrsa treatment method. 




 Not necessarily. The 1000watt blue spectrum hydrolux weed grow bulb used in video is new technology.  




 Thank you for input.  
























 Karma  









 Chairman Pao is an elitists gatekeeper.  Down with censorship. Now if we could only get rid of moderator ProtoDong from r/technology  




 This woman is an elitists gatekeeper. Down with censorship.  




 ProtoDong need to be fired like  chairman Pao 









 I am not a scientist. Would like the scientific community to research my idea and replicate it in lab. I also believe that Joe six pack should have the freedom to try any alternative medicine he wants.  You sound like an gatekeeper. Freedom of speech buddy.  




 Personal attacks is a sign that someone is losing the argument.  




 Yep, it is called freedom.  This is not the USSR. 




 Then show idea too your lab if what you say is true. 




 I want it to spread with or without testing. Then the gatekeepers won't be able to supress technology. Trust me if enough people hear about idea someone will test idea in lab. 




 The Wright brothers or Tesla did not go though "proper channels" when building there ideas. 




 Amen brother.  




 Ditto. 




 Thank you. 




 Good info, buddy. Did you notice that they use blue LEDS not blue spectrum hydroponic grow bulbs. Blue spectrum hydroponic bulbs works much better and faster than blue LEDS. Plus the light is safer. The airforce is also using powerful light to disinfect rooms from MRSA. I will provide a link in a min. 

 




 It is a weed grow bulb buddy. If it caused damage to skin people would be sueing hydroponic grow bulb companies
. People work all day, legally in colorado, under these bulb. Thank you for expression concern just please keep it civil.  




 /u/ProtoDong go away. It is not slander if it is true. 




 You are wrong.  I made a video where I tryed to treat a mrsa infection with benathonium cloride/ epson salt and alternating hot/cold. I did not use the 1000 watt bulb in this video. This treatment was a failure not my combination therapy that includes a hydroponic bulb. Got it buddy.
 




 The problem is how would I infect the mice with mrsa. Not safe except in a lab setting. Also. I am an animal lover,even mice,  so I couldn't do this. Answer  you question buddy. 




 Please keep forum civil. 




 I don't mind that you disagree with me but you language is uncalled for buddy. 




 Yep. Moderator /u/ProtoDong need to go away and stay in /r/technology where he belongs. 




 /u/ProtoDong it wasn't advertising. It is a open source free idea I am giving away. Also you could have contacted me before deleting my post from the first page. Also, your rude language was uncalled for. Please leave me alone. 




 /u/ProtoDong I contacted the moderators from /r/conspiracy about your rude language and trolling behavior. I don't want your posts deleted. I just requested that you and your trolling buddies leave me alone. Go back to /r/technology. This is the conspiracy subreddit. So leave me alone. Ok. Buddy. From proud Veteran. 




 /u/ProtoDong is a /r/technology moderator.  The rule of reddit don't apply to him. I messaged the moderators of /r/conspiracy about his behavior. I don't want his posted deleted I just want him and his trolling buddies to go back to /r/technology and leave me alone. All his rude post's had negative points but overnight most of his post are now positive. 




 This is the moderator from /r/technology who deleted me after getting over 600 upvotes. 




 /u/ProtoDong you are a  moderator. Go back to /r/ technology. Stop trolling or does the rules not apply too you 




 Must obey gatekeeper. 




 Good link. Thank you.  




 If I get blacklisted from this site that is where I may end up.

 I think it's funny. Rise against the machines. 




 Also why is the moderator /u/ProtoDong  and his buddys from r/technology up voting his rude comments. Went to bed at 3am and his comments where all negative and now they are all like magic positive. I thought the moderator's where suppose to be neutral. This post has 92% upvote, so leave us alone. 




 You didn't even watch the entire video. In the video, I stated that I was going to go to the hospital to have my infection cultured. The proof is in a lab result currently in my medicial record.  




 LoL 




 I have an after video on my youtube channel.  




 Goodnight buddy.  




 It is called freedom buddy. Don't pretend you care about what happens to other people. If you were a caring person, you wouldn't use such nasty language.  




 I think you are wrong but even if you are correct. I don't care. It is call empathy. When the law become lawless you must break it. I don't  care about your fear tactics. Go troll some place else. Quit pretending  you care about me. If I go too jail so be it. If you want to have an intelligent coversation of why I am wrong I am all ears. Name calling doesn't prove you know what you are talking about.

  




 Please be honest. I am a big boy.  Can handle it. 




 By heating up and cooling down my arm, this increases blood flow. More white blood cells get to the source of infection. This helps in the healing process. I am too tired to answer the rest of your questions. Message you tomorrow.  




 No it isn't.  It is only a criminal offense if money is exchanged. The government can regulated medicial commerce not  medicial speech.  I have 1st amendment free speech rights. 




 Yea and moderator /u/ProtoDong has too wait until I am at the top of page one before he deletes my post.  




 Thank you.  




 Ok. Sorry tired not thinking completely straight. 




 Also, look at the spectrograph of a blue spectrum hydroponic grow bulb.  




 Yep. That is one of the papers. There is many others. Go to blackwell synergy and do a search.  




 Blue spectrum light is already FDA approved for the treatment of acne. So moderaters statement is nonsense. Also 400nm blue light acne treatment uses a 12 watts LED bulb. I use a 1000 watt blue spectrum hydroponic grow bulb. This extra power increases penetration. 




 Google 400nm mrsa or blue light mrsa. Then get back with me. 




 I have had like 15. Around a dozen treated with antibotics.  Then my last three, treated with my combination therapy. 
























 Actually you can with a brain scan. If you show a psychopath a picture of a starving child while getting a MRI brain scan the sections of the brain dealing with emotions will have little too no response. 




 An open mind is good but don't be so open minded your brain falls out.  














 What they don't realize is that the sleepwalkers are not interested in sites like reddit. 




 The gatekeepers are in the process of loosing there power. They are scared. Read book "The end of power" by Moises Naim. The centralized absolute power of the dark triad gatekeepers is becoming a thing of the past. 




 The new CEO must make reddit a safe place for future corporate advertisers.  




 Reddit is in the process of making this website a "safe place" for corporate advertisers. 




 "While not required". This is conspiracy section. Even if required I may break the rules. So f off bot. 




 https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3dautm/content_policy_update_ama_thursday_july_16th_1pm/ 




 Yea but it is in there best interest too do so. The bean counters will never learn. 




 If Reddit management had any commonsense, rather than getting rid of free speech to satisfy PC corporate advertisers they could run a fund raising campaign from its 
users. PBS runs fundraising campaign for there ad free public television. Reddit should do the same. Harvard business school management style will not work with Reddit culture.  




 Reddit probably will keep conspiracy open. Classic misinformation tactic. Anyone who tell a truth that the powers that's doesn't want disclosed is a "crazy conspiracy nut".  




 The new CEO states that reddit was never a free speech forum and that reddit has  " dark side" 




 Yep.  "Learned helplessness" is not something the average uses of reddit is good at. F the gatekeepers. Have you seen the new "content policy". 




 Reddit use too be one of the few free speech zones that PC corporate culture didn't control. We need to give the new CEO hell for not respecting the wish of the vast majority of the users wishes.  We got rid of Chairman Pao, if the new CEO doesn't change fast I am going to start a petition asking for his removal.  
























 The only reason reddit cares about it "dark side" is because they want to make this website safe for future advertisers. Everything is not about money. Got that new CEO. 




 This is how ex-chairman Pao must currently feel like. 




 I hope the new CEO realizes  how important free speech is too most people on reddit. 




 Most TV sucks. 




 The guy from South Africa who is going to replace Jon Stewart is not funny.

 Before I came up with my mrsa treatment method, I was given vacomycin on three different mrsa outbreaks. The nurses had to move the IV too a different spot every day due the vacomincin inflaming my veins. 




 Vacomycin is a strong antibotics and is hard on your system. 














 Not sure. 



















 Old traditional media is dieing. People don't want to be told what to think.  




 The  gatekeepers of CNN are not happy with the fact that they can't control what is posted on reddit.  



















 Thank you for link.  









 Thank you.  














 Yep most likely. 




 Are you going to continue to censor popular posts? My successful post in r/technology was deleted and the moderator was rude and was trolling me. My successful post had over 600 points in r/technology and I was deleted and censored. I want my post reloaded and I want you to tell moderator ProtoDong to quite being a rude censoring gatekeeper.

 If he wanted to help he could advocate a return to glass steagall. 









 It's a "free speech zone".  









 This policy change will make reddit a "safe place" for increased corporate advertising. 




 This new content policy will make reddit a "safe place" for corporate advertisers. RIP free speech. 














 Not giving breaks and working more hours is not going to save a company enough money to increase wages 5X.  




 Sounds like a fun place. 




 Foreign news agencies have covered articles of the onion thinking they where  real. 




 Now that's a true conspiracy. 




 Nothing just like the term. Wikipedia the article  of dark triad.  Good reading 




 This video is satire. 









 This is satire. 









 It wouldn't suprise me.  




 That is true. I am talking about most CEO of large corporations. Many CEO's are great people. 




 Thanks buddy. My spelling sucks. 




 People are not asking for a 100k . Proper breaks(30 min) and air conditioning would be a good start. 




 This is why we need better labor laws. 




 That is what bosses told their workers in the gilded age after a 16 hour work day. 




 I am moving to Australia.  




 They love temporary labor.  




 Down with censorship. Down with venture capital inventors demands. They have TV. That is ok but leave this website the way it was. 




 Enjoy being a troublemaker. 









 I wasn't mocking users. Don't talk about yourself  as a group.  




 First therapy doesn't work for dark triad personality types. The best way too deal with them is to avoid them. Also I am not claiming I can fix the problem but rather just pointing out a truth of the world. Not all problems have solutions. Just because I don't have a complete solution doesn't mean I can't point out a truth. 




 Some individuals need to be made fun off by labels and comedy.  




 The number one rule of fight club is you don't talk about fight club. What is the number one rule of karma? 




 Some CEO's are good people but the rates of CEO's being dark triad personality types is several times the general population. This makes them highly rational but only through the prism of there self interest.  




 Most socialpaths are psychopaths. 




 It is a problem if most people don't have the ability to spot a dark triad personality type. 




 Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts...absolutely. 
Centralized power leads to absolute power. 




 My research of peer review medicial papers lead me to a new method of treating my MRSA superbug infections.
http://mrsafoundation.com/matthew-mcpherson/ 




 Psychopathic people love centralized systems of power.  




 Yea systems of dark triad people.  




 "I don't understand you point" is a saying. It means I don't agree with you.  




 It's called being a secondary psychopath. So I don't understand your point.  




 In your profile you call people reductionist. Isn't that's labeling buddy. 




 I deleted my comment because I wanted too.  




 I have the freedom to delete my own comment. If someone else deleted the comment it would be censorship.  




 Left brain analyst  




 You sound like the thought police of 1984. 




 Some evil people need to be labeled. If more people would have labeled Hitler maybe this dark triad would not have been able to kill half the Jews of Europe. 




 Go troll somewhere else buddy.  




 Free speech buddy.  




 The problem is high IQ psychopaths fake emotion with there superficial charm. 
























 Your posts are not wasting time but probably are your current job.  Have a good night Clinton operative. 




 I think you know why I think you are on reddit. You are good at what you do. 




 I think you know the answer to this question. So you think me doubting Hillary Clinton's non-answer answer on the TPP makes  me a conspiracy nut.  




 Or you could make up a better reason for not posting links. Most people who like reddit post links and comments. I do not buy your reason for not posting links. 




 I rarely find this is the case when I post a link. 




 Vulcanfactcheck I have a question for you. Why do you post only comments on politics and never post links?   




 The Clintons have always been for corporate free trade deals.  




 The reason as stated in her official position and what is her real reason is often two different things. Your use of language makes me think you are a lawyer. 




 We all know Clinton is for the TPP. 




 He is the flying spaghetti monster's gift to the Democrats. 




 The article highlights how Bernie Sanders believes he is different on trade than Hillary Clinton. 




 The article is about trade and the TPP and is less than 45 days old.  We all know where Hillary Clinton stands on the TPP. She is for it. 




 The TPP is a current event. 














 I just signed the petition.  




 Probably not much. 




 She is a kid not a professional. 




 I think you know the answer.  




 Guitar not guiter.  




 Yea my spelling is not always the best. Guitar not guiter
 




 Someone needs to start a change.org petition for this man.

 Better than I will ever be. 




 Got the point. It's a guitar. 









 I signed your petition. Here is my petition.

 Maybe she is a troubled artist. Still cool in my book.
 




 I can't keep a tune and from my misspelling of guitar in title it seems I can't spell either.  




 You get the point. Enjoy the video. 




 Should have put this meme in the /r/conspiracy. 




 Good music may have a future. 




 Thank you for link. Going to check it out. Today was the first time I watched some of her videos. 




 She has mad skills.  




 May Oswald rot in hell. RIP President Kennedy.

 Go away. 




 Lot of campaign contributions.

 It would be nice if this was currently possible. 




 Go away buddy.  









 Reddit needs to make it's website a "safe place" for corporate advertisers. The bean counters don't understand that if this change takes place they will lose most of their users.  




 Most private institutions are funded by corporate donations. Jonas Salk's polio vaccine was funded by the government. I appreciate your opinion though.
   




 /r/science won't allow me to because my idea has not yet been replicated  though peer review scientific research. That is the purpose of this petition.  




 Thank you for pointing this out. I am going to contact the MRSA foundation and request they provide these two links.
