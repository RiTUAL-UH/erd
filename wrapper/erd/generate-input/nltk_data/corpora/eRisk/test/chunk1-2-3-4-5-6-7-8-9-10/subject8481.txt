 I seriously doubt your bookmark's bar actually saves you any time.  Typing in a web address would be much faster than sifting through all that shit. 









 I don't know if the dude doing the spread eagle is actually tied on and about to get ripped apart or if he's just really fucking committed and a badass.  




 Mr. Freeman, it's an absolute pleasure having you here. Now tell me, would you rather fight 100 duck sized horses or one horse sized duck? Since, as God, you're the only one that can actually make it happen!

 It's not cancer, spiders or an abscessed tooth.  According to the dentist, the nerve on one of my molars died and then became infected.  So, the guy who said "blood and puss" is today's winner.  The only reason it ever got to this point is because I'm a Canadian that was traveling in the U.S. and couldn't see a dentist until I got home.  Thanks for your concern everyone, I'm on antibiotics and was even prescribed percocet for the pain so I'm high as a kite. 




 Thanks for the suggestion! 




 I agree that it doesn't belong in /r/askscience.  It is posted in /r/science. 









 I once sent a customer a text saying "goodnight beautiful" that was intended for my wife. He still greets me with "hello beautiful" every time he calls.

 Rocket salad?  I think they meant *roquette* salad, which is a kind of arugula.  I bet the Italian menu says roquette, but they just assumed rocket would be the English version.

 The company I work for was featured on How it's Made. The producers genuinely want to know how everything is built from beginning to end. We must have spoken with their writers a dozen times so that they had a deep understanding of the entire process. It was quite the experience.  




 I travel for work constantly, I'm actually writing this in an airport. My best tip is to eliminate checked baggage. This won't help if you're going on vacation, but I can't tell you how many time this has saved me. 

Tight connect? Your luggage doesn't get left behind. 

Want to grab an earlier connecting flight? The first thing they'll ask is if you have checked luggage. 

If you eliminate checked luggage, you can literally walk off the plane and to your car or hop into a cab without breaking stride. 

This goes without saying, but the airline can't lose your luggage if its with you. 

Note:  Please use only approved size luggage for carry on travel. If I see you on a flight with your whole life in multiple suitcases, I'll recline my seat into your lap as far as it can go.

 I literally just teared up in awe. 




 People who board flights out of turn. When they call seating zone 3, if you're in zone 4, the agent at the counter should turn you away. But no one ever gets turned away! They just let them right on the plane like a reward for being bold enough to try or something. As a guy who travels for work, this drives me nuts.

 It's amazing what difference a good actor vs. a bad actor can make.  I immediately felt connected to this coffeemate guy.  The lines didn't feel forced and his deliver was perfect.  Bryan Cranston is an amazing actor because he can be anyone, not just Walter White.

 One of the first cars I ever drove was a 1973 Datsun 240z. I drove it from 2001-2004 since my dad thought it would be a good car to cut my teeth on, especially since you can open the hood and actually learn about how the thing works. Today's cars are basically computers under the hood.

I remember it felt like you were literally sitting on the ground it was so low.  It also used to get insanely hot in the cab because all of the heat from the engine had to go somewhere.

 A layman-friendly explanation to something (which I think is) complicated or technical is exactly what this post is about.

 I own stocks in several large American banks and insurance corporations.  Should I be pulling my money out?  Recently these stocks have been doing well and have been projected to continue to do well.

 The same thing happened to me on my birthday. I got multiple bottles of whiskey, whiskey glasses, whiskey stones for keeping it cool and apparently no one had discussed what to get me. 

Still unsure about the connoisseur vs. alcoholic part though.  




 I'm 32 and I never thought that I would wind up working with my dad, but here we are.  I'm now one of the partners in the business and doing very well. Sometimes following the family business can work to your advantage, but don't expect it to fall into your lap. As the son of the boss I have to work twice as hard as others but I'm also the best at my job and most likely to take over. Surprisingly, I really enjoy my work and my dad and I work well together.

I also never could have imagined getting married and having kids, especially since I was never really outgoing. It's highly recommended; best thing I ever did.  




 I don't know about bison, but with African buffalo the herd is all that matters. Often when one is injured and trying to follow the herd it will be cast out by the other buffalo and even attacked so that it won't draw predators towards the rest of the herd.

 Customer: Hi; how much is your paint?

Clerk: Well sir, that depends on a lot of things.

Customer: Can you give me an approximate price?

Clerk: Our lowest price is our introductory special at $12 a gallon; after that we have dozens of different prices up to $199.

Customer: What is the difference in the quality of the paint?

Clerk: Oh, there is really no difference; its all exactly the same stuff.

Customer: Well, in that case Ill take your $12 paint.

Clerk: Well actually the $12 variety is only available to you on our website. If you want to buy it here at the store youll be charged an additional $20 Customer Convenience Fee.

Customer: So if I go home and get if off the website its only $12?

Clerk: That is correct, Sir--- plus a Credit Card Usage Fee of $6 and then of course there is the standard Shipping and Handling Fee of $14.

Customer: What?!! So, in other words, buying online would cost me exactly the same as what Id have to pay here in the store?

Clerk: I suppose so, but if you buy it here you get to use it immediately. Online purchases take ten business days to get to you, unless you pay the optional $24 Express My Paint fee.

Customer: You have got to be kidding me?!! Arent you?

Clerk: Well no, Sir; but that is academic anyway as right now the $12 paint is completely sold out in both places.

Customer: Thats BS! I am looking at shelves full or the stuff!

Clerk: Ah, but that does not mean that it is available for sale. We sell only a certain number of introductory priced cans on any given day. Oops, look at that! It just became available again at $17.50.

Customer: Cmon! You mean to say it went up while Im standing here?

Clerk: Fraid so. Inventory control changes our prices all the time. I strong urge you to purchase your paint as soon as possible as it could go up again. How many gallons do you want?

Customer: Well, maybe three gallons. No, make that four; I dont want to run out. I assume I can return
anything I dont open?

Clerk: Certainly, Sir. The $12 paint is non-refundable, but if you return it within 48 hours you will be entitled to a $4 credit towards the future purchase of another gallon of the same colour paint at the same or higher price.

Customer: That is crazy! In that case Ill just give any unopened can to my brother as hes planning to repaint his home soon.

Clerk: Sorry, Sir, no-can-do! Our terms and CAN-ditions- -- thats a little in-house paint joke--- prohibit paint transfer. It is strictly for the use of the original purchaser.

Customer: But wait a minute; I hadnt spotted those Paint Sale-$9.99* a Can signs over there. That sound like a much better deal.

Clerk: Ah yes, thats from our low cost paint division. That asterisk denoted that the cans are actually half
gallons and the price is based on a minimum purchase of two. There is also an additional Environmental Fee of $5 per can; a non-refundable Can Deposit of $3.50; a Paint Facility Charge of $5 and if you want more than one color, the second has a $25 surcharge and the third is $5 extra.

Customer: This is ridiculous; to hell with it. Ill buy what I need elsewhere.

Clerk: Well sir, you may be able to buy paint for some rooms from another store but you wont be able to find the paint for your connecting hall and stairway anywhere but here. And I should point out to you that if you want Uni-Directional paint it is priced at $249 a gallon.

Customer: I thought your most expensive paint was $199?

Clerk: Sir, that is only if you paint non-stop all the way around the room and back to the point at which you started. Stairways and hallways are considered unidirectional one way exceptions to the rule.

Customer: So, if I buy the $199 point and use it in my hallways and stairs what are you going to do about itsend some goons in to paint over it?

Clerk: Sir, I believe you are getting it now. But no, please, that would be plain silly. Wed simply charge you a Direction Adjustment Fee plus the difference to the $249 on your next purchase.

Customer: New Purchase?!! No way! I am out of here.

Clerk: We at Skyhigh Paints never forget that you have a choice, so thanks for shopping with us and have a nice day. Bye bye!

And aint that just exactly how it is these days?
 









 Is it bad that the funniest thing about this picture is your ears? 
























 I am, but the clickable area is razor thin.  




 My dad used to have boxer shorts that said " faded glory" on them. I can't think of anything sadder.  




 Having a hard time upvoting you on mobile. It's like trying to thread a needle.  




 As a sales professional I disagree. My job Is to direct you towards the best product for you personally. That's the product that will give you the most happiness for a price you can afford. If sales is done properly, everyone wins. You leave happy with your purchase and I earn commission. People who inflate prices artificially or lie about the performance of a product hurt the rep sales professionals everywhere. 

I don't have to lie to you about a product. I just have to tell you that the one with the features you want is more expensive. You buy it or you don't. That's on you. 

Lying about the amount money Jobs brought in wasn't a dirty salesman tactic. It was straight up theft.  It came right out of Woz's pocket.  




 Any suggestion for cold or frozen cables?  They seem impossible to coil properly.

 I completely forgot that I recently joined this sub. This is amazing.  




 Tony, my wife met you at a common friend's wedding.  She says you're the bomb on the dance floor.  That is all.  




 I smoked for about 12 years, smoking a pack a day at the end. I quit the day that my wife moved in. She wasn't going to put up with any shit and that made the decision to quit easy. There was no hiding it because she was living with me, and the temptation faded slowly. I still get the rare craving, but it's only for a minute and then it's gone.  




 I'm late to the conversation, but this is worth mentioning. 

I was raised Catholic and went to church all my childhood, but after moving a couple of times I had pretty much stopped going to church by the time I became an adult and gradually lost a lot my beliefs over time.  Recently, my wife and I were planning to start attending church again since we now have a young daughter and we felt it was important that we raise her Catholic like we were. I went out and found a church for us.

At the new church I felt a connection with the deacon immediately. He was charismatic, energetic and "modern" for a church deacon.  He even baptized my daughter himself.  He was arrested on charges of distribution and PRODUCTION of child pornography mere months before she was enrolled in his Sunday school.

The thing that gets me the most is how comfortable I felt handing my child over that monster.  I'm done with the church now, not going back there or any other church. 
























 Amazing. TIL that a dolphin that is 1 second old could out swim Michael Phelps.

 You can take this a step further and program a shortcut as well. I use ctrl, shift, S. It's much faster than opening the search bar.  




 Does anyone know if this will help or hinder their stock in the short term?  I expect it will help long term.  




 We did this in Montreal recently for NHL game 7 vs. Boston.  Tickets were $11 instead of hundreds and all the proceeds from the ticket sales went to charity (concession sales weren't donated).  It offered the feel and crowd of a real NHL game to a lot of people that can't afford to go otherwise.  Tickets sold out in just a couple of hours. 




 Not in this case because he never puts his hand over the puck, but just pushes it out of the net.  If he placed his hand over the puck during the save then it would have been a penalty shot.

 I keep waiting for his videos to feel tired, but he always has great new material and makes it feel fresh.  Each one seems better than the last.

 If reducing clearance is the goal, then you shouldn't be using single wall pipe.  Double wall stove pipe only requires 6" clearance, allowing you to put the stove as close to the wall as you want without requiring an additional shield.

OP's wall looks great, but most heat shields are a black piece of tin on the wall. Most installations look much nicer without a shield. 




 The woodstove they installed is UL certified with a specific clearance requirement.  As long as the minimum clearance is met, there is no need for an air gap to try and reduce clearance further.  Most modern stoves only have 4"-6" clearance requirements off the back and sides, making additional shields unnecessary. 

Shields are great for uncertified appliances that require 48" clearance to combustibles though. 




 The other one that comes to mind immediately is for the police officer that went unpunished after he killed a kid while driving 120kph in a 50 zone.  But there wasn't a jury in that case, and i believe they're reviewing it, so I guess it doesn't apply. 




 The trial was not about whether or not he killed Jun Lin, but whether or not he had the sense of mind to know what he was doing. Magnotta admitted to killing Jun Lin, but that his state of mind was so psychotic that he didn't know what he was doing was wrong. 

Multiple psychiatrists testified for the defense saying that they felt his schizophrenia was to blame. The obvious planning seemed to prove otherwise for the prosecution. 

I think this is the right decision and I'm very relieved that they jury came to it. Especially after a variety of fucked up decisions by Quebec juries recently.  




 There is case that just closed in Quebec where an officer in an unmarked car was driving 122 kph in a 50 zone.  He killed a 5 year old boy when he struck the car.  Apparently he was not in pursuit of anyone and was on his way to relieve a surveillance team somewhere. There was no rush. He wasn't even sentenced to community hours, just walked away free of charges. 




 Some jobs take more than two weeks to complete, like a bathroom or a kitchen. Not to mention they cost thousands of dollars and most people can't afford to do multiple expensive jobs at one time. I would revise this to say that you should tackle the small things at the get go, but save up for the big stuff.   




 You sound exactly like my mechanic, looking at Lexus now.  









 I've noticed this in the past, but am currently watching US Open replays for today. 




 As someone that lives in Montreal, but works North of the city, I see the traffic headed in every single day. Fortunately I get to drive by at 120 and wave. 
























 I bought a Canon T1i years ago when I was low on funds and was looking for something with better options than a basic point and shoot.  Now I'm looking to get some quality lenses, specifically the Canon EF 70-200mm f/4L USM http://goo.gl/9IWHkE, but I'm not sure if my entry level DSLR is going to make the most of it.

Has anyone experienced something similar?  If I need to upgrade my camera, how should I go about it? 




 For those of you looking for pictures, this is all I could find.

 It's important to remember that bees are territorial and will attack other hives, killing the bees and stealing their honey if they are too close together.  Not everyone should have a bee hive, and in some regions you can go to a website to determine where the closest hive is to you.  It may not make sense to have one yourself. But for those people that have space for a hive, this looks interesting.  




 It's because if you thought the topic was interesting enough to comment, then it only makes sense that you would want others to see it as well. 




 How are there 13 comments and only 4 upvotes? Cmon people, if you comment make sure to upvote the thread.  




 I had the exact opposite thought. A hard cookie would crack rather than be cut in a nice clean line.  




 Thank you! I think that I might have actually unlocked webber by burying him in a grave or something like that.  I'm also at about 80 days in my current ROG game, so it shouldn't be long. 

I guess it's time to start adventure mode.   




 Typically you earn experience after you die that goes towards unlocking additional characters, but I seem to have stopped getting experience. 

I've played over 125 hours, some in ROG, but mostly in the originally game. At this point I have only unlocked the robot. I stopped getting XP a long time ago. 

Can someone tell me how I can started unlocking characters again? 




 In Canada that would be $30,000.  




 My dad loves classic cars, and a '73 240z was the first car he ever bought with his own money. He bought another one in 2001 and let me drive it as much as I wanted. 

It's like your ass is on the ground. I shit you not, you literally feel like you're sitting on the road. I used to take my girlfriend for a ride, and that car was like an aphrodisiac. 

I wasn't alive when it was first  produced, but I'll always love that car.  
























 Sweet, tangy or spicy? They had all three.

 I know my fish monger well and told him that we were making sushi. Before preparing the fish I always place it in the freezer for at least 15 minutes to kill any parasites.  




 My local fish monger does a great job. Since  I'm not on the west coast I'm pretty sure that it was flash frozen at one point, but I'm not sure.  




 They're a tartare mixture, one with tuna the other with salmon. They have a little fish roe, Japanese mayo and some crunchy tempura bits. We would have added some scallions if we'd had any. The only reason they're not sitting on rice is because we ran out.  









 I can't believe I just watched the whole thing, but that was a great video.  Thanks! 




 I'm not planning to upgrade the portrait lens at this point. The results from that, little inexpensive lens are astounding.  Really I'm looking for a telephoto lens and potentially a wide angle. 




 The biggest thing that I'm lacking is zoom.  My kids are getting older and I need to be able to take some sport action shots from a distance.

I'm currently using the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 portrait lens quite a bit, but I do use the 18-55mm when I need it.
