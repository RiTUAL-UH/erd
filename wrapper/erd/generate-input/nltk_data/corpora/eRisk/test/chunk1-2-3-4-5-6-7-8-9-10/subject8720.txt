 The last time I watched SSY, I think my mind was spinning from everything that happens in the end that the impact was lost a little bit. This time I'm determined to watch it properly! 




 It's taken my second watch to realise that maybe Yakomaru/Squealer's shift in name has deeper meaning than his new, recognised autonomy and authority. When he was named Squealer, he was cowardly and seemingly sold Saki and Satoru out. He's almost literally squealing to save his own skin. 

I don't really know how to feel about Squealer/Yakomaru even now that I've almost finished rewatching SSY... 




 Arguably one of the more interesting characters in Shinsekai Yori, I thought it would be awesome to see what other people thought of him. What do you think of the change in his personality? Do you think he was plotting everything from the start? 

This discussion is to be strictly about Squealer/Yakomaru so spoilers are fine. I mean, it's a bit hard not to discuss a character without talking about everything they've done, right?  




 I've nearly finished watching Shinsekai Yori and I'm just blown away by the impact it has. Like you, it's leaving me deep in thought and I can't help but feel really...dark. SSY isn't a happy anime by any stretch and I think it's meant to really challenge its audience. Ultimately, I think it makes us think a lot about human nature, and nature of ethics. It's hard not to find myself thinking about not only the characters and the plot, but the deeper themes of the anime as well. SSY is probably the best anime I've ever seen.  





























 So I'm going to take an exam this afternoon that I haven't studied for. I'm pretty much resigned to the fact that I'm going to fail. What do you do when you take an exam you haven't studied for? 




 I would definitely suggest going back and trying to watch it again. It is intense...but worth watching!!  




 It's unclear whether it's genetic or not, but my family (from what I've been told) has a history of mental illness. I can't help but think that maybe without that, growing up would have been a lot easier.  
























 Thank you! I actually did this and it helped a lot! :) 




 Thank you! I didn't really do as well as I'd hoped...but I should be alright!  




 Me too. Like right now. 




 Does it have to be Jesus? I'm not confident in how much he knows about International Relations and political theory. 
























 I feel you - that was tough to get through...still think the ending makes all of that worth it though. And to be honest, I felt like Shun's suicide was sadder than Maria and Mamoru leaving... 




 I find this hard to accept - I've never failed a test in my life. 




 I had enough time to study on the train commute thank goodness! I'm probably the worst procrastinator I know. :/ 




 I can't decide if this sounds like a good idea or a bad idea.  
























 Maybe try Glasslip? It isn't a straightforward anime though, like Akatsuki no Yona (which I also loved btw). I really enjoyed it though! Or maybe Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso? It was AMAZING 




 On Shinsekai Yori, I can understand why some people may say it started slowly. For the most part, a lot of the story is told quite subtly, or even not at all and we are left guessing. What makes SSY so good are all of the silences, where we're left grasping and guessing at what really happened and why.  




 I agree with everyone here recommending Shinsekai Yori - IT'S AMAZING  




 Is it more important to you to work a high-paying job which enables you to do heaps of awesome things and look after your family or work a job where you can follow your passion and enjoy your work without necessarily earning very much money? For example, I want to earn a lot of money one day so I can buy my mum a house, and afford my own house and take care of my younger sister and afford holidays and stuff. 
























 So I've just finished watching Ao Haru Ride and loved it a lot, although I wish the romance had been more pronounced in it. I'm just really in the mood to watch a solid romance anime that isn't too old and has a really nice story like AHR or Sukiitte Iinayo.

I wouldn't mind something with a bit more comedy either, like Lovely Complex (one of my absolute favourites!). I guess the most important criteria here is romance, and not just wishy-washy romance, but actual solid romance...something to make my heart race! :) 




 OMG I've just finished watching all the available episodes of Ore Monogatari and I love it! 




 I've just finished watching Shinsekai Yori for the second time and I can't help but feel blown away by it. At once, I feel very subdued by the dark themes of the entire anime, but at the same time heartened by the ending and Saki's will to change her society for the better. 

It's such a chilling anime, and I don't think I really understood why until now. Ethics are such a vital part of human society, and the way they are warped in SSY really made me question not only ethics as they stand today, but also as a system of thought. Essentially, I guess it made me really start to think about why certain things are bad and some good. At what point should we assign 'rights' to something? Are only human beings really guaranteed rights?

I guess that's the reason I love this anime so much. I'm so fond of deep thinking and turning difficult questions over in my mind. Each shocking twist of the plot jolts you out of your thinking and seems to make it all the more real. 'What if such and such really did happen?' 'What if that was how society really is?' It's a philosophical and emotional rollercoaster and I simultaneously loved and hated that. 

I'm curious as to what other people felt when they finished SSY. Did you start questioning the nature of the world like I did? Or, was it a purely emotional story about children growing up in a post-apocalyptic world? 

Also, I'd love to discuss some of the broader themes of SSY...like the bombshell about the queerats at the end, or the nature of children's rights and such...so, GO! 




 That's fair - I really like anime like Shigatsu, so it was pretty addictive for me :3 
Maybe try one or two episodes. It was a little bit confusing at times so I could understand that :D 
























 Kaichou wa Maid-sama is another one of my favourites!

Haven't seen Golden Time though, might watch it then! :)

These are all great and in my top ten, so I highly recommend them! 




 I absolutely loved Chihayafuru (and the second season)! Japanese culture really interests me and I love anime they showcase different aspects of the culture, like Chihayafuru does with karuta. More than anything though I just love the characters and how much they love karuta and dedicate themselves to it! Makes me wish I played too :3 




 I was the same, although in saying that I don't usually cry when watching anime or movies or whatever. YLIA definitely hit me right in the feels though!  
























 I know! It was so good!  




 I'll definitely go and check out the rewatch threads - I've been dying to see what other people have thought after rewatching SSY...it's definitely a different experience the second time around. On Yakomaru/Squealer, I've actually started a thread dedicated to discussing him as a character, as he's personally one of my favourites. You should definitely [check it out!](http://www.reddit.com/r/shinsekaiyori/comments/3atzyy/the_nature_of_squealeryakomaru/) 




 I mostly agree with what you're saying about the possibility of Squealer becoming a dictator himself had he managed to overthrow the humans. What's really scary about that though is coupled with the revelation that bakenezumi were genetically engineered from the non-PK humans, it really does seem plausible that Squealer would become just like the humans he was trying to overthrow. I definitely agree that Squealer wasn't good. I mean, even if someone argued that he was inciting war for the sake of liberating his species, the fact that it seemed he was planning to go further than that and straight to world domination stands. In the end, his opportunistic and calculating nature definitely make it seem like he was after more than just being free from humans.  




 That sounds like exactly what I'm looking for! I'll give it a go :) 
























 Oh it's okay I found it! I just typed it in wrong the last time :3 Thank you!! :) 




 Oh my gosh I LOVED Kimi ni Todoke!!!  




 I've been recommended Golden Time a few times so I'm definitely going to watch it now! I really loved My Little Monster as well!
Ano Natsu de Matteru looks good as well! Thank you for your suggestions! :) 




 I had a look around and can't find the anime you're talking about. Do you perhaps know the Japanese title of it or a link to where I can find it? 
























 Okay.   




 Me? I'm okay I guess... 




 This probably isn't the best example, but it's the only one I can really think of right now. To give you some context, I was at work and I was really struggling. It was like I wasn't even there, like a zombie. I worked through the motions of what needed to be done but I barely even have a thought to what was happening or what I was doing. It was a bad day. Anyway, I knew I had to do something, or else I would go home to an empty house and continue to feel empty and bereft. After work, I called up a friend I hadn't really spoken to for a couple of weeks; he's always up for anything and loves to explore. So, I asked him to pick me up and I directed him to an abandoned railway tunnel I had found near my house when I was younger. All I really told him was that I was having a bad day and needed to DO something. The railway tunnel is covered in graffiti you see, so I picked a blank space and added my own graffiti: 'I am alive'. After that I decided to hang out with him and his friends who I hadn't met. While I remained pretty melancholy for the rest of the day, just doing something so out of the ordinary shocked me. It brought me out of the quiet, dark place my mind had gone. It was almost like I had been holding my breath and had finally remembered to breathe again. I'm not saying you should go out and graffiti or anything. Just do something like calling a friend you haven't spoken to in a while. Go for a walk somewhere you're not familiar with. Explore.  




 Thank you. I'm surprised by the comments I've received. I didn't really realise that there are other people who feel the same way as I do. Sometimes, I do try to make an effort to go out and do things, even if they're on my own, but more and more lately I find myself just opting to stay at home. I feel like I only make an effort because that's what I'm supposed to do. It's my responsibility to do my best to get better. 

I wish you luck with your meds. Don't be afraid to talk to your doctor about trying different ones if those ones don't work for you. And give them time to work I guess. And you're right, they don't give you back the 'meaning' in your life, they only even out the emotions for you so you can find/create that meaning yourself. It's hard and it's frustrating but it's possible.  




 I've been there too many times, I know what you mean. It just gets harder and harder to break free from the almost cozy darkness. Loneliness, for me at least, is so familiar. It's easier. I try not to let myself get into that kind of thinking, but I guess sometimes I just get so tired of having to try so hard to be 'happy'.  




 I understand what you mean. Sometimes, I find myself getting lost in the moment and enjoying myself, but not as often as I'd like at this stage in my recovery. More often than not, everything seems so meaningless, like you said. I guess the only way to try and not feel like this is to do things that shock you into feeling...so doing things outside of your comfort zone. It's what I've had to do a few times...but it doesn't always work :( 




 Definitely the live version of Latch by Sam Smith - he's an angel  




 I'll make sure to! I'm just watching the second season of Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru at the moment (and loving it!) so that's next on my to-watch list! :D 




 I think it's hard to say. On one hand, it's hard not to think that any friends you make who are also depressed are simply there for the pity party. Misery loves company. Speaking from experience, putting a group of depressed teenagers together eventually creates a somewhat toxic, but understanding environment. People who are going through the same thing as you won't judge you, and will be able to understand you on a level most people won't be able to. However, it's a sad truth I've come to understand that it's hard to recover alongside someone else at the same time. For me, their recovery became more important than my own. Their depression almost ratified my own, making it a real and tangible part of my life.
