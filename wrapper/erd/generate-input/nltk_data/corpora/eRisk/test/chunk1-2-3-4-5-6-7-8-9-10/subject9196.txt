 Probably you are right. As a proof, here is my photoblog from 2 years ago (while I had more time, I went outdoors and tried to capture some awesome portraits):

 Mine app reviews were deleted, the scores however were left untouched. Do you experince the same?

Maybe a small revolution for app reviews is comming (hopefully they will decay with time). 




 Thanks, no it was taken in Warsaw at bowling center (at the bar).

I would say that only downside of camera is a fact that it protrudes from body, so I often put finger on it - and then lens is dirty. So remember to swipe with t-shirt it before taking an awesome photo :)

I still experiment with battery but I find battery life quite decent, and phone is awesome to hold (5" but still small and light). 




 Do you know any wireless charger (iQ, would be used with Nexus 5) with an extra USB port in it?
So besides the phone (wireless) I can charge a mp3, or a tablet without getting under the desk. 




 Thank you - just rooting N5, and it is next thing on my to-do list.  




 Anyone can confirm that? I don't like spending about 3$ just like that...
Because it is not visible in their screenshots. 









 Also in Polish. 









 You can use Dropbox API or SkyDrive. I don't have any experience with any of those two so I cannot be an expert. 




 Will it be live somewhere on the Internet? 









 It look like it was wrote for Android 2.X, for sure not with current guidelines. Otherway nice work. 




 But you need to give a gmail account as I understand, and later on there is no way to transfer this Google Play money between accounts... 




 Germany have them - code on each kitkat (outside) - bought 6 of them, and no prize.

Poland - they are but competition page says 1 more day and 20h to start of a competition. And code is going to be on a receipt/bill (so as I understand 1 per one shopping, not per bar).

Italy and Austria - I haven't seen them, when I checked 1 week ago. 




 I was staring at first two, and wondering what I'm missing...  




 Keep up with Google guidelines - for sure app using G+ multiplayer are not worst due to matter of used service. Take a look at Osmos HD multiplayer - quite nicely done!

I don't know how it is in your country/surrounding but more and more my friends started using G+ as it is more hmmm, lets say 'professional' (less family) and it is connected to your phone. 




 It is a preview of FPS made Blue Brick (polish game studio), Left mouse click to shot, right to drop a weapon. Simple as that. 









 [Age of Zombies](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.halfbrick.ageofzombies) - shooter 

[4 Player Reactor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=coolcherrytrees.games.reactor4) - great to play with with friends at one phone.

[Can Knockdown 2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.idreams.CanKnockdown2) - throwing balls at targets

[Cartoon Wars](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamevil.cartoonwars.one.global) - defending castle, while sending own troops to take down opponent castle.
 




 I lost hope that it will be finally out, nice but somehow I enjoyed more 1,2, or 3 parts. 




 On what video? I'm asking how to implement such effect in my app, not how to turn it on in YT app. 




 Bought it in UK, regretted immediately... 









 Hi, latest update of YouTube app brings awesome feature of video over activity. Does anybody knows how they achieve it (or get similar result)? 




 S4 Mini, LG L5 II, or Samsung Galaxy S Advance. 




 Samsung S4 Mini -http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_i9190_galaxy_s4_mini-5375.php 




 Some story behind that gif:
It was during EURO 2012 in Warsaw - when hosts (Poland) was playing with England - game was postponed. But there is a roof which (even despite that forecast was saying that it is going to rain) was left open.
As a result of waiting for the game, two guys run on pitch - they were arrested, but later on (as I remember correctly) their charges were withdrawn. 




 Anyone have it to share apk file?  









 There  is a video of that gif:

 I got few pairs of headphones (always 'in ear' ones) which have same problem - one from pair is broken, in some of them it start working when you hold cable near jack (where cable ends, and jack starts) at special angle.
Is there any easy way to fix them? So far I was always buying a new pair (all of them last around 5-12 months), but it's enough! 





























 In my country (Poland) where mech keyboards are not popular, Razer is quite easy available. I bought it as it was for ~100$ when buying any other would be around 200$ (120$ + 40-50$ (shipping) + duty charge (20-30$) = around 200$).

So Razer was quite good choice considering situation. I own black widow tournament edition (love tkl), and now I'm considering buying Shine 3 TKL with browns.

 Story:http://www.wykop.pl/wpis/6622222/kupie-pizze-2-za-10-000-doge-mieszkam-w-olawie-mow/

It's polish portal similar to reddit, a guy with nick "noisy" asked somebody to ordered 2 pizzas to [Oawa](https://goo.gl/maps/6JWSz) offering 10k in Dogecoins.
A guy "SharpNieSharp" took a challenge and ordered them, a special ask was to write "Dogecoin" on a box.
Pierogi (dumplings) was an extra thing - personal choice of SharpNieSharp.



Edit: If you need any translation - just ask (exam tomorrow so I will do anything apart from studying).  




 Is that setup sponsored by Razer and Pepsi? 




 I thought it would be cheaper to sell whole keyboard and buy new switches - then I looked at prices per switch... 




 Why do you want to save pieces (switches as I suppose), is it better to clean it (without desoldering) and sell? And use that money to spend on new one? 




 "Where do you come from fella?"
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh64nPT7JWk 









 Do you also wrap it up and send it to yourself - few days of that feeling "Is today going to be THAT day?" 




 Let's start with ***"640K ought to be enough for anybody."*** - Bill Gates, not true at all - sorry folks.  














 If you tried and didn't fall in love, lucky you - that shit is expensive, but in my opinion worth it. 




 Try mechanical - never go back... 




 Sorry for not changing system language or trying to make it English-readable. Top is "Birthday are celebrating by:" and buttons are "Send birthday wishes".

As a extra info - Polish is one of hardest to learn language - If you have any questions I will glad to answer them.

 Painful is to see it reposted X time...  




 I see 12z (it is about 4$), so

A) It doesn't work

B)Not yet has spreaded through play store

C)It is region limited promotion 









 Uff... you didn't find it. This is just a hoodie that I get as a mobile dev, so it is just a promo, if you expected a viral Nokia clothes commercial - sorry to disappoint you, not that time.





There is nothing in the background. 




 She laughed, otherwise it wouldn't be here. So don't think of me as that bad person. 




 I got it as a mobile dev and she really liked it, plus I'm into Android, so I wasn't regretting it. 




 I recommend to watch that: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyTEKhkB8OM#t=86

one of his commercials. 









 I was as well afraid but I gave it a shot... and it totally worked - she was just angry that I didn't crop out the background, but not such things I have seen on reddit.

 Can you write something more about how they work (comparing to 'normal' keys)? 
Is there any 3d model of a universal keyboard key or did you do it by yourself?
Awesome idea! 


































 Thanks, I will make a screenshot with less colorful wallpaper. 




 To make you guys sleep good I have just removed WRITE permission, at least for now. Hope you will appreciate it. 




 I honestly have to say I didn't check it with Exchange calendar, as I have never though that it would be so popular. But if it will continue - I will make such test, to make sure that I don't ignore any bug - and I can sleep well. 




 As before that one I was into Bitcoin apps, page is already there (http://tajchert.pl/donation/) but I don't plan (at least now) a paid version as red tape work in Poland is awful and you need a company to pay tax from sells, but will take a look at that in few days and future apps. Thank you for proposing. 




 Thank you, I have never imagine (in my life) as student, with none class about programming for Android, I would end up at Android Police main page...

Thank you to all of you that up voted/rated/criticized it! I will make everything to make all your request come true! 




 Thanks, I will make (even) more tests and dive into that to find that bug. Please let me now PM or here if it disappeared or not. 




 In upcoming days I will add a feature to add own colors, and a checkbox "use calendar color" so please stay tuned.

About that colored area whre you don't have anything - double check if for sure you don't have - maybe a hidden event? 




 Sorry I can't get list of alarms from the system... I will do a second look at and experiment with some undocumented database but probably it will end up working only on some phones. In such situation it isn't on priority list todo. 




 I will take a look into that, and probably write email of calendar owner with some small font below calendar name. Thanks for pointing that out. 




 In a meant time I pushed a update solving that bug. But thank you for your effort to test it. 




 Thanks! I though they are gone for good, but now I have nothing no to defend myself for making that mistake.
I just uploaded update to Google Play and it should be available in few hours. Hope you will enjoy it, there is small glitch that if  you make it full screen marked area is a bit out of clock - will fix as soon as I can.
 




 Thanks, my friend (when developing it) suggested it to me but I said "maybe later" now I see that it a good idea, and I would add it (but as opt-in in settings). 




 It show events from next 12 hours, it updates each 30 minutes and checks if there is any new event to show. If it doesn't fully answer your question, just ask one more time with longer description of a issue.  




 Sorry to disappoint you, but no. It is one year old idea, but there was always something more important to do, and I wasn't convinced that it would be so successful.

But it is nice to see that not only I have cool ideas, even if very similar. 




 I don't need any email permission, here are these that I use:

uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_CALENDAR"/

uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_CALENDAR"/

permission to write, modify event I need as in near future I will add some cool function and, if I would add then that ask for permission most users would not update (as automatically update would work in such case). 




 It is done that way. Maybe it is not very visible - I will add option to set it by user. 




 Thanks, mate! Is that a maximum bottom (as you can) position? Or you can't scroll at all? 




 It shows only events from next 12 hours - however, in some post here was it mentioned (to add events from 24hours), and I will experiment with that (maybe second circle with events?). 




 Thanks, added to my ToDo list. 




 Sorry to hear, I tested it with only 7-8 calendars. Can you provide some screenshots, and elaborate on it? Here or PM me. I would be more than happy to solve it. 




 Exactly, that my next idea in my mind - probably I will take a deeper look into it in few days, as I wan't to polish that one to perfection. 




 Would you like a color (as that in events) which indicates temperature, during next 12hours? However I don't know how to show rain/sun on it.  




 I already started designing slim one - digital one. But it is more work to make it as simple and perfectly readable at the same time. 




 Sorry, as in 4.4 there is no lock screen widget I have forgotten about that - just rapaired it, will be in few hours available in Google Play. 




 Thank you sir, you can adjust transparency of pie when adding a widget - from close to 0 to almost nontransparent one. 

Next update (working on it) will bring customization, so stay tuned. 




 Sorry, there is nothing that I can do with that, as I need those to read/add events to your calendar - but since app doesn't have a permission to access Internet, you are safe (even if I would be evil).
I'm currently working on some extra features (personalization etc.) when done, and I would clean project most likely I would publish code.

 Thank you! You are very helpful sir. Will take look at that and add it if it works. 




 Wait, in next version I will make 1x1, 2x2, 3x3. Hope it will help you. 




 Widget updates only once in 30 minutes (not to drain battery), so slowly disappearing, would be hard to do but will take that into mind. 




 Sorry, it needs 4.0 as below that there is a real mess with accessing/reading calendar events and for sure will have some problems - so I decided not to do it. 




 Seen, read, and that is awesome to hear that it seriously helps people.

I would say "enjoy app" but you certainly are. 




 No, it works on all 4.0. Somebody else have same issue - try reboot phone (yes, I know it is weird). 




 It is already available to download with sizes - 2x2 or 3x3. Enjoy! 




 It is already available to download - 2x2 or 3x3. Enjoy!

About colors... wait and I will come back with some awesome customization. 




 It is already available to download - 2x2 or 3x3. Enjoy!
 




 Zmniejszyem w aktualnej (1.9) wersji - 2x2 albo 3x3. 




 In few day I will post a version with such features and customization of them. So stay tuned. 




 That's a lot of text - I'll save it somewhere to read it on phone when on the bus or something. 




 Customization is coming, but Probably (at least in first update) outer ring won't be - only calendar colors, maybe background.

About tapping - working on it. Probably you would be happy.
 




 Sorry for copypasta but I would have to wrote it too many times today:
 "Do you feel lucky? You should, it is already uploaded - give it 1-2hours to distribute to your local google play servers. It has 2x2 and 3x3 ones."

 




 Maybe... Who knows, I have to take a rest after correcting all bugs. Most likely I will just give a presentation at local (Warsaw) GDG meeting - if yes I will try to record it to share it. 




 Sorry to say, it is closed to devs (at least I don't a way to make it for Gear). Maybe Sony Smartwatch or Pebble. 




 Thanks, corrected it (I uploaded without noticing it) and now we have to wait till google play updates. 




 Sorry for copypasta mate but too many of you and I didn't slept in last 30h.
It is not a bug, at least not of my widget (heh, probably every dev is saying that). I can't get event after it was created, otherwise I would have to check database very often = battery drain. So I use minimal widget update time = 30minutes, and after that event will show up, or you can remove and add it. 




 Thanks! Haven't seen it but looks very interesting. Would do my best to make it work. 




 For now there is a list of 10 of them, and choosing at random - would be in 2.0 version - matter of 2-3 days. 




 You wouldn't believe how my calendar lately became full of events... mainly test ones, but hey! People looking at your homescreen would know that! 




 Sorry for copypasta mate but too many of you and I didn't slept in last 30h.
 1 - It is not a bug, at least not of my widget (heh, probably every dev is saying that). I can't get event after it was created, otherwise I would have to check database very often = battery drain. So I use minimal widget update time = 30minutes, and after that event will show up, or you can remove and add it. 

 




 There was a discussion in other comments, I have removed it, in 1.9 version (should be rolling out). 




 Damn, I didn't know it is there... Fixing it. Thanks. 




 Sorry for copypasta but I would have to wrote it too many times:
"Do you feel lucky? You should, it is already uploaded - give it 1-2hours to distribute to your local servers. It has 2x2 and 3x3 ones." 




 All credits with layout goes to Dawid Cielak, I just said that there need to be a ring with colors. 




 1) Yes it is a problem, probably I will go with making borders around each event, and smaller event will be on top. Not ideal but almost close to it.
2)Color sync is on its way. Title/description would be hard, and I don't have ready answer to that. 




 Make sure that in calendar that you choose there is some events in next 12 hours - add events before adding clock, as it updates only once in 30 min. 




 1 - It is not a bug, at least not of my widget (heh, probably every dev is saying that). I can't get event after it was created, otherwise I would have to check database very often = battery drain.

2. Will do, thx, I saw that but has forgotten.
3. Will change - in next versions there would be normal activity as there will be more options to set - customization! 




 It is known (to me) bug - apart for you nobody found it. So ssssshhh... *they don't know*. 
[Serious] I'm working on it. 




 Sorry for copypasta but it is post up:
"Do you feel lucky? You should, it is already uploaded - give it 1-2hours to distribute to your local servers. It has 2x2 and 3x3 ones." 




 Do you feel lucky? You should, it is already uploaded - give it 1-2hours to distribute to your local servers. It has 2x2 and 3x3 ones. 




 I have to do some mindstorming with friends/myself and see what is the best way to do so two buttons, or one configurable, we will see. 




 You should feel lucky - there is already uploaded update (version 1.9) with 2x2 and 3x3 widgets. You should be able to download it in 1-2hours. 
























 It is still not released yet, but I will give a presentation about current (and possibly future) status and possibilities at the end of month, and I will upload a presentation about it - https://plus.google.com/u/0/+MichalTajchert/posts 




 *even be possible to create a music controller on an Android watch...?*
Just use ongoing notification for such actions. I think it is a wise move as my 95% of use of sw2 is only notifications.
Also ongoing notifications (as music control) is already available in Google Music, however they didn't released it in API (in preview). 
Custom card UI will be added in final SDK version (around Google IO).

 Thank you!  









 Yes! You just can't sell/buy it via US bank account - but you can transfer them to some local currency exchange and check out there. 




 You mean to select manually all devices with =1GB RAM? It would be like thousand of them - and you have to check every phone specification.  




 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12234221/specifying-android-market-ram-in-the-manifest

Apart from screen filtering there is no way to target those devices - I share your pain. Unless you want to select them manually, or programmatically at app start - but both of them are far from perfect. 




 Stay tuned (with auto updates), as it is almost ready (center will trigger clock, and ring - calendar). 




 Some of it I just added in 1.91 version - it's messy but better then nothing. I will polish it in next update. 




 In current version (1.91) you can set them to colors of your calendars. In next update I will give an option to customize them. 




 Sorry, but Android doesn't give a list of alarms, also timely doesn't. 




 Check out latest (1.91) version - I added it. Custom colors will be added in next update - with better organised settings panel. 




 Never say never :)
Reddit made my widget popular so I feel obligated to keep connection and exchange of ideas with you guys. 
Thank you for being one more person happy with that widget. It really means a lot to me. 




 Will look into that but please don't get your hopes up, as there is very little chance that it would work - but I will try! Reddit made my widget popular, so I own you guys. 




 Hi, there... I was wrong, there is a way... (which doesn't drain battery) and I already added it, I will ad Google Calendar colors as option and will push in few hours an update with that! 




 Yes, it have to be in next 12 hours, and it have to be a "not all day one".
Also it refreshes every 30minutes so if you add one in meantime, wait 30min. or remove and add calendar to force update. 




 It will work like that in next or 2.0 update - so matter of days. Stay tuned. 




 Glad that bug turnouts to be a feature.  




 Can't get alarms from Android... Sorry. I would love to.

 Anybody with white PBTs can say how fast they get dirty?

I was always wondering about that.

EDIT: I just realized that somebody already ask that question, but didn't get any answer about getting dirty. 




 Yes, it is good, same as Rapid - just full size layout.

In that price tag you wouldn't find anything better.
You can also look up rosewill rk 9000, which is also considerate as one with good quality/price ratio.  




 You didn't specify layout, as I'm a TKL guy...

CoolMaster Quickfire Rapid - good, "standard", cheap (one of cheapest), and same manufacture as Filco.

Other than that - Leopold 660M, to Europe is one of cheapest options if you like such layout. So which keyboard is "the cheapest" depends on that where you live.

For example in Poland SteelSeries is one of cheapest (90$), and next is Razer BW Tournament (120$). In Europe you should also check Das Keyboard as it might be good option to go. 




 Whoa, that is interesting!
Look at "mayo, mayonnaise" and it seems that mayo comes from ~1860!
 









 Yeah, I'm fully aware that system of ratings is "dumb" and Google could easily make it better, but still it doesn't justify such garbarage reviews.

What's more I also get review such "Hello" (1-star), and "You won't look at it if I gave 5 stars. Great app!" (1-star).

Which was pretty sad for me as I also read 5 star ones. 




 Sorry but Google Play doesn't scroll down to review itself.
[Here is pic of it.](http://imgur.com/oLlCYjs.jpg) 









 You should be able to do so. 




 Because it uses Google Calendar as source of information of you events in next 12 hours.
And if you don't have it - app won't get that information. 




 I will!

I'm very eager to do that, and as well I'm going to IO so... it would be done as soon as they are going to release it. 




 Thanks I will test few configurations on my friends mobile, and include that in next update.

However less pixel density widgets in app (settings, and list of widgets) is done on purpose. 




 Please specify phone details, I will see because there is small algorithm that adapts resolution of drawing to your phone. Because otherwise on 1/4 devices you would get errors, memory overflow etc. 




 Did you updated from previous version? If yes please reinstall - for some people it was solution, however I tested and didn't notice it.
If not please mail me(mail is in the app), describe step by step what you do and where it fails, also please specify details of phone/system.
**I would appreciate all of people who have such issue to do that** - as I would love to solve it but it is as a riddle because on my 5 test phone everything is ok. 




 Maybe some of you remember [my widget \(12Hours\)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tajchert.hours) that I posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1uvt84/made_a_clockwidget_with_events_marked_as_colored/) 4 months ago.

After a long time I have done bigger update that add thinks such:

* Languages (Polish, German, Portuguese, Chinese, Italian, Spanish, French).
*  **More than one instance of a widget** - go and put 12Hours everywhere!
*  Second custom touch action for a widget.
*  **Custom colors!**
*  New skins (and more yet to come).
*  Wizard when adding a widget
* Optimization and code cleaning so next features will take less time.

I know that there is still much to do, but would love (as last time) feedback and advice on what features I should focus on, and what you would like to change.

That is my "thank you" for you guys, as only because of you it became popular (around 130k downloads).

disclaimer I would take a look at each (even down voted ones) ideas and opinions but things will be implemented not earlier then 2-3 weeks, because I discovered (by making that widget) that it isn't good to write code in a rush./disclaimer

EDIT: I have made some **G+ group** with access to beta releases and to discuss new functionality, submit your layout to include into app etc. -[HERE](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/108716578003125422667) 




 If you are a tech person - check out smart.exea.pl

Is it worth moving there? It depends in what sector you are looking for a work. 














 Can you provide link to that group buy? It looks quite interesting and if price ain't high - well, why not? 




 The same as any other subject but it is a wrong subject. 




 I would suggest as most people here - go for it, as it is best moment to do so at your life (and later on it would be only worst).
But don't rely on nursing job in Poland - English teacher would be a better choice, and if possible try to merge those two - look at Medicover/Lux Med (private clinics) as they possibly are looking for such people (or maybe translating medical literature to Polish, or teaching medical students).

Good luck! 




 So... like any cinema in Europe?

Only booze is 18+ not 21. 









 Seriously?

Aren't websites for that? Like providing information about you, your portfolio, projects etc. you know, stuff like that...

Are we going to spam Google Play with thousands of our portfolios apps?

 This is "normal", and that is also a reason why I own a Samsung Gear Live - because it uses USB which is way faster.

 Exactly as Jush said. Greenrobot's works but then you will have two not connected ones, one on Wear and second one on mobile - no way to send events between. With that modification your events are propagated as well on other devices - so you have methods post(), postRemote(), postLocal().

 Why don't you connect PayPal with your existing bank card (debit or credit one)?

Than you don't need to put any money on PayPal account as it is drawn from your card automatically.

 You should not shout when asking a question.

It helps. 




 I would say... Samsung - it is (unfortunately) biggest Android manufacture and if something will broke... it will be on Samsung (many bloatware apps, tweaks of original Android etc.). 




 Yeah, shop looks decent, if you are not sure what kind of stuff they are going to buy just make sure to order a "KARTA MAXI" card as using that they can choose from any store listed on their site. So they can use it in bookstore or any other kind of store.

I don't know where do you live but 200PLN is a decent amount for present and for sure they will be happy with it. Just to put amount of money in perspective in McDonald's cheeseburger is 5PLN if I'm correct, average lunch in Warsaw (capital, so it can be lower in other cities) is ~20-25PLN. However electronics etc. are in the same prices as in any Western Europe country (just add 15-20% to USA prices as we got way bigger tax). 




 Yes, we can order from Amazon.co.uk but for some products there is no shipping to Poland. However most products are ok.

Also you can search for "karty podarunkowe" which is "gift cards" and look for some other store as well - depending on interests.
I would suggest looking for merlin.pl (mainly bookstore), empik.com (similar, probably bigger=more items), or agito.pl (as Amazon, however everything is sold by one company).

And keep in mind that if you buy for example Google Play card (awesome because we got access to movies and ebooks lately) they are sold for particular country so you have to look for "polish" one. 









 Moto E (confirmed, but arrival date is yet not known). 




 I already commented that post, and pasted link to this reddit so author can respond by himself but he doesn't look interested in.
If anything I can translate (but I don't think it would be necessary). 




 Translation: "*The result exceeded expectations, and it is better on Kitkat than on the Lollipop"*. 




 So friend of mine re-shared post of somebody who succeed at replacing default battery in Nexus 5 for LG G2 one - 700mAh (30%) more.
https://plus.google.com/u/0/102008505105093990793/posts/cdMJc6R8UST

From his post - he needed to cut one border that holds battery to fit it, and no more Qi charging.

Did anybody else tried it? What is your opinion on that?

 To gather data we used: Routers with running script on OpenWrt, and upload saved data to MySQL database (each minute).

To visualize - python scripts (ffmpeg and imagemagick), data in yaml, csv and json format, finishing with plain HTML (with small jquerys help) to present the data and javascript to provide the interactivity.

 Any opinion on Cruton, any issues worth taking into account? I'm considering buying Pixel LS as it is 700$ cheaper than MacBook Pro (EU here) for Android development so Ubuntu will be my primary OS. 









 Sure it can be, most likely a drawable inside it.
But in this way I avoid most of the problems of for example, keeping size, and detecting text bottom line.

EDIT: you can even find a branch with such Drawable instead of 3 textviews on this repo. 









 Good try of avoiding a pop dialog of Superuser:

 Actually they work in Telegram, and are pretty great (later on you can easily search by some hashtag). 









 Yes, it extracts its RemoteInput correctly, set text, and send it back but Hangouts does ignore that text.
Just tested with Messenger - it works correctly. 




 So I have created sample project with it, and actually it is working.. for every other app except Hangouts (didn't test with other like Messenger).
https://github.com/tajchert/NotificationResponse
Probably they require some additional Id or use other way of getting RemoteInput. 




 What tool did you used to decompile? I used 3 different (dex2jar, some online one, and ShowJava app), each time with different results. ShowJava at leasts shows some method in BaseMirror class, that is Wearable related.

"static Mirroring$WearReplyAction a(NotificationSpec var0) {"
but body is invisible due to some error. 




 Sorry, I found it later on (class) but there is still no code for extracting actions as you described.
Here is my BaseMirror class: http://pastebin.com/WDLV5yap
I have downloaded APK from Google Play (not extracted from the phone). 




 I have decompiled latest apk and can't find this class at all (neither "android.wearable.EXTENSIONS") any ideas where is it or what I'm doing wrong? 




 How about Android TV? 




 I'm aware of that - thus I wrote this is (very) small lib. It just save you work of setting up GoogleApiClient. So instead of those 80 lines of code you just wrote around 25. I found it useful in some of my project thus decided to make it a lib.

 Is Yarn open sourced? Or how is this connected to "dev"? 




 Hi, sorry but I don't have knowladge to help you but did you shared your code? Would love to take a look how to write own simple keyboard and there are very few resources with samples. 




 Thank you! I didn't know that one already exists. 




 That lib is solving a problem that not many people are aware of - if you get a exception/crash on Android Wear device it **won't be reported in Google Play** - so you will get many 1 star reviews and no crash reports. 









 Do not forget to add license as well (for public ones at least).

 What is most easy and good argument for and against http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis  




 I think this is called pull requests. 




 I see there only Python, PHP, Node.js so no easy way to use on Android (unless this framework is only for backend solutions). 




 What for? This is a library, app that is "visible" and can be used is just a mock to show how it uses library. Also it won't be possible as Android M isn't still release as API (for example 23) thus also I cannot upload it to jitpack etc. 

Which is a good thing because there can be still some changes before it going public (and I hope so, this library removes only some of pains to use new Permission model). 




 Is this some clone of a http://jimulabs.com/ (Mirror tool) even gif looks like theirs. 



















 Go ahead and give a try to Import.io.

Created two production apps based on it. So far very good experience. 




 To be honest I would suggest traveling to Warsaw/Gdask/Krakw at any occasion that you would have - as Biaystok isn't that much to see. Unless you want to enjoy nature - then mazury is your best bet and it is not that far (great for kayaks/yachts). 









  Which App Store?

Similar question:
http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/342xdv/china_android_markets_what_is_your_experience/ 




 I would suggest subscribing to AndroidWeekly, browsing /r/androiddev also G+ Android related people etc. and use Pocket to save articles to read at work (on a phone/tablet).

You will soon find out many interestings patterns, ways of solving problems, hacks and cool features. 




 I would guess Leopold FC660M but keys and case (probably) has custom color. 




 Every account on reddit is a bot except you. 




 Thanks, but that sounds good until you have a paid app. 




 I just read this post [Android is finally beating Apple in this one key metric- revenue from apps ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/341k7h/android_is_finally_beating_apple_in_this_one_key/) and as almost half app revenue is from "China market" though it would be good to read about it and maybe try to sell there some apps.


Did you use any Asia markets (competing with Google Play) to sell your apps ? If yes, which ones and what is your opinion? 









 Go and look for local developers meetups (my personal recommendation - GDG events), most of them have hackathons - events during which teams compete by making apps. In most cases you can join them as a idea person, and see if anybody is up to join your idea and help to create it.

 Nice post, I would also add accelerometer data to check if user isn't looking down.

 Best libraries are those that solves problems that you didn't know that you have. 




 I would like to see library effect on for example gif in readme instead of having to compile project or download APK. Much appreciated.  









 Oh, ok now I watched GIF few times more I got this. It is both drawer and wizard. Before that I thought it is wizard with drawer as a part of wizard process. Thanks! 




 I'm not sure if Drawer is correct UX pattern in "wizard", as (in most cases) we don't want user to jump from first to last item without setting middle ones.

Just a thought. 




 Anybody tried it, how are results?

 It always bothers me (like now during SpaceX Falcon 9 start) why they start to count last 10 minutes and show all those people doing a lot of important work in command center on dozens of screens.
Also is there some kind of manual that they go through - can somebody explain it what are some most important moments? 




 22 here: Computer Study Engineer, worked last 10 months in nice and (mostly locally) well known company but got the feeling that it is the last moment that I can achieve "better" things (risk a bit as I don't have a loan or something). Thus now I just want to push some idea with crowd funding support - so in year or two I can be proud of something that I created. 




 Thanks since posting I used my SO laptop (Lenovo flex 14) to see how does it look as it has even more dim screen - looks like it will be fine in 95% of cases which is good enough for me. 




 Thanks for suggestion but T450s is no match for me - need HDMI output as I'm doing quite a bit of presentation using projectors. 




 Hi,
I'm on the edge of going with X1C but only turn down is poor screen brightness mentioned in few reviews.

Can somebody confirm if all panels (HD/QHD/QHD with touch) have similar brightness?

I aiming in HD version but maybe it is worth to pay for better screen this 400$ more. 
























 We had an Android Wear watchface for few months, but it was using old (now deprecated) API and we took it off store.
Currently we are working on:
Hardware clock, updated Android app with many neat (I hope so) features, and then Wear watchface.

Sorry to put this on the end but we are rewriting whole app to make rending clock faster and more flexible to many situations, and then we can work on watchface with awesome performance. 




 Thanks, I just fixed those mentioned and ask native friend to make a full proofread with some fixing style. 




 Sorry if it sounded off putting.
My previous posts was mostly - tinkering is awesome and I really recommend it (even if you "end up buying mine") as you will have tons of fun, and maybe we have missed some important thing.
Also I already developed (for now a beta part) an API for 12hours to allow 3rd party devs to play with this, as I can find one, two... uses for this but I'm sure there are tons more. 









 Once I find a bit of free time I will make a (probably) medium short story how it went from idea (3 years ago) to current state (and hopefully to product on the market).

Let's just say it was a lot of tinkering, seeing what works, what doesn't, what we should improve, what are key aspects, polishing design, polishing design etc.

And don't get me wrong, attaching LEDs to a clock was easy but for example figuring out that it is good to move from wall clock to desk one is a better idea was tricky part. 




 Thanks, I have added paragraph "what?" near top to make it more clear. Hope it is fine now. 














 Sorry didn't tested it via VPN, maybe some server lag. I changed an hour ago setting where it is available  and description - description was refreshed thus I though it is also available worldwide. 




 I tried similar thing at my old Asus UX32VD - swapping screens between 2014 and 2012 edition. With no luck. Screen was fine but they used cable with different length that had weird angle at one place... I wasn't able to bought it - so I gave up.

So be prepared for that kind of stuff.

 I don't know what kind of app are you making, but I would recommend going through Google flags apps like Gmail, Newsstand, Play Store itself and check things like button presses. They do not have touch. Even Google Maps sound is limited to voice commends which is key-feature.

One app that I'm aware that stands out is Facebook - sound on refresh, but they are big enough to push their own ideas across platforms.

I'm not sure how it looks currently but at some point also Twitter from what I recall had some sounds on refresh list. 




 Not a source but considering your example (button clicks) -  don't do this. For one simple reason - many users have build in system sound for click on touch screen (ex. LG by default), which will be supper annoying.

Or just offer simple way to turn it off.

Also it is not common to implement sounds in apps (if we consider UI - as refreshes, buttons etc.) probably in most cases only notifications are "loud". Of course this doesn't apply to for example music apps for obvious reasons.

 Hi,
I installed Duolingo on my grandma tablet and she started learning at amazing peace and eager. Started with 0 language knowledge around a month ago.
Her native language is Polish and Duolingo offering Polish-English course was a big plus.
My guess was to start with movies in English with Polish subtitles as probably her reading skills are better than listening. Other idea is to convince her to go for special course. What are your recommendations for older people?

 I don't know where you live but in my area apart from Hackathons (which probably aren't best fit for you as you are looking for a not that rapid developing) there are dozens of meeting to solve some problems in society - for example http://kodujdlapolski.pl/ which means "code for Poland" and in most of their meetings there are at least few ideas and always too little dev people.

Another idea is to take some popular Android app that is abandoned for a while (bad UI, slow etc.) and make it much better - just be aware of trade marks etc.

Also probably /r/Android or /r/enterpreneur is better to give you just an idea for an app. 




 Mine does (X1 2015) when CPU is used and I scroll too fast, is there way to turn this off? 




 If you think about mobile startup - nice and short reading.

Also as a mobile dev - I can highly agree with author.

 Take into account Lenovo flex 2 14 or X1 as wel fit your size needs.

Basically all Lenovo have not most bright screen - so if you would like to work on sunny beach, you might consider other laptop (Dell for example).

Source: owner of X1 na SO has a Flex 2.

EDIT: You are asking at /r/thinkpad for dell noise issues? sry?

 Go for some used Samsung old flagship - as S2 or S3.
They are still popular, and some errors as Samsung-specific from what I saw.

Moto E is nice but, hey it is almost vanilla Android so there is almost no chance of getting an error.

Skip to 0:45, and 2:27 is probably one of most beautiful shots I have ever seen. 




 I use Win 8.1 (came with win 7 - uh). 
HDPI is fine, now using FullHD on 24" is a pain ( a bit joking but hell, you get addicted to hdpi).
There is no many issues with hdpi - mainly scaling in not round way ( 100% is supper small, 150% is fine, but 123% for example is blurry in many place), some installers are a bit blurry but I hope with Win 10 it will be a bit better (also steam application is not hdpi-friendly). Probably HD on 14" is just enough but QHD is only version that was available here in Poland with i7. 




 Polish "PLAY". 




 X1 3rd gen i7, non-touch QHD maks brightness with developing in Android Studio + chrome + emulator = around 5,5-6h
Screen could be more bright, touchpad one or two times (since 2 months) had some problems - trackpoint not, restart helped.
Overally happy but 8GB is a bit of pain, 12GB would be perfect. Would buy it second time - also LTE is super nice (even if before buying it wasn't key feature) having 1GB per month for 15$ a year is super nice fallback.
