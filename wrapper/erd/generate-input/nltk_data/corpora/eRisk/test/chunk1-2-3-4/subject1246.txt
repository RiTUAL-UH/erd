 In AskScience and Science we have a lot of flaired users, and we'd like to be able to add them to a private subreddit, right now it's done entirely by hand, which is a real chore if several people have added flair.  

Is there an existing script or bot that would automate the process, like the script that syncs flair between two subreddits?  I'm not a programmer, but it seems like something that should be straight forward to do with PRAW.

 Environmental biology professor at [Fort Lewis College Durango, CO, USA]( http://www.fortlewis.edu), [studying the biological impacts of climate change](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QcIjyzwAAAAJ hl=en).  She studied the biological consequences of earlier snowmelt, climate warming, and most recently elevated CO2.  Her research on how elevated CO2, not just climate warming, leads to a longer growing season was [published in the journal Nature](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature13207.html), and reported in the [news](http://www.nature.com/news/co2-makes-growing-seasons-longer-1.15081), including in a [New York Times column on changing seasons and its consequences](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/science/springing-forward-and-its-consequences.html).  Studies like hers highlight the need to better understand the impacts of environmental changes that happen at the same time.  Her study shows an apparent benefit of greater CO2 concentrations on growing season length that we did not expect based on [an earlier conceptual model on changing seasons] (https://www.sciencemag.org/content/324/5929/886.summary).  Earths biological systems are changing due to human choices, and we need to better understand the impacts, both positive and negative, to reduce the associated risks.

 **Science AMA Series: We helped create the Third National Climate Assessment Report. Ask us anything!**

This past Tuesday, May 6, the White House released the Third U.S. National Climate Assessment - the most comprehensive national effort to assess the science and effects of climate change in the U.S. The report is designed to help officials, businesses, and members of the public in all regions and sectors of the country make the best decisions when dealing with climate change and managing related risk. The NCA also illustrates how these regions and sectors are connected. Unlike previous assessments, this NCA has been released as an interactive website, nca2014.globalchange.gov, to make it more accessible and useful to both citizens and scientists.

We are researchers at the University of Arizona who played a significant role in both the overall report leadership and especially the Southwest and Forestry chapters. We will be answering questions starting at 2PM EST. 

Who is here:
Kathy Jacobs - Recently returned to the University of Arizona to lead the UAs Center for Climate Adaptation Science and Solutions after serving as the Director of the National Climate Assessment for the White House.

Gregg Garfin - Lead author of the Southwest chapter of the NCA and Professor in the UAs School of Natural Resources and the Environment


Dave Breshears - Lead author on the Forests chapter of the NCA, drawing on his expertise on drought-related tree die-off, and Professor in the UAs School of Natural Resources and the Environment


Dan Ferguson - Director of the Climate Assessment for the Southwest 


Thomas McDonald - Project and Events Coordinator at the University of Arizonas Institute of the Environment, helping us navigate Reddit and input our answers.


tl;dr - The White House released the third National Climate Assessment(NCA) on Tuesday. It is comprehensive, designed to help everyone make decisions to deal with climate change, and released as an interactive website, a first for the Feds. The just-returned-from-the-White-House former director of the NCA, Kathy Jacobs, and a number of contributors, all from the University of Arizona, will be here starting at 2PM EST, 5/9/14 to answer your questions.

 Prof. Richard Betts, Climate scientist and Lead author of the most recent IPCC report is doing an AMA in /r/science today.  Please stop by with any questions about the IPCC or climate science!

Here is a link to the AMA:

This gave me a good fright until I figured it out, for some reason, and this is something that not many would notice, in subs with many user flairs, if you have RES enabled the "Next" button to see the next page of user flair is gone.  This gives the impression that the user flair has been deleted, but it's still there.  

If you disable RES and reload the "Next" button appears and you can go through the list.

 ##**Science Verified User Program**

/r/science has a a system of verifying accounts for commenting, enabling trained scientists, doctors and engineers to make credible comments in /r/science . The intent of this program is to enable the general public to distinguish between an educated opinion and a random comment without a background related to the topic. 


#**What flair is available?**

All of the standard science disciplines would be represented, matching those in the sidebar.
However, to better inform the public, the level of education is displayed in the flair too. For example, a Professor of biology is tagged as such (Professor- Biology), while a graduate student of biology is tagged as "Grad Student-Biology." Nurses would be tagged differently than doctors, etc...

The general format is:

Level of education|Field|Speciality or Subfield (optional)

When applying for a flair, please inform us on what you want it to say.

#**How does one obtain flair?**


First, have a college degree or higher in a field that has flair available.
Then send proof to the mods of /r/science .

This can be provided several ways:

1) Message the mods with information that establishes your claim, this can be a photo of your diploma or course registration, a business card, a verifiable email address, or some other identification. All submissions will be kept in confidence and not released to the public under any circumstances. You can submit an imgur link and then delete it after verification. 

Remember, that within the proof, you must tie your account name to the information in the picture.


2) if you aren't comfortable messaging the mods with identifying information, you can directly message any individual mod and supply the information to them. Again, your information will be held in confidence.


3) Send an email with your information to sciencereddit@gmail.com after messaging the mods to inform them of this option. Your email will then be deleted after verification, leaving no record. 

This is convenient if you want to take a photo of your identification and email from a smart phone, for example.

Edit:  Hi.  We're getting flooded with requests, we're adding people as fast as we can, if we miss you somehow, we apologize, if you don't see your flair or get a response in the next two days, message us again.

Thanks for making /r/science a better place!

 Ebola has been in the news a lot lately, but the recent news of a case of it in Dallas has alarmed many people.  

The short version is:  Everything will be fine, healthcare systems in the USA are more than capable of dealing with Ebola, there is no threat to the public.

That being said, after discussions with the verified users of /r/science, we would like to open up to questions about Ebola and infectious diseases.

**Please consider donations to [Doctors Without Borders](http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/our-work/medical-issues/ebola?utm_source=google utm_medium=ppc utm_term=brand_sitelink) to help fight Ebola, it is a serious humanitarian crisis that is drastically underfunded.** (Yes, I donated.)

Here is the ebola fact sheet from the World Health Organization: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/

 We're looking for a practical way to judge Panelist activity in /r/AskScience, and a good way would be to generate a log like the moderation log but tracking flaired users.  We don't care so much what they've posted, but rather how much Panelists post, so a simple tabulation of the poster and the number of comments would be fine.

Seems like it would be straight forward, but I've learned that simple things sometimes aren't so simple, so it makes sense to ask more experienced people first!

 Even worse, some big name highly competitive chemists (I think it was Corey) would completely leave out critical steps in their procedures so that their competition *couldn't* reproduce it.

Shameful it is.  




 Chiropractary has never had any proof it belongs in medicine, as a field chiropractors reject evidence-based methodology, huge difference. 




 In fairness, so does literally every other field of science, chemistry is struggling with the issue of reproducibility, as is biology and medical science.  The issue is reproducing others work isn't publishable, and if you aren't publishing in academia you are failing.

 Post your questions here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/365xeq/science_ama_series_im_luiz_rocha_an_ichthyologist/ 














 Today we announce a new feature in /r/science, **Science Discussions**.  These are text posts made by verified users about issues relevant to the scientific community.  

The basic idea is that our practicing scientists will post a text post describing an issue or topic to open a discussion with /r/science.  Users may then post comments to enter the conversation, either to add information or ask a question to better understand the issue, which may be new to them.  Knowledgeable users may chime in to add more depth of information, or a different point of view.  

This is, however, not a place for political grandstanding or flame wars, so the discussion will be moderated, **be on your best behavior**.  If you can't disagree without being disagreeable, it's best to not comment at all.

That being said, we hope you enjoy quality discussions lead by experience scientists about science-related issues of the day.

Thanks for reading /r/science, and happy redditing!

 




 ##**Science Verified User Program**

/r/science has a a system of verifying accounts for commenting, enabling trained scientists, doctors and engineers to make credible comments in /r/science . The intent of this program is to enable the general public to distinguish between an educated opinion and a random comment without a background related to the topic. 


#**What flair is available?**

All of the standard science disciplines would be represented, matching those in the sidebar.
However, to better inform the public, the level of education is displayed in the flair too. For example, a Professor of biology is tagged as such (Professor- Biology), while a graduate student of biology is tagged as "Grad Student-Biology." Nurses would be tagged differently than doctors, etc...

We give flair for engineering, social sciences, natural sciences and even on occasion music.  It's your flair, if you finished a degree in something and you can offer some proof, we'll consider it.

The general format is:

Level of education|Field|Speciality or Subfield (optional)

When applying for a flair, please inform us on what you want it to say.

#**How does one obtain flair?**


First, have a college degree or higher in a field that has flair available.
Then send proof to the mods of /r/science .

This can be provided several ways:

1) [Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fscience) with information that establishes your claim, this can be a photo of your diploma or course registration, a business card, a verifiable email address, or some other identification. All submissions will be kept in confidence and not released to the public under any circumstances. You can submit an imgur link and then delete it after verification. 

Remember, that within the proof, you must tie your account name to the information in the picture.


2) if you aren't comfortable messaging the mods with identifying information, you can directly message any individual mod and supply the information to them. Again, your information will be held in confidence.


3) Send an email with your information to sciencereddit@gmail.com after messaging the mods to inform them of this option. Your email will then be deleted after verification, leaving no record. 

This is convenient if you want to take a photo of your identification and email from a smart phone, for example.


Thanks for making /r/science a better place!
 
























 Starting on April 22nd, PLOS and /r/science will begin a weekly AMA series as part of the Science AMA Series to bring authors from the PLOS journals to reddit.

[See the announcement from PLOS here](http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2015/04/plos/)

PLOS, an open access journal, and /r/science, which does public review of journal articles, makes for a great fit, one that we are excited to bring to our readers.  

If you have suggestions or requests for AMAs from PLOS authors, email them to plosreddit@plos.org

Tune in every Wednesday for a new PLOS AMA!

 




 I've been trying to zone in on the fix for months, but I haven't had the time to really find the root cause. It's not the .organic-listing css, it's probably some inherited css from a different part of the stylesheet. 

I'm sure it's obvious to one of you, help? 





























 Post your questions here:

 Post your questions here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/31zpzy/science_ama_series_we_are_fred_whoriskey_and_sara/ 




 First off, I don't think this can be done, but I'd very much like to be wrong.

We in /r/science would like to track the number of readers who look at our AMAs, we get a lot of requests for the information and right now I have to email the admins and wait for them to get back to me with a number, I can't look at changes over time, or any other handy stats to let us know how people are using our AMAs. 

If we could embed a smart pixel via CSS we could gather some data on this, but it appears that all of the images that the subreddit CSS pulls need to be hosted on a reddit server, which would make our tracking pixel just a pixel.

Any thoughts on how to do this or am I stuck continually harassing people to get data?

 







































 Please don't submit them either, we are committed to keeping /r/science a serious discussion of science.  We know reddit just loves a good prank, but there are many other places to do so.

Yes, we totally hate fun.

 We should get the authors to do a  PLOS Science Wednesday AMA! 




 Science AMAs are posted early to give readers a chance to ask questions and vote on the questions of others before the AMA starts. 

Guests of /r/science have volunteered to answer questions; please treat them with due respect. Comment rules will be strictly enforced, and uncivil or rude behavior will result in a loss of privileges in /r/science.

If you have scientific expertise, please verify this with our moderators by getting your account flaired with the appropriate title.  Instructions for obtaining flair are here: [reddit Science Flair Instructions](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/flair) (Flair is automatically synced with /r/EverythingScience as well.)
 




 I will be giving the general rationale for our efforts in /r/science and discussing how everything fits together for the [American Chemical Society's Webinar Series](http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/acs-webinars.html)

Register for the webinar here (note there is a limit of 1,000 registrations, after which the overflow goes to youtube:

I hope everyone finds the discussion informative!

  Do you really believe they were ESSENTIAL for his success?

Absolutely, I'm sure he'd say the same thing.  

That doesn't diminish he hard work or his investment.  Without a market for Telsa's cars, he fails, and without the California Zero-emission tax credits, Tesla isn't even profitable.  There are stories told of how close Tesla was to going under, I believe a couple of months from not being able to make payroll (read bankrupt.)  

Building PayPal is significantly easier than a car company, and the sale price of any internet-based company should be weighted carefully (How much did What's App sell for again?  Does anyone seriously think a mobile phone app was harder to develop that a car company? Luck  and a good idea is a huge part of the internet success, in fact luck is substantially under appreciated in business success.)

Here's a story for you to read: [Tesla Is No Success Story
Tesla is only profitable thanks to politics and tax subsidies.](http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/economic-intelligence/2013/06/03/teslas-success-is-the-result-of-political-favoritism)

Some quotes:

Tesla Motors, the California-based electric car start-up, has been the subject of a great deal of hype. With the recent news that it repaid its $465 million low-interest loan from the Department of Energy, it's now being heralded as a success story worthy of redeeming the failures of a green-energy subsidy program that has included the likes of Solyndra, Abound, Ener1, and Fisker Automotive. Since then, Tesla's stock value has more than doubled and the company is currently valued at around $12 billion.

and 

Even with the support of federal and state politicians, Tesla would still be reporting losses were it not for its ability to profit off of other auto manufacturers in California. In the first quarter of 2013, Tesla reported its first-ever quarterly profit by using special credits from California's Air Resources Board, which rewards auto manufacturers for the production of "zero-emission" vehicles. So far this year, Tesla was able to turn what would have been a $57 million loss into an $11 million gain by selling $68 million worth of these credits to other auto manufacturers in California.


Without a low-interest loan from the DOE, Tesla would have had some trouble getting started.  Sure he could have gone to venture capital, but they would have wanted a lot of control over the company, something Musk has been reported as being unwilling to give. 




 PhD chemist here, you are right.  "Simple" things are months of work. 




 You realize his efforts have gotten significant government support.  SpaceX is basically funded by a NASA contract, Tesla received a government-backed loan, and the sales of their cars are supported by a meaningful tax incentive.

It is unlikely he would have made it without the government, so this is probably a case of a perfect counter example to the libertarian dream.

 It's important to realize that, again, INCI names aren't chemical names, so several different materials can have the same name.

For example, acrylates copolymer can be any from a list of acrylate monomers and literally any molecular weight above 1500 or so. 




  put $1k towards a decent mortgage

Anyone who is making that much doesn't has a mortgage payment much higher that $1000, $2000 to $3000 for the mortgage is a lot more realistic. If you don't have a mortgage payment, you probably pay cash for an M4 anyway.  

That being said, you general analysis is correct, someone could in principle afford this, but it would be pretty dumb.  I believe most people who drive M cars lease them. (Assuming the majority of those with M cars aren't hobby racers.)  I suspect a majority of the people who drive them are business guys who want the appearance/status symbol. (that doesn't cheapen the car, just a society thing.)

 




 Because INCI names aren't chemical names, they are a nomenclature of their own. 

In this context "Alcohol" strictly means ethanol [as defined in the INCI database](http://www.cosmeticobs.com/pro/news/ingredient-of-the-month/alcohol-inci-alcohol-or-alcohol-denat-803)

 I believe so, you can seriously injure yourself if you screw up.  I think 5 mL of methanol is all that it take to blind you.  

Ethanol, you can drink an 8 oz glass and just have a bad headache the next day! 




 Pretty much. 




 Mercury is only used in one vaccination that children get, the DTaP, and the form used is not toxic to humans at anywhere near the concentrations used.

You could drink elemental mercury and it would pass right through you, the salts are substantially more dangerous because they are far more readily absorbed. 




 You are correct, they are both organomercury compounds, but different types.  Similar to ethanol and methanol, which are both alcohols, however they have drastically different toxicities.  A lot of ethanol os a drunken good time, 15 mL of methanol will kill you. 




 [Today, the only childhood vaccines that have trace amounts of thimerosal are: one DTaP vaccine and one DTaP-Hib combination vaccine.](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Concerns/Thimerosal/thimerosal_faqs.html#f)

So it's just the DTaP. 




 Actually, they didn't.  Aluminum is in there as a [adjuvent]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant) not a preservative, aluminum was already there. 




 It's important not to propagate misinformation however.  Also, the mercury used at a preservative in vaccines is a different compound of mercury, and isn't nearly as dangerous to humans.  

The mercury found in tuna, however, is more than a vaccination ever was and **is** the dangerous kind, methylmercury.  It's presence is largely the result of humans burning coal which releases mercury into the environment.

 There isn't mercury in vaccines anymore (with one exception).

 Oh he totally was, but Diaz looked worse, he looked inept.  It was the right response to Diaz's style, that's what you do to one dimensional fighters, take away their style. 




 Condit was point-fighting Diaz, too.

You could also look at this as exposing Diaz for being unable to adapt once his game plan was taken away from him.   




 This is an opinion piece, not research.

 I'm actually going to an NSF-sponsored conference in July to basically do this. (I believe meta conversations are called "Communications" in academia!) 




 At the American Chemical Society Meeting in March, I was interviewed about the Science AMA Series.  This is the video the ACS staffers put together, I thought people would be interested in seeing it.

This is before a webinar I am giving covering science discussions on reddit:

(I'll post a link to the webinar on the day of so that people can easily find it.)

Hopefully reddittors find this interesting and informative as to our motivations and values. (spoiler:  we're pro-science!)

 Way too much work for the admins to vet websites reddit wide, reddit is just too huge.  Also, if something bad would come up from a link on an "approved" site, would reddit still be able to claim safe harbor? 




 Every single one of your comments in /r/science has been removed for breaking various rules, you've ranged the gambit from inane and off topic to homophobic and insulting.

And now you're whining to strangers about how terribly oppressed you are.

 Thanks.  In /r/science, we have an unusual situation in that we have an incredible number of mods, 814 last count, which gives us a lot of internal review of mod actions without the drama of having a public mod log or anything like that.  Because /r/science is one of the most moderated subreddits we get a people who post thinking it's any old sub that they can make their shitty, off-topic, political comments in and get away with it.  They can't (and should not be able to, frankly.)

While we do have mods from many different back grounds, I assure you that we don't have a dramatic ideological bend beyond being pro-science, as in peer-reviewed science.  We aren't pushing any philosophical positions, mostly we try to keep them out.  That's why his comment was removed, he's making a glib comment that is pushing a personal position (which is seen in his previous comments.) 




 In /r/science, the only time we look at behavior outside is to confirm a track record of poor behavior.  ( posting on a racist subreddit would tend to confirm that a user is a racist for example.) 




 It's because of a history of bad comments by this user.  We give temp bans to get user's attention, nothing special here.  It was a shitty comment that offered little insight.   




 He received a warning because of his history of bad comments, most of them have been removed for being overly hostile or political in nature.  It's not just this comment in isolation.  

Sorry that we don't feel like getting into arguments with hostile users looking to screen shot our conversations for grandstanding.

/r/science is not a free-speech subreddit, we have rules, we enforce those rules. 



 




 He isn't banned, he's just not giving you the complete story, like leaving out the parts where he is reinstated and given a warning to make better comments in the future.  We issue short term bans to get people's attention, works doesn't it?

Not as drama filled that way is it?  

[Here's the real conversation](http://imgur.com/eYeAUpL)

Note the bit he left out at the end.

But by all means, don't let this interfere with your circlejerk and harassing messages.

 Is there a way to re-title things to make it less of an issue?  We can't add anymore categories as we are at the character limit for the sidebar, so that's not an option.  

I created anthro as a separate sections because it tends to be more field work/lab work oriented than other fields in the social sciences, in particular Physical Anthro, which looks a lot like paleontology to the untrained observer.  Cultural Anthro and linguistics, sure, they could slot right into soc without issue.  

And honestly, from my experiences, aren't all anthropology people just functional alcoholics?  Would they even notice? :-D 




 We love all of our children equally.

How many active full mods?  how about we change the subject?  I like turtles.

 Science AMAs are posted early to give readers a chance to ask questions and vote on the questions of others before the AMA starts. 

Guests of /r/science have volunteered to answer questions; please treat them with due respect. Comment rules will be strictly enforced, and uncivil or rude behavior will result in a loss of privileges in /r/science.

If you have scientific expertise, please verify this with our moderators by getting your account flaired with the appropriate title.  Instructions for obtaining flair are here: [reddit Science Flair Instructions](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/flair) (Flair is automatically synced with /r/EverythingScience as well.)
 




 Is that closer to rheology or tribiology? 

(Like I said, I'm not the one who knows about this stuff, and it's the difference of slightly different orange backgrounds on flair, anthro used to be in soc, so there are probably anthro people with soc css classes.) 




 Our resident anthropologists tell us that Linguistics is a subset of Anthro.

http://www.aaanet.org/about/WhatisAnthropology.cfm

Social Anthro, Physical Anthro, Archaeology and Linguistics.

None of these are subsets of chemistry, so I don't have a knowledgeable opinion.

  




 Yup.  There isn't really an easy way to further break down the fields since people put their particular area, not a subfield in the text.  It would have to be done manually by someone familiar with the fields separating each out.  Some of them would be pretty hard to classify as well!  

For example, we have people with engineering degrees who work on computer programs to analyze biology.  So which field are they in? 




 It's under anthro, we follow the North American standard.

I'll see about working up more specific data later tonight, this is jsut css classes, so it's very broad. 




 You have env flair, environmental science, which is a green color, you must have the css turned off. 




 We think of it as community moderation, the rules are written as objectively as possible and enforced by a group capable of dealing with a default, as is the mod to subscriber ratio in 1/10,000!

A smaller group would burn out from too much work, this way no one person is critical, people can do as much as they want or as little. 




 Also amusing, flaired users/total subscribers

2769/8,260,948 (currently) = 0.0335% so a little over 3 hundredths of a percent. 




 Some go in health, other go in epidemiology, it depends on what the best fit is. 




 It's under bio.  It's the css flair class, not the flair text. 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/science/about/moderators

/r/science actually has more mods that all of the other defaults combined, currently around 800. 




 That's some nice Excel work! 




 Publish or perish is quite the incentive, especially on a publication going to a small journal that few will read anyway.   
























 Users are invited to take part.

 That isn't his job now, http://www.monsanto.com/whoweare/pages/fred-perlak.aspx

you just aren't familiar with what industrial scientists do! 




 I'd like to get some of these industrial people to talk about something the grad students are really concerned with:  getting a job. 




 No, but I've been working on getting big companies to join our discussions, and this sort of thing is completely outside of the traditional culture. Cultural change is hard, especially when you're talking to people in there late 50's/early 60's! 




 We didn't, in my opinion that isn't controversial, or particularly relevant.  It's a difference of opinion.  If you're looking for an excuse to be upset, then there probably isn't any talking you out of it though. 




 Based on the actual AMA, what are your thoughts? 




 Things worked out pretty well, but I am tired now! 




 Let me see what I can do, I'm at work and my image capture options are limited... 




 This is exactly true, I emailed Janice Person in August of 2014 completely out of the blue with my "Come Talk to reddit" sales pitch.  I still have the email chain in our gmail account! 




 Point them to our AMA Submission Guide!  We have a partnership with the ACS, so you can look forward to some quality AMAs from big name chemists (like Harry Gray!) 




 It was just posted.

 




 If only this was true, remember corporation are run by people in there late 50's/60's, they have never heard of reddit and took a lot of explaining.    




 I agree, I want reddit to be a cross-cultural meeting place to discuss important issue in a civil manner.  Some people are more interested in putting on a display of anger, but that doesn't get anyone anywhere. 




 In contrast to what the conspiracy people believe, corporations aren't really interested in reddit.  They are run by a generation that has largely never heard of reddit, convincing them that putting any effort into it was a challenge.  After that, corporation talk about things *forever* (I speak from experience here.)  

Recall when people talk about small business being faster and more agile that big corporations?  This is what they are talking about. 




 it is only kid gloves to people who can't contain their emotions, people who are used to having civil conversations do so without even thinking about.  There is never any need to be discourteous, just because that is routinely ignored on reddit doesn't make it ok. 




 That is how it is, very few top scientists work in lab these days, the same is true in academia, Nobel prize winners don't do bench work, they write grants and give talks. 




 We do let the votes work, on the questions that meet our publicly stated ground rules.  We have been doing this since January of 2014, these aren't new rules. 




 My apologizes if I misinterpreted your comments, you may have noticed other comments around here, they aren't so nice.

The fact is, I have spent months vetting this AMA, and we know who Fred is, I have contacts within the company and outside who give me information off the record, all of them say Fred is the guy to do this.

All of the political stuff just tells me he can think on his feet, everyone knows he represents Monsanto, that's a given, but he is a scientist, not a MBA or a marketing person.  He may not be in lab now but he did his time which makes him one of us. 




 whilr I can't require an answer to every question, does anyone doubt there will be far too many questions to answer?, I push all of our AMA guests to answer the top voted questions first. That seems to be the only fair way to go. 




 We have rules, you chose to ignore them, next time you start by messaging the mods and establishing yourself.  Also, taking pot shots at us is crap. 




 No, only ask questions that are civil and polite.  One can disagree without being disagreeable.  Anyone who can't frame their question without anger doesn't sufficiently understand the question! 




 Asking a question in anger, or using humour, does not reduce the validity of the question

It does get the question removed here, and now that you know the ground rules if you violate them you can't complain about your question being removed, since you made the choice to have it removed yourself.  Action = Consequence. 




 We get those too, organizations doing official AMAs like this is much harder.  Lawyers and human resources are involved.  ugh. 




 None of that means anything, of course he's a registered lobbyist, you have to do that to talk to politicians, there are legal requirements.  As for contributions, so what?  I've cut multiple checks to politicians, if I could afford to do it more I would, last time I checked that's how the American political system works: you support those who represent your point of view.

"If any mods want my credentials on this feel free to e-mail me. "

And you supplied your email address?  Nope.  So we can't email you, can we?  Also, everyone else making claims **follows the subreddit rules** which require you to get the flair before you make the claim.   




 They do, and several have flair in /r/science.

 




 This is none of those areas since it could not possibly be decades old.

Also, it's our house, and our rules, those who wish to yell can start their own AMA series in their own subreddit. 




 I respectfully disagree with you on this.  While he is certianly operations leader, his title that of a scientist.  Every corporation has a bevy of Vice-presidents, it's just a level.  All high-level scientists at science-based companies take on a public outreach function, that's how it is.  Of course this is about public relations, any public interaction necessarily is, that's the definition of talking to the public.

Referring to veiled "credentials" also doesn't get you far here, users with credentials have flair stating such, which you have none.
 




 I have had a year and a half to prepare for this, /r/science can handle it. 




 I think we can be pretty sure that Monsanto's goal isn't to drive Indian farmers to commit suicide.  The whole concept doesn't pass the sniff test, it's just far to hyperbolic.

From one of the links:

For example, a 2012 paper in The Lancet that surveyed Indias suicide mortality rate noted: Studies from south India have shown that the most common contributors to suicide are a combination of social problems, such as interpersonal and family problems and financial difficulties, and pre-existing mental illness.

So yeah, blaming GMO seeds for every suicide by a farmer since the mid-1990's is beyond misleading, it's unethical. 




 Actually, reddit only gets AMAs from people trying to promote specific things, getting scientists has not been as easy.  Convincing corporations to take this risk has been very challenging, I've been working on this one for **18** months. 




 Exactly.  Who would ever come talk to a group that just wants to yell at them? This is the basis of our civility requirement, in addition to it being the right thing to do. 




 It's not to make them happy, it's to follow our rules. If users don't like our rules, they don't have to post questions.  
 




 Could explain what that is? 




 I can deal with, by removing the comment, and if needed banning the user. 

This our house, we make the rules, and the rules are "be polite." 




 The question if phrased correctly is fine, but that's the point, it needs to be phrased in a civil manner, minus the accusations. 




 That's actually an example of a question that would be removed as uncivil because it is an accusation not a question, if you don't know how to ask the question with basic decorum, them you aren't qualified to be asking the question. 




 For those of you who aren't aware, tomorrow's Science AMA is with Dr. Fred Perlak of Monsanto, a legit research scientist here to talk about the science and practices of Monsanto.

First, thanks for your contributions to make /r/science one of the largest, if not the largest, science forums on the internet, we are constantly amazed at the quality of comments and submissions.

We know this is an issue that stirs up a lot of emotion in people which is why we wanted to bring it to you, it's important, and we want important issues to be discussed openly and in a civil manner.

Some background:  

**I approached Monsanto about doing an AMA**, Monsanto is not involved in manipulation of reddit comments to my knowledge, and I had substantial discussions about the conditions we would require and what we could offer.

We require that our AMA guests be scientists working in the area, and not PR, business or marketing people. We want a discussion with people who do the science.

We offer the guarantee of civil conversation.  Internet comments are notoriously bad; anonymous users often feel empowered to be vicious and hyperbolic.  We do not want to avoid hard questions, but one can disagree without being disagreeable.  Those who cannot ask their questions in a civil manner (like that which would be appropriate in a college course) will find their comments removed, and if warranted, their accounts banned.  /r/science is a serious subreddit, and this is a culturally important discussion to have, if you can't do this, it's best that you not post a comment or question at all.

Normally we restrict questions to just the science, since our scientists don't make business or legal decisions, it's simply not fair to hold them accountable to the acts of others.

However, to his credit, Dr. Perlak has agreed to answer questions about both the science and business practices of Monsanto because of his desire to directly address these issues.  Regardless of how we personally feel about Monsanto, we should applaud his willingness to come forward and engage with the reddit user base.

The AMA will be posted tomorrow morning, with answers beginning at 1 pm ET to allow the user base a chance to post their questions and vote of the questions of other users.  

We look forward to a fascinating AMA, please share the link with other in your social circles, but when you do please mention our rules regarding civil behavior.

Thanks again, and see you tomorrow.

Nate

 Sometimes people misread things or something of that type as well.

 I just spent the cash to rebuild the transmission in my E61, it was expensive ($3700) but I looked around and there wasn't another wagon that was comparable for close to the cost.  The Audi Avants are still around, but rare, especially used.  




 Perhaps!

 If both users have relevant flair, then presumably the answer isn't clear, which happens in science all of the time, that's why we run experiments! 




 I am a mod for science and AskScience, and we are aware of this issue.

This is one of the reasons we have flaired users, you can judge how relevant their expertise is, or if they have any at all.  The general user doesn't have the background to judge the quality of the references or the argument, so they aren't using that.  Flair gives them something else factual to go by.

Further, if on of our flaired users tells us as comment is inaccurate, we delete the entire comment thread.  It doesn't matter how many votes the comment has.  We can't be experts in everything, but at this point we have experts available covering almost everything.

 I'm pretty sure I'm the only one who organizes AMAs on /r/science :-)

This also puts me is a strange position of being the only one who speaks to the scientific community about reddit and social media. 




 I understand they release quite a few as well, but I don't know, I'm just asking. 




 The Cayman Islands have two industries:  international banking and turtle farming.  The banking part clearly doesn't factor in here, but how important are the efforts of the turtle breeding program there?  Is this a drop in the bucket or a huge aspect?

If any one is interested in the turtle farm, [here is their website](http://www.turtle.ky/)

 When I was a much younger chemist, I briefly considered research in to antimalarial drugs on a non-profit basis.  It didn't work out for other reasons, but I still wonder on occasion if the model of writing grants for supporting a non-profit organization geared towards new treatments of diseases that primarily affect the world's poor is viable. 

I know that the pharma companies haven't ignored new antibiotics, it's just a really hard area (I think it was Eli Lilly that dropped several hundred million dollars into an effort and came up empty handed.)

 Would the funding structure be aimed at existing for-profit and academic institutions or is there a way that overhead costs could be covered by this funding?

 Most of the time you can do that, some times the walls were put up after the tub was put in, and that's not an option!

Also, tubs are heavy, bits of a tub lesser so. 




 I thought the way you removed an old iron tub was to smack it with a sledge hammer to shatter it.

 Awesome, thanks so much Deimorz!  We appreciate your work. 




 Just keep adding Atlas 5's, problem solved! 




 Any idea how long it took to slow Cassini down enough to be captured? 




 We put things in the orbit of Mars, so that's possible.  

Jupiter is so massive that they probably have to make sure to avoid probes getting dragged into it's orbit.  

I believe there is a probe hanging around Saturn.

Uranus and Neptune were fly-bys?  (I'm asking, I can't recall.) 

I wonder how far off from possible an orbital probe out there is.  

I suspect the real reason is money, there just isn't much that having something in orbit of Pluto would accomplish vs a fly-by and the cost is probably a lot higher. 




 Is it even reasonable to put something in to orbit around Pluto, or is it just to small to get a probe out there in a reasonable time, and stop it?

 The concern that started the whole thing is with a surfactant called SLS, sodium lauryl sulfate, which is in a lot of things.  It's a strong surfactant, and some people are sensitive to it, although most people don't notice.   It will "dry out" your skin, which in this instance is a touch misleading becuase it's not removing water, it's removing the stearic acid (which is similar to wax) from your skin.  Without the oily layer in your skin, moisture escapes, and your skin gets flaky. 

In order for SLS to do this, it has to get into your skin, the micelle formed by SLS is quite smaller, and it can slip into the pores, for some people this is worse than others.

Another surfactant, SLES, sodium laureth sulfate, is similar in structure, but it has a few ethylene oxide units between the carbon chain and the sulfate group.  It turns out this is hugely important to the irritation profile.  Those groups make the micelle of the SLES much bigger, and they don't enter the skin nearly as much, hence they are far less irritating.  Now, SLES doesn't foam as well, adn people like foam, even though it has nothing to do with cleaning.  So to increase foam in SLES shampoos, some companies add SLS or Cocoamidylpropyl betaine, which is a foaming agent (it's glorified coconut oil, all of these things are.)

As it turns out, the SLES and betaine conbine to make the shampoo even less irritating, depending on the "sulfate-free" shampoo, it may be significantly less irritating that the sulfate-free (this is the case if the shampoo uses an alpha-olefin sulfonate surfactant.)

So there is not problem with SLES, but it's a "sulfate" so now people think it's terrible...even though they don't know why. It's fine, unless you're a statistically trivial group that has unusual sensitivity, then you should not care.

 I was wondering that, I suspect there is a reason they can't, Deimorz is pretty sharp, I would be surprised if he didn't think of that.

Also:  Can we expect to see you around a bit more? We saw you were added as a mod to /r/defaultmods... 




 It's the suppression of freedom that adds the zest! 




 Things have improved because /u/Deimorz and /u/krispykrackers are now tasked with listening to us and making things happen. Deimorz is explaining to moderators what is technically possible, and what is not.  He's going to work on making things happen, and I personally believe him.  (krispykrackers too.) Deimorz wrote Automoderator, he gets it.

Both are the most trusted admins left, and  if either of them get sacked for no reason, reddit will burn to the ground. 




 I think I may mention to Kn0thing that removing Deimorz would be a really bad idea...I think that might be taken seriously now! 




 That must have been done when subreddits were rolled out, right?

/u/spez has some 'splaining to do! 




 Please disclose where you work, your role there, the projects you have worked on, and a summary of your personal investments to continue this conversation. 




 Dude, shampoo is fascinating stuff when you get into the details.  Just look at the ingredients, I can tell you what each one does, how much they added (approximately) and how they added it, largely off the top of my head.  

Shampoo is also so much better than it was in the 70's, but ignore all the sulfate-free stuff, it's just marketing trying to sell you something.

Also, laundry detergent way more interesting than you are guessing, it's not just soap and water, there are about 50 different stains that are tested for and small changes can have huge effects on cleaning.  

 




  But your company was paid to conduct a study 

No, my company wasn't paid to do the study.  I'm an industrial chemist, I'm basically an on-staff expert, marketing wanted to look at it.  That's how business is done, sometimes things don't pan out.

Also, I no longer work for that company, and that company doesn't need protection anyway, it was Dow Chemical.

Now, I hope everyone of you will kindly disclose where you work, what you have worked on, and for good measure, a summary of your investments.  We all want to know what hypothetical conflicts of interest (as defined by people who have no idea what makes a conflict of interest) people have.  Just so we're on a level playing field.

If you're not willing to do this, I suggest we drop the matter.
 




 You clearly have no idea what a conflict of interest is. 




 He edited his comment, he said I profited **directly* from climate change, this isn't true, I have never received direct payment for anything climate change related.  




 Funny, because that's not what the GMO-Truthers say, fact is you don't know anything about my political beliefs, so please don't make definitive statements. 




 It's still ridiculous, you may one day in the future work on climate change related something, who knows!  Does the truck driver who delivers things to a plant that makes amines for carbon capture "work on climate change"  or does he just drive a damn truck?

I just did an assessment of the technological needs of the industry to determine if there was a market there, the conclusion was that there wasn't.  I actually worked on additives for diesel fuel twice as long, does this make me a shill for the petroleum lobby?  That's what so silly about the statement, editing it is kind of bullshit, because it was plain wrong, he should just admit that he was mistaken and move on. 




 Give us a "Promote to top post for 30 minutes" button so that we can give a special post visibility.  Not all content is the same, and the default frontpage structure makes defaults really dependent on the top post, if we have an mod message to the subreddit or a special event it would be nice for us to have  away for a large initial number of subscribers to see it, as it is now, we just have to pray it doesn't get buried for whatever reason. 

This would also let us counter downvote brigades you sit on the new list to kill posts. 




 Split out moderator permissions more specifically, this will help us run our big team of comment mods more effectively.

Specifically, I want Posts broken up into comments and submissions, and approve and remove.

We would like to give out permissions that allow simply for the removal of comments and nothing else.

 




 I post all of the AMAs by hand every damn morning because of this issue, it's pretty big to my quality of life I'd say!

For two days a week, Tuesday and Wednesday, we have dedicated accounts, and they will have enough karma that it isn't a problem, it's really the accounts we set up for people who are doing one-off AMAs that the issue pops up.

Could you make it that approved submitters don't get a captcha? 




 I was hired to work on something completely different, this was just something they tossed on me, that's how industry works, I don't generally choose what I work on, I'm ok with that. 




 We've kicked a similar idea around, but we can't get readers to read the sidebar, this would be lost on people.  AMA now means it's a q a, it's a generic term now. 




 Sure, I'm a researcher in industry, that's what we do.  You could make the same case (a better one actually), about laundry detergent.

So picking this out from the list of 100 things I've worked on over the years is misleading to the point of being a lie. 




 None of that, it was  a project to look at existing products for use in post-combustion carbon capture.  It was a "can we sell more of our stuff in this" thing.

I'm an R D scientist, it was the company's direction to look at it, and I do my job. 




 Your claims are stretched far beyond what any reasonable person would call "profiting" the projects I worked on were assessments of uses of our products, and we lost money by doing the work since it didn't go anywhere.  It was one of 5 projects I worked on at the time, I'm a scientist, it's what we do.

Maybe consider making logical arguments based on facts instead of libel and character assassination? 




 Not really true either, since it was an application of one of our products, I was paid for being an R D scientist and I did an assessment of the area, your argument is bullshit, give it up. 




 Yup, I don't expect there are any barriers to getting them to do AMAs! 




 [I posted a response to his claim, which is wrong.](https://www.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics/comments/3bzhq2/rscience_shuts_down_after_reddit_fires_an_ama_mod/csv1vq2)
 




 This isn't remotely true, I've worked in home and personal care for the past 4 years, making additives for shampoos and laundry detergents.  I have worked on carbon-capture projects in the past, but they didn't go anywhere (which should shock exactly no one, right?) 




 I edited the text to include NGOs, I'm biased by being a chemist, and there aren't many NGOs that operate in chemistry, my apologizes!  I don't think we will have any issues with NGOs, so I haven't called it out as an area of emphasis. 




 It's small, but there are a several very experienced people there. 




 Yes, they are relevant, although, tanning it mostly a local event found in the skin, the hormone pathway is more related to base skin tones. 




 You can post this question in /r/skincarescience for more details, but tingling has nothing to do with the tanning process, and their mechanism is laughable because blood flow doesn't have anything to do with tanning, it's caused by a [specific biological process, called Melanogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte#Melanogenesis)

They are talking pseudoscience gibberish, it's typical of the marketing drivel.

 we can do this, good suggestion. 




 They do, and every one knows this, we have to get past it. 




 we have talked about alternative plans, it would take a long time to get back to where we are. 




 reddit was actually bigger than Digg at that point. 




 I am talking to them, and they are listening, I can't comment on follow through, but we have to give them a chance.  I do trust the people doing the work. 




 Because we can't do any of these things any where else, if reddit dies, so do all these plans. 




 We at least have the names of the people handling the AMA address.  Change takes time, I see no reason to pile on, our point has been made. 




 I am at a conference dinner at the moment, Alexis has been humble and receptive in our conversations.  I behave like a dick some times too, I can't hold that against him.

We want reddit to work, changes can't happen over night, we have to be reasonable. 




 Not hardly.  There was stern talking, but in the opposite direction from what you are speculating. 




 AMAs are more required to be scientists, less a peer-reviewed journal summary thing. 




 We will not be, we discussed it, and we do not see added value that would be worth the disruption to our readers.  We believe the admins are listening now, and we are willing to be patient. 




 We would like to talk about what our values are, what we are currently doing, and where we are going in the years to come, and why we support reddit.


**Our Core Values**

Our overarching goal is to bring science education to the public. We have set up outreach programs that help to get more people involved in science and to bring science to a level that can be understood and appreciated by people from every educational background.

To this end, we have invested enormous amounts of time working with scientists, working with science advocates, talking with public policy groups and so on; all with the intent of setting up a platform where people can come, discuss and learn about science. We are trying to break down the 'ivory towers' of science, so that those that are practicing science aren't living outside of the public. While this is no easy task, we are fortunate to be enabled by reddit as a platform. We are not here, spending this much time day-in and day-out just because we love science or because we care about reddit alone, but more because it is an incredibly powerful tool that we have that allows us to really make a difference. How often can you say that you are able to just go in and ask a question of Monsanto scientists? Or read about the newest, hottest research and see people from every walk of life discussing it, and explaining its scientific intricacies and real-world applications? Nowhere else on the internet offers that, and it's something we worked very hard to achieve - hence why we care so much and why we strongly support reddit.

*We believe in the scientific method.* As such, we support the peer-review process which provides the most basic test of validity through testing of ideas and speaking through data. We are not the arbiter of science, simply a venue for the presentation of peer-reviewed research.

*We believe in authenticity.* In this day of information availability, the truth always comes out, its best to speak honestly about what you know and make your case from that.

*We believe in civil discussion.*  The issues brought up by scientific findings arent always what people would like them to be, and controversial topics abound.  We believe that civil conversation is the best way to understand others point of view. One can disagree without being disagreeable, in the end we all agree far more than we disagree, and it isnt always a win-lose situation.

**How We Promote Outreach**

  *Links* 

We allow our users to post links to summaries of peer-reviewed scientific journal article from the last 6 months. Science journalists are professional communicators of scientific information, and they are able to put the research findings into context for the reader who would otherwise struggle to follow the jargon and other technical language found in the primary literature. Our users are then able to engage in conversations about the research findings in the comment section, asking questions and answering them so that we can all better understand the significance of the research (or insignificance as the case may be.)

*Science Discussions* 

Active posters in /r/science who have formal training or conduct research in some scientific disciplines have the opportunity to confirm their expertise with the forum moderators. We 'flair' these users so that you can identify (a) their academic degree and (b) their self-proclaimed research discipline and expertise. In exchange for acknowledging these users, we expect them to contribute constructively to the community.  We allow our flaired users to post their own summaries of a particular subject they believe to be worthy of discussion.  The flaired user/scientist can then directly interact with other users and answer questions they may have in order to put research into better context.  This is useful if a particular field of science is generating important findings, but they are not easily encapsulated by one particular publication.  This also allows for the non-scientist users to actually engage with a scientist working in that field, something they might never get the chance to do in their normal life.

*Ask Me Anything* 

AMAs are well known on reddit, but in /r/science we seek to bring scientists from many different fields who perhaps have no exposure to reddit. This gives our scientist users a chance to ask complicated technical questions of people who are making news in their field, and for non-scientist users to ask questions they have always wondered about, as well as reading about how scientists approach a problem and what science actually is (the continual testing of ideas.)


**Where We Are Going**

*Industrial Scientist AMAs*

Professional scientists typically work in three sectors:  Academia, Government, Non-profit organizations and Industry.  

We have had the good fortune to have access to many people from academia, non-profits and government labs, but the public discourse with industrial scientists has been virtually non-existent.  Many in society discount the views of industrial scientist because of the bias caused by having a financial stake in the research, and many in industry are concerned about public disclosures for legal reasons, be that the threat of being sued or being fired for saying the wrong thing.  Evidence can be presented for both of these sides, and that is why we find ourselves where we are now:  *a huge portion of the scientists in our society being closed out of conversations.*

We would like to change this, and bring more industrial AMAs, however it will take bravery and understanding on the part of everyone, but we think that the benefit of having an open discussion about the science of the products and services we interact with the most in life is worth it.  

You saw this beginning with our hosting of an [AMA with Fred Perlak from Monsanto]( https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3b6mr4/science_ama_series_im_fred_perlak_a_long_time/), who came answer your questions in as forthright manner as possible.  We know that a large number of people mistrust a Monsanto employee, and assign nefarious motivations to him.  We were pleased to read a civil discussion between concerned people, which did not concentrate on the bombastic extremes that are so often found in these interactions.

In the coming months we hope to bring you more scientists from companies that make the things you use, so that you, our readers, can better understand what it is they do and how they do science; we hope that people will reserve their judgment and listen.  Likewise, we hope that businesses will realize that cutting off communication with the public has not been good for our culture, and a different way forward is not to be feared due to hypothetical legal concerns.


*Current and Future Employment*

Many of our readers are students, and a big concern for students in science is finding their place in the world. For employers, having new graduates with the skills that are needed is critical. Properly identifying the current and future needs for skills in the sciences and related fields (like engineering and math) is important for everyone.  Having skilled people who cant find a job doesnt help anyone.  We will seek to bring AMAs and other related content to our readers, that way they can help figure out exactly what they should do.  Sometimes it helps to just ask someone!  While some students have the opportunity to ask people around them, and the large majority dont. (I know I didnt!)  We would like to do something about this.


**/r/science Supports reddit**

I mention all of these things because we can't do any of it without the platform that reddit provides.  This is a unique place that has allowed us to connect people interested in science, scientists and even random people who just show up. Without the reddit platform, it would not be possible to fulfill our goals of scientific outreach and we would not be able to communicate science to the broader internet community effectively. 

We welcome your civil input on this, and we are listening to you.
 




 Could I ask you to give the mods updates on a reasonable basis? 

While there may be a trust issue with others, I think all of us trust you. 




 We have a nature preserve right behind our house in Northern Illinois, we hear the coyotes every night, and I'm sure there is a lot back there.  What are the best ways to learn what's going on without causing disruption to the wildlife? I'm thinking web cams?  How do we place a camera where we can catch the action?  Maybe leave tacos out for the wild life? 




 There is no Santa Claus. 




 oh fun, this is why conference presentations aren't allowed, you can push whatever nonsense you'd like!

 Interesting! 

*Sets flair to "Epidemiologist"* 




 Does this mean you're an epidemiologist, or something slightly different? 




 I'm the mod in the green text, I've made a longer comment here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Blackout2015/comments/3c4x6h/leaked_conversation_from_kn0thing_and_the/csskpbs

But the short version is things seemed to have changed at least in the short term. 




 Too many hypotheticals, I work in concrete reality as much as possible, and the fact of the matter, as people are realizing, is there isn't a real alternative to reddit currently, making it a moot point.  

For me reddit is a means to an end, I'm  not doing this for personal glory, I'm motivated by science outreach, and dispelling myths about science.  

Every time I read something about antivaxxers or other clearly false things, it motivates me to do something about it, this is my doing something. 


As such, I need a wide audience of non-scientists to have a chance to read the content I arrange for, which means having non-science content intermixed, which is reddit.

See the issue?  
 




 Hey, I'm the mod in green here, I did the screen capture,of course, and shared it with some groups to explain the situation better.

This was the exchange that pretty much precipitated /r/science going private, as you can read, it's not about Victoria being fired, although we completely disagree with that action.

The issue here is one of communication and respect.  We don't treat our users like this when they message /r/science with questions, even when they start off by calling us traitors, or any of a lovely grab bag of insults.

When went public to break the stonewalling we were getting because we needed to finish setting up an important AMA and we had one day before the holiday to do so, time was critical.  We as mods really need to have prompt communication with the admins when we have issues, generally speaking we work independently and can handle almost everything, if it's gone past that, it's important.

As for the Science AMAs, I have always run them basically independently of the admins, I worked with Victoria to handle follow requests from our guests who wanted analytics on how many people viewed this AMA (totally reasonable requests.)  We don't have access to that information (I would love to have it!)

Given the frustration of the mods contacting the admins with questions, and our miserable success rate (it's not just science mods), I can't ethically refer our guests to an anonymous email address that I don't have any reason to believe will respond, and I don't have the bandwidth to put the requests in myself, so it puts me in a really bad position going forward, and that upset me.

As many of you noticed, /r/science was brought back public before any of the other defaults, this was because we had accomplished our goal of forcing a change in the communication behavior of the admins.  This being our only goal, we did not see a benefit to further disrupting the lives of our readers, a vast majority of whom do not care about reddit politics.

I take the admins at their word that they will be making an attempt to change (kn0thing seems to have come around as well), we have put a lot of work into making reddit a great source of science information, we want it to succeed.  


As for the Hawking AMA, I found the contact information independently, and arranged for the AMA to go forward.  It will be posted on Tuesday morning, we are quite excited.

Thanks,

Nate 




 Feel free to add me as a mod for biochemistry, I can tend it as part of the /r/science world

 We didn't take one then either. 




 This will be resolved by the morning, we are finishing up conversations. 




 As a mod of /r/science, and arguably one of the instigators of all of this, I'm ok with AskScience staying up, it's the tradition of AskScience not to get involved in the politics of reddit. 




 Yeah, this is just the last straw, honestly.  It's a series of broken promises and ignored requests that has lead up to this. 




 Good point, edited for clarity. 




 I'm willing to be patient, but it's gong to be really hard to keep AMAs  going in /r/science, I do most of the AMA set up by myself (sometimes while holding a sleeping baby) and I don't have the wiggle room to absorb this. I've been working to transition to a team but it just hasn't happened, because reddit... 




 I've spoken to her on the phone several times, in addition to working with her for quite sometime, I concour, if anything shady happened it would be totally out of character. 




 I have, but she's professional, so I don't have any more information. 




 I fully support this decision to shut down /r/IAmA, letting Victoria go is a slap.

To back this up, I am the mod in /r/science that organizes all of the science AMAs, and I am going to have meaningful problems in the /r/Science AMAs, Victoria was the only line of communication with the admins.  If someone wants to get analytics for an AMA the answer will be "Sorry, I can't help."  

Dropping this on all of us in the AMA sphere feels like an enormous slap to those of us who put in massive amounts of time to bring quality content to reddit. 

I personally feel like shutting /r/science down as well, that's how much of a bad taste this leaves.

 That is when /r/science started adding comment mods. 




 Your data is already out of date, /r/science now has ~~856~~ 857 mods.  :-D  

/r/science has more mods than the rest of the defaults combined (excluding AskScience). (Considering their are 50 defaults, that's quite the number.)

A vast majority are comment mods, but that's also a vast majority of the work, we don't need 800 people answering modmail! 




 In January 2014, /r/science started adding comment mods which should massively skew the data given the large percentage of the eventual total. 




 We are Legion.

 Good to hear!   




 It's a pretty interesting AMA about starting your own chemistry startup.

Post your questions here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3e26al/american_chemical_society_ama_we_are_amy/ 




 This is a great AMA in AskHistorians, a great subreddit, we mods wanted to give our readers a chance to see it and ask questions. 









 One of the inhibitors I feel when thinking of starting a business of my own is my age (I'm 40), I feel like the ramp up of a business would take too long to pay off relative to my rather good paying job.  How long has it taken you to get your businesses self-sufficient?  (I believe they call this "crossing the valley of death.")

 yup! 




 We should be able to respond to users without our usernames being visible.  We can send messages from the subreddit, but we can't respond to modmail this way. If you're explaining the official stance of the subreddit to a hostile user I don't see why your username is important. (The number of users who argue that the rules should not apply to them is too damn high!) It's just a way for users better target individual mods.  




 I agree, actually, the admins need to actually do something, most of the time there is just no response.  having a fully open mod log would allow bad actors to laser focus on the person who just enforced a rule.  This already happens way too much.  If you respond to a mod mail to explain why something was removed, even though you didn't do the removal, you can end up being comment stalked, and doxxed. 

I think there is a disconnect because users don't see the incredibly hostile messages the mods of big subreddits constantly get.  We have constant reminders of how terrible people can be.

 Wicking is a balance between gravity (the density of the fluid) and the surface adhesion of for the wick.  Trees are essentially ground water wicks that bring water to their leaves. Since water has a high affinity for cellulose, trees can grow quite tall!  But that's not your question.

If we are looking for an unwickable liquid, we would want high weight, and strong cohesive forces.  Off the top of my head, mercury fits this.  Mercury will spread out on certain metal surfaces, like aluminum, but it is actually dissolving the metal in the process, which would make for a poor wick!  It doesn't spread on normally found materials like wood, or plastic or glass.

Another possibility would be fluorocarbons, since they tend to repel both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces.

 How do you suggest dealing with the very real problem of mod stalking/death threats?  




 And when the admins are overwhelmed and they don't do, what happens then?  Because that will be the first couple of hours.  You can't rely on the admins for even the simplest of things history has shown, this is just a fact now. 




 I agree, and adding the line "in video games" would be unlikely to reduce the popularity of the post, while being more accurate and not misleading the reader about the scope of the study.  Too many readers don't look at the article at all, they just take the headline as a fact. 




 See the comments, it was reported as such by another mod.

 I think we really do need to be header on the psychology publications, they evoke way too much drama given the supporting information. 




 We believe it should have included a subject area, instead of generalizing to the whole populace.  The headline of the linked article is the sensationalized bit.
 




 Yeah, it's not your fault, we're just trying to figure out where the line is on these headlines.  




 Well, this was the point of the new rules, I should have been quicker at removing it.

 It was a trivial critique of the methodology, one that is maybe meaningful to the inexperienced (hence the votes) but noise to people who do this for a living.

 It's the little tags next to the post headlines or occasionally a username. 




 We have too many people removing things for that to be feasible, which is why we need the rules to be as specific as possible. 




 Would not be removed automatically because it isn't "invented by a" 




 Sorry, left out a word, that's what I get for typing on a phone while a 3 year old attacks me! 




 My subreddit is /r/science, we have a couple of custom bots in addition to automod, and our custom moderation set up.  We just have one of the most strictly moderated subreddit, in addition to one of the largest. 




 We can, and we'll watch things.  

We're not completely clamping down on headlines, just taking a harder line on things. 




 We would like the traffic from our subreddit to encourage quality science journalism, not sensational headline engineering. 




 There are plenty of other words, we're just picking out one that has been abused in the past.  Right now it's just "invented by a"  that specific phrase. 




 of course. 




 It's an interesting idea, but it would be hard for users without a great deal of educational background to do.   




 Poor communication.  We ask the admins if this is a ban evader, because we can't tell, and then we don't get a response.

 In practice, this is not true.  Different mods remove different comments and ban different accounts. In a subreddit that makes little attempt to moderate comments it might be possible, but we had  close to 40,000 mod actions in the last month. 




 Peer-reviewed journal article appear in print and therefore don't have video associated with them, so the odds of missing something is low. 




 Mod of /r/science here, and actually, that was on our list of complaints.  We get a response from the admins maybe 1/5 messages.  
 




 How do we tell if they have evaded the ban or if they are just another shit head user?   




 That is how we use it, if it is just a little off, we tag, if it misrepresents, it's removed.   




 Report any comments that say that, and we'll remove them.  Our mod team is reasonably effective, it may be less common than you are recalling (confirmation bias and all that.) 

We could set up "correlation" to trigger and auto-report to the mods. 




 We will try to do this, we don't tag things as misleading that often. 




 oh, we'll look at some examples and see, it might be on the blocks... 




 Sad to say, we don't get many computer science articles.   




 The flair would show 'Misleading, see comm...]  the character limit is annoying.  




 The issues of a default are well known, and /r/science is the oldest default. 




 Must be early on-set mental degeneration.  I'll probably be wearing adult diapers in six months. 




 Ugly work around, but welcome to the world of being a mod on reddit, where you don't get even simple tools. 




 I'm not concerned about karma personally, I have never sought it (as you can tell by my relatively low karma for a 7 yr old account.) If we had a mod abusing sticky comments for that purpose we would remove them as mods. 




 That would be fine, just don't call it out as a video in the title. 




 Pessimist! 




 We have been asking for the ability to make sticky comments for literally years, this is part of the blackout motivations. 




 In this case, yes.  Scientific publications don't say "invented by" so it's pretty easy to make that rule. 




 You didn't even try to read the post, did you? 




 We'd rather them reach the front page for the right reasons- meaningful research - rather than a sensationalized headline. 




 Videos are not allowed because of experience, while there might be some good ones, a vast majority are just fluff.  It was allowed for years, but it just became a problem.   




 I can't imagine a post with an equation in the title that isn't a bit off. 




 um...yeah. :-) 




 True, but "by a" might be too broad for an auto-remove. 




 Things are far from perfect, we are still trying to figure out a good way to address things, if you have ideas, please let us know! 




 We can't make flair a link, unfortunately, it's a limitation of reddit.  Good idea though!

We can try to make a post though, that should be doable, but the issue there is we have no way of making that post visible, it would likely be buried. 




 It's easy to accidentally say something that an expert in the field finds misleading. 




 We discussed it with user groups for a while, and now we're open to suggestions to improve our policies.  




 Maybe we should add "invented by a" to the removal phrases, I doubt I've ever seen that in a non-sensationalized title. 




 Sure, or just send an email to sciencereddit@gmail.com 




 Thanks, it's back out. 




 This is a on-going issue, a big part of the problem is people who aren't experts in an area would make misleading headlines and never know it.  Not an easy thing to police. 




 We'll make an exception, simple.  I doubt we'll have to make many of those.

 Hi everyone,

A constant complaint we've had is the sensationalism of headlines, we've discussed the issue, and we're going to start enforcing some new rules for headlines.
 In addition to the [existing rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/rules#wiki_submission_rules), we're adding these.

**Headlines may not:**

  - **ask a question** (anything with a '?') Linked articles which have a question in the title should be re-written to describe the content of the paper in keeping with our existing rules against editorializing and sensationalizing.

  - **make claims of resolving a long standing issue/cure/mystery.**

  -  **use an exclamation point.**

  - **makes general statements about large groups** (e.g. "men don't trust women", "Doctors hate him") The headline should indicate the group that the finding applies to.

  - **have a list mentioned.** (e.g. top 10 things you must read)

  - **makes reference to the thoughts or feelings of the reader.**  (e.g. "You'll never expect this")

  - **contain the word "[Video]" or related terms** (since we don't allow videos, linking to a page that contains a video is not allowed.)


**All Submission must have flair assigned**

The mods have been assigning appropriate flair to unflaired submissions, but we are no longer going to do this.  Unflaired submissions will be removed.  There will be 5 minutes of time to flair a post, after which it will be subject to removal, with notification.

If you have additional thoughts on how to make more specific headline rules or add rules, we'd like to hear them.  We will be testing things out and we may make changes as needed. 

Thanks!
