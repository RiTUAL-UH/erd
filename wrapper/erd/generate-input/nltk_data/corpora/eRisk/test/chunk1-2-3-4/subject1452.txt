 
Outside of the US, people will celebrate a similar event at 05:06:07 on September 8th.  




 Apparently a single old Saxon ox can plow more than a team of oxen in 1592.
A furlong was considered to be the length of a furrow (a long, narrow, shallow trench made in the ground by a plow) a team of oxen could plow in one day. 
An acrewhich gets its name from an Old English word meaning open fieldwas originally the amount of land that a single farmer with a single ox could plow in one day.
An acreone furlong in length and one chain wide.
 




 Because it has a high molecular weight, I doubt that the enzyme catecholase would be able to get across the skin to the bruise. There might be another mechanism of action.

 In hospital patients small volumes (1-10 mL) of deuterated water are routinely used to estimate the total body water content. 




 I agree that fish farming makes sense but emphasise that it is a controversial topic. 

Farmed salmon are dyed orange. Otherwise, theyd be an unappetizing grey. Dyes harvested from microorganisms (canthaxanthin   astaxanthin) and added to the food can account for up to one-third of total feed costs.

[Spider goats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioSteel) were engineered to produce spider silk in their milk. After 12 years research and development the company went bankrupt in 2005.

 Some types of food are weird:
i) egg is an unfertilized chicken embryo
ii) milk is a white liquid produced from the mammary gland of a cow
iii) fruit is plant fetus
iv) yogurt is a fungal infection in milk
etc.

 




 Using phosphorescence as a fingerprint for the Hope and other blue diamonds.

Abstract

Sixty-seven natural blue diamonds, including the two largest such gemstones known (the Hope and the Blue Heart), were probed by ultraviolet radiation, and their luminescence was analyzed using a novel spectrometer system. Prior to this study, the fiery red phosphorescence of the Hope Diamond was regarded as quite rare compared to greenish-blue phosphorescence. However, our results demonstrated that **virtually all blue diamonds phosphoresce** at 660 nm (orange-red) but that this emission often is obscured by a concomitant luminescence at 500 nm (green-blue). Although both bands were nearly always present, the relative intensities of these emissions and their decay kinetics varied dramatically. Consequently, phosphorescence analysis provides a method to discriminate among individual blue diamonds. Treated and synthetic blue diamonds showed behavior distinct from natural stones. Temperature-dependent phosphorescence revealed that the 660 nm emission has an activation energy of 0.4 eV, close to the 0.37 eV acceptor energy for boron, suggesting that the phosphorescence is caused by donor-acceptor pair recombination. 





























 It helps to prolong a conversation if you prompt people to talk further about their own interests. 




 It is interesting that she is buried in an unmarked grave but is commemorated by many memorials around NYC.  
























 Please note that bacteria digest plastics. It takes time and the degradation time varies with different polymers. 




 In another thread it was suggested that a second satellite would have also 
heard the ping in the middle part of the arc. 




 I don't know of any events but they finished as if the sequence was professionally organised. 
























 Thanks for the video. I assumed that they were metal tubes and I never suspected that the buoys are so sophisticated inside. 




 Do you have any idea of the scale? How far apart are the different ping locations? 




 Location is northern part of defined search area. Signal was held for 2 hours 20 minutes. Houston said that the previously detected signals (by Chinese ship) were 555 km away. 
























 DEET shows up in blood samples for drug analysis. It is readily absorbed through skin because of low molecular weight   logP 2. 




 So back to searching along the ping arcs? 




 In Australia we don't call them Australian cattle dogs and use the name blue heeler. We have a second cattle dog breed called Kelpie which has a similar shape to a dingo. 
























 We can't get meaningful data because the orifice is blocked.

 Makes me wonder what effect the freon   kerosene spill had on the ecosystem. I guess it was diluted to insignificance. 









 What does it feel like to be old? Which parts of the body ache, fail and change? How do you best take care of them to limit their deterioration? 




 Move to Australia. They come and eat bananas from our hands, lick cuddle and sleep. We throw them outside if they bark. 




 I gave up smell and fragrant foods like curries remained delicious. Wine tastes good but definitely lacks a component. 




 Marinate meat before you go. 
If hiking eat the perishables (steak and eggs) early and long term hikers sharing your campsite on will hate you.
