 Hahahaha - there was talk of using Montgomery Clift or Farley Granger...

We just thought the "named after Alan Ladd" element was too good to pass up!  




 Thank you :) 


































 Actual film composition is all conjecture at this moment as we know absolutely nothing about:

a.) shared screen time.

b.) Lex's power suit (armani or armor)

I'm just talking looking at them side by side in the abstract.  Eisenberg is known for playing an introverted nerd type and Cavill is ripped - even if not to comic standards (much like the airbrushed standards women face).  

I'm just saying, in terms of spirit - they are quite opposite.   




 I kind of like this casting.  They can go a lot routes with this character - specifically in the contrasting looks between Superman and Lex.  Just physically, when you look at them, you know where their strengths lie. 

They can play off Lex's need to be adored - and maybe that jealousy of Superman plays into his working out and bulking up.  

I would suggest reading these to get a better look at their complex relationship:

 I think the Joker looks down on anyone who loves him.  














 Hey guys, 

I have to agree with apathy and uber in that I really enjoyed it, and found it moving on a number of levels.  

I have a different take about how it's an allegory on my site here:

 Human or cat years? 














 Is there anything he can't do? 
























 Thank you Mongo and Nadelus for your contributions and insights.
I think people are judging Robocop 2014 too harshly on it being a remake for two reasons:  nostalgia and the "ickiness" of the term "remake". 

In fact - I think we agree in that this Robocop stays true to the "soul" of the original in that it takes a great premise of Frankenstein/Man/Machine and also injects commentary of America.  Verhoeven with glorious hyperbole and Padilha with political conscience (both of them satire).  Verhoeven presents an America of 80's excess.  Padilha includes one that is 00's "dark and gritty".  

I think Verhoeven's works better because of less studio interference - but we don't live in a MUST LOVE/MUST HATE all caps paradigm. 







































 On what basis? :)

Nostalgia - or as its own film? 




 It was all originally digitally drawn, but painted with photoshop.  We did manipulate the Astaire image for multiple versions of him though.  







































 That is a very silly comic.  

I might get down voted here, but I'm with you in that I'm not as crazy about the Iron man films either.  

Have you seen the new Robocop?   




 The "hey I loved the movie is (like I stated) nostalgic, and also very subjective - which is completely valid. Movies by their very nature speak to different people in different ways.  

But I would still reiterate that movies are not black and white.  We love movies because they are so multi-dimensional. 

I would go back to my article (and give me more traffic ;) ) by emphasizing that it is the soul of the film that matters most. 

With your reasoning (Murphy's death and Lewis gender/race), nothing short of the Paul Verhoeven film would suffice - and I'm not sure if I'm crossing any lines here, but I think that a highly faithful adaptation would just come off as imitation Verhoeven/Robocop.  Which would ring extremely false and very disingenuous.  That's why I wouldn't defend say... the Total Recall remake or the Red Dawn remake.  

This film tries something new.  The vital parts of the film that you refer to is that he dies - how he dies is interpreted by the directors in different ways.  The vital thing about the partner is that there is a tether to his earlier humanity - not race or gender.  Those are just superficial.

The film also seems to have a Fellini-esque quality, where the marketing team is imagining how to "design the product" for a larger audience.  Maybe Padhila is commenting on the bullshit marketing that they think WE like.  I would even caution to guess that maybe their would be a certain segment of the audience that wants a Robocopo more like the original EM-208.  ;)

All I'm saying is, if you give the film a chance, you might notice that it's actually trying to be about something.   




 Completely inventive use of squibs.
