 Thanks for the answer. One of my goals is to bring the price down for more casual players too, and make it easy to transport.  




 I certainly will, it will be worth 40% of my grade for that course. Apparently, we would be outsourcing the designs to producers, so if I could be able to make several boards, I would love to give you one for free! But I just started designing it, so don't expect it any time soon. 




 Wow, thanks so much for the detailed post!

2) I will post pictures of the designs and specifically tag you to hear your advice.

3) Aluminium just seemed an interesting material to use for white pieces, but I will certainly think of all materials available for me.

4) I hope I will not make them finicky.

5) Yes, I will certainly make them weighted.

6) I will try to add magnets, but will not make it a priority.

7) I didn't think of that, but I will still strive to do it, but I think its not a necessary.

Thanks so much to the post. Another question, how much are you willing to pay for a chess board? 




 Yep. I was thinking of also a way to make the puzzle pieces to click on the other side of the board to keep it together. 




 Thanks so much! That certainly looks nice! I will try to use the puzzle design, as well as making the board look like the "perfect one". 




 Four pawns on one tile? Isn't that a bit too much? Looking at chess boards I own, it seems to much. Is there any reason for your advice? 




 Thanks :) 




 Will do! One more thing, what is the price range you are willing to pay the most for a chess board? Thanks so much mate!
Do you mind if I will be using some of your answers in my project? Just quotations. User tag could be optional. I dont think examiners will care to much.
 




 That is exactly what I was thinking. But it would still be visible, making it less appealing. Trying to think of a way to make it better. 




 That is what I am striving to do! 




 Wow! Looks incredible! I wish everyone in this subreddit could have one. I could answer this question myself, but im interested in what your thoughts are: what makes this board so amazing? 




 Will certainly try! 




 Thanks! Since I am just a beginner, sadly I dont think I will be able to pursue pieces that look beautiful like the first two links. I will try to make wild designs, and will try to make sure they are not terrible. As for all the other links you posted, I will try to do all the suggestions you posted! 




 Wow! Interesting design. Is it practical when playing? 




 Silly me, I thought I read weightLESS pieces. I was also puzzled by the idea of having light pieces. But this makes sense. I am sure your idea is much more favorable. 
However, I was curious about what you think the design of the pieces would be. Is there any style you prefer? For example, do you prefer medieval looking pieces, or maybe more modern? 




 1) What the hell did I just see! Do people actually play on that!?

2) Its true, those colourful boards are plainly a pain. However, why do you want Stauton peices? I was thinking of making newer, more elegant and simple designs (but certainly not abstract pieces where you could not tell the difference between a rook and a bishop).

3) Thanks so much for the advice! You are the real mvp! I can use any material really, and wood certainly is the easiest option, but I really wanted to experiment with "new" materials, such as aluminium? I was not thinking of glass as I imagine it could be easily broken when travelling (saphirre or gorilla glass may be too expensive).

4) Will do! In your opinion, do you think I should?

5) Sounds interesting and aesthetic, but how would that help?

Thank you so much for the detailed post! I didn't expect such a great answer!  




 I agree, those small magnetic boards are impossible to play with! That is why one of my main goals is to make a chess board that would take the least space possible while not used, but explained/unfolded to be easily playable.
Why would you want the pieces to be wooden? What do you think of other materials? 
And finally, what do you mean by mountable from 4 pieces? 
Thank you for the post, and good luck in games! 




 Can you please explain why you would want to see that? Do you want the pieces to be hollow or made out a light material? What materials would you prefer? Thanks for the answer :) 




 PS. Sorry for the strange title, my retard friend submitted the post before I finished writing it. 




 Hey r/chess!
For a school project, I decided to design and produce a chess board (for those who know, Design   Technology course in the International Baccalaureate). I really love chess, and therefore I really want to do a chess board that will be amazing. Do you have any suggestions? Has there every been some aspects you wished you could improve? What materials do you prefer? Designs?
Feel free to tell me if there is anything you would want!


 




 Is it really that bad? I can imagine every country over states what it did (been in both UK and Russian systems, which does point to that). I wish education about WW2 could be less biased towards the home country. I also wonder how the German lessons are about WW2. 




 I fully agree, and what the US did was certainly amazing and important. However, it seems to me that you are stating that what the USSR (and to a certain extent the UK) did was insignificant compared to what the US did. 




 Why? Just interested. 




 Hey r/euro!
I hope this subreddit is alive, I hope this post will kickstart a discussion!
What do you think about the ECB interest rate? Do you think it will change, why, why not? Will it be affected by the QE?
Feel free to share your thoughts! 




 Thats a lot of support to the US, but what about the USSR (and to a certain extent the UK)? 
























 What do the value investors here think about this? I see it too high, but there are some valid arguments. What do you think? 









 Due to the popularity of my post in another subreddit (which I feel is very useful to anyone who invests), I felt like I should share it with r/investing:
http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/2wvd06/the_intelligent_investor_handbook/ 




 Top two in this subreddit! :D 




 It did not, but neither do I. I just tried to find some sort of proxy indicators that try to measure (quantify) the advice Mr. Graham gives.  




 Your welcome!  




 Thanks for the help! Was actually using that, but now I am certain in what I'm doing. Thanks! 




 Great post deserves more than my upvote! 




 Thanks so much for all the comments. I felt like I wanted to add several things. 

1) The sections are not necessarily the most important.
2) The formulaes are there for those who know them, but can be easily researched.

But most importantly:

3) This is meant to be edited and improved by this great community, so that the I.I. handbook becomes even better. If you feel something is wrong, post an edited/improved version. 




 Explain what ORI does as a business please, apart from a one liner from wikipedia. How is it organised, what are its departments, products, services. By doing so, it will help any ORI investors by being more clear. 




 Hey r/investing! 
I was just very curious if you could answer this question. I'm sure many others will be interested. How do you measure/understand a company's "competitive moat"? Would really wish to know.
Thanks in advance! 




 Time will tell ;) 




 Where do you get your stock market news?
Just read news. In the business sections (also economy/finance/etc.) you will see companies performing good/bad. What news should you read? NYT, Economist,WSJ (for high quality), Business Insider, CNN Money (for more casual).
Do you come up with your investing ideas, or do you find inspiration or advice from some place?
Completely depends on different people. 




 Thanks! 
Sure is a moronic question :D 




 Your welcome! :)
I would be very interested! 




 Hey r/investing! :)
A quick one. When are annual reports published in the US? What about europe/asia? Thank you in advance :) 




 Hey there investors.
During my reading of the book (2003 edit), I highlighted some of the main points I felt that were important for me. I then wrote this handbook, which is effectively a list of these quotations ordered to make a bit more sense. I then added my own notes to add/clarify the notes. 

First of all I just felt like sharing it so that it could help any of you. However, I would also love it if you could add upon it (maybe I omissed some importnat things?). Thank you in advance, and hope this helps you! :)

https://docs.google.com/document/d/106U79BVHzzeCiO5SjWD1eCz4Lp6nm3VJ0rYThUk1Shg/edit?usp=sharing

PS. If you didn't read the book, I strongly suggest you do.

Thanks for the upvotes! First time in my life I'm on top of a subreddit. Im very glad its on this one, I really think its the best subreddit out there! 




 Money weekly YouTube channel. You cannot hate it. 




 ESTJ terran.
But what does the "variant" mean? How many are there? Tried looking, couldn't find (I got assertive).
Same thing to what is a sentinel? (Explorer etc) 




 Countries that have defeated an aggressor in war have the right to claim parts of its land, an unwritten rule in war. Germany tried, and failed, to expand its land. The surrounding nations had the right to take their land. Besides, Nazi Germany deserved the punishment it got, and present day Germany, without all this land, is far better off than at any other period. 




 Best country in the africa! 




 Being Russian, I can tell you: Russians drive similar to many other countries (which are similar). Its just Russians have the cameras (they have more footage).

 Thanks, an excellent explanation. For some reason I'm more familiar with the last terms than the first ones :p You're amazing thanks! 




 No one mentioned the intelligent investor? 




 From house of cards, "the anti-nuclear argument is purely emotional, with no rationale or logic supporting it".
I'm paraphrasing. 




 Vive la France! :D 




 Should be similar as to like total war (where different rates of taxation earn you money, but stifle food, science, happiness).
But similarly, economics in civ has always been non-existant. So much more could be added. 




 Could someone please explain what that means? The language is a bit too complicated for a mere mortal like me..  :'( 




 LifeLad 




 Amazing answer, but could you please explain the first paragraph (standard deviation part). Learning it in my math lessons and would love to understand how it links to this situation.  




 "There is risk that our increasingly communist government will confiscate everything in sight. " LOL

 




 Can you explain in more detail please? 




 Holy f*ck what an amazing answer. I only understood like 30% of what you said, but wow, thanks so much! I will dive into all the things you talked about to try and formulate some sort of educates respons, but can you start by telling me what is kurtosis? That ks so much! 




 SL. Thought of going up, but was too late. Get 90%+ in all tests. 




 Hey r/investing!
I have to write a mathematics essay (Math Internal Assessment for the IB), and at the moment I am trying to formulate a question. Since the stock market is very interesting, I was curious, what mathematics is used to "predict" share price movements. Any relatively complex maths is enough, even if it is completely wrong (I assume many mathematics formulaes, etc. in predicting the stock market are wrong). Any help would be helpful! Thanks so much! 




 Just shows the new lows Russia has reached. Being a Russian, it hurts :'( 




 I don't know about most, but nuking is certainly up there :D 




 even to (any country) in "x years" the (country) would look alien in "x years +400). Go an read more about the actual religion and culture the (country) and people dressed and what they did for fun and compare that to (country) during the days of (any leader in year year x). It is a continuation but it changed more that enough to be called a different.

I suggest France as a good country. But can apply to pretty much any country. Not trying to argue here, just pointing out that this argument you put forward can be applied to almost any country. 




 I thought I was going to have an amazing well argued response that will change my view for the better and open up a new world in investing for me. Pity all I got is you seeing HR... :D 




 Please don't down vote, imagine its moronic Monday. Why is this statement bad? Sure, the NIKKEI and others have remained stagnant for long times, but most have increased. Over a life time (I'm 17), isn't that good advice? Sorry for any stupidity, CMV. 




 Thank you so much :)

 I agree, but I still wish the roman empire could have been larger. 




 From a post I just saw on here: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Somalia_map_states_regions_districts.png 




 It was not failed. After Trajan's death, emperor Hadrian was more concerned in preserving the empire, not expanding it. He decided that Mesopotamia could not be kept, and so voluntarily retreated. Whether the Roman Empire could have held on to that land is mere speculation. 




 The most direct benchmarks are the individual indices. The German Dax 30, French CAC 40, British FTSE 100, Italian FTSE MIB 40, the Spanish IBEX 35. These five economies consist of over half of the EU GDP so can be a good gauge, four of them (excluding the FTSE 100) are in the euro zone. However, due to the German and french economic clout in the euro area, the DAX and CAC 40 could suffice.

There is the Stoxx 50: the fifty largest Eurozone companies; which is maybe something you are looking for. However, it is similar to the Dow Jones Inudstrial Average 30, as there are very few companies.

The S P Europe 350, or the FTSE Europe 300 could also be indices that you are interested. But to be honest, these are not that good. For example, they include Swiss companies, which are neither in the EU nor euro zone.

Overall, of course, its up to you. Make your own judgement. I believe it is best to use the individual indices as the Europe is by no means united enough (hopefully soon) to have a single index. Compare the European economies and you will understand what I mean. But if you insist, try using the Stoxx 50.

Hope this helped, good luck! 




 Regret not being protoss. Wish I didn't have to do much and just macro to get death ball. Zerg actually seems hard, much respect.

 I wish the new unit would be an upgrade built in tech lab needing armory. This upgrade would revamp the reaper, so that it becomes useful again in the late game. This would reduce the need of new hotkey, be a barracks unit, and make the reaper useful later in the game.
What the upgrade should do to it, how much it will cost, etc. is not up to a plat player to decide. 




 TIL clouds move 




 Instead of a new unit, why cant we have an upgrade to the reaper. This upgrade would require some later game building (armory?) and would completely transform the reaper into some better unit. This would keep the same amount of hotkeys, and make reapers useful later on in the game. Im no pro, so I dont want to propose how the reaper should change, but Im sure this would be better than simply adding a new unit. 




 Got upvotes, no comments :( 
You're all a bunch of backstabbers! :'( 




 Hey r/nootropics! Any recommended source of nootropics for France (western Europe too I guess)? Is there anything else I should do? Thank you in advance! 




 The grass is so green :O beautiful 









 I heard about NQ group. Where can I find them? 




 It was truly nothing. Just teasing. I was worried of getting banned because it happened to me and others many times, and deliberately did not go far. 




 Quality post :D 




 Dear multiplayer game host,

Why do you ban people?

You were playing as Maya on pangea, and were winning by a wide margin. I was Austria, slowly being surrounded by your cities. I convince everyone to unite against you as you declare war on me, and I fight tooth and nail. I forward expand towards you to defend myself, and I obviously troll you to rustle your jimmies. 
Why did you ban me and everyone else from the game dear host?
What is the point? Why do you even play on multiplayer then? You were far from losing, why dont you accept the challenge? Why do you, dear host, always ban the person who challenges you? Why do you do that? And why do you call me 'noob' right before banning me? If im so bad, why ban me?

So many questions, but the only answer I see is "You have been kicked". Please love me back...

Sincerely,
Everyone else in the game.

PS. In all seriousness, why do hosts even play multiplayer if all they do is ban the first threat they see? Why isnt there some voting where a majority needs to vote for banning a player? 

PSS. Oh and host, please buy BNW, G K is sh*t (no trade roads!?). 




 My favorite: carriers don't need sailing. 




 Why did bbyong all in!? I was so surprised!
He was ahead (economy and army).
Please explain to a mere mortal. (platinum league) 




 What about Egypt :D 




 I completely agree with you, and hoped you were ESTJ :( 




 Estj? 




 I will limit any exposure. This is more of a side investment. However, may you please explain to me why you would want to avoid the sector? 




 Hey r/investing!
So I am interested in the solar energy market for many reasons which you can easily find throughout the internet. I am interested in picking individual stocks (no hate please), but I have no knowledge of any solar company (apart from vague knowledge due to Elon Musk investing in SolarCity).
Therefore, I looked at two solar ETF's, found 6 of their largest holdings each, and wanted to find the biggest companies. This is because, in a emerging industry, I would like only the largest companies. 
Here they are, ranked by their weighting in the ETF's: 
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XfbhRl9XYBIgPxbqtpNMo802W5MQ76BPgSZVtj13D-E/edit?usp=sharing

I know many of you here are interested in solar, so I am sure this would help you guys. My question is, why is Hanergy so over valued? Is solar city so overvalued because of Mr. Musk? I would love some brief explanations of why some companies are so overvalued compared to others. 

Thanks so much! And I hope this little chart is helpful! 




 What do you investors think about solar? What about its companies? What about the subsidies (notably from China)? 
























 Hey, thanks for the answer! I guess with hindsight I should have added that I know what you are saying, and I am proud that people like you exist. My post could be used as a good proxy to see how many investors here are ACTUALLY investors like Graham explained in II.

My analysis reports that I do for the companies I research are around/above 2000 words, and the formula is just a footnote in my analysis. My analysis is completely based on the analysis put forward in II, and I would want to reassure you I do not depend on this formula; usually, by the time I reach it, I already have a constructive opinion of the value of the company anyways. 

However, I would be very interested indeed on building this formula properly, and would love it if you could help me.

Thanks again for the answer and link though, maybe even more helpful than what I expected. Have a good day! :) 




 Hey r/investing!
This is a simple question from a simple person. In the formula (for those unaware:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Graham_formula), one of the key elements is the "growth rate". 
My question is, what exactly is this growth rate of? Revenue? Earnings? Something else?

My second question links to the first one. Where does one find / How does one predict the growth rate in the next 7 to 10 years?

Thank you very much for the help!  




 From my recent trip to Hong Kong. 









 If I did mistakes, please tell me so :p 




 For those that are not aware of the video game Civilization 5: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_V

For more details on each ideology: http://civilization.wikia.com/wiki/Ideology_%28Civ5%29

Freedom is similar to democracy
Autocratic is similar dictatorship/Fascism 









 I completely agree. I just seem to think the same thing in half the posts and here you are writing it. If it makes you fell any better, people did this in the 1920s too, only the technology got faster. That's why I humbly believe personal finances ought to be a subject taught in high schools with proper exams. But maybe I'm wrong. 




 I wonder what you think when you write this. 




 What do YOU, ladies and gentlemen, think about GE right now?

 Thanks. I did do some mistakes however :( 




 I agree with you. I think the word "empire" is very broad, just like "country". Is a colonial empire, like the British, the same as a 'grand' empire like the Roman, Persian, Ottoman or Mughal empires? Certainly not. But I also believe there is a third type of empire, lets call them 'tsunami empires' (because 1) sounds cool and 2) I think its a good analogy). 

In my humble opinion, I believe the 'tsunami empires' ought to also be considered equals like the ones above. Napoleon, Alexander and Genghis Khan all created real empires that invaded enormous territories, with legacies resonating throughout history. 

I agree with your post, the French empire was extremely different from the Roman Empire (and others), but I believe it still was one, the same way Russia and the Vatican are both countries, even though arguably with slight differences.

Do all of these empires even hold one common similarity? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_empires#All_empires_at_their_greatest_extent

PS. Napoleon did win wars. Out of the 7 coalitions, France won the first 5. Each of them was a separate war, with interluding times of peace, and each of them not started by France. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars#cite_note-19

He also did hold on to the conquests. The empire itself was governed in a very efficient way, and unlike Ottoman Empire, where its regions broke away from it, Napoleons empire fell apart due to foreign invasion. Example: After the first coalition, France established puppet states "sister republics". In the second coalition (war), the allies attempted to take away France's conquests; conquests Napoleon successfully held - winning the war of the second coalition.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Second_Coalition
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_Republic

Hope I managed to counter-argue in an efficient and unbiased manner. However, being french, I might be biased :P 




 Thanks. First post 3 




 Drew this while playing ETW (turns are long)

First map: Pre-Napoleonic Europe
Second map: The rise of the French empire till its zenith in 1812. Each colour corresponds for the coalition wars.
Third map: Europe at the France's zenith. 

Feel free to comment, criticize and complain, I would want to know any feedback.

PS. Imagine how easy it would be to "name every country in europe" in 1812 :p 









 Over powered. Invade Mughal too easily. No real enemies after that. 




 I believe u/Elos's response has been very well written as well as thought through. The blame of the war is on all nations, and arguing for the blame of a specific country can be easily done as all of them were guilty of many things, which I assume you know.

However, as Elos and (I assume) everyone else agrees, the guilt is not spread evenly. When analysing the start of the war, the "gunpowder" and the "spark" are two different multitudes of factors, and analysing only one or the other is a disservice to the actual events.

The "spark" can be clearly blamed on the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which Elos elaborately explained. But the blame is also on Russia, with its incompetent Tsar and government. Germany too is to blame for supporting A-H's aggressive foreign policy. But the narrative 'assassination = war' is simply put: wrong, as Elos again explained. To add to that, it took over a month between the assassination and the start of the war. The Archduke was a moderate, and was deeply unpopular in the A-H elite. It was, again as Elos said, the ultimatum that commenced the war.

The blame for the "powder" can be blamed on even more nations, throughout history 
(I mean, one can blame the Louis XIV for being a douche, which resulted in the kings being douches, which resulted in the French revolution, which resulted in Europe attacking France which resulted in Napoleon invading Europe, which resulted in the unity of Germany, which resulted in Austria being weak, which resulted in them becoming allies, which resuted in WW1, which resulted in WW2, which resulted in the Cold War, which resulted in the space race, which...)
but generally speaking, Germany has contributed to the most "powder". Not as much as the treaty of Versailles imposed, but did contribute the most. 




 An example. The IS attempted mass conversion, and according to some, genocide of the Yezidi people (the brown area between Iraq and Syria). Presently, the vast majority of the Yezidi have fled to nearby Turkey, Kurds, or other areas of Iraq/Syria. This may be interesting to you: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinjar_massacre.

This is just an example, and as u/Tollaneer and others would explain, the IS is attempting 'religious cleansing'. 




 The US had a larger population. But the size of the economy is not all. There's a time lag for economic power to translate into cultural, political, military, technological power.

Assume China's economy becomes larger than that of the US (it is in PPP). It will take decades for the US to lose its military, political, etc. dominant position.

Even though the US was larger, technological innovations still happened in the EU3. Germany had still the largest army, France arguably best medicine, UK most political clout, etc.

Hope this helped. 




 For those who don't know, Paris, Lyon, French Guyana and Martinique didn't participate because they merged the department and region, and therefore will participate only in the region.

Marseilles, even though larger than Lyon, is not when only Marseilles proper is considered, which is why it is not with Paris and Lyon in the "big league of cities". Greater Marseilles is spread out across departmental borders.

 Hey r/civ!

Im sure this question could be interesting for many of you. By best I mean most historically accurate, large, fun to play with. Thanks in advance! 
























 Thanks :)  




 :'( 




 You are right, that is why I am not doing so. I fully agree that I am too inexperienced, and I do not plan to do so anytime soon. That is why I am asking here, to be able to find out how to find this information.  Nevertheless, thanks for your answer: short and to the point. 




 I don't expect venture capitalists. I'm talking about friends and family. The only reason I would want increased capital is to allow me more opportunities. Any other questions that may help you understand? 




 Could someone please explain why Indonesia's GDP is so cyclical (yearly)? Its GDP rises the first 3 quartets, before falling in the fourth. 

Is this because of commodity experts? However, its largest commodity, coal, is merely 10% and not cyclical. Palm oil, 7.3% of exports, is not either. 




 I guess I should have added a TLDR:

I invest. I want other people to give me money. Their capital will track my portfolio (eg. my value +10%, their money invested rises +10%). They become minority owners of my portfolio, owning 'shares' of my portfolio/vehicle. They can sell the 'shares' to me or other 'partners' and earn/lose the difference. They have voting rights to the investment decision using their 'shares'. They sign document agreeing to all of this AND that they understand they may lose all money.

Is this legal? Will I have problems? 




 Thanks for the fast response! Where would I be able to find the french laws? If that is asking too much, where did you find the US laws? 




 Hey r/Investing!
I hope this post matches the high quality that this amazing subreddit provides to all. If I fail to do so, please tell me so. I will keep it short.
I am a 17 year old and I invest (shares and bonds), living in France. My question is a more legal one. I am interested in selling 'shares' of my portfolio, which would allow my 'partners' in the 'investment vehicle' to see their investment grow and fall in par with my capital gains/losses. I don't plan to make this a big thing, but I am still curious whether this is legal or not, and whether this entails me to any risks if I fail (I plan on providing a document on this). 




 That is awesome! Would you mind showing me your website, kickstarter, or plan? Honestly, I would like to help you if I can, specifically in accounting (not that there is much point for it, but I would want to build balance sheets, PnLs and cash flow forecasts). 




 Thanks for the response! That is something I used to do in Poland (which got me in trouble but yolo ca$h money bling bling). Now that I live in Paris, and are in high school, we can leave the campus and all stores are available to us. :(

If you have other ideas, please tell me! 




 So how does this apply to 'les Pays Bas'?  




 http://hope4grantcounty.org/wp-content/themes/hope4grantcounty/images/there-is-hope.svg

Would you be nice enough to tell me a bit about the atmosphere in Spain right now? Where are you from, what job do you work in, what do people think about the parties? Economy? Euro/EU? I would love to hear a inside perspective that isn't from the news. If you do not want to, by all means don't. I'm just very curious! 




 I would love doing that, but its impossible living in the middle of Paris. I was thinking maybe bringing newspapers or even breakfast (croissant, etc.) to neighbors (and later grow) every morning. What do you think? 




  Excluding school, etc. I am not able to pay taxes, which puts me in a difficult position (by declaring taxes myself my family will lose a lot of its 'pro-natalist' benefits). Secondly, I did not localize a problem that I could solve living in Paris, which would allow me to open a business. Costs here are very high too, which would mean that I would need a large price to cover them. But please, if you have any ideas or guidance, I would love to here it. What do YOU do? Tell me your story! 




 I am investing through my father's account as I learn and ease myself into the world of investing, which limits my risk of losing too much money. Therefore, I do not have the privilege of exploring my broker's capabilities (however, this will certainly something I will now try to ahcieve). Nevertheless, could you please tell me a bit more about investing in bonds. Thanks  




 1) Governments of major economies, nothing too hard
2) From what I understood, purchasing bonds in the primary market requires high capital (thousands of euros), which I do not own being only 17. If I am wrong (as I often am), please enlighten me.

Thanks for the answer by the way, I appreciate it greatly. 




 Just don't vote for Podemos and you should be fine in the long term :) Hang on tight! 




 +1 for "depending on what part of France you're in, some have more grass then others"

Thanks for the guidance, being so young I guess it is what I need most. I have trouble finding resources to work out the myriad of taxes and regulations imposed here, and I am not sure what to do. If only there were entrepreneur subreddits for each country (or at least an EU wide one)...

I would love if I could help you with accounting. I would love to help create and evaluate balance sheets, PnLs, cashflow forecasts, if you're (or anyone else) is interested. 




 Makes sense. I may be wrong, but maybe having 50%+ as one colour would allow you the possibility. 




 Are you investing through your fathers account or on your own? 




 Too young, only 17. Living in France does not help either :( 




 Im sorry if I may be wrong, but isn't the Netherlands, Les Pays Bas, plural, and therefore neither? 




 The green area, "0-9%" should be further subdivided. The natural rate of unemployment is commonly around 4-5%. 9% unemployment is not good by any means, so why is it in the same range with 3% unemployment?

PS. I agree with you. 




 Hey r/investing!

Im having trouble understanding how to buy bonds (I am only interested in government ones) in secondary markets. I understand what face value, coupon, yield, etc. mean and how they are calculated and what they represent; but I fail to understand how to buy them and how the secondary bond market system works.

I would be very grateful if anyone helps :) Besides, bonds are the other side of the coin in investment, and yet, bond investment is so underrepresented here. I am sure an answer here would help at least a couple of you out there.

Thanks for the help, and wish you all the best for your portfolios! :) 
























 Precisely.  




 Thanks for the explanation. That's why I believe this is the best subreddit. However, could you please explain what one ought to look for in a cash flow? 




 If I lose 60% now, wouldn't that mean that all the future capital I will have would be at least 40% less than what I potentially could have. Or am I over-exaggerating? 




 Quite what I am worried about. But from a smaller base, I am worried of the % loss I will have as it will continue to grow further.  




 Thanks for the answer! Quick question:

Can I get in trouble for things that 'those individuals' have agreed to. If they agree 'I understand I may lose all my money', and then I they try to sue me for losing their money, will I get in trouble? 




 Thanks for the great answer. Exactly what I was looking for. I have two questions:

1) In how much trouble will I get into if I don't do anything (assuming that this remains a small thing and I don't have anyone go and sue me).

2) Can I get in trouble for things that the other parties have agreed to. If they agree 'I understand I may lose all my money', and then I they try to sue me for losing their money, will I get in trouble?

3) What are the chances I even get caught if this remains a small side thing with no 'lose all the money'? 

PS. I consider myself a value investor (risk averse, long term), not a trader (speculation, high risk, potential for huge mistakes). 




 Family would as my father would want to see me earn my own money. Friends would because they have nothing better to spend it on, and many actually do have faith in me (whether they should or not is not for me to decide). I must stress again that this is not a massive mutual fund that I am starting, just a small side thing. 




 "living in France". Updated. 




 Hey r/legaladvice

I hope I am clear enough. If I fail to do so, please tell me so. I will keep it short. 

I am a 17 year old and I invest (shares and bonds). I live in Paris, France. My question is a more legal one. I am interested in selling 'shares' of my portfolio, which would allow my 'partners' in the to see their investment grow and fall in par with my capital gains/losses. The people I want to join are simply friends and family who would be interested. I don't plan to make this a big thing, but I am still curious whether this is legal or not, and whether this entails me to any risks if I fail (I plan on providing a document on this). 
Simultaneously, I do not want to register anything if possible. My goal of doing this is to increase the amount of capital to widen my options so I can invest in more securities. I am not planning to do so until I feel more comfortable and knowledgeable investing.

TLDR;
I invest. I want other people to give me money. Their capital will track my portfolio (eg. my value +10%, their money invested rises +10%). They become minority owners of my portfolio, owning 'shares' of my portfolio/vehicle. They can sell the 'shares' to me or other 'partners' and earn/lose the difference. They have voting rights to the investment decision using their 'shares'. They sign document agreeing to all of this AND that they understand they may lose all the money.

ANSWER: After reading every single comment, many of them of very high quality, which I thank you for, I have been convinced that this is a bad idea for many reasons which merely appeared good to my young naive self. I will continue to invest and will allow people to loan me out money, but not in the way described above. I will however consider this in a year or two when I (hopefully) will be in uni in (hopefully) London, hopefully (hopefully) in LSE, where I will be able to have more opportunities open. For detailed reasons of my decision, read this great thread for those interested. Thank you so much ladies and gentlemen! 




 That is certainly a possibility. However, doesn't the Shanghai Composite currently look like a classic stock market bubble? About the US, could you please explain why you think its over-valued? 




 Personally, I am 17 years old and am preparing to embark into investing with around 1000 euros in start-up capital.

I know that time is my friend and in the long term I should be fine, but I am just worried about the significantly reduced compound growth I will expect if I lose a signficiant part of my capital in the beginning of my investment carrier. For example, if I lose 25% early on, all my future earnings will be significantly lower than what I could have had (around 25% less). I put emphasis on this because I am just going to start investing now.

If my reasoning/logic is wrong, please tell me more. I do not believe I am right, it is just what seems to me.

PS. And thanks for responding so quickly. 




 Hey there,

Being a 17 year old beginner, my analysis of firms is based on the 'teachings' from the II, which I have built upon (hopefully improved)*. I now assess firms on many different quantitative and qualitative metrics, but still based on the II. 

However, I feel like there is a gaping hole in my assessment as I make no reference or use of cash flow. Throughout the II, cash flow is barely mentioned (and mostly in comments by Mr. Zweig). 

However, I believe it is important. I am currently researching about its use to answer my question, but I would love it if you could please tell me how and why it is necessary to analyse it, and how one ought to do so. 

*To view it (this is just the template, it goes into much further detail. Furthermore, I have worked on it, so it may be outdated): http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/2wvd06/the_intelligent_investor_handbook/ 




 Hey r/investment!
I am sure many of you here have an opinion on this question, so why not make a thread where we discuss this. 

Is the market* overvalued compared to underlying metrics? If time in the market is more important than timing the market, does it still make sense to invest at these all time highs? Should one wait for a correction?

It would be nice if you could state you answer with some explanation (or links to explanation). 

I believe this is very important for many beginners to know, as well as a great way for seasoned investors to help out with.

PS. I am aware this is the million dollar question and it is foolish to ask it, and even more foolish to expect a concrete answer to it, so keep in mind the point of this post is just to hear out some opinions of what people think, not make forecasts or predictions. 

*By market I refer to stock markets generally. I guess more specifically it would be the US and European markets. 




 The Independent: independent.co.UK. Am I missing something? 




 Whether the data and facts show that the ttip is good or bad, this article is so extremely disappointingly biased, it makes me wonder how the independent is considered useful. 




 This is probably what you might call "Mapporn": http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-uk-election/
Toggle with 'show proportional map view' 




 Oh sorry, these are specifically BAD examples. OP explained that he was writing a paper why the veto is bad. 




 China's veto not letting Taiwan be a country.
US veto not letting Palestine be a country.
Russia's veto ...

The wikipedia page about the UNSC is quite good, especially the # of vetos per country diagram. I assume your're in uni, so I am sure you can do a better job than me (im only 17). Good luck 




 In my humble (and often wrong) opinion, I believe the veto is not meant to be beneficial, but is meant to allow the great powers* to have checks and balances, so that no one power is too powerful. And I believe that by not allowing any nation too much power / making compromise and dialogue effective, leads to more benefits to the entire world in the long term. It also gives the incentive to large nations to want to remain in the UN (eg. USSR in the 1950s). Look at the league of nations to see what happens when one power/one side is too powerful. 

However, as you've mentioned, this has lead to numerous local mishaps at best, genocides at worst. Try looking at the bigger picture. Hope my answer helped, tell me if im wrong. 




 More than helps! Thanks so much!
I realised (sadly) that companies have gotten into debt to pay higher dividends/buybacks. My question is, what is a high payout ratio in these current times? Should standard be lowered due to the low interest rates (what would that be?), or should they be heightened to prepare for (a long awaited/potential/maybe not) rise in interest rates? What do you consider to be good, satisfactory, bad and terrible payout ratios?

Thanks again :) 




 Hey r/dividends!
I'm sorry if its a little vague. Please tell me so and I will elaborate. Thanks :) 




 Thanks for the insightful response  




 Is there a less shady way of describing 'investment vehicle'? :p 




 Thanks, will do. I thought being a mutual fund was limited by its size, but I guess I was wrong. I will look into it :) 




 Thanks for the great answer! 
























 Thank you everyone for the great responses! 




 Being french, it hurts me :'( 




 I somewhat understand this, but please tell me what 'capex' means :p 




 I am very disappointing by Arianespace. It existed for such a long time, but is partly government owned and depends on subsidies. SpaxeX started out solo, and has grown successful due to innovation and efficiency. Now Arianespace is begging for more subsidies. 

If europe's space industry is to grow large, it needs more competition, more businesses aiming for efficiency, and broad government subsidies, not targeted at specific companies. 




 Hey r/rocketlaunches,

This is my first post here as I just recently started to be interested in this. Im only 17 and did basic Physics (and Chemistry, both IGCSE Physics Higher Level for those familiar. Got 93% in science.), and now pursue other subjects.

So with my limited knowledge, could you please tell me where to start off when learning about the physics behind launching rockets, how rockets work, how SpaceX is making them more efficient price and mass wise, what are the main issues with launching rockets now, as well as travel to Mars (radiation and other problems to maintain a crew to the red planet).

Are there articles, videos, maybe even books, that I should start reading? Thank you very much, I look forward to learning anything and everything! :D 




 :'( 




 Thank you. I expect more mistakes to come.  




 Hey r/mapporn!
To commemorate the end of the war, here are maps that show the events unfolding. Please tell me any inaccuracies! I want to note I did this unrelated to Mapporn and throughout a rather long time period, so the quality is inferior to my expectations.

Key: I did not think of it as being crucial considering everyone knows about world war 2, but here it is:

Dark light blue: UK

Light light blue: occupied allied* territory and colonies

Red: USSR and allies

Dark red: USSR

Again, I want to apologise for the low quality, I did not mean to do them to post them here.Furthermore, please find any mistakes, I am sure there are many! I want to apologise in advance for the lack of Lake Lagoda, lack of consistency in the shades and again for the poor camera quality.

 Exactly. 




 But look at the long term graph. Even if it had a higher value, its rise is so extreme it will crash before growing higher. Is my reasoning flawed? 




 That's why I emphasised how my analysis is based on so much more. Sorry for not being clear enough. But thanks for telling me nonetheless. 




 That should be a quote! When was the last time you invested in something? 




 Detailed and logical answer. I am curious however, is looking at fundamentals of the economy a reliable way to analyse the stock market? The stock market reflects the confidence in an economy, and may (usually) has wide discrepancies with the quality of underlying firms, and an even wider discrepancy with the fundamentals of the economy. There is also irrational emotions of the masses to consider.

You certainly are more knowledgeable than me, I am just curious. 




 Great answer! Never thought of that. So what are you doing now? Are you just waiting for the dip? 




 Im the OP, and thanks for all the great answers. Still would love to continue reading this great debate. I personally had a small question: if I were to keep cash, should I just keep it or buy short term government bonds in countries that have no chance* to collapse?

*Yes yes, I know. You know what I mean. 




 Its okay guys, im in Paris XD 




 :D Criticism is always welcome. I'm already subscribed to both :) 




 Thanks 




 Thanks for the great answer. But I couldnt help but mention that France has the glorious euro. 




 Great response. Thank you. 




 Thank you for your response. 




 Thanks. Was always curious. 




 At least 40% :'( 
Being 17 and doing this small time, what are the chances of gettting caught and what consequences will occur if I don't pay it? 
























 Hey there everyone!

I was wondering, how should we approach small businesses, or maybe even larger ones, for research and information (example: for the EE)? Do you have any wisdom to share? Tips, advice? Share please :)
Thanks :) 




 Don't you wish this was more common? Anyone disagree? 




 Hey there my fellow dwellers of the IB,

I know some of you may also be interested, could we discuss how to formulate an ee economics question. What did you look for, what criteria did you have when thinking of a question?

Hope your IB is going not terribly, wish you an above average day in IB! 




 I'm just concerned on self improvement overall. Knowing more about myself is something I think would do so. Thank you for the response :) 




 Thanks for the response. Do you suggest either psychologist or counsellor? 




 Academically, I believe I am not getting the grades I can, and was wondering if meeting a psychologist or psychiatrist would help.

Socially I do have numerous sociopathic (lack of empathy, selfish, confused) tendencies, and was wondering if that too could be something. 














 Hey there
I am debating whether I should go to a psychologist to discuss (not sure how to describe) about how to improve myself. Deep down, I kind of believe it to be  useless. Could you  please explain why that may not be the case. 




 Hey r/IBO!
I cannot think of a topic that is within our syllabus (SL) and that makes any sense. Could you please help me find something. For example, the '4 colour theory' that many of you may know off, is interesting - but how exactly does one write a math IA about it? I do not understand. :(

 I'm interested in many different areas so hopefully this shouldn't be too hard.
Areas I am interested in:
Investing/stock market (anything really)
Economics - (more macro)
Rocket launches and rockets generally
History (ww1, ww2)
Military of armies
Nukes 
4 colour theory (Plan B) 




 Why would you ask this question? What are your reasons for or against? What made you believe you should ask this question? Please lay out your rationale. 




 Finally someone spoke out! :D

Please send me a link if there is one! 




 Why is there a noob question in ADVANCEDentrepreneur? 




 This sub-reddit has great content, but lacks comments! What do you guys think about Macau? I personally wonder, is comparing Macau to Vegas reasonable in long term projections? Or are they too different?  




 Than you. This is the kind of response im looking for. 




 No, I want a biography. I already read II and will start SA. 




 Because time is a scarcity ;)

I did, but wanted to ask here too 




 Hey r/investing!

This si a simple question: which book describes his life, his philosophies and his views best? 

Thank you :) 




 You are awesome  




 I stands for international, not your chavish british one :D

Hopefully will get to LSE and maybe even meet up one day 3 great answer m8 




 I know, and I read it. But I was curious what YOU think. You seem knowledgeable. 




 What website would be appropriate for in France/EU? 




 Are there ways outside of the internet?
 




 If someone could ElI5 PROBM and send me one link showing it, I should be fine learning everything related to it :) 




 Hey r/nootropics!

Im sorry if this post is not of high value, so I will keep it short.

I live in France

I have a limited debit card which does not allow me to purchase over the internet


How do I purchase nootropics if I were to want to? 
























 Hey there readers!

I just read a great book and would love to email the author some questions. Even if its ignored... Is this possible?

I would want to contact Ron Chernow, author of Titan.

Thank you in advance, I appreciate all the answers :) 




 Wish I had a business. Otherwise I would. Good luck :) 




 Wow that's a very interesting business model you've got there! 




 LOL a good friend of mine is the daughter of the founder :p 




 What is the best alternative then? (If no coder friends or acquaintances are available). 




 I may be wrong. Unlike water,  bandwidth has a very large and beneficial use to society, a merit good with a large positive externality - unlike water (I am aware we need water to survive). The benefits vary from providing education, training,  entertainment, political accountability (at least in democratic nations), healthcare, increases long-run aggregate supply, allows for more perfect knowledge etc. Examples abound. Therefore, bandwidth, internet and similar other goods and services (such as Wikipedia), ought to be provided for free as their benefits far outweigh the costs. 




 Sorry I meant, others had so much hate on you. Very interesting article too. So what would you suggest retail investors do? 




 I feel like your having so much hate for no reason. What would one, in your opinion, do then? Should this prevent one from investing in Google? Are there other companies you could name that you feel have similar issues? 




 All the money raised by start-ups / number of people in country. A proxy to see how easy it is to gain capital (and thus how easy to succeed) in a given European country. 




 It is very expensive, your right. But I really do not understand why the perif is such a large chasm. Living in Paris it just seems like a large road. I woudknt understand how the prices of real estate in one side could be markedly higher than on the other. 




 I'm Parisian too and didn't know that. I thought it was a clear east v west divide 




 Permanently keep the Olympics would have numerous benefits to all parties currently involved in the negotiations. But what would it provide to the IOC? I fear that dictators are more lucrative.

 Thought you could  




 How would you re-negotiate? 









 I may be ignorant/wrong but I believe in my humble opinion that finance/accounting/bookkeeping is the only real tangible thing one can learn to prepare for business - everything else being learnt through experience. I also believe it is the bedrock of all other departments (marketing, hr, production) and that by learning it first it would help in the long run (not that I didn't learn about marketing either). 




 Hey!
I am a pre-university (IB) student 17 years old) living in Paris. I would want to apply to UCL, LSE and/or Oxford and I would want to have some work experience. I already am doing a 3 week internship this summer, as well as read up on a lot of material. Just as John D. Rockefeller began almost two hundred years ago, finance and numbers is something that I appreciate and having some bookkeeper experience is something I will value greatly. I understand that I would only be of limited use, but I would love it if you could give me a chance.

Here are reasons why I may interest any of you:

I do not require any pay at all

I have free time

I consider myself very knowledgeable (albeit inexperienced) for my age*

I have a good grasp on Microsoft Excel, Access and other software

I have satisfactory grades: 
near perfect IGCSEs (including ICT HL, Business HL and maths HL)
40 in IB (according to latest report) (including Math SL and Economics HL)

I am willing and able to provide more information as well as evidence that I actually can/did these things.

I would want to participate in accounting, finance, etc. for any of your firms. PM me for further details if you wish so.
I hope I am not sounding too pretentious or arrogant, I am just excited at the prospect of working with entrepreneurs, craving to be one one day. 

PS. I will only work for an actual start-up and/or SME. It will have to be online as I am not able to move away from Paris.

*I have already began investing in the stock market after reading both the II and SA, as well as 'Titan: Rockefeller' and many other books; I have pursued small entrepreneurial ventures and have already worked in a couple of events organising several things. However, I overall lack the experience that you may require of me, and I am willing to compensate by working hard and learning fast, without pay.

 And they are running out of time 




 A very utopian and unrealistic idea, but what about: a nation where a majority of people are shareholders of companies that use robots. Incomes of most people would derive from capital gains and dividends, whilst a minority gain their income from managerial roles (CEOs, politicians, non-profits, military, etc). I've thought about it, but being 17, I would love to have this idea challenged. 




 Will soon be 29 states :p 




 I just hope European companies actually try to increase efficiency instead of relying too much on subsidies. I would want to see European spacex's instead of ariane's. 




 Thanks for the response :D
Why do you think fiscal policy would not work/be effective? 














 Hey r/economy! My first post. 
You all probably know a lot about this topic, so lets discuss! Mini-essays, links or discussions would be much more interesting than simple responses - but I wish this thread interests everyone.

Discuss! 




 Strange :D 




 Lad :D

How did he do? 




 Thank you for the answer :) is there anything I should tell them specifically? Its a tiny snack sandwhich shop, so I doubt they got annual reports :D 




 Thanks for the answer :) Any tips or advice on how to frame the question? I guess I would want help in the details.
