 "Sorry dad, my fucking dumbass friend changed the url when I got up to use the bathroom"

Come on OP 




 Hi!  I have several pets on side accounts that I want to show off on my main account userlookup, but I'd like a lookup that was possibly kind of designed with this in mind?  Anybody know of any? 




 If you feed a pet at movie central when it is bloated:

You will get the 'very bloated' status.  That should make it easier to get leftovers, or so I've heard. 




 Nice zap!  I'm working on zapping a poogle MSP on TWO accounts and it's not going so well  x_x  pray neoluck for me as well! 
























 I regret isolating myself from my peers, and not even taking any part in extracurriculars.  Most of the time, I literally went to school and went home to get on the internet, and stayed in my room.

Originally, I was very socially awkward due mostly because of my terrible home life, but was still very sociable.  Just annoying, though.  7th grade was a terrible year, it was my first year at the junior high, and I was quickly learning how cruel other kids could be.  I mean I was annoying, I deserved some of the hate I got, but there were some things that happened that were practically unwarranted.  It was around that time that I moved to my grandparent's house to get away from my homelife abuse, and it just came to me that I was tired of other people.  So very, very tired.  My self esteem was in the pits.  I was tired of being the subject of ridicule, of being a psychological punching bag of my peers and family.  And I knew it had to do with the fact that I was hopeless at social interaction.  

I don't know what happened, but it was like some part of my brain just... slowed to a stop when I realized just how shitty everything was.  Some part of me broke, I think.  I stopped interacting with my peers mostly.  I spent a lot of time studying.  I pretty much only spoke when I had something witty to say.  Soon... people started liking me.  My only friend year later told me that someone from one of my classes told her, "test_subject3112 used to be really weird, but she's cool now".  That's right, I was cool because I wasn't an annoying shit anymore and just shut up.  Because of my bad self esteem, this pretty much only reinforced my behavior.

While I did learn a great amount of patience from my actions, it is terribly regrettable.  I developed severe social anxiety because I have worried so much about making myself presentable to others.  I kept silent, I figured shutting up and being obedient and staying out of others way was the best and easiest way to coast through school.  Now it is difficult to be employed, to leave my house, to make friends.  I am anxious much of the time.  I quit my last job due to a panic attack.  Apathy has encroached on every aspect of my life.  My therapist actually told me my depression is worse than my anxiety.

At the time this all started, I could hardly cope with the stress.  I'm thinking it is probably a combination of school and home pressure that caused me to break and retreat within myself.  I greatly fear rejection.  People tell me not to care about what others think, but I have realized from so many years of being alone that people are a part of our lives whether we want them there or not. 




 *cringe* I checked on the pandora website and the minimum price is like 20-25 dollars per charm...  My grandma got me one of these bracelets with only four charms, so the minimum she would have had to pay would be at least over $100, right?  Now I feel like absolute shit because I literally never wear it.  ):  




 Perhaps some money in there as well in case of emergency?  It doesn't have to be much, but I've heard it's always good to have some money outside of your wallet stashed somewhere just in case. 




 Wait there's a neo group on facebook?  Can't you report that person to the group mod for scamming and get them removed?   
























 Huh, that's really weird O_o  just another mysterious glitchy thing about neopets I guess haha 




 263  :o

 Not all pets had an unconverted option, unfortunately.  You probably just happened to have those pets  ): 
























 we really need a skunk vandagyre already, I'm pretty sure it'd be colored like a panda.  Don't you dare let me down JS, I saw how you fucked up the gold kau 




  I don't know what I did wrong??

You offended his dickish sensibilities 




 lol one time someone made a post about getting the island mystic avatar, and I went and checked it myself because for a stupid second I was thinking it was like a limited time frame avatar and I could get it too.  

Well I remembered it wasn't, but I still got the avatar  xD 




 lol I'd do it haha 
























 I honestly don't know how to pick a name for what I'm feeling.  I'm certain I'm straight gray-a (I feel pretty much no sexual attraction, but I can feel romantically attracted), either that or my libido is just perfectly shot.  But I feel fine with the thought of never having sex-- or do I?  

This is going to sound perfectly ordinary, but I only get off to gay porn or fanfic.  The part that I ponder over is why I feel like I would be better off as a gay dude.  I'm not transexual-- at least I don't think I am.  Aren't they usually pretty sure about it?  I never minded being a girl.  

One thing of note is I find pregnancy personally abhorrent; the thought of *myself* being pregnant literally fills me with disgust.  I think it might be considered a phobia of sorts.  I don't think it is the cause of my asexuality, but it might be a contributor.  Even before all of that realization though, I never had an interest in dating while I was still in junior high/high school.  I couldn't understand why girls oogled at guys, I thought, 'sure that guy looks attractive, but why are you losing your shit over it?'  I literally gave no fucks.  It was only later after my second boyfriend, I realized I cannot feel sexual attraction (if I have, it was very temporary), and that I am probably asexual due to the fact that I just get disgusted with myself when it comes to the sex part.  I messed around with non penetration stuff, but ultimately it got to the point where it felt disgusting.  And I never actually felt connected when I was involved sexually with my boyfriend, despite how I felt toward him romantically.  Like, I removed myself mentally from the situation pretty much while it was happening.

Then I started thinking, and I just realized: you know, I'm pretty, but I've never really felt comfortable in my own skin, and not by an 'I'm ugly' standpoint, but mentally.  I just... don't feel like I belong in my body.  It's not overwhelming or persistent, I don't even feel like I would be strictly *male*, just... that I don't feel like either gender?  Male is the best fit maybe, but I don't mind being female.  It's just, there's this quiet and unnerving sort of feeling that something is wrong.  It's been there even since I was a little kid.  I don't mind being asexual and never having sex, but the part I do mind is likely being alone forever because of that.  

I dunno, am I weird?  Sorry for this unstructured rambling.  Feel free to ask questions if anything has confused you.  I wouldn't think any of you are weird ever, it's just that experiencing this for myself is so very confusing and stressful and sad at the worst of times...   




 Fuck, if the [notice board](http://www.neopets.com/noticeboard.phtml) was still in working order I'd tell you to spend a couple mil to put up a notice at the top.  IMO that would be the best way to get someone's attention at this point  xD  But that's incredibly unconventional and silly.  What else is there to do?  It'd be better than a ticket, since it's not on-site related and Rico S. just closes them anyway...

 ...You're really comparing things online to racism in real life?  You are an idiot. 
























 most likely gallery items

**Holy fucking nope, Batman.**  If I lost my gallery I would be inconsolable.  That is like the one thing I've put most of my efforts on.  What the fuck.

**EDIT:** HEY GUYS would it help if I checked the 'login birthday prompt' on my site preferences?  It gives a birthday prompt when someone is logging in from an unknown location. 




 There is none, it never actually got released.  So I can't dress it up in dress to impress lol 




 He was willing to wait for me to be ready for sex, but I ended the relationship because I did not want to give him that impression.  I knew I would never want to be intimate with him like that, so I broke it off to avoid pulling him along.  I say that like it was a simple thing, but it was terribly sad.  

Honestly, I'll not even consider dating another person unless they're asexual.  ):  It's just there aren't many asexual people out there, so the chances of me being alone are pretty high. 




 From what I have experienced, sexual attraction is different from romantic attraction.  Romantic attraction is the emotional response to a person.  I liked being around him and spending my time with him and being affectionate with him.  I did not know how to define sexual attraction at least, until someone described it as being hungry and having a plate of your favorite food sitting in front of you, and wanting to eat it.  Honestly, I've never wanted to ravage anybody, or have it done to me, gentle caress, or whatever.  Not even kissing.  It was always emotionally based for me.  I am capable of being romantically attracted to men, and I find them aesthetically pleasing-- but the romantic attraction is *always* at the forefront.  

I was not tipped off about the asexuality until I tried doing stuff with my second boyfriend and I felt disgusted with myself.  Even with my previous boyfriend before that, I felt a similar feeling, but just ended it before I could really think about it.  No matter how much I cared about him and trusted him, it was always disgust with myself when the matter came to sex.  Masturbation by myself is okay, and I have certain fantasies, but the thought of actually doing anything with any of them or of just normal sex sounds awful.  That probably makes so little sense haha.

I cannot fathom what it is like for a person to lose themselves in lust toward another willing person.  Kind of wish I did, it must be pretty exciting.  :P  But oh well 
























 The way he raises his pitch gradually throughout is hilarious 




 [Every time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymPpIzaanhY) 




 DAMMIT I ALWAYS MISS THAT BITCH 




 lol I think it's a joke because of what's happening today 
























 [Y-yay!](https://otomeohmy.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/tumblr_mcav3y9sao1qc7dbso1_500.gif)  I like friends~  Sure, I'll PM you  :3

 




 Yep, that sounds like exactly what I do, thank you!  It was a coping mechanism originally from my childhood that just never left.  It is sad at times, I do get attached to characters and end up feeling even more lonely when reality hits me.  I'd like to be able to learn to live in reality but it seems so impossible  ): 




 *Dysfunctional high five!*  Lol hi there.  It somehow makes me feel better that there is somebody else experiencing this.  Sometimes I get way too centric in my own world haha 




 I do have regrets of having given up on so many things, I just don't even know how to stick with something at this point.  Art is pretty much the only thing I ever keep in my life, but I frequently give up on those projects and such because of apathy.  I'd rather have learned to play the piano, something more exciting like that could probably keep my attention?  I dunno haha.  Most of my imagination is filled with what ifs and with a me that is much stronger than my actual self.. 
























 ...not everyone would be comfortable with it?  In fact I'd say the vast majority would feel uncomfortable.

 Hey I don't have anything cute that's neo related, [but will this work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6D6Xd3wCHE) (headphones and hd for best experience)  :3 




 Man can I just have this issue but in real life?  I'd love to not have to eat  xD 
























 I was 12 years old, never did drugs, but I encountered a very malicious presence in my grandmother's house.  

It wasn't something I could see, but no matter how much I tried to convince myself I was just crazy and there wasn't actually anything there, the presence felt like pure evil and *made* my body react in such a way that I became filled with terror and flight.  My rational mind was literally just like what the ever loving fuck is going on?  

I've heard of people who have a certain instinct that tells them something is wrong when they can't actually discern what it is, and this was just one of those times.  My body and instincts were telling me to *get the fuck away* from whatever was there, except that it was blocking the only doorway out of the kitchen.

Nothing happened, but it felt like it wanted to kill me.  It irrationally made me fear for my safety in a certain way.  The part that really cemented the idea of it being a demon of some sort instead of a panic attack, was that the feeling of apprehension and fear within me *didn't gradually wear off.  Its exit was as instantaneous as it had come*.  I didn't realize just how heavy the atmosphere had felt until 'it' left.  The room then felt so light again, and I was filled with relief.

I imagine the whole ordeal probably would have looked like I was insane to an outsider; I was crying and praying to god and trying to melt into the back counter.  It was both the strangest and scariest thing that has ever happened to me in my life.  

The experience itself *did* happen to me.  The part that nobody would believe is that it was a demon.  I can't tell you with fact that it was a demon, but I can tell you that it felt like there was a malicious presence there, and I personally associate the idea of a 'malicious presence' with a demon.  I guess it could have been some kind of temporary, one time, vivid emotional hallucination.  I don't know.  I don't go chasing after ghosts and the supernatural.  Nothing like that has ever happened again, thankfully.   




 YOU BOYS LIKE MEXICO? **YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO** 




 I felt like Gates to Infinity pandered either to children or casual gamers.  I hated how I couldn't take multiple missions in one dungeon like in the previous games, *I mean why the fuck not?*  It made gathering materials a slow and painful process.  Plus they literally just made it waaaaaay too easy to get rich and get good items in that game.  I agree the storyline was too short and not as compelling as the previous games.

They better not skimp out on this new game that's coming out, I will be so pissed.   




 [This item.](http://items.jellyneo.net/?go=itemshowitem=7108)  The item description totally brings it together.  xD 




 I changed all the passwords and pins of my side accounts and main to completely separate ones for now, and I've deleted all traces of linking to my side accounts on my main just in case.  I've also checked the plain text neomail and login birthday prompt in site preferences.  I haven't talked to anyone on the boards lately and haven't neomailed anyone, and have bought a limited amount of items from user shops (a little risky, but I still need to complete quests).  And deleted cookies.  So far, my accounts are okay...  But I hate being careful like this  x_x

EDIT:  By the way... why is this happening *now*?  I get when it happened while neopets was still a relatively popular site, but I would not expect such tomfoolery to occur when the site is dying.  It seems to have come out of nowhere... unless it is a result of people realizing after the neopocalypse that they can do whatever the fuck they want?  _; 




 Oh yeah, *black liquorice*, another candy I hate  :P 




 I'm glad too, I really thought I was weird and alone on this.  :'D 




 My hope is that I can apply my imagination into creative outlets.  I can imagine things so vividly, but when it comes to actually writing, that is where I am perfectionist.  I'm a very good writer, just not with creative writing.  Creative writing involves exploring life in a realistic aspect.  I can't just make all my characters perfect like I can in my head, because that isn't good writing lol.  Being a good writer allows me to see how much I suck at writing creatively.   




 Hey man, my imagination falls along the same lines!  My favorite fantasies involve saving the day and rescuing my imaginary friends with my mysterious superpowers.  Well, I will admit I find this childish of myself, but only because I am so self-critical.  But you can at least have the comfort of knowing you aren't alone in this aspect.  c:   




 Do you think it's because our daydreams are like an idealized version of reality?  For me, it's a place where I am far stronger than I really am; that's the most important part.  I find myself looking toward society with a certain degree of apprehension.  I notice a lot of conflict and discord.. so being able to retreat within myself provides a sort of safe covering from society and a sort of buffer from my social anxiety.  

I look at myself in reality and am disappointed with the person I have become.  The person in my daydreams has lots of friends but minus the conflict... but they're also super idealized versions of people, people that just can't exist.  Wishing for things that can't exist is quite exhausting, I agree.  I want to be willing to accept reality, but it seems very far off right now.
