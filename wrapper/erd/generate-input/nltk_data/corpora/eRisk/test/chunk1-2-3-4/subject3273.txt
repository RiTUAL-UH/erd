 We have Jesus here.. So yeah. 




 Sorcery... 




 This is true. I see them on a daily basis. 




 The battle in my head right now.. *think happy thoughts, think happy thoughts, think happy thoughts... I CANT!!* 




 My girlfriend of 4 years broke up with me earlier this year... I'd break up with her the day before she broke up with me. That would show her, and I would regain the upper hand! 




 TIL nothing... 




 eBay needs to do a lot of things.. 




 Erection, it does all the thinking at age 16... 




 If we're sharing stories, back when I was an RA I got a call at 3am from my boss saying EMS was on their way and I needed to meet two students outside with them.

Long story short, the boyfriend was at the girlfriends dorm room and while they were getting it on the girlfriend passed out and the boyfriend panicked and called 911.

While we were standing outside with EMS the boyfriend asked the EMS worker if she passed out because he was putting it in her butt... 
























 First thing that came to mind.

"Who's in charge here?" "The Clawww" 




 I don't typically steal, but I feel as though you have called me forth to perform a duty required of me due to the complexion of my hair. I'll keep you posted. 




 I got banned from selling on eBay. Apparently I'm sketchy and they don't think they can trust me. That's cool though, I only spent years building my eBay business to what it was. On the plus side I can still support their million(probably billion) dollar company by buying things from their site. They didn't ban me from that.  




 I'd be fine and dandy if it were this tree.

 Hopefully I'll be able to teleport over to the Walmart. I really hate driving 20 minutes for milk. 




 Ohio State was undefeated until.... yea, nevermind.. still hurts. 




 Thank god you drew a picture for the towel trick. 




 Plot twist: former students are famous in prison. *sings johnny cash covers* 




 I see they've had contact with the Chinese. 
























 *finds new friends* 




 Wutt? My home state on the front page of reddit?  




 Gosh that's sooo scary. I think I need to eat a donut to calm myself down. 




 Those stinkin Pugrats! 




 I imagine you live in a normal house, but when you go to work, or duty calls, you walk out to your back yard where there is a hatch that says "quarantine" on the back of it. You slowly make your way down the ladder where your co-worker, who we'll just call Desmond for the sake of the story, meets you and gives you the low down on the night before. You guys go into a dome shaped room where a computer sits in the middle of the room and you enter 6 numbers in a specific sequence. If you fail to enter the sequence in an alloted amount of time and hit return all of reddit will cease to exist. True or False? 




 It's a frog dog!  




 My father is a Criminal Investigator where I live and meth is a growing problem in our area. He has shown me several people's mug shots over the course of several years from the first time they came in (before/beginning meth use) and their most recent mug shot. The most recent picture ALWAYS looks like a completely different person that's 40 years older than they actually are. Unbelievable how that drug can affect you. 




 That's just how you live. 





























 It is indeed a very beautiful town, and Tennessee's oldest town! Here's a picture my dad took from downtown Jonesborough.

 Can I take a message? 




 Tis a very similar landscape. 

-fellow DayZer 




 Na we have "hollers" here in TN. I've live here for about 10 years and haven't really figured out if there is a defined landscape that makes a holler a holler or if the places they call holler are just called that because the road names are named such. For example "hog hollow rd" is a road name in this county and that area is generally referred to as hog holler.  




 Yep sure is is! 




 Oh Em Gee. 




 I've been up to Mountain City a few times and the path from Johnson City to Mountain City that goes up by Watauga Lake is absolutely gorgeous. I've always wanted to go out on that lake.  




 That's awesome! I love living near mountains. I'm not sure if I'd want to live anywhere else. Just about everyday I see something that I haven't noticed before. I hate when they go bare as well. Way more beautiful in the summertime when everything is green. 




 This is what I see.

Near Jonesborough, TN.

Edit: Much like, so wow.  
























 Close. Am I speaking with a fellow Fall Branchian? 




 I was waiting for you. Glad you could make it.  




 Bristol Motor Speedway is definitely an interesting sight to see in these parts.  




 Definitely worth it. Good luck to ya. Maybe one day you'll be a fellow East Tennessean. 




 Fall is definitely one of the most beautiful times of year around here.  




 I love it. I've lived in several parts of the country as my dad was in the military and when he retired we moved here.  None of the places weve lived in can compare to East Tennessee.  Depending on where you live you have the best of both city life and country life. Southern hospitality isn't a myth, everyone treats you better here. It's a great place to live. And actually I just transferred to Middle Tennessee State University last year so I'm right here outside of Nashville when school is in session. I think choosing to live between the two places would definitely depend on several factors but if you want the option to have a quiet secluded life (with a view) East Tennessee is the place. Also,  not that I'm saying your life has to be secluded in a place like East Tennessee, because it doesn't. You just have that option if you want it. Hope that helps!  




 Oh yes, you must come back when there is not a festival going on. There are so many less people and you can see the town in its true form.  




 I'll notice you by your driving first and then the Illinois license plate. 




 My favorite place in Ashville is the Biltmore Mansion. The view from the back of that place is amazing not to mention the house itself. 
























 I need this thing on my counter in the kitchen. Never have to see another ant ever again. 




 Well great, now I'll never be able to get on an elevator the same way again.. 




 I said to myself,  "Self, you really don't want to look at this." But my finger didn't get the memo.  




 Sure, I'll pretend I didn't see this 12 hours ago. 




 Awesome! I actually work at Warriors Path State Park during the summer! I probably know you or know somebody that knows you. 




 Indeed. 




 That's awesome.. 




 You're welcome! It's awesome to see the number of people that are from or have passed through our area.  




 Can confirm.  Fellow graduates from high school get arrested all the time for meth.  
























 That's surprising given your username. 














 I was just about to ask if you broke even with the record company or if they had to recoup their advances? Or if it happened some other way?  




 My mind wouldn't process that as anything other than "....we can't just photographer nude.." for several minutes. I 




 There's a dude that I used to be in East Tennessee States computer science program with that apparently played goat on this album.  I'd like to know if he's getting a nice check in the mail every month for that.  









 Reese Cup? 







































 I always tell myself that if they really want to talk to me they'll call back. So I never check my voicemail. 









 I'd go to class. They'd never find me there. 




 And then if you hit always there's a dialog box that pops up and tells you how to change it, but usually I'm too lazy to read it. 




 Can we please get an illustration of the Supreme Leader flipping this switch. I can see it in my head and it's cracking me up. 




 Ayyyyyeeeeee 




 Revenge 





























 It's broken.. for sure it's broken. 




 Nashville local here. I was working security at a local concert venue and she showed up to see the guy performing. As I walked by her one time I overheard her saying that she had been selling out venues since she was 14 or 15. 









 You know, the first thing I thought when I saw this picture was, "this has to be in Tennessee." It was confirmed when I saw your user name.  




 This happened to me earlier today actually. My brain went into overdrive and I wasn't able to answer either question I was asked for several seconds.  




 Oh yea! Went to the store and fought some people for bread and got the last jug of milk. Don't know what I can make with the two but I'm ready.  




 Jonesborough, TN! 





























 The district  as well as the Johnson City Press  received an anonymous email Tuesday morning claiming that a group of players held the younger boys to the ground and rubbed their bare penises on their faces at a Fellowship of Christian Athletes football camp this month at Tennessee Technological University.
 









 Or...
Bow to the shoe, cat! 









 Tiny Houses.

It'll be a hipster thing. 




 Franklin? 




 I love Jimmy Fallon. 




 I hope his name is Yoda. 




 At first glance I thought this baby was in a blender.  Then I was reminded of dead baby jokes... 




 I'm not too sure. You'll have to ask him. 




 I couldn't imagine that. Drowning in the ocean would definitely be the worst.
