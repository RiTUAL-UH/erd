 Pontypool blew my mind.  There's also this really bizarre one called Resolution.  The Devil's Pass  - based on the Dyatlov Pass incident.  All sooo good. 


































 Barlene!  A kitten, hat-off, huh? (like a dance off. but with kittens and hats instead of my sweet moves) 




 "I'm the mascot of an evil corporation." 




 My dog, Gregory,  does the head tilt.   Bruce is kind of a weird one.   Perhaps he was a dog in another life.  His favorite thing to do is play fetch with this random ceiling fan chain.  Only that chain though.  He will run for it and bring it back compulsively.  Adorable. 
























 So, I made it!  I can definitely feel the difference.  I think I feel that no-nicotine-fog lifting.  I am going to revisit origami to help with the tactile aspect. 









 Has Hyperspace been mentioned?  Or Snuff Box.  Yay!  Freakin' love British TV. 





























 On it!  I finally feel like I want to be around people again! 




 Thanks for the encouragement and perspective!  It helps to think to the future.  At least today it does!   


































 He thinks he's people! 
























 Likewise in the concentration department!  As you can see, my attention is entirely elsewhere:).  Philip is only 4 month old, so he could go either way.  However, his brother, Bill Clinton (also pictured), is trans.  I thiiiink he likes girls. 









 Best.  Ever. 
























 Yes, you do!  It gets amazingly weird and existential.  Two of my favorite things. 




 Will do! 




 For some reason this exchange reminds me of the Adventure Time episode where Finn and Jake make the two kittens do all kinds of random things...

 For those that do want to whoop on me: test_subject395#1995. I kinda started fresh on the iPad. I wouldn't expext too much of a challenge just yet. 
























 Really dug Resolution.  Glad to see it listed.

Also, Pontypool 


































 Thank you.  You, my friend, are on the level. 




 How would I tell?  A lithograph would have indentations, right?  Any other telltale signs? 




 Thank you.  For real. 




 Hah, got it, needed a tiny Alan wrench.

Nothing!  Wha...? 




 See the second picture I posted.  

I have no idea how to remove the backing without busting the glass.  Should I just bust it? 




 If only the gnomes were in a more Gravity Falls style...http://imgur.com/pMd9hNr 




 Holy crap.  My brain did not even go that direction with it.  It was custom framed.  I've never seen a frame like this.  Apparently, the framer didn't want their name attached. http://imgur.com/Wkz8uIA 









 I have had sleep paralysis issues for nine years now. Typically, the dreams that end with the paralysis involve something horrifying (being thrown around a room or stalked by something unseen).  Those suck.

Three nights ago, I had the first one in two years.  It was a dream within a dream within a dream.  I remember waking up twice only to find that it wasn't quite over.

I felt my hand sting.  Then it started to really hurt.  I was on my back, so I pulled my hand to my line of sight.  Expecting a cramp or my hand to have been asleep, I peered down towards my hand to find a deformed, hairless head with its mouth wrapped around my hand, up to my thumb. The body wasn't visible, and I can still remember the expressions it was making while it chomped down.

Then the paralysis!  Finally, I woke up with a yelp.  A literal yelp.  I had fallen asleep with a paintbrush in hand.  I had clenched so tightly onto it in my sleep that my hand cramped.  Weird.
