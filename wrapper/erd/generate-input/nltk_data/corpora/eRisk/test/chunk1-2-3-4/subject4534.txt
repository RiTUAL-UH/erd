 Maybe 3-4 yrs old. Could've been Christmas. Eve. Parents let siblings and I open a present. I got a Looney Tunes puzzles cos I distinctly remember porky pig. 




 Religion. And real country music. 




 Led Zeppelin. 




 My dad gave me his belt too from when he was in his early 20s. It doesn't fit me since I'm a girl but I still have it. It has his initials engraved into the leather. 




 Failing my first year of college. If I could just go back and do it all over, I would. I wouldn't lie to my parents about how well college is going. I wouldn't spend the next years depressed, unmotivated, and feeling lost in life. 




 It can happen. I have native cousins who have blonde ish hair, pale skin, and I saw a native baby with blue eyes. My mom made me to over to look at the baby just for his eyes. I also have cousins who are pretty brown. 




 Pistol Annies - Annie Up 




 Electromagnetism. I just can't... understand. What is this witchcraft? 




 Not sure if it's a sixth sense and not sure if it's at all impressive since it requires close proximity but I can sense when someone is close to me. When I was a kid my siblings found it amusing though. They would stand behind me and then let their hands hover over my back and I would feel this weird tingling feeling over the exact spot. It's come in handy though. My family is all fairly close and relatives are often visiting each other at all hours of the day/night. When I was in my early teens, I went to bed early because it was a school night. I left my door open because I was terrified of evil spirits and ghosts and felt safer with the door open. I fell asleep. Then I woke up. My right thigh was tingling. I shot up and there was my male cousin crouched beside my bed with his hand hovering over my leg. He told me he just wanted to ask if I had any CD-Rs. I told him I didn't and he left. Turns out, he'd been groping female relatives while they slept. He grew out of it but the family has kind of ... ostracized him since. 




 When I was living with my sister, we had our first fire drill in our apartment. I ran out the door and went downstairs to the lobby. My sister followed right behind me with her wallet, our cat, and her cell phone. Nowadays I'd probably just grab the kids and dogs and leave. I can't remember where I ever leave my wallet or cellphone so screw looking for it. 




 Family recommended the show to me because it was funny. I watched an episode and couldn't watch anymore. It came off scripted. 




 I watched Glee for awhile so I can say the only episode I liked was the very first one. It all went downhill from there. 




 Homemaker. I'm single with no kids. But that won't stop me. 




 I sent a text message to the wrong number. I inverted the last two digits. I thought I was texting my brother in law. He was with my sister when her phone died so I joked that I was stalking her. The text receiver didn't appreciate the joke. Turns out a girl he knew shared the same name as my sister. I explained myself and apologized. 




 For me, the most useful info is that drowning is silent and isn't the flailing around and shouting you see in movies/TV. My nieces and nephews love swimming and our beach doesn't have a lifeguard. Someone drowned there recently. 




 That sucks. My mom forgot her iPhone in a public restroom. Mine was stolen when I forgot it in a bookstore, so my mom was happy a cleaning lady found hers. Since those things cost about $700, my mom gave her $40 for finding it. 




 US Netflix, Spotify, and Hulu. 




 Had one drink at 18. Didn't drink alcohol for years afterwards. Family has a few recovering alcoholics so I just didn't see a point to drinking. First time I got drunk was on my sisters birthday. Made sure to drink a lot of water. Stopped drinking when I felt myself losing my ability to walk straight. Growing up shy and self aware has only made me very aware of how drunk I am. Tipped the waitress alot but I do that sober too. 




 Punched myself in the face too except i was trying to stuff a sleeping bag into its sack. 




 "We should get a mini freezer and just fill it up with TV dinners." 




 Jack from Lost. I hated that guy. 
























 I would probably have a panic attack. Cry a lot. Call my sister. No answer, travel to her apartment. Cry some more. Then take her car and drive a whole day to my parents house. Find my family and bury them all at the family plot. Take my dogs and live at my parents cabin teaching myself survival skills hoping I learn enough to survive. 




 Not a book but Thomas Nagel's The Absurd. It expressed and validated everything I felt my whole life. After reading that I decided that the meaning of life is to give life meaning. Felt 1000x happier. 




 I'll play Mario Kart 64, Star Fox, Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and Cruisin USA on the Wii every once in awhile. 




 I recently bought the Season One DVD. I can't decided now whether or not it's a good idea to watch it right now. I may binge watch. 




 Glee. It hit all the right teen angsty notes. And the rest of the show sucked after that. 




 Home - Dixie Chicks 




 The saying "it takes a village to raise a child" applies to my big family. Grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins are not afraid to discipline each other's kids or call each other out on shitty parenting. Sometimes we'll recruit a relative we think will be most effective to talk to another relative about their actions or behaviour. 




 They drive to the next town or drink in their homes where the cops can't see them. 




 I was 12 years old. Hometown has an adult dance after the family dance. This was before the town's alcohol ban so it was a pretty popular dance for the adults. I spent New Years at my grandmas where she was also watching her other grandkids whose parents also went to the adult dance. She didn't have a tv so we played card games all night. At midnight people started shooting blanks from their guns cos thats a thing here for big events. 




 Sunny Sweeney, Lee Ann Womack, Laura Cantrell, Jamey Johnson, the Secret Sisters. Still patiently waiting for their albums! 




 Amazons and Gladiators. The Room. In The Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale. All damn horrible. 




 Get "acoustic earplugs". I got some for $7 after I went to a rock/metal show. Didn't need them at all for country concerts though.. 




 As a girl who didn't know the difference between a tank top and a camisole, i have no damn clue either. 




 Believe what the tv tells them. 




 Boulder to Birmingham - Emmylou Harris

Whats Up - 4 Non Blondes 




 The movie "Giant". James Deen, Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson. I watched it on TCM one boring evening. Now whenever someone mentions they don't like old movies, I tell them to watch that. But it is a very long movie but worth it. 




 The Glass Castle - Jeanette Walls

The Alchemist - Paulo Coelho
 




 I really like being your friend. I think we could be very good lifetime friends. You make me feel like I'm capable of so much more. I'm also happy you're more comfortable with sharing your thoughts and feelings with me because it makes me feel closer to you. I don't want to lose you. But, if you're hoping for more than a friendship, it isn't gonna happen. 




 The Sarah Connor Chronicles. I'd never been so pissed off at a cancellation before or after and I'm still upset at my friend for introducing me to the show. 




 I tried this and my dogs understood but he just didn't care. 




 I sometimes think it's cultural and maybe a little bit biological. My dad is shy as well as my sister and me. My adopted siblings are not shy and neither is my mom. I was shy because I was incredibly self aware and that made me very self conscious. I had a happy childhood and was never bullied. Kids were always nice to me. I was sheltered a lot too. My dad and my sister learned to cope with their shyness by creating public personas but they're still very much introverts. I didn't create a public persona for myself but I learned to control my shyness after years of practice because I was tired of being shy. I'm still introverted though. It took years of practice, years of awkward moments, stilted conversation, and trial and error to learn to cope with my shyness and make friends for the first time ever. Dealing with my shyness is still an ongoing process.

I do think shyness is related to a fear of rejection. When I'm struggling with my shyness and force myself to be confident, I feel a sense of fear and if I feel I'm "rejected", it fucking hurts. But I think "fuck it," life is too short. I heal that rejection and move on.

I also think it's cultural because my old hometown was a very shy town. The people were just shy towards outsiders unless the outsider goes out of their way to be friendly, then they're accepted into the fold. But the new generation is not like this. They're very outgoing, friendly, and eager to experience new things. 
























 We don't air our dirty laundry in public. We try to keep family problems to ourselves. But in a small town, it's hard, word gets around. We also don't take the bait and engage with antagonizers. 




 I have a mid 2010 macbook pro that still works great. When I felt it was slowing down I wiped the entire thing to brand new. I also know someone with a 7 year old macbook pro and it works just fine, no problems, it just needed a new battery. 




 As someone who has helped to take care of younger cousins since I was 11, and babies from when I was 17 and up, a healthy 4 month old is fairly easy to take care of. But then again, I want to go into childcare and love kids! 




 I was a vegetarian for only a year. It was easier to be a vegetarian in the city (vegetarian friendly restaurants, fresh cheap veggies, fruits, etc) but once I returned home to my native american hometown, it was hard. I tried until I relented and became a pescatarian. Then I relented some more and accepted traditionally harvested meat into my diet. So, vegetarian no more. Once I went back to the city I didn't know if I could start over again. I do want to become a vegetarian again. Possibly when my roommate and I finish our store of meat in our freezer. 




 I'm incredibly careless with my stuff. I have a habit of tossing them around when I'm done with them. Also, I'm clumsy. 




 I have a relative like this. He also has very little filter so will say inappropriate things. He's deeply embarassed me a few times with his loud voice and ramblings that included me somehow into a topic. So... I now avoid him when I can. 




 I've always wanted to learn more about horses and take horse riding lessons. It's a dream of mine. Now I'm scared I'll turn into this. 




 Sounds like my kind of party! 




 123wpm. I already knew I was a slow reader but wow, I am slow. I like to build the image in my head though so I re-read paragraphs and make mental notes of character names and other bits of info because I have terrible memory. 




 I had no idea the Superbowl was tomorrow. Aaaaaaaand I still don't care. 




 I'm this friend. My hope is I'll arrive on time this time for sure. Nope. Now I know to add 30mins to my ETA. I've been late my whole life and it's hard to change that habit. I felt bad for my one friend. He told me he arrives at the time of the meet up even though he knows I'll be late because he can't stand to be late. 




 Hermione was my favourite character and I hated that she ended up with Ron. Harry made a better match. 




 Reading was just what the girls in my family did. I wasn't an avid reader like my sister but I did read a lot. My parents would take us to the bookstore once a month. I didn't appreciate books until a few years ago. I read Divergent and the book made me angry. JK Rowling was able to build a world, characters, and sympathy in ~200 pages, something Divergent failed so miserably at in the same amount of pages. Thats when I started to appreciate good books and truly start to enjoy them. 




 My nephews and nieces would eat all the fruit. Then discover the candy. There is no hiding it from them. Except the top of the fridge. They're still too short to reach even with a chair. Except my uncle and cousins can reach the top of the fridge. Solution is to eat the candy as soon as you buy it.  




 Declare one day a year to be Pajama Day. Everyone encouraged to wear pyjamas the whole day. I'm serious about this one. 




 My favourite thing to do is listen to music, watch tv and go on the internet when I have the house or apartment to myself. It's the best. I can do all these things without being disturbed. I also like going to the bookstore and spending hours in there looking at books. 




 My hometown is completely surrounded by wild untouched land that goes on for what seems like forever. If you're going camping it's a lot of portaging, a lot of carrying packs, and a lot of paddling for hours on end. If you bring an iPhone, iPad, or iPod you better protect it! My mom dropped her iPhone in the lake one time. My dad was smarter and put it in a waterproof case. But neither of us brought any kind of chargers. After a long day of paddling/portaging in the hot sun, it's nice to relax in your tent and listen to some music, play a game, or watch a video. Then it dies and you still have a few days to reach your destination. I plan on taking my oldest nephew on our next camping trip and I'm sure as hell getting him a charger so he can play his iPad games during our downtime. 




 My niece was a few months old when she had whooping cough. Was a long hospital stay and you felt helpless just watching her. 




 Same. School is rarely cancelled and the reasons for cancellation was because the schools water pipe's froze or the power went out for the whole town. No matter how cold those school buses still showed up 8:15 to bring everyone to school. 




 Listen to country music. My crush liked traditional country so I started listening to it too. Crush didn't feel the same but I discovered music I actually liked and now only listen to country. 




 Pay off my parent's debts. Get my dad a Harley Davidson motorcycle. He's always talking about getting one some day. As for my mom, she'll get some fancy convertible car. She's always wanted one. 
























 I'm kind of the same as well. I don't really stress out over things. As a kid the plans my parents would make was always a 50/50 of whether or not they followed through so I've learned to just roll with things. I don't make plans. If something happens, then I just go with it. I'm always surprised at how emotional people can get and how stressed out they can be. I started thinking people would find my calmness very odd so now I try to "show" more of a emotional reaction when really I'm pretty calm. 




 Is it not common practice to clean your place before going on vacation? When I started living on my own I made it a habit of cleaning my entire place whenever I would be out of town. I really don't like the idea of coming home to dirty sheets, dishes in the sink, and garage in the garbage bin that's been sitting there for awhile. Even now that I have a roommate who will be home I always make sure to clean the entire place before I leave. 




 Frak. I wish I knew this yesterday when I got a spam text for some FIFA prize thingy and a link. I deleted the damn text but wish I could report it now. 




 One christmas my aunt gave my siblings and me a camera that printed small stickers. It was an awesome gift but then she told us she had given it to us by accident and it wasn't meant for us but we could have it. She intended to give us this crap gift. 




 I never completed Star Wars Episode 1 Racer. There is one track I couldn't get past. 




 A family friend told me that he went to a private party where the Dixie Chicks played for 1 million. I'm pretty sure I'm gonna save up now! 




 The Power of Myth by Joseph Campbell. 




 I love this show. Glad to hear there's a movie coming. 




 I couldn't snap either so I decided to learn. I just practiced for a few days. Hurt because my fingers weren't used to doing it but now I can snap with my right fingers, left not so much. 




 I never understood the alligator thing so I just think that it points to the smaller number. If it starts small, it's less than. 




 Last year I took a year off of school and stayed with my parents. I was probably unemployed for like six months while I was there before I got a job. My parents travelled a lot so I took care of their two dogs, the house, and helped with both of brother's kids whenever they needed a babysitter or needed someone to drop off/pick up the kids from school. It sucked. I was bored out of my mind. I spent my days taking the dogs for walks, visiting my grandma who lived down the street, and cleaning the house. A lot of internet surfing and watching movies. 




 This works for me. I'm near sighted in my right eye but my vision isn't too blurry in that eye. It just makes things a little sharper. 




 My 6 year old nephew probably would. 




 My gamer friend introduced me to minecraft when it was in its early days. Now my 6 year old nephew plays it on his xbox and my 5 year old niece plays it on her ipad.  




 As someone from a small town who loves country music, the whole "I'm so country" is wearing thin. My hometown is traditionally hunter-gatherer so no farms, ranches or horses. It's just hunting and harvesting. The people who live that life don't talk about it and post it on facebook because it's just life to them. It's no big deal that they split logs, put down fish nets, and set up traps and travel hundreds of kilometers to catch bigger game while holding down jobs to take care of their family. They're not tailgating, having bonfires, drinking beer from a dixie cup, or posing with their guns for facebook. That boat they own has a purpose and so does that snowmobile, it's to get them to their nets or traps and to travel long distances over water or land for bigger game. And that truck they have is to transport the cords of wood they cut to either heat their homes or in the summer cook their food over a firepit. 




 Guitar stand. My brother and me would prop them against our stomachs and pretend to be x wing fighter pilots or something. Pew pew pew. Flying around the house until our dad demanded we put them back. 




 I'd be a slacker or a moocher because I wasn't thinking about what I wanted to be at 5. I was too busy being a dusty kid with scraped knees in a small town. 




 I haven't had cable tv in two years. I do have netflix and if I want to watch a new episode of a show I'll go to the networks website the day after it airs and watch it there. My roommate doesn't watch TV, just youtube vloggers. So no cable tv missed. 




 Emma Watson, Jennifer Lawrence, Rachel Weisz, Kristen Stewart, Kate Winslet. 




 ""RON - WEASLEY!" Ron bellowed back, as though he and Uncle Vernon were speaking on opposite ends of a football pitch." -Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban 




 "She doesn't even go here!" 
























 I take him out everyday so he can run around in the yard. I also play with him at least two times a day. I try to wear him out but he's still young-ish (1.5 years) and it seems he never runs out of energy! I wish I could get another cat but that won't be feasible until next year. 




 I've been busy lately and admittedly haven't been spending enough time with my cat. He pretty much demands constant attention. Anyway, lately he has been nibbling on my arm or leg. It's like a gentle bite. I would get mad at him because I really don't like being bitten no matter how gentle. Anyway, lately now whenever he does it he'll start to get... aggressive? It's like he's playfighting but it's doesn't feel playful and I've never encouraged him to playfight with me ever before. I usually play with him with his lure toys, etc. Is he mad because he feels neglected? 




 I had two jobs where I was under qualified. The first one was when I was 21 maybe and it was as an onsite administrator assistant. It was a small company and I felt they really really did not need an assistant because I had nothing to do all day. I also had no idea what I was supposed to be doing.

Then there was the summer job I had recently. I was a coordinator of sorts. I was in charge of a dozen people from 9-5 and my job was to supervise them but also coordinate their training program. I had to make up their schedule and hire people to train them. I think 50% of the the job was knowing the right people and networking. I didn't know the right people and I had to learn quickly how to network. It was very stressful and has honestly led to my recent depression. Though I felt I could have done a thousand times better in so many ways my bosses are happy with my work so I guess it wasn't all bad. 




 He's probably in his 80s. Drinks a lot. I hear he's sober now which is surprising. But before he used to drink with his alcoholic friends on his porch and yell obscenities to the women walking by. He also passed out with a pan on his hot stove that caused a lot of smoke. He was fine and so was his house. My town gets some sick entertainment whenever they hear firetruck sirens 'cos the town is otherwise dead and nothing is going on. So quite the crowd. For awhile he didn't have proper sanitation and I'm pretty sure he used a honey bucket lined with garbage bags because those garbage bags he left for the town's garbage collectors to pick up was pretty squishy. My dad calls him the world's best neighbour. 

He did help me though when I was taking my dog out on a walk. My town lets their dogs run loose if they're not tied up year round. I make sure mine are collared and leashed when I take them out. Well a vicious dog was too interested in my dog and they were both getting aggressive with each other. World's best neighbour came to my rescue and scared the other dog off with a few rocks and kicks when I was struggling to keep my own dog in check while scaring away the other dog. 




 I think he'll just have to be happy with my company until I can get a second cat! Thanks for the advice. 




 Cats are REALLY weird. 




 For some reason I thought cats were social animals! I guess I've spent too much time with dogs to know the difference. I think I'll just stick to what I'm doing then and next year when I'm able I'll just get a second cat. Thanks for the advice and info. 




 I live in a townhouse that has a shared fenced courtyard. I recently adopted a cat and he's settled into his new home. I've started taking him out everyday with a harness and leash. At first he was scared but now seems to look forward to his daily outing into the courtyard. I just follow him wherever he goes and if he's up for it I'll play with him with one of his toys. But I've noticed that my neighbour lets her cat out everyday too. The cats notice each other but don't walk up to each other and if my cats becomes too interested in the other cat I pick him up and distract him with something else. My parents have a small dog that tries to pick fights with other dogs so I have a bad experience of introducing dogs to each other. I'm wondering if it'll be the same with my cat? Is it okay if my cat wanders towards the neighbours cat and say hello? Honestly, I just want my cat to have a playmate, he likes his new home but he's very playful and at times seems lonely. 




 The only grocery store in my town doesn't allow dogs. When I first got my dog I would walk him to the grocery store but I didn't want to leave him outside because there is a ton of stray dogs in my town so I took him into the store with me. I carried him through the aisles. Anyway, they now have a no pets allowed policy. 




 I actually had this conversation with a friend of mine. I told him didn't exactly have standards but was looking for someone who shared my values. Someone who believes in God, is a moderate Liberal and has strong family values since I do love kids and would love to have a big family one day. But I think I would also like someone who plays video games (BF4, Skyrim), doesn't mind me dragging them to the latest romcoms, and laughs at my dry-ish humour, and someone who has shelf full of books. I really don't like people who smoke or smoke up and prefer someone who is a social drinker who doesn't become dramatic once they've had a drink. Also, I'm fairly spoiled since I'm the youngest girl in my family, so someone who can accept that about me and doesn't make me feel guilty about it.

Edit: Forgot to add liking country music. It's 90% of what I listen to and I go to a lot of country concerts. 




 I like country music so whatever is on country radio. 




 Yep. Scared of driving but only because I'm pretty sure I'm the bad driver. 




 Dixie Chicks (Natalie Maines), Loretta Lynn, Patsy Cline, Miranda Lambert, Carrie Underwood. So many really. 




 I don't mind her music but her voice is great and the only reason I buy her albums. 




 I'm not familiar with the newer Pokemon but Jigglypuff was always my favourite. 




 I have a few: Dixie Chicks, Rilo Kiley, First Aid Kit, Miranda Lambert. I have a ton more but when it comes down to it these are the singers/bands that I'll never tire of. 




 Divergent and City of Bones. The movies aren't great but they're a helluva lot better than the books. 




 YES. It drives me crazy when I hear kids/teen saying they are bored. My grandma would lecture me as a kid/teen whenever I said I was bored. My mom would lecture me as well if she heard me say anything about being bored. "Read a book then, there's a bible right there." Uh, no that's okay, I found something to do. 




 All of them. Except uniforms. That I understand. 




 Yes, this. When I worked at a movie theatre it was the people who demanded fresh popcorn when they had just been popped not 5 minutes ago. We just put them in the display to make it easier to grab. 




 I told my sister of the sin of the vertical video. I have yet to tell my mom. 
























 I've used rdio cos we didn't have spotify but now I want to move over to google play cos I think they have bigger payouts to artists.

 rdio.com, I'm switching to google play though. If I like an album enough I buy it off iTunes. And if I like the artist enough I actually buy the CD. 




 A friend actually did this. I thought it was insanely crazy/creepy at the time but he's one of those guys that just says "Fuck it" and does whatever he feels is right. He saw me shopping one day on vacation and decided he had to get to know me so while I was standing around he chatted me up. We became instant friends before I went back home. For some reason he became fascinated with where I came from and made the 16 hour drive to my hometown and stayed a week in a tent behind my parents house and got to know my town and my family. He says its one of the best trips he's made. He's actually the first and only person to ever mention how beautiful my dark brown eyes were. Everyone is quick to compliment blue/green/etc but rarely brown so I was pleasantly surprised. 




 Do women have different protein requirements than men? I took some whey protein powder from my brother in law until I get my own. But my friend tells me I need to go to a professional to find out what exactly protein I need. He mentioned protein shakes made specifically for women?

 




 I liked Kiss Me. Saw it on Netflix. Imagine Me and You is good as well. 




 Confidence and hobbies. I think looks (either eyes, body, whatever) can draw a person in but it's personality or choices they make that can make them attractive. The most attractive girl I ever met was cute but what made her so hot was that she was very confident, super friendly, ambitious, and she had various hobbies like cross country skiing. 




 I would probably say Kristen Stewart. I only saw Snow White and the Huntsman just for her. 




 I feel like my depression comes in waves. I think of it as a cycle in which I go through good periods of productivity and socialization and other times when I think life is completely pointless and why should I even bother getting out of my bed. I kind of get what you mean. 




 Bride Wars. I kept expecting Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway to admit they loved each other and get married. 




 I don't think it's forward or weird at all. I've actually gone a step further and pretty much grabbed one girls hand and wrote my number on it. We were good friends until we moved to different cities. 




 I love Little Big Town but since they switched producers on their last album and decided to chase hit singles they've been kind of meh to me. I see this as another attention grab by them. 




 Oh wow, thanks for the song suggestions. I have some listening to do! 




 I've been thinking about songs like "Wide Open Spaces" and "New Strings" which made me also think of songs like "Long Time Gone" where someone leaves their hometown only to realize how good it was back home. Are there any more songs of leaving home only to miss home and/or coming back? 




 In a perfect world Miranda Lambert would win every country award. 




 I hope you told her. I've actually told two of my female crushes how I felt about them. One of them was flattered but straight, and the other was asexual and not interested in starting anything but still remains my friend to this day. I really don't regret telling them. 




 I keep his toys out so he can play with them whenever he wants so I guess i'll try putting them away so he doesn't get tired of them. Play before mealtime sounds like a good idea. He's not declawed. 




 It seems that way. I've started to divert his attention by grabbing his lure toy when he starts to become aggressively playful. I just don't want him to think it's okay to try to bite and scratch my arms or legs when he's like this. 




 LOL don't worry I certainly appreciate him, the many cat scratches on my arm tell the story of me constantly petting and hugging him to the point he would get mad.d 




 I take him out everyday and play with him at least two times a day but I guess I'll ramp it up. 
























 Haha that's perfect 




 My brother played Eminem's "Headlights" a few weeks ago. I'm not a fan of rap but my brother is a big Eminem fan so I'm familiar with the story of Eminem's relationship with his mother and that song honestly made me start crying.

But I think it would be 4 Non Blondes "What's Up" at 14. I heard it and that's when I knew music wasn't something you just consume but could mean so much more. 




 I have no choice but to take my time. I think I've chosen an expensive hobby so I'll have to save for my next purchase. :) 




 Yeah, I kind of figured that too. Any suggestions for the next step? 




 Thanks, there's a store nearby that carries Grados. I'll go take a look. 




 I just bought the Sennheiser HD558s. I like them enough but I can't help but feel they're just a taste of what I'm looking for. A start pretty much. I want headphones that make it sound like I'm right there, right in the room. The 558s still feel like I'm listening through headphones. Any cheap set ups for someone just starting out? I listen to mostly country. 




 Yes and it sucked. I was maybe 9 or 10 and this was at a daycare type center. I cried in the kid's house. One of the girls my age must've seen me cos she gave those were talking about me shit. Also, heard my aunt joking about me but I love my aunt and forgive her 'cos she just likes to joke around. 




 Bree Van De Kamp. Redhead. Stepford wife-ish. And I think I could handle her crazy. 




 Thanks, I'll check it out. I miss rdio simply because people I friended shared the same taste in music and I could see what they were listening to.  




 In a good way? It would be the steel guitar. 




 Watched fireworks with some friends from my backyard. 




 Ruining their fun I guess. When I didn't drink and would go bar hopping or clubbing I would just order a soda like pepsi or coke and just let everyone assume I was drinking rum and coke. 




 For those rare nights when I decide to just get drunk I drink lots of water and a bottle of gatorade before I sleep. Still got a hangover when you wake up in the morning? Bacon, more gatorade, and more water. 




 I made the switch from rdio to google play and so far it's underwhelming. No community, harder to discover music, and adding music isn't a simple click. 




 I feel like if something was popular, it was everywhere and you couldn't escape it. Pokemon, Spice Girls, Backstreet Boys, Tamagotchi, Titanic, Friends, Windows 95, Sock'em Boppers, Tickle Me Elmo. Nowadays it's easier to ignore things but I kind of miss being caught in a wave of pop culture. 




 If anyone wants to add me, pm me. I don't want to give out my PSN name here. I have a PS4 and play GTA5, BF4, and just started FIFA. 




 I listen to mostly country music. I was thinking of the Sennheiser 558 because I can pick it up today while I would have to order the 598 online. 




 I'm thinking of getting Sennheiser HD558s. Would these be good headphones to start off with? And would I need an amp/dac or them? I'm seeing the E10k around a lot so should I get those? It'll be for my iPod classic and laptop. 




 I'm Native and yes it is. I have a lot of alcoholics in my family. My parents stopped drinking when I was a kid and I'm glad they did because our home life was great compared to others. Education sucks in native communities, poor healthcare, poor housing, little jobs, and residential school really messed up the older generations who then became poor parents to their kids who then became poor parents to their kids. But the new generation is getting slowly better. I see more young people who are breaking the cycle of family addiction who lead healthy lives. I didn't drink until I was in my 20s because of all alcoholism I saw in my hometown. People who get blackout drunk and become violent. But after years of living away from that I felt it was okay to try a beer and now I would consider myself a social drinker, 1-2 drinks tops and I'm done and switching to water. I'm very aware of the stereotype so I try not to get too drunk. 




 **Budget** - $25-250  
**Source** - iPod classic, Macbook Pro  
**Isolation** - Doesn't matter  
**Preferred Type** - Over the ear. Or in the ear.  
**Tonal Balance** - I'm not sure.. I don't like too much bass. I like to hear everything.  
**Past headphones** - $20 Sony earbuds that get worse over time and sound muddy now. Sennheiser earbuds that were stolen so I don't remember what they sounded like. I also have Denon AH-D7000s and I find those underwhelming but they're meant for my record player not my iPod.  
**Preferred Music** - Country, country rock, indie rock/pop. I could be listening to anything from acoustic country, country with rock guitars, or lo-fi like The Wavves and then to something like Lorde or Florence and the Machine.  

The store I'm going to carries Sennheiser, AKGs, Audio-Technica, Monster, Bose, Sony and Panasonic. So preferably in those brands. 




 Riddick. Katee Sackhoff being badass, just ignore Riddick's stupid comments. 
























 No, I don't really feel a romantic connection with men.  

I've met a few guys I've been physically attracted to but their personalities totally turned me off so it was a no go. I can't really explain it. I'm attracted to the fantasy of a man but not irl men. I find that guys fall short of the fantasy. 




 I was raised Roman Catholic and couldn't imagine leaving the Church behind or renouncing my faith. I'm more Catholic in tradition than practice (but still attend Church occasionally, etc.). My family are just Catholic, that's just the way it is. I've reconciled my faith with my sexuality over time. When I was a teenager I believed it to be a sin. Now, I just believe Mark 12:30-31; I believe in loving God with all my heart, and loving my neighbours as I love myself. And oddly enough, I think of the Miranda Lambert song "Heart Like Mine"  where she sings: Jesus, "He would understand a heart like mine". I think if I try to be a good person, go to Church, be charitable, and kind to others, than that's all that really matters. In the end, Jesus will be my judge, not man. 




 I identify as bisexual, but only consider dating women. I'm sexually attracted to men but that's about it. I have yet to find a guy in real life that I'm attracted to, the more I get to know a guy the more I lose interest, meanwhile women are just so attractive in every way. 




 What bothers me is that they have to explain it at all. From the viewers POV, everything was working in the favour of the allies. If they hinted that it was going to be a hell of a fight with tons of casualties, it would work but they spent the last episode having Cage in a sort of rage because they, the MM, aren't left with any viable defences. 




 Yep, same here, with one added 'tell' which is my voice for some reason goes deeper. 




 Emmylou Harris - Boulder to Birmingham 




 Yes! It would be nice to be asked. I asked a friend to take down drunken pics of me from his facebook. He did but then months later put them back up. I approve things added to my timeline now. 




 Yes, Kate Winslet. Titanic. 




 My golden does this sometimes. Usually when we're out for walks and she wants to play with stray dogs and I won't let her. 




 For slowed down music, I've always liked Don Williams. Emmylou Harris is also good. 




 Jenny is my favourite L Word character. 




 Now I'm confused, I thought TDEE took into account activities like exercise? 




 I'll see how it goes for this week. I played my first soccer game yesterday and it was pretty intense so I'm really tired and sore. If 1540 calories isn't enough I'll add 100 calories incrementally until I feel the difference. 




 I'll try it for a week then and see how it goes. Thanks. 




 I'm 26, 5'5", 132lbs. I started lifting and running three weeks ago. I lift and run 3x a week and play soccer once a week for an hour. I'm wondering if 1520 calories is enough? My TDEE is 1902 and I took 20% off of that. Should I be eating more calories? I want to lose weight but gain muscle.

I try to eat 105g of protein, 60g of fat, and 140g of carbs. I always fall a little short on protein and fat and overdoing carbs but everyday I'm getting better the more I experiment with food. 




 Dixie Chicks Top of the World CD and 20 best of 60s Rock and Roll CD. I was 14 and decided I would find music that I really liked and stopped listening and buying whatever MTV or pop radio told me to listen and buy. The 60s CD was my parents but I loved it, "Da Doo Ron Ron" "Ain't No Mountain High" "Wild Thing". 




 I love running. I used to run track and field in Grade 5 and I remember looking at a poster of Donovan Bailey wishing I could be as fast as him. I played soccer as well in elementary and later ran track in high school. But I think it does grow on you but you shouldn't be afraid to try other things. My mom started cycling after being a runner for years and absolutely loves it because it's much faster, and less harsher on her knees. 




 I bought a digital textbook. Was slightly less expensive and it expired at the end of the semester. I could bookmark pages so I could flip back and forth very easily. The only thing was that it was available through a website I had to login and the website sucked and was a little slow and I could only download one chapter at a time. 




 I actually like Blake Shelton's music because I feel it's genuine to who he is. As for Luke Bryan and Jason Aldean, I believe they're sell outs because I really don't think their music is genuine to who they are. 




 Ashley Monroe, Elizabeth Cook, Kelsey Waldon, Sunny Sweeney, Angaleena Presley, Nikki Lane, Lydia Loveless, Holly Williams, Lee Ann Womack. Thought I'd add more women to your list. 




 Xena. Buffy. Spice Girls. Hermione Granger. Captain Janeway. Sandra Bullock in Miss Congeniality. Aurora from Sleeping Beauty. Stupid Ash from Pokemon couldn't appreciate Misty. Also, my brother and I used to have lightsaber fights in the backyard. And how could I forget Lucy Liu in Charlie's Angels, leather and whip. 
























 Liars and Fools 




 Sofa fm boot liquor is an online radio station I would give a listen to, it has many of the artists suggested along with a variety of others. I'd say it's a good place to start. 




 Lonely Too Long or In My Arms Instead 




 Grab a snack, it's a long list: The Hours, Chicago, Drop Dead Gorgeous, Beautiful, Sugar and Spice, Simone, Miss Congeniality, Looper, Gravity, Unforgiven, The Proposal, The Housesitter, Star Wars: A New Hope, Wag the Dog, All About Eve, Singin' in the Rain, Little Miss Sunshine, Funny Girl.

I made my own movies as a kid, wrote my own scripts as a teen, and watched a lot of movies. I don't watch as many as I used to but these have always stuck out as my favourites whether or not they're critically acclaimed. 




 Clarke Griffin from The 100. She's so badass. 




 I think that's what it is. Thanks! 




 Okay this seems familiar. Thanks for the help! 




 My trainer came up with a routine I can do while I'm traveling and don't have access to a gym. One of them is titled as a dumbbell burpee and the instructions are to row on each arm, push up, and then lunge on each leg. 

I don't remember doing this since I was super tired the day we went through this workout. I'd rather not bother my trainer at this time since its late. 

Anyone know what exercise this is? I'm at a loss of exactly how I should be performing it. Google isn't any help. 




 Kenny Chesney is pretty entertaining, so should be a good show overall. Have fun. :) 




 I can't answer how long his set will be just that you should go. I saw Eric Church recently and he puts on a great country-rock show.  




 I remember seeing that as well but can't find it now. 




 1) 26
2) Bisexual
3) PS4 and 3DS
4) PS4. Thinking of a PC build though because my roommates PC games look really cool.
5) BF4, Zelda, Mass Effect, Elder Scrolls, Fallout.
6) RPGs
7) Waiting for the next Tomb Raider and patiently waiting for the next Mirror's Edge. 




 As of now, since it changes everyday:    
**Album:** *Hold My Beer, Vol 1.* by Randy Rogers and Wade Bowen  
**Book:** *I, Claudius* by Robert Graves  
**Movie:** *Interstellar* (re-watched it last week). 




 I think it was my first grade teacher. She was really pretty and really nice. She went on maternity leave before school was out. I still kind of remember her all these years.   First girl crush that I was completely aware of was on this girl in high school. She knew I liked her because I told her. Anyway, she married a guy and they have a kid now. I feel weird whenever I see her now because I turn into that awkward and shy 16 year old all over again.

 I think she was purposely trying to speak "clearly" to be understood by the American guests which made Graham laugh. 




 I was 10, too. I was playing in front of my house when I was catcalled by a guy driving by in a car. I was too busy playing to pay attention. The only reason I remember it at all was because my 14 year old brother came storming out of the house, chasing the car, and yelling at the guy. 




 So glad I got to see them when they toured Canada. 




 Oh, too late, I already bought it. :-/ 




 St. Vincent has more albums?!? I really need to download the rest of her albums. 




 Punch Brothers - The Phosphorescent Blues  
Rhiannon Giddens - Tomorrow Is My Turn  
Brandi Carlile - The Firewatcher's Daughter  
Justin Townes Earle - Absent Fathers
 
























 Stacked up on an office room shelf. 




 What station? I might have a better idea if I know the type of music the station plays. But would it be Jolina Carl "anymore"? 




 Friendly, and genuinely kind. Gets me every time. Active and has hobbies. 




 Yep still live with my parents. I'm from a small town and getting your own place is almost impossible. I also think it's cultural. I'm also a student so I live at home to qualify for student funding. I still have my own place when I'm at Uni but when the semester is out I'm back at my parents. 




 The Anthelios Lotion made me sweat more, the Cream was much better. 




 I watch other people's videos on YouTube mostly because I live in an area where I don't get to see the artists I would like. 




 Yes. But I've learned to invite people to concerts I think they'll enjoy. Eric Church and FGL? My brother. Don Williams or Charlie Pride? My dad. Keith Urban or Brad Paisley? My friend who plays guitar.  Carrie Underwood or Miranda Lambert? A female friend. 

Most often they repay me by forcing me to go to concerts with them like Nicki Minaj or some metal show. 




 Classic country would be:

Hank Williams, Roger Miller, Kitty Wells and Patsy Cline.

Modern would be:

Kacey Musgraves, Kelsey Waldon, Lindi  Ortega and The Pistol Annie's (Ashley Monroe and Angaleena will also play their solo work). I would add First Aid Kit but I don't know if they would be country exactly. 




 Yeah I was thinking of putting the 3G network back on so on the off chance it's switched on I'll get a notification.

Edit: hopefully they didn't pull the SIM card? 




 Okay. Thanks. I doubt I'll ever get it back but was just curious. 




 My iPad mini 3 was stolen. I reported it stolen. Had the sim card suspended. I have Find My iPhone turned on and put it in Lost Mode. It has a lock screen. I have restrictions set so no one can make changes unless they know the password.

But since I found out it was stolen I've checked Find My iPhone and it's been offline. I've checked the notify me but so far, nothing. It's only been two days.

The thing is I'm not sure if they were able to restore it somehow. I usually customize the names of my devices but this iPad is just listed as 'iPad' which is odd. I might have forgotten to rename it when I reset everything a few months ago. I'm just wondering if there is any way possible they could have restored the iPad mini which could result in the name change and the offline status? 




 Randy Rogers and Wade Bowen, Hold My Beer Vol. 1

-Standards
-El Dorado
-Hanging out in Bars 




 Brandy Clark or Brandi Carlile. 




 Dixie Chicks
-Wide Open Spaces
-Fly
-Home 




 There's a mashup of Linkin Parks Numb with Jay Zs encore. 




 Dirt. The only Florida Georgia Line song I own. 




 I like a lot of songs off their "You Get What You Give" album so I'd just recommend the entire album. 




 I'm not sure about a second cat now. I'm a student so I go "home" during the summer months. This was the traveling I was talking about. I'm not comfortable leaving my cat alone for weeks or months at a time even if I get someone to check on him. 




 Jake Owen - what we ain't got? 




 Kristen Stewart or Amber Heard would be at the top of my list. 




 It seems traveling will be an issue then. My cat is fine with traveling now and seems to know what to expect. But if cats in general are not fine with traveling then I can't predict if the second cat will get used to it as well. 

I'm moving from a roommate situation to on my own. 




 I've already listened to it a few times through already. I love it! I think it's quickly becoming my favourite of the year along with Randy Rogers and Wade Bowens recent release. Same Trailer, Different Park was good but I found I tired of the music. It sounded all the same. This seems to have more variety to the tracks. 




 I wasn't too much of a Jason Isbell but the more I get past the quietness of his songs and listen to the lyrics the more I like his music. 




 I have a 2 year old cat and I'm thinking of getting a second cat. I think my cat is lonely when I'm not home, he seems to sulk whenever I leave. I think he could use a companion. But I'm wondering if it's the right decision.

Some things I'm concerned about:

- I travel every few months to visit family either by 16 hour road trip or by flying. Traveling with two cats is doable but does complicate things. 
- I would be committing to another cat for his or her lifetime. Though a companion would be great for my cat, my cat doesn't have to worry about vet bills, moving, etc.
- I'm moving from a 3 level townhouse to a 2 bedroom apartment in a few months
- I'm starting College in the fall so the cats will be alone for a better part of the day, the pros are that my college will be across the street from my new apartment

Otherwise my cat isn't affectionate but does love humans and their presence as well as their attention. He's playful but not very creative. 




 I was just about to post this link after finding it but you beat me to it. :) 




 Oh, Tonight
