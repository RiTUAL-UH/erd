 "There are two paths before us: Where the corporations dominate or where the public says enough. I ask for your help so that the nation takes the second path,"

a russ feingold quote, not that anyone will see this as i am 10 hrs late. 









 GARY FUCKING ANDERSON!  I remember being a little kid and this game seriously wrenching my soul out.  Then to again have my dreams pushed to the brink of reality a decade later and again, now as an adult, having my body shut down from the disappointment that is, the Minnesota Vikings.  




 Hey everyone.  I currently live and teach in South Korea and the community I live in is kicking off a fund raiser for some schools in Siem Reap, Cambodia.  I first visited Cambodia last summer and walked away awestruck and inspired.  The people of this country have many reasons to be depressed and downtrodden, yet they are not.  A mere 40 years ago Pol Pot's reign of terror and genocide tried to destroy this great country.  So many people are still so affected by this, and yet these people are amazing.  So loving, so friendly, and so much desire to better their country!  Well the fundraiser my community in SK and I are doing is simply a spare change fundraiser in which we handed out Piggy Banks to all interested people, and then told them to bring them back to us on December 16th and also decorate them in an original manner, and we would give prizes away for the best original pigs!  I was wondering if the great people of Reddit would be interested in getting in on this?  Obviously you can't send a Piggy Bank full of change, but people could keep the change in a Piggy Bank, decorate and send pictures?  Or simply just keep some change for a while and donate it.  Figured maybe Reddit wanted to do a little good for some great children and people in an amazing country!  Here are a few websites that talk about the projects I am involved with and also how to help, or how to donate.  Thanks for hearing me out.  If this pig thing is stupid for a real broad internet community, I understand, just was curious if it would work on a wide scale basis.  Cheers!

 Where you are from is a major part of what shapes you as person.  I like America man, and I am proud of that.  I am not necessarily proud of some of the decisions our country has made and especially not proud of our healthcare system in particular.  But I know a lot of great people who would bend over backwards for just about anyone.  These aren't the people that everyone hears about, so it is a shame that the gun-toting obnoxious assholes are all people ever do hear about.  I am proud of the people around me that I saw (don't currently live in America -ironic for me to be defending it and then not living there, I know) who are great people and hardworking and are trying to help our country change for the better. I.E. protests around wall street.  




 Oh I am not proud of the American Government, heck I am not proud of many of my countrymen/women.  But I am still proud to be American as most Australians are proud to be Australian or Brit is proud to be British.  Its my identity and I wouldn't want to change my roots, I want to be proud of them.  




 Defending your country is simply being proud of what you are.  Sure, its great to make fun of what you are and where you are from, that is funny.  But when SOMEONE ELSE pokes fun or insults where you are from, it essentially is them poking fun or insulting you.  I am American, and I make fun of some of our ineptitude, but when another insults it I will stand firm and  try and defend it,  I don't think that makes me "butthurt"  I think that makes me someone who is proud of who I am and where I am from.

 Getting dongchim'd by a student is one of the most infuriating, awkward, hilarious encounters around.

 Has anyone tried this powerful treat? 









 Yeah this made me laugh really really hard..."pooped a mudslide" might be one of the funnier things I have read. 




 Oh I totally agree it was very buggy.  But it had such highlights and fun playing time that, to me at least, made up for some really brutal bugs. 




 That was the name of the company.  It was an MS DOS game.

 She is indeed the only one in THIS picture. but her face speaks for them all believe me.  Disgusted by this cookie duster on my lip. 





























 Not sure why you were down voted.  I have many friends that are exactly what you described, people that never leave.  I decided, fuck that, saved up my money and moved out of the country.  Its just all about making the decision to actually do it.

Edit: spelling 




 What is this "athiests" you speak of?   




 The only reason I clicked comments was to upvote this inevitably posted comment. 




 That's so meta... 




  Personally I'd be thinking about the first few weeks after our wedding when we'd start talking about fetishes and sexual boundaries/secret desires and all that and I'd tell her how much I want to give her an enema. To be clear I'd want her to privately give herself an enema first so there's no scat then fill herself up with water again along with 3 movie sized bags of skittles and invite me in the bathroom, I just want her to squat over me in the bathtub so I can stare and poke at her anus as she sprays a jet of skittlewater into my mouth as I wildly jack off as the crack of wet skittles spraying off my teeth creates a machine gun sound effect, then finger her as I lick out her gaping anus as it twitches and quivers. She's a bit weirded out at this but she loves me and knows this fetish is something I've been fantasizing about since I was 12. Plus we're married and have a newborn together, what is she going to do, divorce me over this? She's more than welcome to peg me afterwards or any other fucked up fetish most guys would balk at.

That is my personal favorite.  I still can't stop laughing 




 My best friend has referred to Christmas as Newton Day since we were 14.  I have sent him a "Happy Newton Day!" text now for a decade.   




 losing the game, checking in. 




 My friends and I also saw Jawsome very often, but we have now incorporated more words into this style.  Words like "Jawful" or "Jawstruck"

"Man, I am jawstruck by how jawful this movie is." 




 http://www.unitedwisconsin.com/recall-offices

This is a list of recall offices, and many union halls in cities/towns also have outposts where you can sign them.  That's where my parent's and siblings signed.  As I am living out of country, I can't sign. :(   But promote this list of locations if more people you know are unaware and wish to sign. 




 YUP - Love me some Decemberists, last show I saw before I moved out of the country.  So good. 









 Like I said different strokes for different folks! :) Have an upvote. 




 Definitely love some Tool.  Maynard is a genius.  Puscifer and APC are rad too. 




 Obviously everyone has different tastes in music.  Different strokes for different folks.  So I guess I will start, bands I listen to that really just rock my socks and maybe more people should have their socks rocked by: The Decemberists and Limbeck.

Both awesome, in my opinion.  What about you guys? 




 Agreed, resin taste awful.  It was simply a last resort when the city was dry... 




 Was doubtful, then it lined up with the entire "The King is Dead" album by The Decemberists.  Really cool.  Rad find, man.

 There are two Capua's now I think, the one you just updated as well as in the disputed territory (SW of Albuquerque)  Not sure if city name was used twice, or a typographical error.

 To be fair, it says "unlimited drinks", and that can be quite appealing for customers interested in the more expensive specialty drinks.

 Deviled eggs are super easy. Quite delicious. And very cheap. Eggs, mayo, mustard. Might have that all already  and not even need to spend.   









 Si! 




 Whoops. Didn't even see it. Sorry to repost, vikes fans. 




 This article is extremely well written. It comes off as poignant and eloquent. But it still leaves a sour taste in my mouth.  MMQB is putting out some really good stuff.  









 Its my niece. Her parents are badger fans, and im over. Wasn't trying to be an attention whore. Just a picture of me spending time with her watching football.   









 9-7. But let's hope im wrong and we get a few more. SKOL 




 AD, you are the man! Go Vikes. 

What's it like being a cyborg in the NFL?  Do you think being a machine-man gives you any edge?  

Seriously dude, your rehab after that knee is inspirational. Thanks.

 Yeah, but you give no explanation that's why you are getting downvoted. Not for a dissenting opinion

 Wow. That website rocks. 




 There is no chance they keep Freeman, with or without Norv. They will keep Cassel as a vet, if anyone, and draft qb in 1st or 2nd.

 I imagine the equivalent of the Amsterdam coffee shops will begin opening up at some point. Seems only logical, no? 




 No offense, but your comment comes off as ignorant as shit. I assume you are white? You clearly don't understand the unequal job opportunities of African Americans in ANY profession, let alone head coaching in the NFL. How many black head coaches were there prior to this rule?? It clearly is working as they are now actually seeing opportunities. It's not forcing any team to hire these individuals. Its forcing teams to actually give them a look. 

Its not like you can just "get rid of the Rooney Rule."  Racism isn't dead, and old white owners usually need to be pushed in the right direction. Sorry, for this mini-rant, it just really pisses me off when people are ignorant of the incredible struggle for equality that is still being fought for by African American coaches. 




 Maybe pick up something from Milwaukee Brewing Company. Local, very city orientated. Or hit up Great Lakes Distillery for some great local booze that may not be available up in Appleton.  




 Understandable. They are quick reads. The dunk and eggs are only 50-70 pages 




 If you still are feeling the itch, there is also the Dunk and Egg novellas as well as The Princess and the Queen. All in the Westeros world. Fantastic reads.

 Hey folks. I am about to start my first year teaching at a high school. I will be teaching US History and a Government class at a Hmong-American Charter. Was wondering if any fellow Social Studies teachers out there had any classroom design/decoration ideas? Resources for quality Historical posters or something? Just trying to brainstorm some ideas. Or maybe just hearing how others have decorated their rooms? Thanks for anyone looking to help a guy out! 




 Is the plan for Harvey to return and pitch this year yet? 




 Yeah, clearly ruining his day... 




 Poor Eli... 









 So you must have missed the news of him winning a gold glove. Or him being a back-to-back all-star. You're right only news of him being a shithead. And wishing an injury on the guy?? Now who is being a shithead? I get it. You don't like the guy, but that's pretty classless for a guy spouting off about integrity for the game. 




 What a completely useless comment. I would love an actual reason of why he is a shithead. Breaking the bat on his knee and throwing a helmet? Its called frustration, it happens. You don't watch this team daily. You don't see all the great morale Gomez brings to that team and the fans all the time.  This team loves him. This city loves him.

So now I say not fuck Carlos Gomez, but  rather Fuck zeroesandones. Seriously dude get off your high-horse. 




 De Bruyne had the assist to Fellaini and the tackle that started that counter. He hasn't exactly had a bad match

 He's originally from the south. So there is hope 




 That bite kills him. Called it 




 Rorge and Biter kill the Hound maybe? 




 I was reading the Wikipedia page on the topic, and it essentially says in the 19th century their emerged texts claiming it, but there is no primary source to confirm it.

So the question is: What, if any, proof is there of it happening. AND why in the 19th century did this begin getting written about?

BONUS: If this is true...WHY THE HELL CAN'T I SALT THOSE DAMN CARTHAGIANS IN ROME: TOTAL WAR II????

 It is the Supreme Court's responsibility to protect minority rights from legislation which oppresses said rights. They now set precedent to avoid anymore legislation which would infringe on gay rights. This is exactly where this should have been decided. Just like it was the right place to resolve segregation and the infringement of African American rights. That is the whole purpose of Judicial Review. To prevent oppressive legislation by the majority. Good job SCOTUS! 




 I live in Wisconsin and happen to be a Vikings fan. Like to know the discourse of my rivals. Specifically when everyone near me is a Packer fan. Gonna be talked about all around me. Might as well be up to date. 




 Not saying the Vikings had a solid defense in that game. But an offense without Peterson and with Ponder sucks. It's inefficient (time of possession) and has turnovers. That makes success for the defense incredibly difficult.  









 It failed? That's funny. It sure didn't seem like it failed with groups of  9th graders singing this "obsolete" song throughout the day. But hell, you must have been there, not me. Since you seem so positive it failed. 









 Yikes. That is a whole lot of broad generalization about a whole country of people from one ignorant comment.  That certainly can't enhance any sort of conversation.  




 I listen using the Podcast Addict ap on my phone.  Super reliable and easy. Tons and tons of podcasts 




 Yeah.  I thought I remember him saying in part V that he was going to do one on the Peloponnesian War.  Obviously didn't say it would be next, but did mention he wants to do it. 




 Sproles is much older and certainly did not look better than Shady last year. That Shefter tweet about McCoy being 2nd in NFL in rushing behind Demarco weeks 5-17 last year proves that. He had a slow start, but is still a dominant back.

With that said, I still think the Eagles are the winners by being able to shed that cap hit and getting a potential stud in Alonso. 




 These are all over actually. Around both Madison as well as Milwaukee.
