Also from reading and my own experience with them, if they (CloudFlare) provides the SSL Certificate, then you don't have control over it. They do and the can decrypt your connection because they also own the private key.  














 This list kinda makes me laugh... 










































































 This isn't the 1990s where SSL slows down the connection to a website, we have servers and computers powerful enough to handle that issue now.

Also, anyone can spy on you without SSL enabled on all websites. 

Also HTTP2 protocal and update which is coming out is going to force the majority use of SSL which makes a more secure internet in the end 




































































































































































 You could explain how it is terrible? 

Also, you may not see the threat which I do, but it is coming sooner and sooner as time progresses when we will see weekly exploits of these fitness devices like we do SSL/TLS. 





































































 It's just the press release information that everyone is posting.
