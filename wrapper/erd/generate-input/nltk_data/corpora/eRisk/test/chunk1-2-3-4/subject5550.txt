 I drove from Seattle down to Burien, then Kent, to Bellevue then Redmond then Issaquah. There are cops crawling everywhere - city cops, WSP, etc. Multiple cops and tons of pull-overs - What's the deal? Do they try to align when they do their quota hunting?

 This is even more of a long shot than the guy w/ the hit and run.

Some dick broke into my blue Corolla at a parking lot around this area. There was almost nothing of value in the car, but we'd left house keys in it so those got jacked. Front passenger window is missing also.

It occurred between 3:30 AM and 4:30 AM on 5/17 (probably closer to 3:30 since alarm wasn't blarin when I got to it). So any info from about that time if you were in the area could be helpful.

I'm going to hit the businesses up that operate around there tomorrow as well. 




 Can we get automod functionality to simply block off posts until accounts have accrued some age. When I look over a page of the sub these days, a disproportionate number of the requests now come from new throwaways, people who aren't even redditors.

When Kirk [put this sub together](http://www.reddit.com/r/Loans/comments/jm1os/meta_about_the_creation_of_this_subreddit/), the purpose was to **help redditors**. It's quickly devolving into a haven for scammers. My concern isn't just that a bunch of new lenders aren't intelligent enough to read over the side bar - that's always existed, but w/ all the spam (that's effectively what it is) from accounts made within the last day or two, it becomes tedious to even find posts by **actual redditors**

Other subs where goods/capital are exchanged have used automod functionality for a long time to restrict based on objective qualifiers (karma, age, etc.).  And where this may not have been needed in the past, you don't need to look far to see how this sub's devolving.

 ###Introduction

If you're thinking about lending, start here:

[/r/Loans Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Loans/wiki/index)

The META posts in particular provide great information. Not all of the information there is entirely current though. This sub has grown a lot since those guides were written and scammers have become a lot more interested in the sub - meaning the average lender shouldn't assume good-will as easily on the part of the borrower.

In the course of lending, I've come up with my own verification strategies and copied some discussed in META tags here by others. I've attempted to consolidate everything having to do with verifying information into a single thread to make it easy to reference.
 
 
 
 
###Social Media Verification

If they don't have social media, particularly Facebook, or they do and it's basically never been used, has barely any friends or has a ton of spam-account friends, or seems to have been made overnight, that's a red flag. Facebook is the primary extrinsic way for you to truly verify that they are the person whose photo ID they sent you. Go through the Facebook, make sure it's a couple of years old and the images match the photo ID believably. Have them friend you for the duration of the loan and also have them send you a message. It's vital that they add you themselves, or at least send you a message, since there are people who will add anyone.


###Personal Image Verification

When you ask for images (proof of employment, drivers license, and so forth) ask for all of the following:

(1) Photo ID Close-up

(2) Proof of Employment Document

(3) Borrower holding photo ID

(4) Borrower holding a notecard w/ their Reddit username and date

(5) Borrower making a unique physical gesture

You obviously need to make sure the photo ID matches the name they're claiming and that the person in the photo ID has an uncanny resemblance to the person holding the ID.

An image of the individual holding a notecard or something to that effect with their username and the date (4) can be combined with also ask the user to make a unique hand gesture or to hold the card in a unique way *that only you* ask *your* borrowers. Having the individual hold a card w/ the date and username provides a physical watermark. This is entirely fool-proof however, as a reused image w/ a notecard can be easily photoshopped. A hand-gesture is much harder to photoshop and if the image clearly shows their arm fully connected to their body and what-have-you, it only gets tougher.

One real concern that's materialized itself is that scammers are able to use images nefariously gathered. By including a hand-gesture that other borrowers and lenders are unaware of, you make it difficult for a would-be scammer to simply pass off an acquired image as one taken at that moment. This is beneficial not just to you, but also to the community. If somebody receives an image from a potential borrower where the borrower is making a gesture that seems strange or of which they didn't even ask, they'll be inclined to inquire about it.


###PayPal Verification

This has been brought up time and time again. Anybody can make a PayPal account, but by ensuring that you only lend to PayPal verified users, you can rest somewhat assured that PayPal has taken measures to verify their PayPal identity. A 10 year old PayPal Verified account is a lot more likely to be the person they're claiming to be than a one month old unverified account.

The process of ensuring PayPal verification is simple enough. Take the PayPal email address they've provided you and replace the portion with brackets ([email]) in the following URL:

https://www.paypal.com/verified/pal=[email]


###Phone Verification

(1) Once you've gotten their phone number, **have them leave you a voicemail**. If they don't use the phone number they provided you to begin with - that's a big red flag. They provided you with a bad initial phone number for a reason.

(2) Next, check the phone number they've provided you against the following site (or an alternative carrier lookup):

[Free Carrier Lookup](http://www.freecarrierlookup.com/)

Again, if it comes back as a strange carrier or VOIP number, that's another red flag. They're not providing you their physical/regular phone number for a reason.


###Work Verification

Ask them where they work. Google their workplace, give them a call - ask them if they'd be comfortable with that before you do, if you prefer. It will save you a lot of heartache. I've had a borrower tell me they worked at a particular department store - even sending me paystubs. Their work story seemed strange since their Facebook was indicating a lot of free time. So I decided I'd give them a call at their work place. I came up with a quick story in case anybody asked why I was calling them at work, but I found out it was all for naught. They'd been fired a week ago, their bi-monthly paystub that I would normally take as proof that they're capable of repayment was meaningless.


###Conclusion

A thorough verification process may mean that you're spending a few extra minutes making sure the information provided to you was legit. If you truly want to help people on this sub, take the necessary steps to ensure you're not just throwing your money into a black-hole. There are two types of people who default, people down on their luck and scammers. There will always be people down on their luck no matter how many verification steps you take. But we can work towards cleaning this place up of scammers - and the only way to do that is to *stop giving them money* even if it's "just a small amount." Best of luck!
 





































































 Does somebody know if there are any established equations or models to predict how snow acts as it plummets towards the Earth? From my understanding, all rain starts off as snow/ice and becomes rain as it falls. My question is what role the mass of the snow/ice, and/or even where it originates in the sky, plays in it's disintegration as it plummets?

Any academic papers on the topic would be interesting as well - academic paywall will not be a problem.

Thank you guys!

 He didn't have any Reddit creddit to back him up but I reached out to him knowing I'd probably deny the amount. Anyways, he reached back and thoroughly demonstrated that he was indeed a real person in a respectable position- etc.

Anyways, he issued a refund for the full amount - so I though great, I've been repaid. The amount however did not clear with the bank and since than he completely ceased communication and he decided to block me on Facebook. Unfortunately for him, I have a list of every single friend and family member he's listed - I've already reached out to several people close to him and plan to be a lot more exhaustive.

Krishan, save us both the trouble and pay me back.

 Hey guys,

I wanted to see if somebody could throw together a bot that crawls new posts on /r/loans, checks the username of the poster against a list of known scammer usernames, and simply posts a message warning the community in the thread. You'd be doing a huge favor to the community that's helped out several people in their time of need. I would also be happy to donate $20 to you or a charity of your choice. It won't stop scams but it'll put a glaring warning message to deal w/ a currently widespread issue.

 Alright, so here's what I've got:

http://www.insuredcoin.com/

This is my first tech-related venture and I was wondering if I could get input from some of the vets.

I adopted BitCoin early on and used it (mostly for digital goods). After the insane speculation that's recently hit it, I'm really just holding nowadays. But I do believe BTC has a future where it's primary purpose will return to being a cyber-currency that people use for more than CE.

Anyways, one of the major problems with using BTC has been a lack of protection for your BTC. You don't know how your BTC are being handled by the other party, there are no third party audits or an en-forcible security standard. When companies go under (i.e. Silk Road, GBSE) or when their assets are frozen (MtGox), many people end up losing BTC they left with the host. Likewise, everybody knows about some of the major thefts/scams as well as the purely stupid executive failures.

The idea here is to have a pool of BTC that is used to (a) ensure that businesses that get on board adhere to particular security standards and (b) insure BTC used in transactions with said companies. I don't know if this falls under your typical startup since I want to move in the 501 (3) (c) direction once I can afford modest legal fees (or find a pro-bono lawyer). But that's the gist of it (more details on the site itself - the idea isn't 100% fleshed out yet).

Any help with finding some direction, resources or simple critique much appreciated. 









 I originally posted this as a [PAID] post but I modified it out of principle since it really isn't fully paid (insignificant as the defaulted amount may be).

Repayment was a bit late and communication was okay. I told the person to forego the interest in lieu of complete repayment of the principle. He was apologetic and has gotten ~97% of the principle back to me a month ago. 3.5% was not returned. 




 Amount was broken into two repayment dates. Missed 1st due date, missed second due date (to which first payment was rescheduled), missed another rescheduled due date and then completely broke contact. She made it clear that she paid rent with the money she was supposed to give to me the first - had plenty of money for celebrations and what-not but somehow couldn't afford to not steal from me. Not a dime sent in good faith at any point. Not communicative (I needed to proactively chase her down ea time).

The worst part was, I knew exactly how this would go down the same day I sent her the amount. Hours after sending the amount, somebody hit me up that this person approached them for an additional loan AFTER I granted mine, telling them I didnt give them the full amount they asked for (a lie). My spidey sense was going off, but it was too late. The other lender lucked out by not lending to this person.

I got my principle back at least (not from her of course) so that's always good. 









 http://www.reddit.com/r/Loans/comments/1m5txi/req_need_a_loan_of_100_bucks_pay_back_130_im_sick/ 

















































 I just went through some of the various crowd-funding platforms using BitCoins - there's a ton within the first 3 results pages. But all the links I clicked seem pretty inactive (my point of comparison is KickStarter and IndieGoGo). Has that movement just not caught on as well in the BTC community?

Basically, I'm just wondering what the one or two successful platforms of this nature are - particularly if I am looking to deliver a physical good.

Within the next month, we're plan on launching our company which will sell the physical product for USD but also through BTC. Is there some online registries you guys can point me to as well where I can let people know, y'know, "WE TAKE BTC!!!". 




 I've known of BTC for a few years, but a front-page article rekindled my interest. Wondering what the best way is to restart (it was just cpu back in the day - do I just want to buy BTC or should I invest in new mining tools)? This has probably been asked a thousand times but I don't see anything too relevant in the first couple pages.

 This guy was a real character.

- Day 1 We speak. He ups the amount by a 100. I say sure. Interest: 0%
- Day 2 Loan sent
- Day 16 I reach out about 1st payment, he doesn't provide ETA for a reschedule.
- Day 27 Retry. This would've been his final payment date. Provides sob story. Again, I ask for a date. Radio silence
- Day 28 Retry, he replies sometime this week. I demand a date. Suggest 100 of 400 by 9/28. He agrees finally. He corrects to 10/5.
- Day 33 He says he'll be sending 100 eventually. I tell him that won't work so he says he'll be taking a bank loan and pay me back. I suggest 10/7.
- Day 40 I reach out again. I give him an additional 20 days, to which I get (another sob story) "gimme a break". 
- Day 42 I'm done. 

This was a NO INTEREST loan, a 100% favor that put me out 400 for a couple months. And he's asking me to give him a "break" for not paying over 2 months on a NO INTEREST favor. He posted in /r/trees and his background should've given me an idea, but it was one of my first loans and I didn't realize what d-bags some of these borrowers can be to people lending them a helping hand. 

Lesson learned: Once somebody misses the first payment on a partial payment of a large sum  I will contact every single person on their FB from now on. I kept giving the guy the benefit of the doubt since he kept promising payment and I didnt want him to look like a piece of shit with his family/friends, but going forward, thats just not feasible.

On the plus side, I took away so much from this tedious experience that's helped me in more than facet of life to make it worth it.

 I contacted the borrower on the due date. Something unexpected had come up and we rescheduled a few days out. He was apologetic and offered much more interest to compensate and paid it out even though I declined it. He paid more than a fair amount on the rescheduled date. Great borrower, would def lend again.

 Only paid after extensive collection efforts - several weeks late (with additional interest though). Was unresponsive until the very end when I was ready to open a claim. Supposedly changed phones but I saw him online on Facebook, in addition to reaching out by email, where he ignored me as well. Worst thing was, I stuck my neck out for the guy and even passed his resume around up here. I made sure nobody I contacted on his behalf escalates his resume further the moment he was late on our rescheduled payment. It's one thing to fall on hard times and get in touch - it's another to dick around w/ someone else's cash until you're left with no options.

I lucked out since apparently he had used a friend's account and that friend was not too happy about facing the consequences of this guy's actions. The interest made up for the extensive collection, but I doubt he would've paid if it wasn't his friend's account on the line. Definitely would not lend again.

 http://www.reddit.com/r/Loans/comments/1lc0c4/req_200_for_utilities_about_to_be_shut_off_im/

Full amount due 9/27. Missed due date for partial on 9/13 but reached out to me which you would think is a positive. But no. He did not give me an expected date either when he let me know he couldn't make payment. I proceeded to contact him a few days later via all mediums and have not heard back. I can see him online and responding to his friends on Facebook - and he still hasn't blocked me so maybe I will see my money.

I can understand if someone hits hard times, but it's not chill to not communicate when that happens. It's been a week now. If you're reading this /u/DustinCasler, you know what happens next. It's my first default but it still feels sucky, I could've helped somebody who wouldn't be a douche but now my money's tied up for at least a month. :(

Edit: Recouped thru alternate sources. Finally had a chat with a guy after posting this and looks like he was just embarrassed about the whole thing. Advice to other borrowers: You need to communicate, even if you can't pay back, so we (lenders) can decide our next move. 









 Prompt repayment, before I even woke up in the morning. 














 Good communication, payment ahead of schedule. 









 I'm looking for a bot that can detect keywords in titles only and can peruse the entire sub-reddit from today to the earliest archived date. Is this too simple a task for this subreddit? 









 Good communication, prompt payment

 This might be a new problem for loans. I saw somebody on Craigslist buying reddit accounts and thought to myself, "why the hell would you pay for an account on reddit?" I'd be willing to pay a few cents for an account, with several thousand, I could upvote anything I wanted to front page status. But $10-$30 per account? That's weird. And than I stumbled on this section. It'll probably be an easy giveaway when a scammer of that variety pops up (100s of posts a few years ago, lul in activity, 10-20 one word posts presently) but I thought I'd put that out there. 












































 Taken from Facebook post(s) by the former US Democratic Presidential candidate:

for original Facebook content. Quoted below:
GameOfNations... The bigger game here is Iran

"The people who dragged us into a war against Iraq and Libya want to drag us into a war against Syria as a run up to war against Iran.

This is part of a long term strategy by Neo-Conservatives who I heard openly planning and promoting this madness to Congress throughout the past two decades.

America's decision makers must be very careful not to be suckered again (and again) into more wars.

Our intervention in Iraq destroyed that country's defenses and helped to create ISIS. An attack on Syria would strengthen ISIS.

It's time to end US interventions. It's time to take care of things here at home." -- Dennis Kucinich

 My understanding is that international law prohibits the execution of POWs. My understanding is that the US acts in Afghanistan as an international force. That when the US captures a Taliban soldier, they are US POW. That if the US then kills the soldier, or hands him over to a jurisdiction knowing he will then be summarily executed, that this is a violation of international law.

http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2dapn2/some_pictures_from_my_tour_in_afghanistan/cjntkra?context=3

Somebody has eloquently argued (to a lay person like myself) that such regular actions of US capturing soldiers and turning them over to local parties for execution is not illegal. That it falls under civic, not international law. Can somebody with a proper background explain?

(Added note: I'm not interested in hearing whether this is moral per somebody's perspective. I think its deplorable semantics regardless of whether it is illegal or not. I want to know if its arguably legal - and if there's any precedence, etc.).

That ISIS is killing prostitutes - in Baghdad, a city they don't control, when killing alleged prostitutes has never been their modus operendi. But hold on a second:

http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28281102

This is a story that's actually associated to that image. Somebody went into an alleged brothel in Zayouna and massacred several women - alleged prostitutes. According to the locals, it was Shi'ite death squads. What's more troubling? Maliki's Shi'ite forces suggested that they were going to clean Baghdad up of sleeper cells:

http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/03/us-iraq-security-sleeper-insight-idUSKBN0F81FK20140703

People have been "disappearing" like they used to when the US first gave Shi'ites power in Iraq. ["Disappearing"](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=6f2_1404371007) in Baghdad means you're getting a fate much worse then a quick death.

What's disturbing is the willful displacement of the imagery. Sure, they mention the killings in Zayouna within the article. But do they, like many other sources, indicate who's obviously associated with the killings given that Maliki is still in full control of the gunmen prowling the streets of Baghdad? Do they mention that Zayouna is one of the handful of remaining mixed areas in Baghdad? That the victims, allegedly prostitutes, may well have been average Sunni or Christian citizens (not that killing of prostitutes is in any way okay!). Nope - the Western mind is pushed to make a tenacious connection between this killing, which was not done by ISIS, and point their fingers at the wrong criminals so we can continue to think we're backing the "right side" in this struggle.

 The US air drops around Kobane resulted in 20% of the weapons going to IS. The US weapons to the "moderate" groups have resulted in 2 of 12 moderate groups defected - with TOWs and other weapons - to Nusra (similar to IS). US weapons to Sahwa (The Sunni Awakening) are also now firmly in IS hands with the mass executions.

Basically, along with the weapons given to the Iraqi army that IS looted over the past months, we've effectively armed the people we've declared war against - supposedly for a good reason. It's just been one epic fuck up. 




 Do you have a source for your attribution to Muhammad? Khwarijj were a group of sectarians with the explicit belief that commission of the kabair is tantamount to apostasy. You can throw the title around in a derogatory way, but it doesn't apply technically to these guys. In fact, the closest existing sect to the Khawarij would be the Ibadis in Oman... 




 They also separated the Christians. Christians and Sunnis were free to leave. 




 You will get downvoted. This sub is a cess-pool of armchair generals with a hard-on for the any and all current international conflicts. 




 That video of them pleading for help sure was convenient for the SAA 




 Very appropriate music video to go along with announcing these:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY0WxgSXdEE 




 **Abdulaziz bin Khalifa al-Attiyah was found guilty in absentia by a Lebanese court of channelling financial support to al-Qaeda.**

Sounds legit /s 




 I'm not really qualified to have a real discussion on the topic. My only contention was that its not as simple as declaring all new celebrations prohibited (opinion held by some of mashayakh you quoted) - since there is valid ikhtilaf on whether the celebration is religious or secular in nature. I can't speak to Halloween, Mother's day, birthdays or national holidays specifically. 




 Also muslims had the disgusting habit of making eunuchs out of their male slaves.

Maybe. Deliberate castration is explicitly prohibited in Islam however so the carry-over cultural practice really has nothing to do with them being Muslim. 




  All their "state building" initiatives need to bombed too IMO.

Yes - collective punishment is the way to go. Let's teach those average Sunnis for using the resources provided by the fighting groups that control their cities /s 




 Something that doesn't make sense about the video is that it looks homegrown, not one of the well-edited videos usually produced by this group. The group instituted a treason-policy on people recording "your brothers" on film without state apparatus - right?  




 I'm not going to give a value judgement on the concept, but happy to explain it. What your right hand posses is a reference to female slaves of age.

Although Muhammad encouraged the freeing of adult slaves in general, Islam doesn't completely prohibit slavery. That doesn't mean slavery in Islam is anything like what was done to the Africans transported over to the United States by people who's religion laid down no laws with reference to slavery. Slavery in Islam is not perpetual and doesn't transcend subsequent generation. Every slave earns a wage, the wage must be paid timely and they eventually earn their freedom. It does mean that, as a general rule, Muslims can cohabit with female slaves who are of age.

As far as Muslims following the rules associated with it in modern times, its rather difficult. You get slaves by winning wars. Islam doesn't just allow you to pick up random people and declare them your slaves. You also (generally) can not enslave other Muslims - so when a Muslim extremist group fights another Muslim extremist group, they don't get to take any slaves. In the recent past, Muslims have generally been fighting other Muslims so there hasn't been a lot of associated booty or slaves.

Slavery in Islam isn't simply about sex though. Suppose you're at war, and your army kills a child's family. The child is your slave, but the majority of the world would look at rearing the child as 'adoption' and not outright slavery. In any case, the topic is a lot more nuanced. 




 I don't know specifically about Mother's Day. I was actually talking about the logic for prohibition of *all* secular holidays, "All celebrations which differ from the Eids prescribed in Islam are innovated festivals" - which is how I understood what Sh. Salih b. Uthaymeen was saying. Other scholars don't count non-religious festivals in the same category:

[Sh. Abdullah b Bayyah](http://en.islamtoday.net/artshow-411-3472.htm)

[Sh. Salman al Ouda](http://en.islamtoday.net/node/618) 




 Sh. Salman al Ouda opined the opposite. There isn't one 'right' opinion in jurisprudence. 




  Netanyahu was born in the United States

You're right. OP is not wrong to consider Netanyahu a native speaker. He's spent a lot of time over the course of his youth and adult life in this country. 




 Yep, flash some buzzwords, exploit their sympathy *for you* as they're passing by trying to get to the next class and say stuff that people generally agree with "let's not bomb people" "give peace a chance". The whole video was bullshit. 




 For the US, "hearts and minds" was just a strategy - that's not the case here.... People don't join extremist religious groups for no reason. These people legitimately believe they're doing something good for their community, as misguided as they may be. 




 If it's one thing the various factions of Islam can agree on it's that the Koran is a perfect transmission from God and has never changed since Mohammed's revelation. 

Most sects believe that, sure. 




 They won't be welcomed. IS basically waltzed into Tikrit and Baiji. I know from anecdote and even videos of people thronging to them when they came in. Locals helped IS identify particular soldiers they despised from the army when IS executed many prisoners. Things may have changed, but Sunnis in places like Tikrit and Baiji have plenty of reasons to despise the Shi'ite army - possibly more than IS, if IS is actually not doing them too sharp. 




 No - they killed people associated with Sahwa and they killed certain tribal leaders. There are *a lot* of tribal leaders and vested parties. 




 You will quickly find religious fundamentalism after a defeat followed by years of humiliation. 




 If the city falls to a suicide bombing, it'll be called Kurt Kobane 




  IS is a fanatical upstart regime. They are recruiting thousands of disillusioned youths from Western Europe.

IS is made up almost entirely of recruits from Syria, Iraq, Turkey and Tunisia. The disillusioned youths from Western Europe form a trivial component of their standing army.
 




 Our media needs to inflate this trivial hot-spot, let's not bring facts into this one.

3--- 3--- 3--- 




 These stories are being told by rather questionable anonymous sources. At the same time, AI has a good reputation in the West for their reporting. 




  This sort of thing goes without saying yet people still act shocked. After all it's called the Islamic state, not the Buddhist state or the Episcopalian state. 

[Burma/Myanmar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Burma_anti-Muslim_riots) is considered a Buddhist state by both demographics and constitution. 




 Because things aren't as simple as our media makes it seem. 




 ["the death toll may be in the hundreds of millions."](http://i.imgur.com/mMBILmY.jpg?1) 




 When it's actually a genocide. [Proving genocide](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2ksk5j/hundreds_of_iraqi_tribesmen_opposed_to_islamic/clp6hyu) isn't as easy as throwing the word around meaninglessly. 




  but i have heard some pretty nasty things of ISIS members raping small children (even babies) 

As far as propaganda goes - that's some of the nuttiest 




 Through the more reliable primary source:

http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/10/30/iraq-isis-executed-hundreds-prison-inmates

The article that was posted by OP is very shoddy journalism at best, complicit deceit by the journalist about a very serious international matter at worst. 




 If you're not Muslim, you'll be paying 5% jizya tax on your earnings. If you are Muslim however, you'll only pay 2.5% zakat tax - but, you run the risk of being drafted into the standing army. As a member of the fighting force, if you don't die, you'll be forced to fork over 20% of earnings as khums tax. Avoiding taxes with IS is like taking out a mortgage - you can pay a shittier fixed rate, or pay the lower rate with the possibility of being sucked into something much riskier. Going as a non-Muslim under a guarantee of safety is probably your best tax-bracket bet. 




 Why? Engineering departments are already full of virgins. Lots of them. 




 I've heard they do have black market stock options. They're performing a bit better than Hezbollah and the Iraqi army, with a strong upwards trend. I'm bullish on IS stock. 




 It's very difficult to kiss your head. Even when you're decapitated. 




 This is the same reason I became an alterboy at the church. 




 TL;DR Grassy Knolls is a phrase associated with the assassination of President Kennedy. Bibi Netanyahu is implying a presidential assassination of the president of the United States. Our media didn't care and instead focused on just the "third world" jab. Our media did the same thing when the tape leaked about the US role in government change in Ukraine. Rather than focus on the meat of the tape, we focused on the fact that a government official used the F-bomb.

I think I'm going to be sick. 




 Israel won't sink without the $3 billion in direct military aid. It makes up 1% of Israel's GDP. It was great to cement its existence while the country matured, but its not as significant as people think. 




 Bombings aren't exclusively against JN/IS. Bombings have also been directed against alleged SAA positions. During the Israel/Palestine debacle of late, Israel even attacked an SAA position on the grounds of there being a rocket mysteriously flying in from there. I wouldn't be surprised if Syrian air defense and long distance capabilities are targeted in the near future as well. 




 I really appreciate your insightful post - should've gotten more upvotes/visibility as its one of the rare handful of meaningful posts on this sub. 




 When he posted - this thread was still being bombarded. Things change once a thread makes front page... 




 You should edit your post. What you're referring to only happens to articles while they're still working their way up. By the time an article hits front page, a lot of the comments that make it up are pretty well-reasoned. 




 Well, its not like they can give the furniture to the Gazans now that their flats are completely demolished. 




 Probably a lot. The same way people dismiss good things they appear to have done as well. The story isn't black and white, but it's definitely a bit troubling that young impressionable minds are being recruited to blindly follow apparent leaders operating from hiding. 




 Fun fact, when these guys were first closing in on Baghdad (or so it seemed), the Shi'i government there ran mass executions of Sunnis accused of being "Sleeper Cells", Sunni inmates, and so on and so forth, and anti-regime Shi'ites like followers of Sarkhi. Course that wasn't covered by HP or Reuters... 




 Jews aren't allowed on the Temple Mount anyways under Rabbinic law either... 




 Nope none of that. 'Ali is a common Sunni name also btw. 




 Can one identify a Shi'te from a Sunni from appearance or accent? 

No. The issue most people, especially in the West, don't want to touch with a ten foot pole is that the only way to do this is through the collaboration of locals. It goes back to the (now ignored) suffering of Sunnis in Iraq over the past several years under the democratically elected Shi'ite government.

Some people hypothesized that they can ask questions or ask you about something Sunni-specific. Firstly, that makes sense if you have 5-6 prisoners. It's not a reasonable way to go about things to have an interview for 200 prisoners. This also discounts that mainstream Shi'ism is a reactionary religion to the Orthodoxy. Religious texts of Shi'ites actually teach Shi'ites about the majority opinions as well - their belief is that their leaders did put on a public face as Sunnis but were secretly teaching a completely different religion. It would be rather difficult to single out Shi'ites on this alone.

What would make things easy is lining up 300 men, bringing around villagers who sympathize with you and who suffered at the hands of some of the prisoners. Have them point out the guys they like to keep alive from amongst the prisoners, guys they'd particularly want dead, etc. 




 People here don't like to read - so let's be clear about one thing - they aren't mass executing civilians or committing some "genocide" per this article. They're killing, en mass, people who physically oppose them, etc.

according to witnesses who said most of the victims were members of the police or an anti-Islamic State militia called Sahwa (Awakening).

Is it a war crime? Dunno enough about international law, but seems like a mass execution of unarmed prisoners would be. Is it the carte blanche murder of an entire demographic or whole generation? No. 




 We can rest easy that they likely died swift and painless. Torture is more the forte of the Iraqi army than these guys. 




 He's probably never had someone throw a rock at his head out of desperation. I'd venture to guess it has something to do with him probably not usurping or destroying other people's homes, livlihoods and even their lives. Just a guess. 




 It was funny. There's a place for stuff like that in Middle School - College. International politics - probably not so much. 




 And most of Sweden isn't Ikea either. The point was that Israel can get away with caricatures of foreign states, while foreign statesmen would have to deal with the Anti-Semite card had they done the same. 




 For not being cunty enough. 




 We should force Israeli politicians to team up with a Palestinian politician and together assemble some ikea furniture. This would promote cooperation and teamwork like never before.

But the Israeli will get to keep the furniture. The Palestinian who's home was just demolished doesn't have a place to put it - I don't think he needs it. 














































































































































































 Hypothesis: There is a pattern indicative of bias in moderation by certain moderators at r/worldnews.

Test: Do you have examples of this bias? Please post your analysis - or cases you notice (especially if you have information about the mods involved) at http://np.reddit.com/r/isrworldnewsbiased/

In the past two days, I've seen three articles, several with karma in the 3 digit range, get removed. The recurring theme in each of those articles? They all brought up Israel - and they all did so in a not-so-positive light. I've never seen the moderation team act so swiftly and I must commend them for staying ever-vigilant. At the same time, it's a bit troubling that articles critical of Russia, China and ISIS keep seeming to get accidentally missed by their moderation team even when the articles are from (a) baseless sources or (b) opinion pieces. It's also troubling that in spite of the vigilance of the moderation team with respect to articles that point out terrorism practiced by Israelis, that they seem to keep missing other articles that their logic for removal would apply to. I've set out to help our friends at r/worldnews. They're probably just dropping the ball because they're super-duper busy.

I've started the above sub to keep track of cases like this. Here are the benefits to having a sub for this purpose:

- When somebody asks you why you referred them to /r/worldpolitics when there's a default sub with over a million subscribers that even Google picks up, you can link them to /r/isrworldnewsbiased. Rather than break it down explicitly for them, you can tell them why alt subs are healthy for the ecosystem.

- When somebody asks you why you're being a such a crazy tin-foil hat wacko and criticizing the immaculate moderation team at r/worldnews that has never done anything but uphold the principles Reddit was founded on - you can again direct them to the above sub which ought to be completely empty as a demonstration of how fair the moderation team at r/worldnews is.

- When you (falsely) criticize r/worldnews and somebody accuses you of using an isolated example to cast doubt on the credibility of the mods at r/worldnews and their commitment to the free flow of information - you can also link them to the above sub rather than digging for other (false) pieces of evidence.

Notice the difference. It took them almost a full day to act on this clearly local crime story that built its way to the front page. Meanwhile, they deleted stories of open terrorism (in 2 of the cases near the top of this post) under the pretense of 'local crime' in less than 3 hrs. The story regarding Shlomo Sand was actually removed **while they left this particular story about an Indian crime up** - only to take it down much later.

These are just some of the examples over the last few days that I've seen. In each case, articles were removed under a few (generally about 3) hours.

##Meanwhile the following is r/WorldNews-worthy:

##Here's an example of a Story not tied to Israel, that was rightly removed for being a local crime - given that this is what it was (Indian Farmer burns alive another Indian):

http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2jezyd/a_lowcaste_teenage_boy_in_india_has_been_burnt_to/

Notice the difference. It took them almost a full day to act on this clearly local crime story that built its way to the front page. Meanwhile, they deleted stories of open terrorism (in 2 of the cases near the top of this post) under the pretense of 'local crime' in less than 3 hrs. The story regarding Shlomo Sand was actually removed **while they left this particular story about an Indian crime up** - only to take it down much later.


...

##Here are some recent posts by other people who've called out what appears to be deliberate censorship by certain r/worldnews mods.

  (rich whites) do have the power to continue to suppress the economic mobility of poor people

But basketball players!!!11!!! MURICAN DREAM!![Insert additional anecdotes that belie statistics to support the bullshit idea that there is a ladder to financial success in this country in line with American exceptional-ism] 




 It's not "an internal affair" - it's being covered by media outlets all over the world. Some foreign media outlets have been covering it extensively and even sent correspondents (some of whom were arrested by American policy) to further investigate. When authorities in your country appear to be doing ridiculous things and the world is interested - its no longer an 'internal affair' - this is not some liqour store robbery... 




 So, basically, all the facts were true, but the conclusion that should be drawn is not as simplistic as the one he offered?

By analogy, OP reads "80% of blacks more likely to flunk out of school due to socio-economic conditions and disparity in public education quality in less affluent neighborhoods that are predominantly non-white. It's not because of race or inherent cultural differences, but directly casual to poverty" and then begins to post all over reddit "blacks inherently stupid, nigger stupidity irreversible - 80% blackies flunk - see link. This is science inb4 stormfront, racist"

Yes, the fact is true, but the fact itself is drawn from a study written to dispel the exact conclusion OP was coming to. OP is citing facts from a source, and interpolating the **exact** conclusions the study is arguing against. Hopefully that helps... 




 There's a lot more fucked than just the electoral college when it comes to systemic problems.

 Because at the time of his death, all we had to go on was the police fabrication that he was threatening the cops with his fake sword. You can't raise fuck-all with a story like that. As for Mike, outside of the Fox News watching half of the country, the fact that somebody stole some cigars and was than gunned down cold in an unrelated shooting certainly isn't controversial - let alone that being a crook isn't a good reason to get gunned down. 




 Killed someone? Lied about the situation leading up to it? How is this not a murder one?

Because the gov prosecutor is supposed to bring criminal charges - they can't be brought by third parties. Since a branch of government has a monopoly over the pursuit of such cases, and the envisioned separation of government into multiple parts has become an effective facade in modern times, no charges can or will ever be brought. Unless the prosecutor has a grudge with a particular cop. 




 I think what we're saying is that if the opportunity presented itself, we would loot the pharmacy. That's it, that's all.

That's exactly what I described you as: **Opportunistic** worthless criminals, exploiting the death of a kid and potential abuse of authority by cops to get your fix 




 Totally. Ferguson and ISIS led to this. The amount of baseless speculation in the 'news' is getting ridiculous. 




 Typical opiate troll, this bumps for you.

Oh - I don't mind at all. If it wasn't for junkies like you, I would've never got out the shit hole to the suburbs...

I'm just commenting on how you guys play to stereotypes in this sub so well. Opportunistic worthless criminals, exploiting the death of a kid and potential abuse of authority by cops to get your fix (at least in your imagination). I love it. 




 Darren Wilson was not acquitted of murder. The Grand Jury doesn't rule on innocence or guilt. They ruled that it wasn't even worth charging him and allowing the judicial system to determine innocence or guilt. False Analogy. 




 I know the first place I would hit would be the pharmacies. I would have so many pills, I would be set for a good minute. Anyone else thinking they would do this if they had an opportunity like this?


Junkies living up to popular perception - nice! 




 Can you show a comparison of the money "in huge amounts" for ea side? 




 Instead - the cops picked up the rocks that were thrown by the kids. This is not gonna end well. Cameras - from guys who were taking photos and videos coming in from the police side, quickly turn away.

 I know that they're very unorthodox and would be deemed heretical, but how did this stuff all start?

His political followers came from a large region. Some of them knew nothing about Islam, a lot about their old religions, and he wasn't able to focus on these issues due to the rebellions during his caliphate and he didn't rule long enough to do so either. 




 It is an Alawite belief then, not a Shi'a one, there is a difference.

Alawiyya is as much an off-shoot of tashayu as Ithna Ashariyya 




 1.5 billion people call themselves Muslim. If there's *any* idea about *anything* in the world, I'm sure you'll be able to find representations of it. That said, unlike with Jews in modern times, Muslim groups are less inclined to embrace these variances.

And unlike differences between a Talmudist and a Karaist, the difference between the sects isn't on simply (how do we interpret the holy book) - but different sources of religious material. So in addition to the Qur'an, Sunnis rely on certain books of Prophetic tradition like Muwatta of Imam Malik (~750 AD), Musnad Ahmed (~840 AD), Sahih Muslim (~860 AD) to name a few. Amongst Sunnis, you'll have a bunch of different interpretations (comparable to the Sages arguing issues in the Talmud). But different sects rely on their own books. For most of the major sects, like Ibadi Muslims in Oman and Zaydi Shi'ites (not to be confused with the version of Shi'ism predominant elsewhere) in Yemen, these traditions aren't fundamentally different from Sunni traditions. Many of the traditions are shared - especially since Orthodox/Sunni scholars were meticulous in sourcing reports, and collecting reports - while other Orthodox/Sunni scholars focused on authenticating reports.

The main difference comes with the major branch of Shi'ism in modern times, Ithna Ashari Shi'ism. They have their own religious texts that are generally anti-thetical to Sunni texts. In fact, the fundamental idea of the sect is that the early leaders of Shi'ism were preaching one thing to everybody (and hence why Sunnis have very Sunni leaning reports from the purported originators of Ithna Ashari Shi'ism) - while preaching a secret message to their devout followers. That's why you'll notice if you flip open to a page in a Shi'ite hadith book on a particular legal topic, like saying the word 'Amen' as part of the first prayer, that there are several reports and they mostly unresolvablely contradict each other. One of those reports is what the leader is known to have publicly said about the issue, while the other is his purported secret teaching. They have their own books of religious tradition like al-Kafi (~940 AD), al-Istisbar (~1000 AD), etc.

This branch itself is divided into 3 primary sub-sects: Usoolis, Akhbaris and Sheykis. We won't get into Sheykhis. Usoolis basically argued for a more Sunni style science of tradition (relying on authentication of traditions, Sunni concepts like 'consensus' as a basis for law, etc.). They didn't adopt Sunni religious texts, just some simplistic applications of more refined Sunni hadith sciences. Akhbaris were the more textually inclined, but didn't adopt Sunni-style authentication and favored a more subjective basis for verifying traditions. 




 I think that's an interesting point. I would argue though that suggesting that God must be in this world, which is itself a confined space, requires God to be confined in something material - or at least a "part" of God to be so confined. Would you believe that God is confined, or a part of God is confined, or that God is subdivided into parts? More importantly, I don't believe that our existence is 'real' in the sense that God is literally "The Reality" in Islam, and our plane of existence is itself not something from within which we can ever truly grasp the existence of what brought it about.

To me - that question is a lot like the 'Can God make a rock so heavy that he himself can not lift it' paradox. We affirm that God is unbounded, undivided, infinite and so forth. Than we suggest that God brought into our perception of existence a bounded, divided, finite space. Is God in that space or outside of that space? Or is the question itself flawed? 




 It surprisingly manifests itself in sects of all major religions and some religions (like Sikhi) are completely based on it.

IMO, that's not surprising. If there is an idea, and enough multi-cultural interaction, and the population proclaiming a faith is large, it'll eventually be host to tons of differing ideas. Some of those ideas will die off and we'll never hear about them again, other ideas once niche may become mainstream. Sometimes those ideas will develop in enough of a bubble for something new to be formed and completely new philosophies/religions in entirety can be developed.

In Sikhism, you have for example your more mainstream adoption of the last book as the final Guru while I personally know of at least one sect that has a living Guru even today. The later idea seems to have died off for the most part today, but given the breadth of the religion now in Punjab anyways, it's not hard to find different expressions of it while it's still a very young religion.

Re:Pantheism's expression in Sikhism -India already had a Pantheistic tradition as you know and Muslims/Hindus living far closer than in other areas Muslims occupied - so it would make sense to me that Guru Nanak Gee would've taken some of the ideas from the ancient traditions preserved by Hinduism and incorporated them in Islamic philosophy - then again, we probably have a fundamentally different understanding of what Guru Nanak Gee was accomplishing.

I don't think its completely unworkable within Islam, otherwise Ibn Arabi and others wouldn't have tried. But I feel it already exists to the extent that the 'Knowledge of God' (his ability to perceive) is all existing and all encompassing. In that sense - whereever you are, he's there.

I guess it was easier in Judaism (Kabbalah) because they didn't have a strong opinion on the afterlife.

I think it also has to do with the strain of Judaism that survived and is now mainstream. Judaism took on tons of expressions over the world with new innovators, prophets, Messiahs, Saints, Scholars and what-not. Today, to be a Jew has become so broad, you can have two people who don't agree on anything still be ascribed to the same grouping. It's the ideal environment for Kabbalah to become far more popular than it was in the past when it was confined to a few regions. 




 I am willing to look with brutal honesty

Brutal honesty? You're simply repeating the same tired absurdities.

The Almohads (Sunni followers of madhab al-Zahiri)

There you go again. The almohads didn't follow the defunct madhab (which is a school of law - following the school of law doesn't make you Sunni regardless if your aqeedah isn't Orthodox...), even if their legal system was inspired by it. Their leader Ibn Tumart declared himself the Mahdi - given that the world did not end, in Sunnism, he could not have been the Mahdi. Contemporary Orthodox scholars condemned him and his sect. His Messianic sect has no real association to Orthodoxy just because they gained control of some regions - or to 'the generality of Muslims'...

There were sects and expressions of Islam

Which are irrelevant to the initial assertion I was disputing if they have no tie to the majority of Muslims over the generations - Ahlus Sunnah...those cults killed more Orthodox Muslims than they killed Jews, what's disingenuous is your conflating aberrant sects with Muslims as a generality. It's no different than if I had treated Jews as some sort of monolithic entity and conflated violent expressions of Messianic Judaism through the ages with - Chabbad for instance...its an imbecilic over-simplification.

He himself on a very personal level knew the ravages of Islam and spoke about them in his letter to the Jews of Yemen who themselves faced brutal oppression at the hands of yet another Islamic sect: 

You either enjoying talking about stuff you know nothing about or happen to be a very dishonest individual. That letter - assuming it was actually Maimonides who wrote it - was specifically referring to Shi'ites - who've killed far more Sunnis over 1,000 years than Jews, that were ravaging the Jews of Yemen. And of course, let's completely ignore a violent Jewish Messianic movement that was taking root in Yemen concurrently - because of course its just evil Muslims massacring Jews randomly out of the blue. Maimonides appealed to Salah-al-Din, the Orthodox Muslim leader to handle the mess and save the Jews - but hey that's unimportant to the narrative of random persecution by the generality of Muslims... 




 It is well known that the Quran has a rule that later passages super-cede previous passages. 

You mean naskh (abrogation) in Islamic law? Can you show me where any Muslim scholar has suggested that the prohibition of killing clergy is mansukh? 




 Thought about it for 2 min, and I was just being preposterous and regurgitating somebody else's stupid conspiratorial claim.

The reason that post is at the top and this one is at the bottom is that the members of the sub are collectively pandering imbeciles. 




  It's an endless cycle that needs to stop.

The same could've been said about the 'endless' tit for tat between Muslims and the Crusaders. Nothing is endless.

Thinking that things will get better through violence is mindless nonsense.

Things won't improve through mindless violence like this. But there isn't really a way to organize, or for the occupied people to make hijrah and regroup for the future. They're between a rock and a hard place. 




 I understand where you're coming from, and the knee-jerk reaction to defend against potentially false claims against a minority. But it doesn't look like you've actually looked into this riwayah or its versions for us to really have a meaningful discussion on it instead of going about in loops. This'll be my last post on the topic  - but feel free to look into it further on your own.

But then why does he say   ? Why wouldn't he just say  ? 

That's irrelevant to the fact that its still tantamount to shirk (the guy who's statement I was simply providing evidence for and got dragged into). Qaseem Allah still makes him *The Judge*, even if the interpretation is that he was appointed by Allah to be the Judge. The same way saying that the Aimah are all-hearing and can comprehend all languages, by a miracle of God, still flys in the face of what Monotheism means. A sect of Christians used to believe that God pre-existed but assigned Jesus to create the Universe. Taking His attributes, and reassigning them to intermediaries, even if you're still verbally affirming tawhid is still shirk. Being The Judge on the Day/Creator are some of those particular things exclusive to Him.

And again, you seem to be ignoring the footnote of the source you provided

We must be reading something different, in both footnotes, the editor is affirming that the world is divided amongst those who acknowledge their wilayah and those who reject it...it's not saying that he isn't actively doing the division himself of the people into the places - just explaining what the division is about...

and it's a pretty terrible translation of al-Kafi.

Compared to what? It's the *only* translation into English of this much of al-Kafi...And I'd hardly think somebody who's 'Arabic isn't the best' is in a position to call this translation 'terrible' because (like any translation) there are mistakes.

[source: Al-Mustadarak Ala Al-Sahiheen, volume 3, page 134; footnote says sahih though some Sunni scholars say the chain is weak]

Apologies in advance if I'm coming off pretentious - but here you're conflating **this narration** with completely separate narrations - instead of looking at other versions of this same narration say or even the context I showed of this narration itself - which is leading you to your anachronistic interpretation (that mirrors the Sunni sanitization in Tabaqat Hanabila of a very very short version of this saying that doesn't have the context I provided you from al-Kafi - or any of the other additions beyond the asl). There are other versions of *this* narration on that same exact page of al-Kafi which provide the obvious meaning that I alluded without the apologetic gymnastics you require to sanitize it:       ,**       ** ,    . He's *acting* in that narration, literally doing the determination (). There are tons more versions of these statements with various phrases about how he'll judge in Bihar al Anwar as well...

                      

http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8/1457_%D8%A8%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%86%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D8%AC-%D9%A2%D9%A6/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9_128

Care to explain to me how he's taking the names of the people in Heaven and Hell (and using it) if it isn't him Judging and he's simply a basis for the Judgement done by Allah himself. I don't know how you can get clearer than that on what the narration obviously means... 




  It's just disgusting to see people come to their aid trying to undermine any articles that are critical of ISIS. 

What's disgusting is your mentality. Let's throw away any semblance of critical thinking because questioning an assertion by an obviously biased party is now tantamount to defending the criminals of ISIS. 




 The Almohads were outside of Ahlus Sunnah (Orthodox Muslims - 90% of Muslims) and he did just fine under Salah-ud-Din when his family was in Egypt...to you, there might not be a distinction - but it would be like me accusing Jews of intolerance because of what Abu 'Isa (leader of a Jewish Messianic cult from Isfahan) did. The person before me asserted a culture of intolerance amongst Muslims as a generality. The generality of Muslims are Orthodox/Sunni. There wasn't the kind of rabid antisemitism that exists today before the 1900s amongst Orthodox Muslims and Maimonides' success in his adult life under Orthodox Muslim rule in Orthodox Muslim society is testament to that. 




 Cutting off the heads of the family whose daughter they couldnt rape isnt that surprising.

'I wouldn't be surprised if you did something like this - therefore let's not even question it and just assume you did'

I hope most people don't think like you.

Does the iraqi government really need more propaganda against ISIS? They do a damn fine job of showing how much of a filthy human beings they are.

It appears that producers of the propaganda feel that [they have needed propaganda](http://revolution-news.com/fake-isis-news-triple-verify-graphic-images/) and [such propaganda has been exposed on multiple occassions](http://i100.independent.co.uk/article/claims-isis-buried-women-and-children-alive-should-be-treated-carefully--lJIsWao2Ml).

It's not like the Iraqi govt has any sort of moral high ground demanding that any reasonable person accept anything they say about the conflict w/out question **(NSFL)**. [1](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=602_1404665038)

      = the divider of Allah between heaven and hell, right and
  = the great differentiator?

Your understanding of it means qasim/faruq have effectively the same meaning - so 'Ali is mindlessly repeating "I am the Divider between Heaven and Hell AND I am the Great Divider" - That's the point of the context I provided, Qasim here means (noun) someone who distributes. Not someone who is the basis for a division done by somebody else. [And this is how Shi'ite scholars translated it as well](http://www.al-shia.org/html/eng/books/hadith/al-kafi/part4/part4-ch14.htm) and I'm sure it wouldn't take me all of 20 minutes to find Shi'ite scholars corroborating my plain and obvious reading of that Shi'ite tradition (versus the sanitizing here). 




 My mom heard from an Egyptian once that you believe Ishmael went up to be sacrificed by Abraham, but the Torah says that it was Yitzchak/Isaac. You were taught that also? Did you learn that Isaac antagonized Ishmael also or was it not addressed much, their relationship?

It's actually not very clear in Islam, and it also isn't considered important either (it's not an article of faith unlike for Christians because of certain NT passages). Since neither the Qur'an nor Hadith are clear about it, Muslims relied on Israeliyat (traditions of the Jews in Muslim territories) and these Jews narrated contradictory narrations. Some said Isaac, some said Ismael. Muslim scholars by majority seem to have adopted that Ismael was to be slaughtered. I've heard a case can be made for it being Ismael from the Torah as well unless you consider the Hebrew version of the Torah as absolute and preserved. 




 Doesn't sound like he knew much about his own religion and its reverence for Moses than. 




 Blaming the Jews for widespread antisemitism? That's bold. And baseless. Fuck you with a rusty crowbar.
The earliest recorded act of Arab antisemitism in the modern era was the Damascus Affair in 1840. French monks imported the blood libel to harm the local Jewish population for local Christian gain. Antisemitism is a mind-virus that spreads like wildfire; it's very easy for a population to hate the Other and very tempting for those in power to use scapegoats for their own ends.

The question isn't about the earliest recorded act of antisemitism. The issue here is when "antisemitism among the Islamic community started to flourish". If you want to pretend that antisemitism in the community that brought you Maimonides just came up out of nowhere because Muslim communities just randomly became intolerant and antisemitic for no reason whatsoever out of thin air, that's bold. And baseless. 




 The title of Ali as the distributor of heaven and hell is mentioned in a few Sunni books

Saying "Sunni books" doesn't mean the narration is a Sunni narration, or an authentic narration. Sunni books have quotes from early Shi'ites, Kharijjis, etc. etc. etc. Simply pointing to a gharib hadith in an obscure book isn't the same as these things actually being a part of anybody's aqeeda.

 Kanz ul Ummal

Kanz ul Ummal is a tertiary source, you need to find the asl of the narration to a different book if you want to suggest this is a Sunni belief, or even a truly Sunni tradition.

Tabaqat al-Hanabilah

This explanation of the tradition by Ahmed b. Hanbal, which is sanitizing the obvious meaning of the tradition, is from several hundred years after him and also without a chain. But you're comparing this sanitized Sunni reinterpretation of a likely fabricated Imami Shi'ite tradition (in its origin) that is *indisputably* referring to 'Ali as the Judge on Yawm ul Qiyamah (see the full context in the link):

 :         

http://www.alseraj.net/maktaba/kotob/hadith/kafi1/html/ara/books/al-kafi-1/78.html

and the hadith mentioned by Ibn Hanbal is found in Sahih Muslim: 

There's no dispute surrounding that hadith. The ahadith in question are the ones that support the other guy's claim that Imami Shi'ism supports the idea that 'Ali, and not Allah, is the judge on the Day of Judgement on God's behalf. This is tantamount to shirk as the Qu'ran is pretty clear on Allah directly, and exclusively, being the one you answer to. 




 After all, if God is always separate from creation, how could He draw near to us or us to Him?

I don't know that ought to read it as Him drawing near at all necessary. It's simply a poetic statement about how we should try to draw close to God and we'll be recompensed for it by Him in a way that's disproportionately beneficial to us - as I see it.

that is God doing an action that we are experiencing here in time and space, not in the realm of God. 

Doing an action within Space/Time, versus Him existing bi-dhatihi in Space/Time is different IMO. The fact that He is the One who originated Space/Time through the Big Bang, or what-have-you, already necessitates that He is able to act on Space/Time without being in it. 




 There would be a lot less conflict between us if the Muslim world in general would just accept the existence of Israel and stop inciting against Israel and Jews.

I don't know about this incitement against Jews in the Muslim world. I've been fortunate enough to meet, or know of through others, Jewish communities that thrive in Morroco, Syria and Iran. An incitement against Israel? Sure. But against Jews that have been living in Muslim countries for generations and aren't (at least not overtly) gung-ho on the Israel issue, doesn't seem to generally be an issue.

There would be a lot less conflict between us if the Muslim world in general would just accept the existence of Israel and stop inciting against Israel and Jews.

Nobody in the Muslims world doesn't accept the existence of Israel. It's hard not to accept that there isn't a place called 'Israel' on the map nowadays. If you're saying that you hope Muslims would just cow-tow to this recent geo-political change though and accept the new state of affairs into perpetuity, then you've misunderstood your neighbors. The Crusaders lived in Palestine for generations. They had children, and their children had children and their children's children had children -all before those who refused to live as subjects of Salah al-Din were sent packing. As much as you want to maintain the status quo, and many Muslims want to revert it, only time will tell how the Middle East will look in 50 years. 




 It wasn't until after the crusades that antisemitism among the Islamic community started to flourish.

I don't think its attributable to post-Crusades - I think there's a point in the early 1700s when the more successful Jewish Messianic agitations started and the early 1900s when the first overtly Zionist 'Aliyah's began that led to modern issues. 




 link? 




 But I don't know if those views take them outside the fold of Islam. 

It wouldn't - it might take them out of the jama' if there are some institutionalized ideas/practices aberrant from the jama' - but I don't think its a valid basis for takfir. Deobandis in Pakistan/India tend to be critical of some of these ideas but the foremost sub-continent scholar, Mufti Taqi Usmani wrote a rather [balanced piece](http://www.deoband.org/2010/05/hadith/hadith-commentary/wahdat-al-wujud-wahdat-al-shuhud-and-the-safest-position/) on the topic.

A lot of poets used language that may be considered shirk in common place talk, but they are given the benefit of the doubt (I believe Imam al Ghazali discussed this issue as well) without endorsing any literal understanding of their statements.

The key idea of tawheed seems to be that the Creator and Creation are separate and will always remain separate. Despite being closer to you than your jugular vein, Allah does not actually exist there.

Exactly - its a matter of context. Wahdatul Wujood is based on mindlessly literal interpretations of statements like that (against the norm of the scholarship). There are other traditions which state things like 'God approaches you as you approach him', 'if you walk to God, God will run to you' - where likewise, mindlessly literal interpretations that fly against the general consensus of their reading would lead to the opposite of Wahdatul Wujood, even possibly to outright anthropomorphism. 




 Right - because the Iraqi government (the source of this claim) certainly couldn't have made this up. We all know ISIS is barbaric but the amount of straight up retarded propaganda being put out is ridiculous. 




 Ridiculous concepts like infallibility of aimah may not be shirk, but making 'Ali Maliki yawm ad-din is most definitely shirk.... 




 I'm not saying to walk around toting guns like some of these modern confederacy loving nutjobs. But having *the ability* to defend yourself by arming yourself, under your fourth amendment rights isn't an insane concept to me. Keep spreading honey, but keep a gun in case the bear comes. 




 In LA, New York, Chicago and Seattle - I've seen people sleeping and tweaking out only a few blocks away from high end boutique shops in downtown areas. Yes, it's generally not directly under the boutique stores so you can say the image is an exaggeration in applying it to most 'Western' states - but you're just missing the point than. 




 Part of that is that Judaism, unlike Islam or Christianity, started as the religion of a tribe more than a universal Truth. 
However, Judaism has been a more conversion-centric religion in the past.

This doesn't make sense to me. On the one hand, you mention yourself that ancient Judaism was a proselytizing religion (Khazars, magicians in the court of Pharoah, several passages about how the Temple was intended to invite goyyim etc. are some examples). At the same time, you're suggesting that ancient Judaism was more of a "tribe" than a "universal truth" (i.e. the way it is today). That appears to be a contradiction to me - but maybe you can explain more where you're coming from here? 




 ISIS seems barbaric and heartless.

ISIS leadership is barbaric. Some people do believe in Shariah, but don't take the actions attributed to ISIS as being Shariah. Their most recent apparent execution of a man who converted to Islam before he was taken into captivity isn't even allowed under any interpretation of Orthodox Islamic treatment of POWs for instance.

But then again, you're lumping up ISIS - its a large group of loosely knit together groups. Some of these groups have been responsible for positive things in Iraq and Syria, such as maintaining the safety of Hindu female nurses and returning them to India without a ransom or anything - rebuilding roads, public transportation, court systems, welfare distribution, etc.

My western society seems so much better with much more freedom and justice.

Is it though? [Look around](http://i.imgur.com/k0Cowji.jpg). The amount of destitution, serial homelessness, complete neglect of the mentally ill, depression/suicide, no qualms with commercializing female sexuality (almost exclusively), selling your life away to a 9-5 - drinking yourself retarded to forget on the weekends - and hoping you live long enough to cash in on social security, mass exploitation of your elderly by casino/gambling industries, **Comcast** - it isn't justifiable in countries with GDP that happens to be multiples of GDP of countries with greater levels of polled human contentment around the world. 




 I found it interesting that action fans cared most about directors. But at the same time, I feel like that metric might be a bit skewed by all the people using Google to determine if Uwe Boll directed so they can avoid the film like the plague. 




 It's basically a large info-graphic advertisement for the entertainment industry to adopt more of the professional services Google offers in its Youtube brand. 




 Few corrections. It was there before Mohammed, but after a flood and before he started preaching Islam, he helped the tribes over a conflict of who gets to replace it.

Pilgrims also aren't pointing to it, but they do touch/kiss it. Umar, the second Caliph of the Muslims after Mohammed, reportedly said in front of other Muslims (to the stone), "I know you're a rock and can't benefit and harm anyone, I wouldn't kiss you had I not seen our Prophet kiss you." He was exclaiming that he's carrying on a tradition, out of love for his predecessor and not because he even understood the point behind it. 




 But where's Waldo? 




 The black stone is actually outside of the building structure. 




 Regardless, you're on a list now just fyi :) 




 There are militias all over the country, especially the south, without any popular support. They exist and thrive because they strongly believe in making use of their fourth amendment right. No need to go around killing people, but being armed and able to protect your own (what a militia effectively is) is a positive thing. As a most recent example, compare what happened at Bundy (no violence, just militias taking positions) versus the suffering all around Ferguson. 




 Keep rolling along. Truth is clear from falsehood. 




 Not even an estimate, its just a bullshit number. The Kurds want more foreign aid and intervention, making the situation appear more dire (when its actually improved) is a great way to accomplish that end. 




 Yes, lets pretend the Umayyads dynasties which had such precious Caliphs like Yazid were the epitome of tolerance and generosity

Right - because one anecdotal leader is reflective of the whole. His father's reign was the exact opposite of what you're accusing his of being like, with even Christian annal's reporting on how just he was (see 'Seeing Islam As Others Saw It...' - the extracts from Jon Bar Penkaye). As far as Yazid, would love to see any authentic reports on how he was 'intolerant'. Yazid had at least one Christian adviser (Sarjun) close to him for the short period of time he governed - doesn't come off as terribly intolerant...but I suppose its easier to just make things up?

                              

Wow - He's talking about the divisions between these groups allowing for easy pickings / divide and conquer - from the same passage:        . At-Tusi explicitly helped and became an aide to the invaders - how on earth is al-albani's criticism of disunity and infighting even comparable to outright treason by at-Tusi in your mind?

Or even Ibn Abi al-Hadeed stated in Sharh Nahaj al-Balagha, Volume 8 page 237:

Right...Because a reference to a late religious commentary by a Mutazili Shi'ite scholar, on a Shi'ite religious book - that has no asl for half the narrations it contains with a sanad in any reputable religious text of Sunnis or Shi'ites - is a great basis for **a historical claim**...

Finally, if At-Tusi was such an evil man as per this fairy-tale of an allegation, ibn Khaldun wouldn't have ever studied at-Tusi's famous works.

Brilliant logic. If you don't like a person, you'll refuse to benefit from their knowledge. I hope it works out for you - but historically, that's not how Sunni scholars operated. Every book of history and ahadith has plenty of reports from non-Sunnis, even political opponents like Khawwarij. Orthodox scholarship's openness to benefit from the information recorded, even by political opponents isn't an indictment of them or an exoneration of the man in question for what he did to Baghdad. 




  I don't think things are simple as making their own laws, issues about leadership (which started this) will arise, and it seems like one group will try to dominate the other, as seems to be the case historically. 

I agree - it won't solve the succession problem, but it eliminates tensions that arise in modern systems. In spite of any violence under the Ottoman's over power, there was nothing like the random sectarian intra-religious violence in former Ottoman regions today. I don't think that style of decentralization is impossible in modern times either - the Ottoman's fell like 100 years ago. That's a lot of time for you and me, but in the grand scheme of things, their collapse was pretty modern and they seemed to be doing just 

The fact of the matter is that Islam doesn't seem to be a uniting force at the moment, and with all the bad blood between Sunnis and Shias

I'd argue the opposite. Sunnis today are more tolerant of one another than ever in history after all four of the madhahib had become well-established. You don't get Hanafis beefing with Shafi'is for the most part and so on. You have disagreements, but they're dealt with in populist munazaras, not out in the street with fists or guns. There were certain points in time when there used to be riots about these issues. Sunnis and Ithna Ashari Shi'ites + Alawis may not be close - but that's 90% of people who call themselves Muslim vs 9%. Likewise, Sunnis and Ibadis have gotten closer than ever in history in modern times as well. We keep seeing the results of one or two conflicts blasting our news station that paint a much bleaker picture, IMO. 




 I didn't suggest that 'sectarianism' is inherent in the "shariah of Allah". Just that the peachy view you suggested of Sunni-Shi'ite relations isn't as close to reality as you'd probably like.

People can turn sects into political groups or tribes and use them as an excuse to kill each other.

The issue here is that Ithna Ashari Shi'ism, as a sect, is inherently a political group that vyes with any existing system. Especially post Safavid Ithna Ashari Shi'ism, most especially modern Usooli Ithna Ashari Shi'ism after Khomayni's introduction of waliyat-ul-faqih in Shi'ism, replacing the need for somebody to pretend to be a Shi'ite Mahdi to establish political dominion.

Yes, people can manipulate religions for power politics - and yada yada yada - but Sunni religious texts don't promote competition with existing power, even if the ruler isn't a jolly fellow, as long as the ruler is Muslim. Sunni political quietism even allowed praying behind Khawwarij that took over territories. Or the non-violent responses of people like Ahmed b. Hanbal to 'heretical' ideas being imposed by the Amir of his time. 




 Everyone wants to end bloodshed, which is why the popular solution to this sectarianism seems to be secularism.

Dunno how popular that solution is, but it isn't always a working solution. After the Ottomon's, who ruled with some sort of Islamic law and allowed parties paying jizya to rule according to their own laws, we had secularism across much of their former territories. It only gave rise to violence along ethnic, religious and sectarian lines - along with newer, violence along ideological lines. Adding more abstractions and calling people to them only makes the violence worse, imo. 




 Sunnis and shi'ites have been living side by side for hundreds of years. 
There have been problems, but up until modern times...

What are you smoking? Shi'ite sects created their own states and fought wars with the major Caliphates since the inception of Imami Shi'ism. From the Fatimids, to the Hashashins to the Safavids (just to list the more successful examples). At-Tusi, one of the major mashaykh of modern Ithna Ashari Shi'ism and an author of several works basically personally escorted the Mongol invaders into Baghdad to rape, pillage and raze the centre of the Muslim world. 




 The Daily Mail. /R/WorldNews' favorite bullshit tabloid. 




 None of these got shit on Fox news. 




 If you can't beat them, let them beat themselves up.

Several red states have been beating themselves up economically. They still vote Republican. Because Jesus.

Same way blue states have been eating their own shit for ages. They still vote Democrat. Because butt-secks. 




 What's the point? Our senators [will just filibuster him](http://electronicintifada.net/blogs/rania-khalek/us-senator-filibusters-live-coverage-powerful-palestinian-testimonies). Informed democracy and all. 




 No, they are most def not lol. And also, how many republican Jews do u know?

Koch is a pretty Jewish last name...and being Jewish doesn't mean. Nice ignorant generalization of Jews as some sort of monolithic entity.

but as other commenters point out, that's a pretty easy citizenship to obtain

Uh ya...if you've got at least one Jewish grand-parent, easy as pie.... 




 The title is a blatant rip-off of the Vice video from a while back.

I wonder where they're selling their oil though - as it looks like the entire thing is built on their take-over of Syrian production. 




 Their economy seems to be entirely based on black market oil. Who's buying their oil? 




 Of course the eventual demise of the Zionist entity in the Middle East is approaching, sooner rather than later.

Every Arab country with a military capable of actually taking on Israel has been thrown into chaos. Not so sure about your take on this. 




 Ah - gotcha. Executions don't make for exciting footage. IMO, its not much different from an explosion though. Actually, a far more humanizing reminder of why we naturally are repulsed by war. 




 What do you expect? When you remove people's ability to express themselves democratically, all you get is bloodshed. 




 but I just can't take actually watching these videos anymore.

Really? I've said it once and I'll say it again - the production value these guys are putting out is amazing. I've watched a lot of videos over the years put out by different governments to propogandize their military achievements. What's being produced by these non-state actors is some of the best by far.

This one is just a long propaganda clip with a bunch of action (executions, drive-bys, battles, explosions) with a bunch of Arabic anasheed in the background. It starts by encouraging people to oppose 'oppression' and then breaks into the various clips of their activities in the region as well as some posing (going into sujood near large explosions). Very well-edited, practically professionally. They have explosions for instance which if you got a keen eye, you'll know they threw into the video even though they didn't connect. They also use great effects. Around the middle of the film they begin their standard preaching and what-not (the boring stuff) but get right back into the combat footage after a few min.

Edit: Also noticed that whereas with ISIS videos and the like, a lot of the fighters are obviously older men. This video - they're all kids. Almost everyone in the video is under 25. The video is very tailored to the kids without jobs who likely lost family members or friends during the Sisi coup. 




 The results of protracted, perpetual war. Your enemy improvises and becomes more adept. 




 Can you post the translation directly here (or in a self-post)? 




 People who don't understand how the blockchain works believe bitcoin provides true anonymity (in spite of the premise being that it runs on a public ledger). Anonymity is key to criminal and terrorist organizations. 




 Which is why they'll have average citizens of IS trade in their common currencies. They'll use that currency as needed, but the cities under them will conduct commerce with the new coinage. If this reporting is accurate  




 Probably no punishment, but you can imagine they'd issue an edict that everybody needs to transfer their common floating currencies in exchange for ISIS dinars. They'd implement it the same the United States did when each of them moved away from gold and average citizens were robbed under threat of imprisonment.

ISIS is also largely a welfare 'government' - so there wouldn't be too much seizing necessary to boot. 




 They have plenty of territories under their control. Trade functions in literally the same way as it does in any other place in Syria/Iraq. People still work in local industry, or they join militias for money, and they participate in local markets (buying food, books, etc.) 




 I don't think it's the mayor. Quality mainstream journalism is at an all time low. 




 Also expected that they seize a lot of gold jewelry from men, it being haram and all.

Men wearing gold in the non-upper classes of the Arab world isn't as popular as it is in the ghettos of America. I doubt they would have much to seize. 




 They've designed a Caliphate in the modern age with zero air power, and attracted some of the best-equipped militaries around the world to fight a proxy war against them. I don't think they'll let a little bit of 'lack of preperation' or 'not enough metal' get in the way of their delusions. 




 Guy's got huge balls but no brain (pun intended) 




 The whole point of getting what will soon be a rare collectible piece is to keep it in mint condition. You melt it down, and that value is gone. 




 Video is removed - no mirror? 




 They should be - this is a pretty big step for violent non-state actors, one of unprecedented ingenuity. 




 isis apologist??? hhhhhhh. I just don't believe in the black-and-white good-and-evil story tale of world history and current events...

As you say yourself, there are people like yourself who 'as bad as isis is, we are worse' - that's all I suggested. 




 Taliban eradicated it because they had a hold of power. When they came under attack they needed a quick and easy supply of money, and thus they re-planted the opium fields again. 

You sound like you're insinuating that NATO is behind the increase in opium cultivation, and that is complete BS. You belong in /r/conspiracy if that is the case. 

Except...that you're full of it. Even after the invasion, they had prohibited opium production whereas [NATO was explicitly allowing it](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6589113.stm). In fact - NATO was advertising itself to the common man under that EXACT premise (we allow you to grow opium - Taliban doesn't). You are categorically wrong - that article is from *well* after the invasion while opium production was beginning to rise again. 




 You can't take one case to be representative of the whole given that Daesh has a very autonomous structure. 




 Not to mention that Israel has intermittently launched strikes against SAA hardware at various points in time, including during the recent rebellion. 




 yes i know i have issues.

You absolutely do. 




 What you are supporting is that Iraqis should stoop down to the level of these barbaric Daesh dogs.

Stoop down? No doubt Daesh are barbaric, but I don't know of one credible assertion of torture by them. The closest thing to torture that they've provable done would be their **allowing** Rafah citizens to beat Syrian soldiers to death. They kill their captives and don't give the 'right of repentance' to Shi'ite prisoners - sure. But that's not the same as torture. Whereas Shi'ite militias have been torturing Sunni captives to death since the removal of Saddam:

[The Independent 2005](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/britishtrained-police-in-iraq-killed-prisoners-with-drills-516158.html)
[Amnesty 2013](http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/iraq-torture-2013-06-28)

And mind you, this isn't the selective torture that Saddam or the United States have been accused of for gathering intel. This is pure sadism, they were literally torturing men to death with one military objective over the last several years. You don't turn a majority Sunni city (like Baghdad) into a majority Shi'ite one without some persuasive techniques. ISIS didn't gain this clout in a vaccum, there's plenty of context. If you followed Golden Brigade on Facebook prior to our recent entry into that country (that's a US elite trained group within the Iraqi army) - you would've seen videos (NSFW) [like this](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=6f2_1404371007) proudly posted on their page.

We might hear about the crimes of one side more often, but if you critically look at the evidence, its a bit hard to establish moral high ground for any particular side. 




 The big losers from this will be the Palestinians and rioting Israeli-Arabs.

Maybe - but there will be **no winners**. None. 




 They kill POWs, as well as torture them and desecrate corpses. Daish doesn't have some kind of monopoly on executing POWs. Daesh manages to capture and kill more in a single sitting **and** brag about it in high-production value propaganda videos. Doesn't mean army/Shi'ite militias don't do it - in fact, I've got quite the depressing collection of videos to the contrary. 




 These guys rival Daesh in production quality 




 It's a conspiracy theory about the video. A pretty shitty one if you know anything about guns or camera phones. But skepticism is always a step in the right direction so I guess this may be a good thing in a way. 




 Because they're evil and they hate Jews for no reason. 




 Can someone explain why Kobane matters to **anybody** militarily? Minus all the so-called symbolic bs... 




 Best part is, we have to assume they can't use the internet from within Syria. Somebody had to get the video to Turkey/Lebanon to upload. And somehow they still pull off with better video editing and live reporting than the white house. 




 Can't believe this didn't hit front page - in light of everything recently.. 




 Washingtonian here, and local history buff. Seattle grew prominent later on in the game. Olympia however was our original primary city of port commerce. In the mid-1800s when it became the capital, **everybody** thought it would be the center of the state given its than-existing role and its exponential rate of growth. It wasn't a good 30+ years later when we were about to join the union that different cities did vye for the title. 




 Yezidis are both an ethnicity of Kurds and also a religion that often get conflated (think Jews), especially recently. This family is Muslim.

It's really strange (for me) to be hearing about all the alleged persecution of "Satanic Yazidis" of late since I know for a fact that Mandeans and Yazidis are almost non-existent religions. But we can't play the genocide card to justify more ground troops unless we can sell a plausible story - and Muslim extremists being harsh against an obscure religion sounds about right for what we need. 




 Well, I'm never making it to the ruling class. Is there a waitlist for the roving marauders? 




 Let's hope people confront their foolishness without being run over. 




 A lot of people have lost friends and family members in this war. You can expect the children growing up in this conflict to be affected by it. 




 What's odd is that every piece of media that comes from that organization does precisely that. Everything they put out seems to help justify foreign presence. 




  One of the seven deadly sins is vengence/wrath...is this true in Islam?

Vengence is not a sin in Islam.

Wrath is also not, in and of itself, a sin. Islam differentiates between thoughts and actions. A "bad" thought isn't a sin. Acting on a "bad" thought is. Having a "bad" thought, and not acting on it is actually good deed. 




  Something like revenge might have a neutral value - it is not wrong, but it is not exactly righteous either.

You're right - and the religion treats foregoing permissible revenge as being a 'good deed' 




 CONGRATS! Don't care what anyone says, if you got the gall to come out while a public official, you earn a lot of my respect. That could be political suicide, even in a liberal society because y'know, people care about shit like that. 

Depends on where you're located. In Seattle, the fact that the mayor was all about the butt secks is what allowed him to capitalize on voters. He than went on to repeal police reform, destroy any chance of municipal internet, diminish the effects of the $15/hr wage reform campaign - and generally every single thing he could possibly do that his progressive voters would never have anticipated. 









 The Iraqi army and Iraqi mobs also do the same thing. Countless videos, of explicit torture, using corpses as decals and dragging corpses through the street. Nothing in this video is unique to just ISIS or the Syrian rebels. Minus the production value on the video - that's somethiing only ISIS can pull off. 




 Fines disproportionately affect the poor. Corporal punishment is comparatively equitable... 




 Excuse me to break you, but there's now for a first time ever an actual Islamic terrorist country

The US said the same thing when Iran popped up. And when the Taliban popped up in Afghanistan. The British government was saying the same thing about what would become the Saudi Kingdom. It's not the "first time ever" - so-called "Islamic" states have long existed and Western powers have always considered them "terrorist" states.

a stated ambition to conquer no less but the entire world

Their stated ambition is to have a borderless state - capable of expansionism (as in, the sort of states that existed not even 100 years ago all over the world). So - at worst - they're people who hypothesize about perpetual war but have never experienced it. Since it's inception, the US has ACTUALLY been perpetually in conflict - not just in theory - but in **actuality**. You want to focus on scary international politics? Check your backyard. 




 Were my words to complex for you?

too* 




  Nobody else here is mentioning this? Y'all need to step up your game. This is what happens when the neo-nazis chase off all the intelligent people.

It makes more sense that they conspired to make a profit than that there was an ulterior motive with a conspiracy to eliminate particular negative genetic traits... 




 You rock. 




 The internet: where everyone makes 6 figures and has a 12 inch cock. 




 Mission Accomplished! 




 ~~This~~ war is so fucked up.

In previous 'good' wars, we justified mass civilian casualties from firebombings like Dresden to nuclear attacks against civilian populations. This war is only as bad as it is because its happening in our lifetimes. 




 By that logic, you can't blame ISIS or FSA for anything either. Individual units that gave their bayah to their leader, or are part of FSA, act relatively independently (with the exception of taking orders on locations to post for the former). 




 I don't see how you guys can conflate one anecdotal alleged assault on a guy with "OMG Turks, in general, support ISIS". It's just bad logic. 




 Sounds like your average nationalist, nothing special... 




 Nah, it's not that bad. These are just corpses. Iraqi Military Shi'ites burned alive followers of Sarkhi and used to document torture of alleged ISIS members. Here are some of the videos I've posted previously (it's part of the narrative that isn't going to be covered in typical media reports):

  People shit on the floor in my store about once a week

The fuck - what city is this? 




 I didn't say Orthodoxy encourages secularism. The leader still upholds religious law. He's just not a source for jurisprudence. His opinion has value in that he can declare wars and what-not, but he doesn't tell you how to pray for instance.

As for ISIS, there's plenty of evidence of beheadings/mass executions - don't think I've seen anything verified suggesting they torture people. 




  Just out of interest, if he ever became legit, as a caliph, he is like the pope, so surely he would be refered to as "His Holiness Abu Bakr al Baghadadi"

No. In Orthodox Islam, the leader of the state isn't also (necessarily) your spiritual leader. 




 Let's be *a little rational here*. The source for this is quoting the Iraqi Ministry of Human Rights on a statement allegedly made by al-Baghdadi. If that doesn't give you pause before blindly swallowing the claim...

Also - burning corpses and living people isn't IS modus operandi, barbaric as they are. It's more something a group we support, like the Golden Brigade from [the Iraqi Army is known to do.](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=602_1404665038) **NSFW** 




 No. Dave Firth isn't the idiot. You are for believing an anonymous source from the Daily Mail... 




 And to boot, the claim about sectarian motive was purportedly made by his anonymous friend. There is no result from the investigation yet - just a bullshit editorialized headline. 




 This is the daily mail, not a particularly reputable rag. There are literally *no* known facts yet. The claim that it was even a sectarian attack is entirely based on the purported statement of the man's friend. 




  These elections undermine the agreement 

But they don't break the agreement right? Russia with the technical win. 




 Woah woah woah, don't be rational here. We're trying to have an anti-Russian circle-jerk and you just want to ruin the fun

3--- 3--- 3--- 




 Yep, but certainly not as above board and legit as post war elections in Iraq and Afghanistan while those nations were still occupied, right? 




 Not Sunnis in general - looks like only those Sunnis who align themselves *against IS* while in territory *controlled by IS* suffer. Minus the level of brutality and summary nature of their punishments, it's not much different than aligning yourself against the government of any region you live in. Just a generally unwise thing to do, seeing as how everyone killed was [Sahwa or with the Iraqi govt apparatus](http://www.ibtimes.co.in/why-did-islamic-state-counter-terrorism-implementation-task-force-execute-over-300-sunni-albu-612737)
 




 Don't question the repeated stories of 10-20 guys overpowering and executing hundreds. Over and over. 




 Yep - unbeatable KDR 




 The numbers sound a bit huge. These guys are really good at rounding up 100s of opponents at a time and just dumping on em. 




 There are **literally** over a hundred groups operating in the region. Even the major buzz-words like FSA, Shi'ite Militias, ISIS, are actually conglomerates of other smaller independent groups.

 People said the same thing about the fact that Iran was on the same side as the US during the last 2 wars. On many, many occasions. They've just slipped our national consciousness. Iran seems to keep finding itself beside the US, a country the Islamic Republic's founder described as the Great Satan while Iran was part of the Axis of Evil in Bush-era rhetoric. As an example, here's an instance Iran's little known role in [Afghanistan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_uprising_in_Herat). But American journalists don't tend to have long term memory, and that memory doesn't shape national narrative the way contemporary soundbites do in any case. Everybody but us, and some of our allies, is caricatured as a monolithic entity - our stated 'enemies' in particular being solely ideologically driven and pragmatic. So naturally in a year, Iran will again be on the same side and we'll again be bewildered.

 but lets not pretend that the claim doesn't have at least some validity.

It would have some validity if there was some doubt as to whether this was torture or not. There isn't. This was torture. This is not a matter of connotation and whether to call a fat guy a 'heavy set man' or 'obese'/'fat'. 




 Well the internet IS a series of tubes, so...

So basically, the internet is a bunch of tubes. YouTube, PornTube, YouPorn. Basically the internet is porn. 




 It's sounding about right in other places as well. Even if you don't give up, you're up against lobbies with millions of dollars and brain-dead imbeciles that outnumber you and who can be tricked to vote against their own self-interest. The system is just so broken all around... 




 OP is a account meant to appear like a virulent anti-semite. I'm all for calling out Israeli transgressions or the pondering the reasonable conspiracy theory - but this guys post history shows that's not what he's about. If you remember bipolarbear0, you won't support people like OP even when they post good material. 



















 EDIT : sheesh, atleast tell me why you are downvoting 

Downvoted for providing facts that disprove an aspect of the circle-jerk. 




 Girl marrying outside is considered apostasy in Islam and apostasy is punishable by death.

False - its not apostasy. Its considered adultery since the marriage is illegal. The punishment, in Islamic law, for the girl is 100 or so lashes if she's witnessed by four witnesses having sex with the man. You don't need to editorialize what went down with false claims to make it seem more wrong than it already is... 




 Which is the exact purpose of OPs account 









 Read the article - it gets worse. It appears grand juries have been held for 160,000+ civilian trials while only ~80 grand juries were held for cop crime cases. 




 Thank you - I'll explore more in that direction. I was limited by the data set since the USGS set completely ignores non-US quakes of these lower magnitudes if they aren't felt in 2010 onwards. 




 I appreciate the info!

 If it is true, if crimes were committed, then it is time to reorganize the intelegence structure and allow prosecution of those responsible.

 I was tinkering with some data here (for fun):

http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqarchives/year/eqstats.php

Note that I'm aware that I'm looking at data for 23 years of a planet much much older than that so the sample size isn't even great.

Based on the number of global Earthquakes in 3 categories (magnitude 4.0+, 5.0+ and 6.0+), can we say though that there will likely be more of these noticeable Earthquakes over the next 10 years? Statistics is more of my strong suit than seismology - is this question not even valid (are past trends of Earthquakes not predictive of future events)? 

I also noticed that there seems to have been a substantial jump in the number of 4.0+ recorded Earthquakes from before 1994 to after 1994. This is in spite of the fact that ("Starting in January 2009, the USGS National Earthquake Information Center no longer locates earthquakes smaller than magnitude 4.5 outside the United States, unless we receive specific information that the earthquake was felt or caused damage."). Is this because we're using better tools now, are detecting in more places, or has there legitimately been more Earthquakes after that point consistently? 




 You've got a badger, you tell us. 




 They're not saving them out of humanity. Unlike the idiots at ISIS, they understand that captured enemies provide intel... 




 That's true, but there isn't any video or statement from their group that they're actually using the kids to fight. They're training the kids, sure, but its not much different than videos that previously surfaced of Shi'ite children in camo doing the same thing. Or white boys taking their kids out to play paintball in full camo with Osama bin Laden shooting targets. 




 ITT: The same people who criticized IS for executing Shi'ite enemy combatants defending the same exact behavior by Shi'ite Militias. 




 I like that you guys can take trolling w/ a sense of humor! 




 You seem to have good knowledge. Does this issue not interest you? I will try to Google and see if some scholars have commented on this marriage and what the views are of the various schools of thoughts on how this marriage happened, and if it happened a certain way, is it permissible for Muslims today to emulate it since it is Sunnah. 

I just know a few things - this issue doesn't particularly interest me. If the Prophet did something, and it was not exclusively for him, or it was not something initially permissible that was later abrogated to make it impermissible, than it would be good to go. But that's where fiqh comes in, along with tons of context/research.

In this case, I don't know that this nikah procedure actually went down the way OP said. From my understanding, the majority opinion in all four madhahib have witness requirements. My understanding is that witnessing is also required in the other mainstream sects (Ibadiyya and Shi'a Zaydiyya). I think the only group that allows marriage without witnesses as a majority would be Shi'a Ithna Ashariyyah (but I've never even seen a 12er quoting this story as proof for the belief). 

So for most fuqaha across the board - they clearly aren't giving credence to the riwayah OP mentioned. I can also completely understand why a Muslim man in the first 300 years would've concocted a riwayah like that since it would tend towards legitimizing adultry. All you have to do is secretly say "we're married" and you can sleep together, with none of the formalities, protection and restrictions of a proper nikah. If you get the woman pregnant, you can deny that you were ever married or did anything (no witnesses), which nullifies the principle of legal protection.  




 Are they issuing camera tickets for HOV violations or anything like that? 




 Yes. It says, [15/9](http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=15 verse=9) - quite explicitly, "Lo! We, even We, reveal the Reminder, and lo! We verily are its Guardian." I.E. God protects it (albeit through human agency of what Muslims consider the best generation of mankind, the Companions of the Prophet). 




 Hey guys,

I'm gonna be up in Seattle for a while and I'll be using their 520 toll bridge. Has anybody else gone up there? Does their bridge recognize our plates? Do you get the bills in the mail? And if that is the case - is there a better way to pre-pay?

Thanks! 




 I don't know enough about the topic to comment - I was clarifying your high-level criticism of Ibn Kathir's criticism of some earlier reports in deference to other early reports / lack of reports. If you can provide me with the relevant athar, I can help validate it - but that's about it for this issue. 




 I dunno bout you but I lol'ed 




 What motivation would the early scholars have to fabricate a story like this about Allah's Apostle? Wouldn't the claims of earlier scholars hold more weight than the likes of Ibn Khatir, who were born a long time after the life of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)? 

Earlier scholars didn't fabricate stories - that's completely simplifying the issue. The issue is one of how they got their information. People like Ibn Ishaq for instance didn't have any trouble gathering stories from individuals who weren't particularly reputable in the field, and from non-Muslims. He also often failed to provide colophons. The end result? Some recorded stories without sanad that may even have found their way to later collections and aren't true, are likely not even recorded by Muslims. Early Muslim scholars don't have a motivation to fabricate stories, but when some of these historians failed to be rigorous in how they collated material, we're naturally going to get conflicting stories - some of which don't line up with those gathered from more reputable sources.

Ibn Kathir btw is not a primary source. He's not providing new information. He's literally combing through the reports by the early historians and pointing out which ones are more likely true than not. Which ones are more likely untrue than not. 




 Okay - fair enough, thank you 




 Happy to answer your question - I'd appreciate if you would now would care to provide some elucidation on mine as to how your group deals with the different Qira'at? Particularly, my question: In this qira'a, the only meaning is 'last'. Unlike the other Qira'at, it can't be construed as 'seal'. If all of the Qira'at that have tawattur are valid, then by extension, 'last' is the meaning implied in all of them. **So you're accepting that this Qira'a is a valid Qira'a of the Qur'an and that the word does mean (not simply 'can' - but does mean) last?**

Firstly let me ask you this, according to your belief who will be the last prophet present on earth? Jesus or Muhammad (sa)? If it is Jesus (and we know it is) then how do you reconcile this with the Qirat last...The point I am making is if you believe in the verse as 'Last of the prophets' in every sense, then there can be no Jesus to return.

Jesus will be last on Earth. There's no resolution  needed imo .. since the ayah isn't about who the last Nabi to walk on Earth is.

The point you're making can only be made by interpolating the ayah to read something like 'khatim al anbiyya **fi dunya**' (last of the Prophets in Earth). The verse doesn't say that - it simply says, "last of the Prophets". Pretty much every early sect believes Jesus is alive and was alive (Ahlus Sunnah, Shi'a Ithna Ashariyya, Shi'a Zaydiyya, (Kharijji) Ibadiyya) - ergo he was Nabi while the Prophet was Nabi, so your analogy is wholly a strawman. Since the vast majority believes Jesus is alive, it follows that your analogy should read more like the one I provided: Man A of the Letters family has a son B, and no other children. Son B dies without having any children. Man A lives well after his son. **The last member of the Letters family was therefore A, not B, according to you?**

You don't get the desired results by analogy of what we actually believe that you would with your analogy (which doesn't fit the situation as you add additional clauses).

The verse doesn't say 'last person to *become* a prophet'.

If I say you're the last person in a family, do I need to explicitly say you're the last person to be given birth to? Or will 99% of people understand that to mean you were the last person to join that family (to be born into it) by the obvious rendering of the statement?

 I just want to add that so you don't think all I have got is one argument.

I'm sure you have other reasons to believe what you do. That's fine - I'm here though to understand specifically this topic. There are different Qira'at, how do you resolve that the ayah literally reads 'last' in one qira'a - which implies that it means 'last' in all the other Qira'a.

We don't believe this about Ahmad either so it is not relevant. 

It isn't relevant in terms of what you believe, but it is directly relevant to the analogy you presented. Your analogy would require Sunnis to believe either (a) Jesus ceased to be a Nabi at ascension or (b) he will return with new wahi to displace old wahi. Neither of which Sunnis believe, making your analogy inapplicable. 




 However, if in the future somebody declares a physical war against Islam then the Muslims

So essentially, fighting does not become permissible in your religion until somebody explicitly says "I declare war on Islam"? If they invade your country without saying that and decimate your family - defending yourself against them is not jihad than? 




 I guess it would still be parthenogenesis, but I'm thinking about species that where the female gave birth to males - so I don't see how that would be literally a clone? 




 Okay - thanks for the clarification. 




 I don't think the colonel is self-proclaiming that he's a "truly great Muslim" - I'm sure if you guys talked directly to each other, he's a fine guy. Just very Pakistani in his way of delivering a pov :) 




 Ahmadi leaders said fighting against the British occupation in India was not jihad, because the British largely offered freedom of religion to Muslims...

I appreciate the historical information - but I'm pretty sure Ahmadis believe there's a monopoly on jihad by the Amir of Ahmedis (or the amir of w/e subsect you belong to) so by extension, any jihad that the Ahmadi amir hasn't legitimized is a false jihad. Correct? 




 [Sources of Waswaas and Accountability](http://islamqa.info/en/39684) 




 You didn't answer my question regarding this - I want to know how you guys deal with the Qira'at and I'd appreciate an answer if you're knowledgeable enough about your religion to provide me with one: In this qira'a, the only meaning is 'last'. Unlike the other Qira'at, it can't be construed as 'seal'. If all of the Qira'at that have tawattur are valid, then by extension, 'last' is the meaning implied in all of them. **So you're accepting that this Qira'a is a valid Qira'a of the Qur'an and that the word does mean (not simply 'can' - but does mean) last?**

That's a completely irrelevant argument because you have already begun with the premise that Z is last (because we already know it is last in the alphabet). 

Reworded just for you: Man A of the Letters family has a son B, and no other children. Son B dies without having any children. Man A lives well after his son. **The last member of the Letters family was therefore A, not B, according to you?**

There is a room, let's call it earth. J enters the room. J leaves the room. M enters the room. M leaves the room, never to return. J reenters the room. Who was the last person in the room, subject M or J?

Your analogy doesn't work - nubuwwah isn't about walking around in a room or on Earth. Nubuwwah is about receiving wahi. The statement from the Qur'an is that Muhammad is 'khatim al anbiyyah' (the last (khatim) of the (al) [people who] receive wahi (anbiyyah)). Are you saying that Sunnis believe 'Isa will come with new wahi that will displace the recorded wahi of Muhammad? If so, do you have evidence to support the assertion? Also - are you saying that though Jesus is alive, nubuwwah was lifted from him and he ceased to be a nabi while he's alive in Heaven (another logical requirement of your analogy)?

Muhammad also left the world during Isra and Miraj (or do you guys believe something else about that too?). During the night he left, people would've died who hadn't accepted Islam. Since Muhammad was not on this Earth, there was no Prophet on the Earth, so it was a period of fatrah. Will the people who died on kufr that night be held according to Islam or according to the people of fatrah - since per you, absence of a nabi on Earth is the absence of nubuwwah for that Nabi? Did Muhammad cease to be a Nabi for the night of Isra and Miraj? 




 We accept the word can mean last.

In this qira'a, the only meaning is 'last'. Unlike the other Qira'at, it can't be construed as 'seal'. If all of the Qira'at that have tawattur are valid, then by extension, 'last' is the meaning implied in all of them. So you're accepting that this Qira'a is a valid Qira'a of the Qur'an and that the word **does** mean (not simply 'can' - but does mean) last?

Bear in mind, Sunnis also believe Jesus will return. So they believe another prophet will come. Our belief breaks the seal of prophethood not even an iota more than the Sunni belief. In fact, if anything it is the Sunni belief which breaks the seal.

Man Y of the Alphabet family has a son Z, and no other children. Son Z dies without having any children. Man Y lives well after his son. The last member of the Alphabet family was therefore Y, not Z, according to you? When you draw a genealogical tree, you put Y after Z? Sounds like logical/linguistic gymnastics to me, but if that satisfies you and you're honest with yourself in saying that, then we're obviously at an impasse. 




 A rich person of the time of Abu Jafar As Sadiq sent his slave to ask him about the pleasure of finger to the woman. Abu Jafar replied and said it is permissible as long as you are using your own body parts and the woman allows it. In other words you cannot use any other tools to give pleasure to her. He was an old man so the young woman wasn't satisfied from him so he improvised. 

Source? [To clarify - do you know the primary source of the narration?] 




 You do realize that 99% of Ahmadis aren't on Reddit and that I didn't say it was 99% of Ahmadis? I simply asked a question... 




 He's saying that this Qira'a has **khatim** not khatam, which leaves no room for ambiguity. His point is that in this Qira'a there is no "alternative meaning". Is your resolution of the issue to just reject the Qira'a (which also has tawattur) or did you just misunderstand his argument? 




 They're entitled to their view so **we just made our own separate sub and myself and most the guys just keep away from here** to avoid all the arguments and creating discord.

Than what's with the spam bots that Ahmadi spam bots that hit people up by PM... 




 They're a group who believes Jesus went to India, that there was a new Prophet and that fighting against British occupation over India (when the religion was created) was conveniently a sin. 




 Aisha was never a slave. She was the daughter of Abu Bakr, a free man. 




 repressive religion represses sex

By providing boundaries and a legal process in the event that a partnership doesn't work out? Is it repressive to allow something only in the confines of a contract that has weight in a court vs allowing everybody to fuck around willy nilly and then footing the bill for their abortions, orphaned children, psychological trauma, STDs, non-working/unskilled partners and all the other results of the 'sexual freedom' direction your society is moving towards? 

Social conservatism, religious or not, doesn't exactly require religion to back it up - and its pretty strongly supported in many countries where religion isn't even as dominant anymore (China, Russia, etc.) 




  Because it's social justice. When we let people run amok, we're partially responsible for letting it happen.

The Prophet explicitly said He was not responsible *even for Muslims* living outside of his dominion. If you want to spread something to non-Muslim societies, focus on tawheed. Spreading rules/regulations is a distant second in terms of importance. 




 It would refer specifically to the Muslim community where Islam is dominant. Non-Muslim society, and minority communities in Western countries aren't what's being talked about in these sort of traditions - otherwise, as you mentioned, even in the Prophet's time, you'll run into that having been the case in many parts of the World. 




 Good luck getting that labeled as a 'terror attack' and reaching front page on any of the news subs unlike the attacks by the Palestinians. 




 I find it interesting that we look for explanations beyond the obvious for stuff like Sulayman talking to ants, Mary having a virgin birth, Isra and Miraj - at a time, when science has shown many of these things literally happening. Scientists have found ways to communicate with certain ant colonies. We've observed rare virgin births in animal species. And we can now travel at the speeds necessary to have completed Isra and Miraj. And yet, Muslims seem to have become more, rather than less, skeptical about these things being possible in the past. 




 feminism and queer studies and transgenderism 

Why? Queer/transgender studies don't always result in what the LGBTQ lobbiests want to hear (see basically anything out of John's Hopkins for instance). But we need this information to address real issues that these people experience. Simply prohibiting castration/homosexuality and ignoring isn't enough in a time when these things are becoming widely accepted, and you can't understand these issues until you talk to the people experiencing them. 




 /r/worldnews isn't representative of Reddit imo. It's a very popular sub that even the Google feeds pick up. If anything, that sub is subject likely to be [more subject to shilling](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks) than any other sub on the entire site. Take that, coupled with the fact that people who frequent the sub are barraged with negative anecdotal international stories and simple people turn anecdote into statistics. 




 Yup. There is one. That Aisha was much older than is widely presumed. Several academic scholars have questioned the veracity of the claim. 

I don't know how an "academic scholar" would question the veracity of that claim, if by academic you mean a Western Historian. The argument of "truth of embarrassment" is a pretty established historical method for verifying statements (essentially that if a community is embarrassed or needs to engage in polemic about a saying it produced - that saying is true since the originator wouldn't fabricate something embarrassing/attackable about his own community/self). It's a bit of an anachronism for this topic though since Aisha's age wasn't even part of anti-Islamic polemic until modern times. Early polemic was actually critical about Muhammad's marriage to Zaynab - I'd be legitimately surprised if you can find any pre-20th century polemical criticism of Aisha's age of marriage.

I find it hard to believe that marrying a 9 year old at any point was acceptable.

Than you've got a very short term understanding of history. The very first thing OP said was "the tu quoque fallacy (pointing out that other people did it too)" - it's because there are countless examples of people in the past marrying at much younger ages than us. Arbitrary ages (18 in America, 16 in Europe and various other numbers) are based on essentially meaningless numbers. Have sex with a girl over 18 - you're good. Have sex with a girl that's 17 years and 365 days old, you're a sex offender and a pedophile. They have nothing to do with the development physically or mentally of an individual, life expectancy, etc. And they don't even compare to arbitrary (and non-arbitrary) marital restrictions of past communities. In other cultures, people were married and the marriage consummated (the married woman goes to live with the male) even before they had a period (see Biblical/Talmudic accounts of Rebbeca and Isaac as an example of 3 a year old getting married). I remember even in recent times a big hub bub about young marriages (post-Bat/Bar Mitzvah - think ages ~12-14) in Israel.

There is absolutely zero chance in my mind that the historically accepted age of 6/7 has even a 1% chance of being true. 

Then you're arguing emotionally (even if you are able to cite an academic after the fact). You need to step outside of the issue if you want to look at it objectively. The question isn't whether this is strange to us, but whether or not it is more likely true than not. And the tasheeh of certain narrations over others suggests that it is. 




 If the people will continue to sin no matter what, then the Qur'an says they will be punished after death. Killing them early doesn't save them because they have already sinned anyway. So killing them isn't merciful, it is taking away their last bit of enjoyment before an eternity of torment.

You don't know that they're going to Hell - or that they're going to Hell for eternity. All we know from the nass is that they were destroyed on Earth. Unless there is a specific statement of their eternal damnation, in Islam, you're taught not to speak of it. Statements on punishment are not immutable - the intended purpose is to warn people away from sin. If God simply said, "I encourage you not to do this" - people would take less heed than if God says, "doing this leads to Damnation" because of our nature and the effect of fear of a thing being more meaningful than a suggestion against a thing.

And even when there are statements of eternal damnation, its not necessary that the damnation will actually be "eternal" for the parties. The example is the saying that (at some point) everyone with "a mustard seed of Faith" will be pulled from the Hellfire. If they are continuously going to sin, and increase in sin, then when their life is cut short, they have less potential to sin further into the future - which in turn reduces their suffering in an afterlife (or increases their reward in case they skip Hell altogether). The children they would've had otherwise, who would've had the same influence, never exist. It is definitely a mercy to die if the alternate is that in your future, you would only have become a worse human being. It's also a mercy on future generations, that through that reminder, are vividly discouraged from engaging in sins.

Having said that, your point that Allah is not "ever-merciful" covers this, if correct. Can you supply a verse?

I can't point you to a single verse, but you have read the translation cover-to-cover I presume so you've seen countless examples where Allah acts with Justice, or Wrath. I suppose you can read "tabbat yadda Abi Lahaban wa tabb" (roughly destruction on the hands of Abu Lahab and Him) and the rest of it to the end. The entire Surah is about punishment. From beyond the Qur'an, the textual evidence is His Saying "Verily, My Mercy prevailed over My Wrath." (or preceded over, etc.) - it's evidence that mercy and wrath are mutually exclusive innately, that one precedes the other and that God can act with both.

However, I then find it difficult to accept the virtue of mercy at all. One can be merciful without being "ever-merciful", but I don't think the wrathful killing of an entire city/generation is compatible with any level of mercy.

We'll just disagree on that than. In Islam, when the life of a child is naturally taken away - that doesn't come off immediately as a mercy either with the outlook you've presented. Because how can 'death'/'destruction' be merciful? It is a fact of life - innocent children die all the time, and the Creator is also Malik over everything that happens on Earth. But the death of a child is a mercy on the child (in Islam) by automatic entrance in Heaven, the saying "the Child will open the doors to Heaven for the parents it left behind" and so forth. It's a bit simplistic to say that 'death' or 'destruction' is automatically not reconcilable with "any level of mercy" imo 




 ... I think I'll stick to paying the tribute. 









 Let's do this thing!

 Killing them for sinning or transgressing does not seem very merciful

I was always taught that if I see an animal suffering and effectively dying, to put it out of its misery. Killing those animals was mercy. You can't take an action (like killing in this example) and attribute a good/bad, just/merciful to it, separate of the doer of the action and context in which its done. If there is a community so engrossed in sin, and God knows they will live on only to have a ridiculous bad-deed:good-deed ratio, its merciful on His part to save them from themselves.

That said, Islam doesn't teach that God is ever-merciful either. Being al-Adl (the Just) is also an attribute of God. Islamic tradition teaches that 'his mercy precedes his wrath' - but that doesn't mean He can't act with a different attribute. 




 No paranoia, it's all an act for Beck and there's money to be made in nailing easy victims to the cross. 




 20 minutes of running doesn't involve taking it up the ass 




 Damnit, is there a proper double blind done on this topic by an accredited institution than? Don't leave us ~~hanging~~ erect... 




 But I think this question is still valid purely because we are playing with definitions. 

I don't think this is simply playing with definitions, we're talking about whether God is one way or another way. That's more than definitions for us, that's asma wa sifaat.

The key point is: If God is unbounded, how can God not exist within the creation? Otherwise God is bounded to a realm outside creation. If God is unbounded, It has to be panentheistic.

Islamically, we can't say something about God - unless that something has proof in the text - and even than, it's not quite so simple. Per textual evidence, God exists within the universe in that God can 'see' what happens, God exists in the universe in 'his knowledge', and God exists within the universe in that God has complete control over everything to a sub-atomic level, etc. In that sense, God exists 'in' the Universe. We also say that God does not exist in the Universe in that God is not a thing subject to its rules, God isn't a substance being acted on by time or events like us etc. In that sense, God exists 'outside' of the Universe.

My understanding is that you're suggesting that God exists in the universe in some other way, and since Islamic text doesn't naturally read to support something like that, I can't really comment on it one way or the other - especially since I don't know precisely what you mean by unbounded. If you're suggesting that God is a substance, and this substance pervades space/time and beyond, than we don't define God as a substance where part of God can be in space/time, and part of God is subdivided outside of space/time. That is the Islamic criticism of Pantheism as Islamic scholars confronted it. 




 This is the only online academic source that deals with the question specifically and thoroughly imo:

http://www.islamic-awareness.org/Quran/Miracle/ 




 As far as I know, we know that this is not the case at all. So basically I'm asking, why would he say that when it's not true? 

As far as you know? Let's start there - can you link to academia and what modern consensus is on this issue - if there is any consensus on it?

I believe there's a paper written on this topic in particular. Don't remember what journal. The tradition you're referring to says

            .          

It isn't necessarily saying 'whoever ejaculates first determines it' - it can be read as saying that it depends on the dominance material from one gender had over ( ) material from the other gender leading to a closer similarity to the paternal uncle (in the male scenario).

We can nit-pick wording, but at that point, we'd be criticizing people for saying the sun rises. I think the meaning and motivation behind such sayings is more important. 




  It definitely needs to be more understood. Especially since a lot of people that will use this to save a penny or two are precisely those that can't shell out for a last minute ticket to get to where they actually need to go.

I dunno that it isn't understood - most people who know about this site and this sort of stuff are generally well-informed about what they'r trying to do. I agree on the premise though, the guy behind the site should be more clear in warning people about risks associated with his tool. That said, he doesn't actually make money off of it as of yet. 




 I fly once a month at least, only occasionally for business. If I'm saving $400 on a hidden city (example - any popular route) vs the contracted flight, and I'm being rerouted once a month - I'll accept losing one budget ticket a month. And even when storms do kick in, in my experience, delays have always put me through the same cities and canceled flights were all but one time compensated with a later flight following the same multi-stop path. It's anecdotal, but at least in my case - stuff like this is beneficial. 




 He could - but this is not his actual job. Just a side thing. 




 I assumed all the price comparison sites had to have agreements and pay fees to be able to get quotes and compare them.

Actually, those price comparison sites are mostly built around ITA. Building a tool like what OP's done is not impossible, or even hard. It's a matter of simply doing it, taking the risk (and potential corporate bullying as in this case), putting up any necessary capital while you operate in the red for the first year or so, etc. etc. etc. 




 I think he intentionally broke his site due to the lawsuit atm. 




 bingo 




 It's not much of a for-profit yet - doubt it's even in the green yet... 




 Not really - he suggested that there is an automated cancellation process by airline companies in general - with no proof...

Can they cancel if you miss a stop on a multi-stop route? Sure. Will they? That part depends. If they've overbooked or sold your seat to someone else after you failed to show for the first flight - you'll be told that your booking was canceled for a no-show. If you're a regular abuser or you've been flagged for other dishonesty, again, they can pull the same shit. If you do this once or twice in 5 years while only going in one direction - you're not on anybody's radar. 




 I highly doubt any systems, let alone all 'airlines' will do this automatically - its one thing to identify and penalize a repeat offender by bans or freezing their points. It's a whole nother thing to have a carte blanche automated cancellation process that can have plenty of issues adversely affecting honest customers....

Check out flyertalk - this has been discussed many times by many different people... 




 That's one of the potential downfalls of using a service like this. At the same time however, without concrete data, there's no reason to believe this happens often enough and in such a way as to be impactful to most of the people who've been using Skiplagged (successfully) for a while now. The fact that people had been doing this for ages in the not too distant past (without the use of tools like SkipLagged) would suggest it works out more often than not. 









  Having a lot of accounts open almost always lowers your score.

It quite literally does not - I just demonstrated by analogy how extending your credit line has the exact opposite effect given the part utilization plays in score - you know, based on how credit scores *actually work*...if you can't control yourself and rack up $20,000 in debt, than it's not having credit that ruined you but your own inability to control your impulses. Just about *everybody* on /r/churning has tons of credit - and nobody there is even remotely in bad debt...

 SHIZEN - DER EWIGE JUDE 




 Not really. If you apply for a card today and another one a month later, the company you apply for your 2nd one at will know about your first one. Depending on your credit score, getting a bunch of inquiries simultaneously is actually a good strategy. Your score drops down all at once but it will pick up. Meanwhile, in theory, the companies extending credit to you only see information that's been posted to date. In my case, I apply for all the credit I want every several months since I usually get instant approvals once my credit's back in the +700s. It takes a quick drop, but goes right back up over a short period of time. Rinse and repeat. 




 Say you have 3 cards, with the maximum balance offered by each bank below:

Chase $5000
BoA $5000
Barclays $5000

You have credit available at $15,000 and you only use $5,000. If you now open another account, Amex $5000, your max available is at $20,000. You just brought your utilization down to under 30% from over 30%. Utilization plays a factor in your overall score. Hence, having more credit available is almost never a bad thing. 




 I've got a 770 with over 20 credit cards, and about 7 years of credit history. Only reason to have only 3 credit cards is if you can't control yourself to not max them all out. 




 UN: Israel please stop bombing hospitals and destroying entire apartments.

Israel: *bombs more hospitals, schools and apartments*

UN: OK. In that case, please stop owning nuclear weapons.

 They will sue you, but if you have a good lawyer and you can make a case, you can get away with not paying the excess after the repo. You credit rating will tank (will start to get better after 7 years). 




  That's very interesting, because the end effect would be that a lender has no benefit to lend to strangers...thus there's no capital for anyone. Does that mean it's nearly impossible to move up out of your social class in that country?

Does taking on interest-bearing loans help people move out of their social class? With the exception of anecdotal risk takers and owners of businesses that became successful, it seems to keep the majority of people tied into their social class - keeping in mind that the anecdotal successful risk taker / business owner is one out of every 10 failure entrepreneurs and budding venture capitalists. 




  The type of arrangement OP describes is quite common as it complies with Sharia law.

It doesn't actually, traditional fiqh books would consider this as constituting interest since deliberately precomuting interest over the base is simply getting pegged with a fee you would not be paying if you had the capital up front. But it is common. Muslim establishments in Western societies will find a work around for every inconvenient law - and in this case, at their own expense. 




 Well, back then, i was Muslim - and heavily forbidden to use interest. So, my dad, as i was 20 at the time, spoke to the dealership for hours. Thinking we won a deal, they gave us 0% APR, BUT added all the accumulated interest to the loan. Basically, a car that was work less than $20k, was sold for $30k with 0% APR.

This has nothing to do with being Muslim and entirely to do with being an imbecile. Islam prohibits interest because of alleged exploitation associated with usury. Allowing somebody you're buying something from to convince you to pay 50% of value as an upfront added interest payment over the base price in lieu of periodic interest is just semantics, and is still interest/riya in Islam. 




 Here is a poll that's shows 51 percent of Americans have anti black views http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ap-poll-majority-harbor-prejudice-against-blacks. So you are saying this poll is also a direct reflection of American society because numbers not personal experience tell the truth?

That's not a survey of the number of people who consider blacks a cancer or would like to use violence to expel them. Read the questions - the 51% is anyone who exhibited racial prejudice of any kind, it was the surveyors rendering of in-explicit racism. Quite different from 52% of a sample population calling a subset of the population a cancer, with 33% calling for violence - both explicit, I can't even imagine what a measure of implied prejudice would look like over an Israeli sample....

And yes, that's an accurate and reproducible reflection of prejudice in the United States that's been tested through multiple surveyors with several samples reflective of an average accounting for wealth disparity, education and political affiliation in the United States...the survey and others like it have been reproduced with roughly the same numbers and similar questions over the last several years with mutually exclusive samples each time....

So you are saying this poll is also a direct reflection of American society because numbers not personal experience tell the truth?

Yes...because statistics and statistical extrapolation trumps mindless anecdotal extrapolation in every way...

 




  Historically, the Virgin Birth stems from

Virgin birth stories were pretty popular beyond the OT in other religions as well. It's equally possible, more so even, that rather than a misreading of Isaiah 7/14 leading to the development of a virgin birth story, there was already a virgin birth story and it was later justified by casting it on re-understanding the OT. The same way as was done for many other things like crucifixion or abolition of the laws, etc. 




 Also is there anything in the Qur'an that is similar to the Book of Revelation?

No. Also though, the book of revelations is one of the fully contested books and not even attributed to Jesus or any of his immediate disciples. Its visions/prophecies of one sect of Christians later in the era that became mainstream - and you've had several prominent figures question its canonicity (Martin Luther for example).

There are Muslim prophecies of Jesus coming back, how it will happen, and what he'll do. These are collected in different books of ahadith, but most such reports I can think of are inauthentic by Islamic standards so it'll be hard to find any scholarly work with them translated into English (unlike established hadith books). 




 The Islamic equivalent of Jzus coming back is quite literally, Jzus coming back. 




 The article doesn't have to be directly about Islam in order for it to relate to Islam or Muslims....jeez talk about being anal though... 




 I can only say from personal experience

Sure, and in my experience over the last 2 years, I've observed cruel racism by Israelis (not directed at me). I've also observed a small number of marginalized Israelis who've opposed it. Neither my experience, nor your experience, are a legitimate basis for drawing an over-arching claim about Israeli society. My experience, like your experience, is anecdotal. The studies by the Peace Index and others, demonstrating prevalent and virulent racism, however are not. 




 people looking for a better life in that area make the journey to Israel ( they bypass Egypt because they will get shot to death).

They bypass Egypt because Egypt doesn't have a great immigration policy. You can't really beat being able to call it Aliyah and getting citizenship in a high GDP country by simply claiming Jewish ancestry...

It is not about blacks https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uBFN91t2z28

 Study shows that MIGRANTS are cancer

If Israel had a problem with migrants, it would have a problem with most of its population and the immediate ancestors of almost all of its population. Re-read the poll - they specifically have a problem with black migrants....

 Rephrased your defense of this convicted criminal who used to exploit dying old men and women to fit the narrative of a hypothetical young Jihadi girl in ISIS

You have absolutely no details how she was involved in that ~~scam~~ movement, for all we know she wasn't informed of the full details or had a very minor role, people fall into working for ~~scams~~ terrorists all the time, ~~pyramid schemes~~ terror campaigns prey on the economically weak and naive as well, sometimes people get caught up in the wrong influences when they are young.

So that maybe you'll see how retarded it sounds to minimize her crimes as if they were nothing so you can continue to deify criminals because they choose to fight people you don't like. You lot are taking the 'enemy of my enemy' to an amazing level.

 [Black Immigrants] settled in a very specific place, kicking out the original inhabitants and terrorizing them. Of course they would feel that [hatred]

I hope the irony of your statement isn't lost on everybody who sees that...

But regarding this claim - that its not racism, just anger towards a specific decision made by the black immigrant community as a whole - that the pale faced European Colonists only hate black immigrants because the naughty blacks chose a poor location to settle is a bit hard to swallow... You don't [forcibly sterilize a vaste swathe of people of a particular pigment and heritage](http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/israel-admits-ethiopian-women-were-given-birth-control-shots.premium-1.496519) because a subset of them ruined your view.

 You're either completely uninformed or deliberately providing misinformation. Haaretz has almost *no* market-share in Israel itself and is a known left wing paper. No shit you're gonna find comments by rational people. But it's not a representation of the general vibe in Israel which is what was at discussion here and what you have literally zero clue about unless you're intentionally trying to sugar-coat things.

Check the same story on websites people in Israel actually use...like ynet or even jpost.

From [JPost](http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Bilingual-Hebrew-Arabic-school-in-Jerusalem-caught-in-flames-383176) version of the story:

First comment criticizes **the general vibe in Israel**: Welcome to Israel circa winter 2014-15. Racist laws , an ascendant far right that would make Le Pen blush...

Second top comment is conspiracy theory

Third top comment: I wish the media would stop carrying the lie that there is a "palestinian" people. They're just arabs that were kicked out of Egypt and Jordan for bad behaviour. It's why the rest of the arab world wants nothing to do with them and gives them no aid. You're SEEING that now. They can't be civilized, they're savages. It's why Egypt and Jordan kicked them out.

Fourth top comment: The muslim terrorists will never change. Not until they have succeeded or they are dead. Lets try to help them achieve the latter outcome. Rip the bandaid off clean. It's about time. Then we can move on.

Fifth top comment - conspiracy theory.

Etc.

And I don't remember Ynet, especially the Hebrew version of the article, being any better.
 




 And is not the first staged media event Pallywood has produced.

 Pretty much everything in the Guiness book of World Records? 




 out of stock :( 




 why then did Abu Baku initiate an unprovoked war of aggression and conquest against Byzantine?

Do you have proof it was unprovoked? Islam doesn't just exist in a political realm, are you suggesting that converts to Islam within Byzantine territory were allowed freedom to practice? Are you suggesting that possible self-determination of Byzantine Muslim subjects would also qualify as a 'war of aggression'? There are a lot of possible provoking factors that don't require an all-out Byzantine invasion into Mecca to justify Abu Bakr's incursions. But this isn't a history sub - you likely won't find your answer here, unless you're more going for the question of whether or not Islam allows for political expansionism absent any provocation... 




  For dhu al qarnayn we don't know who/when/where he was.

Look up classical tafasir on it. You can argue that fact about a lot of individuals in the Qur'an - but the mufasireen shed some light on some of the named individuals/places in the Qur'an, especially from outside sources.

IMO - you won't have any luck with this topic. The primary context the Qur'an and ahadith use to speak, outside of themselves, are israeliyyat, and the sayings of then contemporary Christians and pagans. It wasn't particularly necessary for Islam to discuss the status of people like Mani (not being a real prophet) or potential prophets in China and Africa in order for the basic tenants of the religion to spread to those areas, in the time of Muhammad himself. In fact, Islam did just fine in most of these areas without any specific references to the revered personages of those areas.

If you're super interested though, I'd suggest an in-depth History like Tarikh at Tabari which will cite many Muslim sources for the so-called 'history of the world' which is more likely to fill the void you're looking to fill here.

 Well - from the video itself, it looks like he's deliberately making fast gestures which don't register while when he does it slower, it seems to work. The other criticisms of the device already mean I wouldn't drop a penny on it - but this particular criticism seems a bit self-wrought to justify how much he focused on it. 
























 That's evidence of its origin. If Muhammad came to people with a pre-written book or stood and narrated the Qur'an in a long session, you can say somebody else may have written the book or he memorized what he was saying.

  You should reply to him, not me. He might've missed this post.

 You sure about that?

Yes - it was hyperbole though - to qualify - every substantial sect that originated within the first 500 years after Muhammad that's survived till today. I can't honestly speak to every niche group that pops up and attributes their beliefs to Islam.

And yes, that's all Taqiyyah is, or at least, that's all it is for the 12ers.

 We need to use those hadeeths. We don't go and say "My madhhaabs says so." If they have hadeeth to prove their methodology, then we accept it. If not, the act is haraam. I didn't say this... Allah and his messenger said this.

Without taking a position on the issue myself given my lack of qualification, I don't believe you're qualified to be having this argument. You're arguing against Sadl because "If they have hadeeth to prove their methodology, then we accept it" when you don't seem to realize the proof that Malikis/Awzais historically used for sadl was amal of the community.

Advice - Don't get lost in meaningless and fruitless discussions that you don't have the detailed and specific knowledge to take part in. 




 Those guys aren't necessarily Shi'ites. Malikis from certain regions also practice Sadl. 




 Shi'ites are allowed to pray behind Sunnis as long as they make their intentions and the prayer itself independently (per Khomaini, Sistani, and others). [Praying in unity is purely out of taqiyah](http://www.rafed.net/books/hadith/wasael-8/wasail13.html#299) and doesn't meet your fardh requirements (unless you make independent niyyat and simply make your movements together).

            

If this is in Iraq, he's probably actually praying a separate prayer behind the Sunni Imam. The only scholar I can think of that I believe allows Shi'ites to pray (and not have to recite) when behind a Sunni is Fadlallah and plenty of the other major scholars in Qom and in Iran consider him a deviant. 




 Also much of the Qur'an is directly addressed to Muhammad and deals with issues specific to the ummah at that time

That's evidence of its origin. If Muhammad came to people with a pre-written book or stood and narrated the Qur'an in a long session, you can say somebody else may have written the book or he memorized what he was saying. He was an illiterate man, revealing verses on the spot to issues as they came up. 




 Galatians indicates that Paul was on quite friendly terms with at least the apostles James and Peter.

You claimed that Christ's companions corroborated the claims of Paul the enemy - I'd really be surprised to see any statement independently by them recorded to that effect...this is what you said: "The church only accepted this former enemy because people who knew Jesus vouched for him." Evidence suggests that "the church" was a little less scientific in accepting canonicity and attribution...

And referencing a letter of Paul to prove the companions of Christ supported his assertions is circular reasoning...

God talks to me - my evidence of this is my statement that God talks to me. Paul says he's homies with James and Peter, therefore he must be good friends of James and Peter. It doesn't support your claim in any case that I've never heard from an academic at any rate.

That IS what free will implies, yes. Allah in the Qur'an also directly states that He will guard the scripture.

Not in Islam, there are countless passages saying God *does* a thing where human agents are the actual doers in Qur'an and ahadith. The same applies to your Old Testament. Are you suggesting that when God says he "does" something - like gives somebody a child - he comes down and intercedes against the course of human agency and free will in some way? If you are, your claim would contradict Biblical expressions of Godly attribution - not just Qur'anic ones...

The apostles were convinced...

They were convinced of something, sure. There's no real evidence that can be attributed to them directly to suggest they were convinced of your religion and not some other early Christian doctrine.

Ah, right. Those Nazarenes are quite similar to contemporary Messianic Jews in terms of what they affirm and practice, but there isn't much evidence of their existence as a firmly established sect with that label until the 4th century, **removing them quite a bit from Paul.**

We only have a direct use of their name in the fourth century - that doesn't place them well after Paul. The first mention of them by "the church" fathers suggest that this "heresy" originated well before then - Jerome and Epiphanius (4th century apologists of what would become your religion) explicitly place them well before the time of their writing. Back full circle to the point - your claim of some sort of mass acceptance of your Christianity by 'devout Jews' has no evidence - the evidence we do have of Jewish acceptance of Christ actually contradicts it, and Pauline Christianity appealed to non-learned non-Hebrews who had no understanding of Hebrew scripture, in many cases rejecting it point blank (like the major sect of early Christians who followed Marcion), while others ignored it implicitly (like Justin Martyr, an early father of "the church"). 




 The idea is if somebody's got a gun to your head, you don't do something stupid out of sense of misplaced pride, and a slightly excessive desire for martyrdom. 

Every Islamic sect allows that sort of lying. Are you suggesting that this is all the 12er concept of taqiyyah is? 




 Paul was considered "a ringleader of the Nazarene sect" by the Jews (see Acts 24) so I don't know what you mean by that bit. You are correct about the Ebionites.

You're thinking of the wrong Nazarenes. The early church apologies differentiate between whats referred in Acts 24 (a general outsider statement) and the actual Nazarene sect I'm referring to.

That doesn't really answer my request for evidence of Christ's disciples ever provably testifying on behalf of Paul the enemy of Christ.

Marcion is an interesting figure, ostensibly accepting many of Paul's writings yet fundamentally disagreeing with much of what Paul said.

Well, his version of Luke and the Pauline letters aren't identical to - say - the KJV so I'd wouldn't be surprised that he did disagree with some of the statements attributed to Paul.

The point of all that, if we step back, was that of the early Christian religions, Marcion's was one of the most substantial at the time (in terms of size) - and his religion (like that of many Pauline Christians) was very *not Jewish*. Something which flies in the face of your assertion about a myriad of devout Jews suddenly accepting Christ as Lord and Savior, Dead and Risen. By and large, the Christianity of the Jews that accepted Christ early on isn't much anything like your Christianity.

How could God ensure that agents of free will would protect the Qur'an if they are agents of free will? He may have foreseen that they would, but if they are agents of free will then He Himself did not bring it about.

Are you suggesting that unless there is some kind of miracle, an action done by a human being can never be attributed to the one that created the human being? 




  Compare this to Christianity, which spread like wildfire in the most inhospitable of circumstances....

But it didn't. You had a myriad of religions that attributed to themselves to Christ, and a variant won out. With Islam, one set of primary ideas has always been mainstream...

Is it reaching to say that the church made it the orthodox doctrine? Because that's exactly what happened. Paul only acquired credibility because what he wrote was NOT heresy to the early church. 

The fact that one version of Christianity that endorsed the writings attributed to Paul happened to win out historically isn't evidence that there was one monolithic entity ("the early church") that had the greatest market-share since inception...

The church only accepted this former enemy because people who knew Jesus vouched for him.

You'll understand that making claims about Jesus' companions giving veracity to this guy without evidence isn't very convincing. Paul's teachings were most popular amongst the very sort of people who didn't ever know Christ (a Hebrew). For instance, the Marcionites who rejected Christ's Jewish heritage and outright denied Hashem. Meanwhile the early Jewish churches (Ebionites, Nazarenes) seem to unanimously give no credibility to Pauline doctrine...

The question you're asking here is "why did God give us free will?" This is completely different from the question I was asking, which is "why didn't God protect the pre-Qur'anic revelations?" You turning my finishing statement around on me is a false equivalence because you're not asking the same question. You haven't answered mine either.

God didn't protect the Qur'an by sending down a magical barrier or writing it on stone tablets or Gold plates and then sending it down. The Qur'an was protected by human agency, people who had free will. It goes back to your original misunderstanding that God's promise that the Qur'an isn't corrupted requires him to come down and protect it by some divine miracle. God protects it by agents with free will - huffaz al Qur'an (memorizers of the Qur'an) and the early companions. So no false equivalence here, it gets to the heart of your hypothetical... 




 Also, it means lying in conditions which are life threatening, not to spread agendas.

Are you saying that taqiyyah in 12er tashayyu is exclusively for life-threatening situations and has nothing to do with anything else (like spreading agendas)? 




 Amd are any of their claims substantuated (I'm guessing no, especially the taqigya

Well taqiyah is a doctrine of the [Shi'ite sect](http://twelvershia.net/) and Obama's family came from a Sunni Muslim area - so I wouldn't lend it much credence. 




 http://www.islamic-awareness.org/Hadith/Ulum/israel.html

About the explicit statement by Muhammad on where israeliyyat are and are not acceptable.

The closest thing in the Qur'an off the top of my head would be where there is a verse that explicitly calls out the Jews for "worshipping" Uzair. 




 since it is apparently within the power of Allah to protect His revelation, why is the Qur'an the only revelation that was protected?

Because of the community that developed around Islam. The last guidance was sent at a time, place and to a people that were perfect for its preservation and spreading (their accomplishments are testimony to that). The Companions of the Prophet are considered the best generation of mankind in Islam. It was thru normal human agency that the Qur'an was divinely protected.

This was far and apart from the communities that developed around Christ or the other Prophets, yielding traitors like Judas and others, or vast chunks of Moses'/Aaron's closest companions start worshipping a calf, etc. It's also far and apart from Christian/Jewish scriptures that aren't provable to any of the relevant parties (immediate disciples of Christ or immediate contemporaries of Moses). And whereas with Muslims you have colophons establishing unanimity on the essential texts (Qur'an and several mutawattir ahadith), or at least allowing some means of non-textual verification - you don't have the same with the Bible. You have books ascribed to people who had no direct connection to Christ and who don't list their sources. In some cases, you have writings taken as canon written by the very enemies of Christ through his life - who supposedly saw him in visions after he left. And then you have other texts which have literally zero connection to Christ and are wholly 'prophecies' of later day Christian (Shepard of Hermas, Revelations, etc.)

How did a bunch of devout monotheistic Jews come to believe that Jesus is God and rose from the dead if Jesus preached the contrary and was spared from the cross?

But they didn't. Early Jewish acceptors of Christ (Ebionites, Nazarenes) didn't accept the modern standard we use to call somebody Christian or not-Christian. Did Pauline Christianity eventually win out and the other sects become marginalized to the point of non-existence - sure. But you're reaching if you're going to suggest that any substantial subset of devout/learned Jews accepted that particular variant.

The only way I can think of to reason around this is that He has some ulterior motive for sending people astray, perhaps to give them a test, but this does not make sense to me as the action of a Lord who wishes for all to believe the truth about Him.

I'm assuming you're a Christian, and therefore, Muhammad is a false prophet to you. Logically though, we can turn the table and say that God also created Muhammad with foreknowledge of Muhammad's false doctrine and his false teachings. The only way I can think of to reason around this is that He has some ulterior motive for sending people astray, perhaps to give them a test, but this does not make sense to me as the action of a Lord who wishes for all to believe the truth about Him.

Hypothetical why-not-this' aren't a good argument against claims of fact.

If you base "corruption" on different versions of the Bible, then simply ignore Protestantism.

Well Catholics and Orthodox have different Bibles too (Catholics don't have 3 Maccabees for example) - (TheMoreYouKnow).

But his claim to corruption is based on the fact that even before Catholicism, there were substantial theological and textual variants. The Marcionites, people who had a Bible canon well before any of the elders of the Catholic church even thought of deciding on one, had their own version of the Gospel of Luke. They didn't recognize any of the other Gospels that became mainstream later on, and they didn't accept the OT. etc. And that's just one sect - there were tons of different groups each with their own text in the early Christian era. So his criticism of Biblical veracity goes a little deeper, and is a bit older than the modern sects of Trinitarian Christianity. 




 The differences with Sunni Islam and Shia Islam are nearly not as much as their similarities, noted that they share the same belief structure. The only thing is political shareholders within the caliphate.

In premise, sure. But in reality, for the majority of Shi'ites (Ithna Ashariyya) No - it's not. Imami Shi'ites invented their own religious tradition - that contradicts every other legitimate sect. The fundamental concept behind understanding their/your religious texts is that the Imams would say one thing to the general public, and one secret message just to the select few. So in Sunni books, in non-12er Shi'i books, etc. Imam Jafar as-Sadiq will say one thing. But in Shi'ite books, that same issue will have two narrations. One that agrees with everybody else (in the region of the narrator) and another version that's supposed to be the "truth". I'd be happy to bring you a simple example even.

As far as disavowing Shi'ites as Muslims, only a few people go that far. For the most part, Sunni scholars give Shi'ite laymen the benefit of the doubt. I can link you to people who are extremely critical of your religion and don't consider it Islam, but if you ask them about the status of the average kid in Iran, they won't drop takfir willy nilly on laypeople. 




 If God is willing to send someone new to redirect his direction

Where is the redirect? At no point in canonical Jewish scripture or Christian scripture does God say "xyz is the course humanity will take indefinitely and this is my Final word on the matter and so-and-so is my last recipient of guidance". Islam explicitly states "this is it". So it's still compatible with previous prophets, whereas if Bahais except Islam was revealed by God - it is by definition incompatible by its own primary texts. You're comparing two completely incomparable situations. 




  Well he did wait about 600 years before he sent Mohammed. He could have avoided all of this by telling the people of the time everything he told Mohammed. God could have made sure the Gospel was going to never change. But he put it in a time and place for a reason.

And he could've just not let Adam and Eve eat the fruit and just do away with this nonsense by not putting that temptation out there. If you're going to argue about what somebody believes happened, based on "what ifs" and "why not this?" - you're not going to have a fulfilling discussion that goes anywhere. Your premise is intrinsically flawed because you're suggesting that there are simpler ways of having gone about things - but using that rationale, we can work our way back well before the Bahai religion was even invented.

Not to mention that though your solution to a single historical incident may appear simpler to you than what humanity experienced in reality - it doesn't make it 'truer'. It's a meaningless hypothetical.. 




 Yes. Joining a terrorist or criminal outfit doesn't make you any less human than joining an organization that tortures and experiments on people (the SS, the CIA, etc.)

 "Owning" people isn't inherently at exactly the same level of cruelty as torture. We own animals too - but the moment you begin to torture your cat, that's when people will actually look at you sideways. Clearly one is more of an ethical dilemma than the other.

 And Bibi is sitting back and laughing to himself, knowing he's got his hand in every pot. 




 On the same exact page...you have reports explicitly stating that Muhammad wore his hair down to his shoulders...long hair for Wa'il would obviously mean something meaningfully and abnormally longer than that... 




 By whom exactly?

In Sunni texts. You're using a Shi'ite source, quite literally the narration you're referring to is from Wasael as shi'a... 




 Not inciting religious hatred (there's plenty of gurdwaras, mosques and temples that do so on the regular). He's being charged with "Section 125 of the Indian Penal Code, relating to "waging war against any Asiatic Power in alliance with the Government of India"." 




  Bring any who plan or act on atrocities before fair courts to be tried in the worlds eyes, randomly killing people as revenge can only make things worse.

Don't worry - they will. Pakistan just repealed the ban on the death penalty. Expect plenty of summary executions and kangaroo courts in the near future - all for the greater good of course. 




 Keep going Pakistan! I was happy to leave the sand box when my tour was finished, but what those monsters did to those innocent children is just sick. I would do anything to go back and shove my m27 IAR up some Taliban ass.

The Taliban you were fighting and TPP (also TPA) are completely different entities, with their own structures and their own leadership. The Afghan (original) Taliban actually condemned the attack...

But of course, if we're mad at a group of people, they're just a monolithic caricature. 




 No. He didn't. Said "statement" didn't come out till much later - hardly "within hours". During those several days, the Taliban actually demanded evidence in order to turn him over. So we bombed them.

You want to shut down a conspiracy theorist, understandable. But at least get your facts straight... 




 Don't be silly. You can't attach laser beams to them. They're just ill-tempered scorpions flying out of explosions (which they'll survive unlike everything else in blast radius). 




 Mirror/DailyMail would be the onion. The difference is that most people know the Onion is satire. These tabloids are credible sources here on /r/worldnews... 




 Look man, you're not supposed to use critical thinking skills when reading the Daily Mail or the Mirror... 




 "We may have tortured you a bit, but look on the bright side, we could've killed you" 









 Yep - editorialized title. Should read: 22 killed in air strikes. Actual facts from "article":

LANDI KOTAL: At least **22 suspected militants** were killed in air strikes on their positions in Tirah valley of Khyber Agency on Tuesday.

So basically, 22 people are dead. They are supposed to have been militants. Whatever the case, the Pakistani army will be seeing red for the next couple months. 




 The rational strategy is to make your enemies fear for not just their lives, but the lives of their wives and children if they help the US and/or don't help the Taliban. It's a means of breaking the enemy's will to fight.

It wasn't 'rational' at all. People will fear for their lives, but now there will be national consensus for more govt. operations. At the same time, because of this incident, the total government shutdown scheduled by PTI (for the 18th of this month) and PAT (for the 17th) were both cancelled. It is literally the most irrational thing they could do - both in terms of what was done and timing. 




 Thousands. The Pakistani government allowed US drone strikes that killed over 1,000 people in total (though the US only targeted 80 or so individuals). We can get away with killing children because male child in the blast radius over 16 (or 14?) is considered an "enemy combatant" in official tolls. Meanwhile, the devastation by the recent Pakistani army offensives blows the US-drone strike toll out of the water.

Not that what TPP is doing is justified, but there is context here for sure. 




 The most powerful quote by the alleged TPP commander, "What about our kids and children[?]" 




 thank you. 




 Unless you run an increasing militarized police force. 




 It isn't just about deaths - it's the strange deaths, suicides and unsolved murders that are (as you imply anecdotal) reaching mainstream media that is causing worry. 




 I don't know that violence is definitely going up, but we're far more connected to the world and local pockets in our own borders than in the past - so it will seem that way to us.

Federalization of the police. At least in the US. We'll continue to hear stories about bad cops, and the gang-culture of police agencies. The public will support government moves for more 'over-sight' by the bureaucracies that have demonstrated such commendable management skills to date. They will snub out secessionist ideas, with continued crackdowns against locals who are becoming less nationalistic, and more local and globalist/humanist at the same time. You'll hear more about the "homegrown" ideologically driven threats (vs just the Muslim/Russian bogey men). At the same time Obama talks about body-cams, the DOJ continues to [auction off and gift](http://www.carbuzz.com/news/2014/12/16/US-Army-Will-Start-Selling-Surplus-Humvees-to-the-Public-Starting-Tomorrow-7724296/) 'excess' military supplies to local agencies.

Meanwhile, the Islamic bogey man has become realer than ever in the past. No more exotic names - the newest 'threat' is quite literally "the Islamic state". Their stated ambitions have encouraged lone gunmen scenarios by wackos in different countries, completely unaffiliated with the group, to attack their local government and civilian populations. Hilary will become president while Republicans hold heavy elsewhere - resulting in one of those great divided presidencies that gives leadership an excuse to be ineffectual on all issues except corporate interests and the military industrial complex. Increase international role by Western governments in the Middle East will result in reprisals at our door-steps, and we'll continue to tell ourselves they hate us for our freedom and enjoin in the fundamentally flawed circle of violence.

The US/NATO rift with Russia will continue to increase and become problematic with more proxy wars and attacks on allies of these nations by independent parties. China, inexorably tied to the US by trade and debt-purchasing will be assessing their next move. Iran and it's proxies will be continue to increase in conflict with 'Sunni' powers while Israel will continue on a far-right trend.

All in all, use condoms when you're having sex, light up joint and try to enjoy the good things in life. There are less cynical theories about the future as well - still light up a joint and enjoy the good things. 




 Worse - it's an image of click-bait with no real punchline. 




 The goal is to make participation in the military more "costly" for Pakistanis who might otherwise consider joining, along with those already in uniform. 

Pakistani military isn't the sort of volunteer military you have in the US. You generally need family connections to get into the military - and then your next generation takes your place (if they don't move abroad). In other countries, like Iraq, attacking military bases says 'don't sign up'. But in Pakistan, the people who are in, are in.

It remains to be seen what the effect will be in Pakistan.

It's a blessing for the current leadership. Pakistan has been seeing a lot of protests lately about ineffectual government and a younger generation wants new blood (Imran Khan). Nothing like a tragedy to stir emotion and bring diverse stake-holders to the same team. 




 No - it's a desperate attack by a group of people who've been seeing the Pakistani government do the same to their loved ones and families. I'm not justifying the barbarity, but it's not taking place in a vacuum. If the Pakistani government had adopted less of an American-themed "disagree with us and we'll bomb you back to the stone age", and actually brought stake-holders to the table, Pakistan wouldn't be so crime/terror ridden as it is under present leadership.

That's if we assume PT are responsible - according to Shah Farman, theres no proof of that yet. 




 If we last for generations to come, secessionist movements don't pick up steam and somebody else doesn't take the world super power slot. 




 Yea but then he would've won and inherited Bush and Bush-era Congress/Senate's epic fuck-ups across the board. Instead, he was basically guaranteed to lose and you got your first black president - who disillusioned his base to an incredible level.

 You're just being silly, the CIA doesn't do that to white people. 




 With some customers even when you try to explain all the new electronic ways to bank, they just pretend it doesn't exist afterwards. 

As one of those annoying customers, let me explain our logic as well. I can speak for basically anybody who isn't over 80 that still goes into the branch for these personal banking tasks.

- Debit cards are *one more* card to keep in the wallet. Too many cards, trim the fat and the debit card has got to go. A lot of people use CC for just about everything and don't typically need to pull money. When we do, its easier to go to a branch located in a nice retail space you were going to be in anyways - and walk up to the teller with your drivers license (a card you generally need to keep in your wallet) to pull the cash. Most tellers in my experience fill out all the necessary information on the slip for me as well - an added bonus. I literally stand there and engage in the small talk they're trained to make with me.

- When you use an ATM, you can't easily rob the bank. Every now and then, many people get these temptations to rob the bank. Breaking into an ATM is not easy (source: Breaking Bad s02e06). Slipping a note to the teller that you've got a gun is very simple (hint: you don't actually need to have a fun). I've personally never robbed a bank. But we like knowing we've got the option when we're going by to withdraw money anyways.

- There are no lollipops/coffee at the ATM machines outside of the branch. You need to physically be in the branch to appease yourself of these amenities. At that point, you might as well just get to the teller if the line isn't looking like the DMV.

 




 You know the best part? Soon after you made this post, [it ended up on a sub that works to brigade posts like this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/PanicHistory/comments/2p8h5r/rpics_121314_the_nypd_is_always_watching_reddit/) 




 To clarify your fatwa question - A fatwa is an opinion on a religious issue by a scholar of Islamic jurisprudence. OBL wasn't a scholar in the religion so his statements aren't fatwas, but moreover, these aren't religious edicts, just statements of objectives attributed to him.

OBL raised [some interesting points](http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2004/11/200849163336457223.html), even though the methods of these groups were heinous and diabolical. It's a shame that we just keep regurgitating the same nonsense about how they hate us for our freedoms and bikinis - rather than reassessing our international role.

"I say to you that security is an indispensable pillar of human life and that free men do not forfeit their security, contrary to Bush's claim that we hate freedom.

If so, then let him explain to us why we don't strike for example - Sweden? And we know that freedom-haters don't possess defiant spirits like those of the 19 - may Allah have mercy on them.

No, we fight because we are free men who don't sleep under oppression. We want to restore freedom to our nation, just as you lay waste to our nation. So shall we lay waste to yours. "

"I am amazed at you. Even though we are in the fourth year after the events of September 11th, Bush is still engaged in distortion, deception and hiding from you the real causes. And thus, the reasons are still there for a repeat of what occurred. " 




 This. When it comes to corporate corruption and unwavering support for the military-industrial complex, we're as bi-partisan as can be. This is definitely not a red v blue thing. Republicans are your loud, threatening rapists while Democrats wait till you're properly sedated before slipping their hard-ons into our unprotected collective anus. 




  1) Restraint goes out the window when facing foes who don't show any either. Al Qaeda and the Taliban purposely attack civilians. They torture and kill hostages and POWs. This causes a race to the bottom.

 That assumes that the nature of time is exactly as we perceive it. Your light bulb analogy assumes...

Right - you asked 'Why does *casual dependence*...' A moment in time and its discrete precedents are related by casual dependence (a function of time). Only thing I'm assuming is that time is what we know it to be, and not something we don't know it to be.

that the present is somehow a privileged position within it.

Not the present, any discrete moment in time has the same issue with respect to casual dependence and the idea of there not being a beginning. I said, 'select a[ny] discrete moment'. You can select a moment 5 million years ago.

For a different analogy, consider an infinite wire, a light bulb, **a power source**, and flowing current. As long as the wire is superconducting, there's nothing problematic with this situation in my mind.

Where is the power source? The beginning of time? Because that's precisely what I was pointing out (time has a beginning). If your wire is infinitely long away from the light bulb, no matter what distinct point you select on the wire, you are no closer to the power source - so there's no basis for supposing a flowing current up to the selected point. 




 Select a discrete 'moment'/snapshot F in the physical universe (in our case - the present). In order for that moment F to have occurred, the moment before it must have occurred (casual dependence). But in order for that moment before F to have occurred, the moment before it too must have occurred. And so on tending towards infinite in the reverse. You never arrive at F because you infinitely keep requiring a dependence for each dependence you select. Temporal infinite in the reverse isn't a logical proposition in the only universe we know.

By analogy, suppose a dim lightbulb is connected to an infinitely long wire. In order for it to be lit up, current must reach a discrete point on the wire closest to the bulb. In order to reach any discrete point on the wire, it must have reached the precedent discrete point on the wire. So the lightbulb can never actually light up since for every point to which current should have reached, it requires it to have reached the point before it - to infinite. 




 Different authorities gave different answers as to the 'why' - but the majority Orthodox opinion seems to be against directly using electricity on shabbat itself. So electric cars would fall under many of the same issues. Even when they come out with self-driving cars running on automated schedules (so operator doesn't need to interact with it) - I'm sure some people will object. 




 You make it sound like you don't actually think there is widespread evidence of ISIS torturing captives. It's all over the place--**they don't particularly try to hide it.**

These are based on apparent witness testimonies from Kurds/Shi'ites and other opposing [stake-holders](http://www.reddit.com/r/Iraq/comments/2nnviw/two_arabs_try_to_rape_kurdish_mother_in_kirkuk/). That's not what I asked for. Let's try again - if **they don't particularly try to hide it** (assuming its occurring), you should be able to help me here: "Can you link me to one single video of that than? These guys don't shy away from the camera..." 




 His loved ones. His 'family' and friends received death threats for the duration of the witch hunt, constant media attention, had to take down their facebooks. And of course they didn't catch a break when the kid turned up dead.

I guess it didn't really ruin their lives but I can imagine they won't look back on that series of events nostalgically. 




  I would love to see a rebuttal of this by moderate Muslims.

Then ask it in /r/Islam. They'll expect you to provide a proper source though, so find the 'Arabic original of the purported Daesh tract and go on over there. 




  Also, there is something pathetic about a guy who supports a war and even helps convince others to go off to kill and die for the cause while he sits at home tweeting about it.

 Islam actually has explicit restrictions associated with going out for fighting in certain cases while your mother is still alive 




 They believe he was raised into heaven...

That's complete bull.... Show me one single hadith from the Imams saying he was raised into Heaven...he was reportedly on Earth for over a hundred years during ghaybat as saghirah and you don't have any textual support for him floating into space as part of his ghaybat al kubra. 




 Can you link me to one single video of that than? These guys don't shy away from the camera when cutting people's throats, mass executions and even driving around with corpses behind their motorcycles. Or at least some reputable source suggesting that they do. If there's volumes of evidence, it should be a pretty quick find. Let me know.

 and ISIS tortures

Is there any evidence for this or do we just assume that anything evil we do, they must also engage in? 




 drone strikes that kill without a trial and has unknown collateral damage - good

Collateral damage is known. We've targeted about 88 individuals. Over 1,000 people have died in drone strikes. 




 False equivalency

Agreed. There is no documented evidence to support that ISIS tortures their captives.

 This gives an even different context:

https://storify.com/CourtneyPFB/undercover-cops-outed-and-pull-gun-on-crowd 




 Which, as far as anybody knows, only applies to our current universe. How do you know that anything of the sort applies "before" our universe?

I didn't say anything about 'before our universe' (i.e. before space/time). I'm saying an infinite regress doesn't make sense *in the context of our universe* as an argument of time - given causality. I'm talking to *empirical causality* - so the causality we know. 




 Do I understand you correctly that you're OK with infinity up, down, left, right, front, back, and future-wise...

Unless you have a reasonable basis to suggest those aren't possibilities, I'm going to assume they're possibilities.

What makes that one direction different?

Causality. Each discrete 'moment' of time, from the present moment we experience, is causally dependent on its precedent moment. If there is no 'origin' for time in our universe, the present moment could never have been arrived at. 




 How do you know our current moment couldn't be reached?

Empirical causality.

How do you know that existence isn't cyclical? Our universe could constantly "refresh" with the death of this one being the cause or beginning of the next one.

Sure - existence could be apparently cyclical. The universe can 'die' and then 'restart'. But if those events take place in time, you still don't escape causality. And if you don't escape causality as a function of time in the material world, then you still can't have an infinite regression. 




  Regardless of how things got to right now, "this present moment" does indeed exist. The fact that perhaps you can't fathom that there may be an infinite amount of something before it doesn't mean it's not possible, only that you aren't capable of thinking about it. 

It's an ancient argument that's been stated in different ways on different topics dealing with the physical world. It's not a matter of being incapable of thinking about an infinite regress - It's simply the fact that it doesn't make sense to even posit that as an option.

I've seen people try to reference this sort of argument more than a few times in the last year or so, and I simply do not understand it. Can you try to elaborate on this point more

We can step through it. We agree that "this present moment does indeed exist" - do we agree that the moment immediately precedent to "this present moment" also did "indeed exist"? And that "this present moment" is casually related to the precedent (i.e. this moment exists because the moment before it existed)? 




 Do you see a similar problem with an infinite spatial extent that you do with an infinite temporal extent

Not a problem with an infinite temporal extent. Time can *tend towards* infinite (we can't know if it will, but it's logically plausible). Infinite 'space' also isn't inherently problematic. But you can't have 'turtles all the way down' - not in the physical universe. 




 People *in* Ferguson were burning down some shops and what-not - sure. I'm not excusing idiocy. The people protesting during the day, and the journalists covering them were not being "beat down" by the cops? I've got plenty of cases I posted submitted links about over the last few months... 




 I don't have sources - I remember reading about it in a history of Muslim conquest of India. The argument had something to do with how the Hindus had the Upanishads and some of the mashaykh and rulers accepted not only taking jizya on them but conferring rights of ahlul kitab on them as well. Do you read Urdu - I can see if I can find something more specific lying around? 




 There's plenty of different subsects of 'Buddhism' - different groups have believed different thinks afaik. 




 And you show a very poor understanding of a very simple concept . The question isn't whether infinite can exist on paper, in theory or if it can exist in positive time/space - all of which are obviously plausible. The question is if an infinite regress can exist *in the physical world* as an argument of time. In *the physical world* where each discrete moment (however subdivided) is dependent on the preceding moment, you can't have an infinite chain of dependencies and still arrive at a particular point (e.g. this moment). We're not talking about conceptualizing a number line - we're talking about whether or not there can be an infinite regress of **causes** 




 The original Kalam argument had the "everything has a cause" phrasing, only the revamped version by Craig has the new wording.

Are you saying that Craig interpolated the wording to the arguments? If so - that's patently false - it was always effectively the same as "every effect/accident (or "everything that comes into existence") has a cause". The wording isn't needed to accommodate a cause for the first accident that is itself not an accident, since that isn't what was ever posited... 




 1) How do they know it can't be an infinite regress?

How would the present exist if there were an infinite regress and no beginning? This present moment could never have been reached..

You can simplify it to something linear, imagine a casual chain where each event on a line depends on the preceding event. And the events preceding exist infinitely. You can never reach the final/current event because each dependency has its own dependency, ad infinitum. 




 Do you have a source for the version of the du'a you're referring to (from which of your hadith books it was derived)? Short answer: no. Long answer: Different parts of that du'a (as they usually originally exist in different pieces and become combined later on) may be plenty of Sunni texts but I'd need sources and original text to find out. 




 I believe it doesn't violate the Islamic principle of shirk, does it?

IMO it would. Shirk is any association w/ God. Saying anything about God outside of what is empirical or supported by texts would be shirk. An avatar afaik would be God taking on a human form (like the whole xtian - Jesus isn't God but is part of the Godhead - hence an avatar).

Also how are the Vedas seen in Islam? And during the time of Mohammad?

The Vedas, Gita, puranas etc. are not explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. There also doesn't seem to be explicit mention at the time of Muhammad. I vaguely recall a hadith (not confirmed on the authenticity) that encouraged conquest in India. It's impossible that some people weren't at least nominally familiar with it though given that Islam spread as far as China within Muhammad's lifespan (as he'd sent companions there).

At some point in time, Muslim scholars were open to considering certain Hindus as people of the book by classifying them as Sabeans or simply as a separate group. Scholarship in the region, at the time, became inclined to believe that Hindu scripture originally had the hallmarks of Monotheism but was corrupted over time (like with the canonization of the Gospels or the preservation issues with the Torah). 




 Muhammad was asked about how before Islam, he used to participate in gatherings of the notables of his tribe to assess the situation for the community and provide help to its most destitute. When he was asked about it after Islam, whether he would still attend something like that (i.e. engage in something like that with non-Muslims), he reportedly said yes. Doesn't really answer your question - but sets the stage for why Muslims tend to be focused beyond just local issues.

It's not the same exact struggle, but do people feel companionship when they're wronged in similar ways? Yea. Same way Irish revolutionaries traditionally had a sort of common understanding with Palestine. The same cops beating down in Ferguson and elsewhere in the US go to Israel for training. They use weapons designed and [tested on Palestinians](http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/1639) (google Eram Efrati for more info). It's the same struggle - down to the weapons used. 




  I wouldn't be surprised if you got shot.

Except that this is the version of events according to the cop - while several witnesses saw a man with his hands ultimately in the air being executed. Regardless of whether the cops version of the beginning of the events is accurate. And if you've dealt with cops anywhere in this country - especially in law, you'll notice that it isn't as a big deal to fudge reports, or even commit outright purgery. Examples abide in r/bad_cop_no_donut and r/law. 




 Personally - I wouldn't recommend books. Walk into a mosque if you got one near you. 




 The problem with what you're looking for is that you'll likely be really inquisitive, and any person only has so much time. There are hundreds of people reaching out to any reputable scholar, and he'd be setting aside a disproportionate time just to address your questions. I have a feeling you'll be thoroughly disappointed. 




 They've been running paid whitelists for a while now and weren't telling people. It's more in the open now and they have a business model associated with extorting the companies that run the ads. I could care less about their business model - what bothered me is the deceptive nature of initially not even disclosing the reason behind specific whitelisted domains, etc.  




 Yea, there's some pretty obvious interpretative interpolations in brackets, but w/out a direct link to source, I wouldn't trust Memri for shit beyond a gist. 




 Like, what am I even supposed to say now?

 No - I think I'm not being clear. What ISIS has released pushes even Islamists away from them. Remember the Taliban? They also put out videos, just like ISIS (not as great production value back then though). Hated by the world, recognized as the legitimate govt of Afghanistan by two countries though. Had quite a popular following and the unpopular decisions they made (like blowing up the Buddha statue) were the sort of things that the international community didn't like but your super devout Muslim could get behind.  And they were with it to the very end - opium production eliminated - crime rates down - people living and moving about in most parts controlled by them with security - even when the world super-power came knocking, they refused to accept foreign intervention and only would agree to handing the accused party over if evidence was served. They had, and have, a large fan base in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Other Islamist groups? Pakistani Taliban. When Benazir Bhutto was shot and killed, these guys denied it (and legitimately had no role it). When Malala was shot, these guys apologized. They denied accusations and apologized for mistakes - they didn't ignore the former and boast about the later. UIC (before al-Shabbab), somebody opened fire on a movie theatre from amongst their extremists. They were tried and executed. The Islamist group punished its own under the same law applied to everyone else.

Why did Muslims in these regions support groups like Taliban, Hamas, or UIC? Because these groups represented *law* in areas where all that's needed is for a dictator to ask for your head. They represented unbiased establishment of this law, and they believed several of the laws were divinely inspired. They believed - and do believe - that what they're doing is for the good of their society Muslim and otherwise, regardless of what you and I think. I can comprehend that "islamist who wants to live by the quran and hadith without compromise" perspective.

What are the ISIS videos? Let's kill a journalist with no court proceedings and evidence that our action was justifiable. Let's do the same thing with another chap. Let's do it again. Let's get an entire city of average citizens to beat some captured soldiers to death. Then ride their corpses on our motorcycles through the streets. Lets put out tracts that openly allow for slavery in spite of modern connotations. Let's do it without any apologetic material. Let's execute prisoners en-mass, with no depicted attempt at justification. Let's basically give countries an overt excuse to throw a wrench in the stated objective. Let's endanger the lives of the muhajireen (immigrants) who came to Syria during the course of the revolution.

So basically, there's a big difference between what ISIS leadership is self-representing and what those other groups self-represented. They're not currying favor with secular Arabs or devout Sunnis, they've alienated everyone including many of the more crazy devout sort. They are quite literally their own worst enemy (assuming their stated objective is truly their objective). 




 No, the interpretation is on point (assuming that this is a real ISIS document). "That their right hands possess" means slaves - it's historically always meant slaves. Islam never outright prohibited slavery, it merely discouraged it. 




 'counter productive to their jihad.'

Literally every single piece of media they've produced has been counter productive to their stated cause. Every last one. 
























 If you hate gays so much why not join ISIS?

Where'd he say he hates gays? I don't 'hate' many convicted felons on death row, and in some cases, you can even understand what drove them to commit their crimes. That doesn't change that the law prescribes for them to be executed. Where exactly does 'hate' function in this or are you incapable of talking about something without your emotions boiling over?

EDIT: I just remembered we actually spoke before. You can't tell consenting adults what they can do behind closed doors. Also based on that mentality I'm sure Islam fits you like a glove. 

Are you okay with incestuous relationships? polygamous ones? necrophiliac ones? You can get consent in all of those cases (pre-mortem in the last case - assuming consent is even needed for engaging with something non-living). Where do you draw the lines with your vastly superior moral compass? 




 In Islam, it's acting on the impulse that's prohibited. Repressing a prohibited urge is considered a good deed. For instance, if a klepto walks into a store and walks out without stealing anything, that's a good deed in Islam. 




  I'm not entirely sure the point you're making here. Are you suggesting killing someone for acting on their desire is acceptable? 

The Shari' punishment for *Muslims* being caught having certain acts is capital punishment. These punishments are at the discretion of the ruler, and have historically rarely been applied. They're also rules that apply to Muslims - non-Muslims have their own laws under the Islamic governance framework (when Muslims occupied Zoroastrian territories, they didn't prohibit tithing Zoroastrian communities from engaging in incest in spite of their abhorrence of it).

As far as this particular issue, if somebody goes to a Shari court and confesses that they had male homosexual sex, and they are found as being mentally sane and honest, capital punishment is applied. This is the same as when people confess to adulterous relations while married (capital punishment is applied). Likewise, if they are caught by four reliable witnesses (so basically they were having sex in public), the punishment is the same.

If someone chooses to act on their desire, isn't it between that person and God?

No. Some things are between you and God since the law doesn't prescribe punishments for them (i.e. breaking your fast, not praying, etc.). Other acts on desires (extra-marital affairs, theft, murder, bestiality, necrophilia,  etc.) which do have punishments 'on the books' for them - would under an Islamic state have those punishments carried out. 




 Sadly, as with every other situation, the outcome is a forgone conclusion. It will be interesting to see how japanese average people react when all is said and done. 

Not necessarily. Many countries pay off hostage takers, especially for valuable hostages, through back-door channels. 




 I was wondering what the view of abortion was in Islam; whether its interpreted differently by scholars or is covered under the Q'ranic view that one should not kill others who have not provided reason to kill them.

You might be surprised to find that several of the early church fathers didn't share the modern Christian take on abortion being outright "murder" in all cases. Like with Islam, there were discussions on when ensoulment occurs (before which a fetus is not a human anymore than sperm are humans).

After the ensoulment period, Islam doesn't *generally* allow for abortion. 




 Imagine suffering for a year and losing your closest friends and family members. Along comes a group that takes revenge on your behalf and empowers you to defend your community. That's the perspective of a plenty of people in some of these towns. In one town, daish brought out Syrian soldiers and the community beat the soldiers to death. Daish didn't even have to do anything.

Do you remember what US troops did to Fallujah after American corpses were desecrated several years ago? They sent out letters telling families to leave (while making it exceptionally difficult to leave) and then effectively bombed parts of the city into nothing, with more than just your conventional weapons.

When you live in a bubble and haven't experienced what these people have experienced - it's hard to contextualize their actions objectively. For the record - I'm not justifying this sort of thing by Daish or by the US occupation, just pointing out 'how'/'why' people do these things. 




 Plenty - but on the flip, conversion rates spike after incidents like this. Most people are just angry - but plenty are more confused than they are angry. Many of these people want to understand the greater picture, and the context, and in turn - several end up becoming Muslim. It's a recurring theme in the West. And this sub plays a quantifiable role (if we take professions of faith on here seriously) in that direction. 




 Also. Couldnt they just get a sharper knife? Use a guillotine?

The knife is sharp. They are dead with the first blow, the second one / third ones are to guarantee it (in case you didn't watch the clip) 




 inna lillahi wa inna illayhi rajioon 




 The Qur'an was talking about epistemological ideas that were not explicitly developed until the Enlightenment over a thousand years before it.

Stuff like this, and many other reasons. 




 I'm only 21 so I don't think of death as always near

I've seen people die younger than 21. 




 So, the age of earth is 1/3 of the age of the universe.

You can't necessarily draw that conclusion. We don't know where overlaps take place or if each yawm is of the same length of time. 




 It's at the least compatible with modern theory afaik. The Qur'an explicitly states that the Earth and "the heavens" were once a part of a single unit:

Do not the Unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together (as one unit of creation), before we clove them asunder? We made from water every living thing. Will they not then believe? 

As for the Earth itself, its arrival at the present state took place in sittati ayyamin (6 periods) similar to the Bible I believe.

There are certain classes of people free speech does not allow criticism of, nor does Charlie Hebdo. Their our other classes of people you are free to attack at will. 




 they aren't torturing or killing people for it like they do in Saudi Arabia.

 Zionist pig is a term that can only be applied to jews, which is an ethnicity.

You can be a Zionist without being Jewish...in fact, plenty of white Christians in the US who aren't part of the tribe in any way self-identify as Zionist.... 




 Does everyone in this sub hate jews?

Because pointing out a fact as OP does is anti-semitism /s

OP is certainly a racist sack for sure, but it's pretty desperate on your part to lump a criticism of media's dubbing this group as some sort of champions of free speech as "hating Jews"... 




 No. It's not racist. As a matter of fact they are very anti-racist.

You must be retarded or American. Have you ever opened a copy? It's a racist rag...it kinda always has been... 




 It doesn't matter that Islam isn't a race. You can have a racist agenda and attack an abstraction (like religion) that particular races tend to affiliate with. This really shouldn't be a difficult concept to grasp... 




 This will probably sound like a good point to people in America - but anybody in France can tell you that the CH staff are bigots...CH was quite literally a racist rag...its when somebody was openly bigotted of Jews - (and not in a general way by lumping criticism of Judaism with other religions - with CH has done in the past, or criticism of Israel minimized by criticism of Palestinians - which CH has also done) - that CH had an issue.

It's like the Chef guy from South Park years ago. Had no trouble attacking anyone. But the moment South Park attacked Scientology - he was offended and quit.

And that's absolutely fine under the guise of free speech, you can attack many groups and hold a special position for a certain group. You have that right under this general abstract concept. It's the fact that their rag, because of the circumstances, is being championed for being champions of free speech, when really they're a fringe publication that makes use of free speech to attack (generally) disaffected minority populations. 




 I don't like to link to DailyStormer but responding to someone by attacking them versus the content of their message is pathetic, deflective and childish as fuck. 




 I can imagine the number of random texts I'd get from dudes. That red volkswagon beattle can be deceptive.

 When it comes to issues related to Islam, Muslims or Arab terrorists, sources like Breitbart/daily mail and other trash rags often make it to the top spot in /r/worldnews. It's rather depressing really - especially since I've seen the speech and the mayor quite literally *did not* say "fuck off" - these guys can't print shit without exaggeration or respinning. 




 Yep - the internet empowers global calamities to instantly become local. Anecdotal issues become the objective recurrent reality in many people's minds. 




 Only steers and queers come from Texas - more power to you as an out-of-the-closet Moslem. There needs to be more. 




 Clearly English comprehension isn't stressed on in Texas though. 




 Half of our country relies on Fox News to be informed citizens that take part in elections. 




 We have sky news, which isn't a million miles away. But we also have the daily mail, which is pretty much fox news in paper form.

I guess the difference is that Daily Mail is generally considered a tabloid rag - a huge chunk of people in the US literally use Fox News and other such outlets as their primary source of information. 




 Either that or the dog is just legitimately stupid. 




 I don't think that's what he was attempting a "they got what was coming" esque justification - but I can see why JPost and some others would want to reframe the discussion in that way. Every time somebody attempts to explain context to a situation, rather than just telling us to be angry and mentioning how horrific it was, we get in a tizzy. 




 What bias are they depicting? From the announcement email, they're simply asking staffers to dig at the root causes of these issues (if you read the announcement in full and not the re-contextualized excerpts highlighted in the article) - if anything, that's exactly what you want out of a news outlet providing you with a basis to make informed judgements vs 'OMG the Durka Durkas are killing us for cartoons - Muh Freedoms!' 




 I have no gold to give sir - have a shekl 




 Our mosques are segerated. My halal butcher is in Bellerose, Queens and serves me last even if I arrive first. The closest mosque to me refers to me as "abeed." If I go to Friday prayer at the mosque near me, people don't pray next to me and they switch into their language when talking around me. 

And you're 100% sure this is because of your skin color? It couldn't possibly have anything whatsoever to do with the values you espouse? Which you vocalized at least on Reddit - and I'm sure you've vocalized at these different places? Not to dismiss your experience - I just want to know if it isn't conflation and re-contextualization..

I've been to mainstream mosques in 4 states and 3 countries, and never once experienced anything like what you're talking about. Maybe NYC is just a cess pool... 




  Many black Muslims first found Islam through the NOI so Farrakhan deserves a bit of thanks for just getting islam out there.

Plenty of people in the US found Islam 'because of' 9/11. Good things can often come from bad things, you don't go around praising/thanking the orchestrator of something that isn't good. 




  NOI is not black supremacist actually. They view all Afro-Asiatic people as the same.

So it's an Afro-Asiatic supremacist organization disguised as a religion. 




 17 isn't pedophilia.

In UK, underage laws are at 16... 




 I don't know about /r/worldnews, but that is quite literally the exact response I've gotten from someone. When somebody on the fringe does something 'bad', he's a true representative of the religion. When somebody does something 'good', he represents only himself and is one of the rare handful of 'good' people that believe in Islam:

Be better at bullshitting. Look, I am the most consistently anti-Islamic poster in this sub by a longshot, and yet even I am happy to acknowledge Muslims whose conduct warrants praise. The "fringe elements" are, in fact, representative of Islam generally. But, even as toxic as the religion generally may be, its sheer size means that there have always been and will always been individuals who self-identify as Muslims who are still excellent people. The man in question is one such example. So I am happy to praise him, but with the understanding that he is a credit to himself, not some typical representative of his religion. But by all means, keep straw manning the position of those of us who are critical of Islam. 




 Charlie Hebdo weren't killing in the name of freedom of speech.. They weren't violent.. 

But they *were* an extremist fringe. Nobody said they were violent, but their vitriol wasn't representative of French thought as a generality or as a majority. The same applies to the men who killed them. The comment by the AJ staff member isn't about violence, but the values espoused by the two groups. 




 Oh no -- something that shatters the view of Muslims as a monolith characterized by the fringe elements of the group. 




 You didn't get it because you were the butt of the joke. 




  I was laughing hard throughout but find it hard to imagine people got the references through out it.

He was having a go at another comedian ;) 




 I'm actually not a bigot. But I've learned how to reap the benefits of the bigotted karma train on reddit. Say something objectively true in a coherent manner followed by a disgusting bigoted comment in the guise of rational analysis - and notice how the obvious bigotry won't even be registered by most people. It won't be registered because most of the people reading and upvoting the absurdity I posted are imbeciles of r/worldnews and view groups they classify as the 'other' as monolithic entities. 




 has claimed them too,

No - 2 individuals (Cohen and somebody else) have claimed that those groups have claimed them, in contradicting narratives. The story grows more implausible. 




 It's okay - it happened years ago and it's not the same thing as killing a bunch of bigoted cartoonists so it won't get the world riled up. /s 




 Not only that. It might also never have happened.
There is literally no follow-up to be found on the internet that supports that this story is true.

In your exhaustive 0 minutes of research you were unable to find any corroboration and therefore the story should be just dismissed. Alrighty. I was alive when that happened - I remember hearing about it when it happened and it was covered extensively - nice minimization and dismissal of other people's suffering though.

How about actually looking into stuff before making bullshit speculations? 




 Most of this sub is that sub-set of Sunnis that use Reddit. Make of it what you will.

 Rule 30. 




 Maybe they'll start blowing each other up for a change.

For a change? In Syria, rebel groups fight each other more than they fight the Syrian government that they originally set out to depose. And even as a general rule, the victims of these terrorist groups are by large majority, other Muslims. 




 My question is why is it even offensive to make fun of your religion.

Go around Comptom in klan gear yelling "Niggers are monkies", and then when you're getting your ass beat, explain that it meant nothing to you and you were just having a laugh.

Islam is something that a lot of people identify with, it's something they associate with their families, their ancestors, their friends, and themselves. You can't expect to make fun of something - that is the most important something for many people - and expect a handful of them to be a little less willing to play by the rules of their country. Especially in a place like France where most of these Muslims are a marginalized minority growing up in the ghetto.

On top of that I don't imagine all powerful God needs you to defend his honor.

God doesn't need anything from you in Islam. You don't pray because praying keeps God alive, you pray for yourself.

I don't think these criminals were thinking "well in God's moment of weakness, I'll go defend him". You're coming from a very transactional, need/desire fulfillment based culture I imagine so you're conflating it with mindset of people like this, but that sort of recontextualization won't help you understand what happened imo. 




 They knew they were being provocative and have faced threats in the past, I'm quite frankly a bit surprised that everyone is so surprised about it. And I don't understand how they didn't have stronger security precautions in place.

Right? If you're going to make a living on the overtly bigoted notions of a small percentage of the national population - you've got to have at some point considered that your exercise of free speech might not be well received everywhere. Imagine somebody walking through a ghetto in the states in full klan gear yelling 'niggers are stupid'. Free speech and all, but you know what you're doing isn't gonna get you kisses and hugs.

That doesn't make what those guys did right, but everyone that exercises speech that is inflammatory makes a calculated risk. And the same people crying foul about this horrendous incident were nowhere to be seen when George Galloway was getting assaulted by a Jewish guy, or when European revisionist historians were being interred as state policy in many places. 




 Well the ritual was annual for the Maya - I'm sure you can find sources on that. And I don't think they sacrificed entire villages at a time, but no, I can't back up the '1' figure that I posed with a 'like' and '?' to suggest I'm not making an overt claim since I don't honestly know. 




 Why else would he just run into them like that?

If he was one of the hostages. 




 Yea - that whole "the hostages died before we came in" isn't seeming super believable. These guys were almost as trigger happy as [Florida police](http://therundownlive.com/florida-cops-fire-nearly-400-rounds-killing-2-injuring-2-police/) 




 Worked in Pakistan after the school shooting - might work in France too, hope we don't drift into barbarity because of anecdotal events... 




 
Dunno if it's a sin, but questioning aspects [of the holocaust narrative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_against_Holocaust_denial) is certainly illegal in plenty of countries. Including in France. 




 Forget hate speech against Jews, how many of these same "Western liberals" raised an outcry over the consistent imprisonment of revisionist **historians**. Not bigoted cartoonists - historians. How many of these same "Western liberals" came to the defense of MP George Galloway when he was physically assaulted for his freedom of expression?

How many of these same "Western liberals" are defending the hate preacher Abu Hamza al Misri that just got sentenced on trumped up charges today - charges we know are trumped up given that our government has a policy of torturing terror suspects in custody (now undeniable) and UK was unable to even bring the same case to court with the same evidence for the last 10+ years - because they knew they didn't have a case. Raid after raid, arrest after arrest, they found they couldn't build the case. As soon as the chap gets extradited to the good ol' US of A - suddenly there's a bullet-proof case against him justifying perpetual imprisonment in effectively solitary confinement. 




 They sacrificed - what - like 1 kid a year? How many kids die on average each day for the freedom and democracy abstraction? 




 the fuck is silktricky.com 




 You think people move to "the West" for the freedom?

This. My ancestors moved because they were bound by chains and told they had to pick cotton and live in American style perpetual slavery - because we were the unlucky descendents of Cain that happened to get caught. 




 The whole idealogy of Hinduism is based on non-violence.

The central Hindu texts like the Gita are warrior epics dealing directly with the justification of war...

The post-Gandhi popularizations are no more Hindu than the myriads of religious tradition throughout the sub-continent...

 It's not about it being popular, it's about ensuring that your opponents make their political dialogue anti-Islamic. That rhetoric will guarantee your Muslim base even if they disagree with you politically or on topics like this.

As far as people having open support for this in some cultures, its not hard to imagine - people kill each other over politics, momma jokes, and other 'petty shit' all the time. 




 Out of the woodwork? This is a prominent individual in India, and he's cleverly manipulating the discourse to benefit from polling - nobody's crawling out of any woodwork, it's a well calculated political move. 




 Those Muslims are just doing exactly what they are supposed to do. Kill White men and fuck White women (notice the girlfriend of one of the attackers is White). How else do you think they will destroy Europe? Growing up in what is now a Muslim area, we were attacked all the time by Muslims and Blacks in order to isolate us and get White women (who they treat like whores). When Muslims go to a club where there are lots of pretty White women, they will start fights in order to make the White men leave so they can prey on the White women. It is Sexual Jihad. It works very well and many societies have been conquered and destroyed using this as well as other techniques. Countries which were Buddhist, Christian, Pagan or Hindu before are now majority Muslim because of these techniques.

It worked in my home. Eventually, we had to leave my neighborhood. There were just too many of them.

 Hey sis. 




 You can tell the poor chap is falling head-first into an existential crisis. 














 I'm going to take a swing and guess "proletariat" is not Reddit's core user base. Apparently your average city cop isn't "working class" according to these clowns. 

You can be working class and still be aligned against your own interests, the same way you can be black and vote against your own social interests, or be a poor Christian and vote against your own economic interests. There were Jews in the gestapo...your criticism of their use of the term isn't very well-reasoned. 




 He didn't say "just".... 




 Absolutely, police are always re-educating those silly serfs trying to go 10 over the limit and parking a few minutes over their metered time. "millions of times a day" to give out "countless different" infractions to help direct the course of civilization and most definitely not to generate revenue. 




 So the bukket is a grower not a shower - very impressed never-the-less 




 I would share with a neighbor--Muslim, Jewish, Christian, Athiest, or alien--without a second thought about it, simply because watching someone else suffer would cause me suffering. We are all HUMAN.

What if he wasn't suffering (as the individual in the OP)? What if he appeared to live more lavishly than you even and seemed like a complete asshole. Does simple innate humanism drive you to go share your meal with him then? Or does being 'HUMAN' generate envy, possibly dislike, in that particular case?

Empathy doesn't drive you to do acts of kindness, it only allows to you notice when somebody is in a state that you wouldn't like to be in and you are naturally moved to move them from that state. And even that only if you *happen to* to observe an individual distressed with your own eyes (or hear about it). What OP is suggesting is an unprovoked kindness, one that isn't driven by simple empathy... 




 I wonder if he thinks it's equally absurd to believe that the universe and everything in it was created for us alone by a being who we cannot hear, see, touch, taste, or smell

Is it as absurd as the idea of multiverses that by definition exist such that we cannot hear, see, touch, taste or smell them?

 




 Livin the American dream 




 Ahhhhh... thank you kind sir - have an upvote - I've been googling for about 20 minutes and racking my brain - leave no joke unturned as they say. 




 Hey there

I don't know what exactly you're looking for, but here's a Google search of a pretty useful English Academic Islamic website on the topic of Moses

https://www.google.com/search?q=moses btnG=Search domains=www.islamic-awareness.org sitesearch=www.islamic-awareness.org

As far as the Biblical and Islamic accounts, they aren't exactly identical - and the Islamic account is nowhere near as detailed with specifics. The Qur'an has a very limited focus on stories and the idea is that the past stories included in the Qur'an were mentioned because of direct benefit to be drawn from them. So coming from a Christian background, when you read an exclusively Islamic account of - say Moses - it'll feel like a Sparknotes version. Islamic texts neither confirm, nor deny, many aspects of these older stories - or the talmudic/church interpretations of them.

If you look up tafseer (interpretation) of Qur'an, you'll note that scholars will often use what Muslims call 'Israeliyyat' (stories of the Tribe of Israel) that Muslims inherited from Christians and Jews to supplement the information explicitly found in Muslim sources (Qur'an and hadith). And the Muslim treatment of these stories is:

(a) if a detail is confirmed in the Qur'an/Ahadith, then the preceding detail is accepted as true.
(b) if the detail is contradicted by Qur'an/Ahadith, then the Islamic narrative trumps preceding narrative.
(c) if the detail has no testimony whatsoever in Qur'an/Ahadith, then the Muslim stance is neither to accept nor reject it's veracity.

This might be especially useful to you however since Israeliyyat aren't necessarily just what you find in tanakh or even mishnah, or presently existing non-canonical texts. In this sense, the Muslim scholars retained some pieces of information that aren't presently available anywhere else. So if you have access to a library with a volume of an English translation of tarikh at-Tabari (History [of the World] by al-Tabari), then you'll have an even greater volume of information on Moses stories that were known as late as about 800 AD (but the veracity of which can't be established without further research of course).

All that said - the story of Moses is actually pretty big in the Qur'an - I think Moses is actually mentioned by name more times than Muhammad himself in fact. Different details about Moses are found in different parts of the Qur'an since it isn't a book in the traditional sense, but a good place to start is [Surah 28](http://quran.com/28).

 I was just explaining the theological reasoning behind why the word 'revert' is used by Muslims. It's a presumption based on Islamic theology - all created souls are created cognizant of their creator (even before you acquire self-awareness as a child a few years later).

By comparison - you have Christians who baptize children before any reasonable consent is physically possible. To these groups, the child is 'Christian' before he can say 'Christ'. The only differences are that Islam forgoes baptism and considers all children as being born Muslim, and the concept of original sin never actually comes into play in Islam since children are inherently sinless in the religion. 




 Allahu Akbar = God is Great. Takbir is what you say to ellict that (the word to describe the saying).

I imagine you want to throw together a micro-brew and market it through controversy. As far as calling your drink "Takbeer" - you won't get far imo. 




 Explicit tahreem of cannibalism is not in the Qur'an either. Hell, you won't even find a saheeh hadith prohibiting cannibalism. The Qur'an only has give or take 500 legal verses, with repetition - and the law is a lot more expansive than that. Just 2 cents. 




 In Islam, its considered reversion because in Islam the natural state of a human being is that of a sinless Muslim. So for Muslims, Churchill, like all people, was born a Muslim but was taught something outside of his nature by his family, etc.

 Why's the dinner on your sister's arm though? 




 I've consulted someone who has spent all their college years specializing in the Arabic language and it seems that, according to them, the word for interest would be "faedah" vs "Reba" or "Banhith" (usury). 

Faedah simply means benefit in Arabic. Riba literally means 'increase' in Arabic. It's not a direct translation to usury so even the post-Henry definition of usury that negates smaller interest isn't applicable to the literal definition of the word.

The definition of a religious term also isn't simply by linguistics (which is sufficient here imo) but by how the term was defined in tradition. I can put together a small book with the number of traditions on rib'a. In context of all of those, every money earned on money lending is riba - no distinction is clearly made between small and large amounts. To be specific, there are traditions which explicitly discourage even accepting paltry gifts - even 'a rope of straw' - from people when they repay your principle due.

In particular, if you look at the history of the cancellation of riba, the Prophet instructed his followers to pay back their principle and not pay a dime of the riba (that was owed to the money lenders). If the intention was that small amounts of riba were okay, than he wouldn't have allowed his followers to forego paying *anything* over the principle to the creditors of ta'if and elsewhere.

Citing commerce as a normal means of making money, including charging "reasonable" interest rates on loans, etc.

That's not the obvious reading of the ayah and I've never heard of any mufassir of repute suggesting what you're implying here. The people who used to take usury said "this is just business" (like non-usurious business). It's not suggesting that business/commerce is loans - the usury takers compared it to investments/risks associated with trade. 




 General consensus among Shia scholars is that tattoos are allowed. Many believe that to be a weak hadith.

There is ijma amongst Usooli Ithna Ashari's on tatoos?? Do you have any actual proof? 




 People are not hermaphrodites, they are intersex. I hate this bigoted sub sometimes.

Out of curiosity - how is that bigoted? Is hermaphrodite not an accepted term anymore? 




 The ruling for hermaphrodites was classically that they don't marry either gender (and we've had surgery available to hermaphrodites since ancient times). You'd want to reach out to a scholar, but I'd imagine that given the rule for hermaphrodites doesn't change in spite of surgery - the ruling of a transgendered person also would be similar. 




  Correction they do remove something. But you are still rude for trying to validate "what a real woman is". There are plenty of people who are legally a woman but we're not born with a uterus or ovaries. Or what about women who have to have them removed due to various medical reasons? Are they not "real women" anymore.

The point would've been that there are 'real women' - in that there people who are naturally born with female genitals and aren't hermaphrodites. One day - they might have an accident and some parts of their body may have to be removed - this doesn't change that they were naturally born women. Because they are 'real women', the rules and suggestions associated with women still apply to them (in general) and only rules specifically related to their (now missing) parts become void. 

For instance, would you be just as offended if I said that a child born without legs isn't a real biped? Humans - in general - are. But by definition, he isn't. Even if he later has surgery and receives working mechanical legs. He doesn't become a 'real biped' or naturally born a 'biped'. The reason this is important from the Islamic perspective is that - as with gender - some rules and suggestions apply to people based on their physical attributes. Somebody born without legs isn't required to do things like wash their feet during wudhu for their prayers. Let's suppose they have new mechanical limbs - the rule for them doesn't change all of a sudden.

So it is a technical issue and I highly doubt the intent was to offend.

That's neither here nor there - rules in Islam are secondary to the main point of Islam: tawheed (accepting the Oneness of God). Everything else, like following rules even if they are seemingly inconvenient for you, is just a physical manifestation of accepting what God is and what our roles are.

Either way I may some day have female private parts and identify as a woman. *edit still not sure if I will have Srs. It's a big decision regardless of morality.

I don't know you - and I have no idea what you're going through so I am not really in a place to say what you should and should not do. As you know though, going through with what you're considering is an irreversible change. And as someone who cares - regardless of your religious persuasion or decision regarding this issue, I would encourage reading *everything* you possibly can on the issue from all sides - moreso what medical professionals say on the topic through study than what some politically motivated organizations might say.

One of the foremost medical institutions in our country (Johns Hopkins) stopped using surgery as a treatment for GID. And in spite of the direction that political correctness is taking us, [full length studies](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0016885) suggest that this treatment isn't working. To TL;DR some of the most problematic study findings:

(a) An incidence of suicide 20x that of the naturally organed population - suggesting that our solution of surgery is not working to treat GID.

(b) A finding that the majority of people who underwent surgery (of a sample) still had psycho-social adjusments that had not improved (from pre-surgery) - again, suggests that our solution is not working.

(c) Another study on non-trans people who felt they were naturally incorrectly assigned a gender - that 80% spontaneously lost this sense of improper identity over the course of time.

But regardless of what decision you make, just make sure its well-thought out and researched. Wishing you the best. 




 What you're missing is that most cases in the gay population are among blacks. So they end up stigmatizing all gay men because they wouldn't dare single out blacks in the same manner.

 Quran arabic corpus also translates Ribaa as usury, and usury is charging 'excessive' interest. 

That's the post-King Henry-ish defintion of usury for English-people. You won't have a one-to-one translation of all Arabic words to their similar English ones. Ribaa means 'interest' - full stop - not just 'excessive interest' and the proof is in the traditions dealing with it.

Imagine if we started saying that the prohibition on pre-marital sex, and alcohol is just on doing it too much? What's left of the religious prohibitions at that point?

 Being anything is not a sin. But voluntarily removing a working member from your body *is* a sin in Islam, and castration in particular *is* explicitly prohibited. That said - it was something OP would've done before Islam. 




 That's a literal instruction about literal things - even if the expression "one of its wings" isn't literal. If a fly falls in your drink, you're suppose to dunk it. Have you ever thought about why flies are able to do just fine even though they land in feces and what-not all the time? They have anti-bacterial agents that counteract the 'poisons' their bodies pick up. You dunk the fly in the drink a few times and now in addition to the poisons it added by landing in your drink, it gave you the antibacterial agents from within and without it.

The tradition you're comparing to this about Hell's effects on weathers (or fevers) has nothing in common with it. The tradition you opened this thread with is talking about something that isn't known to exist in our universe (Hell) having an effect on something in our universe. That isn't testable. That's the same as saying the angel Izrael takes life vs saying cancer/car accident takes your life. Not testable, not empirical - and neither tradition contradicts our empirical knowledge because its not a statement about an interaction between two things that exist **here**.

If you had a tradition of the Prophet saying that a certain crater on Mars is the reason we have extreme heat and wind, you can test that. It's a statement about something **in this universe** having an effect on something else **in this universe**. It would necessarily be empirically observable and if it wasn't, we'd have an issue. 




 You have an institution which keeps telling us "there are bad apples, but our cops in general are good." Yet it explicitly chooses *not to purge itself*. It has a culture of discrimination that is demonstrably not anecdotal. And you have unions that protect and legitimize bad behavior by protecting the supposedly "rare" "handful" of "bad cops". Its intimate relationship with the judicial branch specifically allows wanton abuse.

 When you say fulan died, we say Izrael took his soul (i.e. why he died). That doesn't diminish from the empirical reason why he died (cancer, car accident, etc.) - I don't see why this hadith is problematic w/ respect to the empirical causes of extreme heat/cold.

How is it explained?

"We see that they are not stopping," he says, suggesting the fight was now heading south to the port of Mariupol. "It doesn't take a genius to see what they are trying to do. They are taking more and more strategic points." The former ambassador was in the room during the attempts to broker a political solution with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Minsk. "Personally I don't trust him," he says. "You look at him and you think, 'Are you serious?'" "Nobody knows what is going on in his head. I believe he is becoming very emotional [over the two countries' historic ties]," he suggests, calling Putin's intentions "difficult to predict." 




 Same thing - in a lot of these smaller grocery stores, it makes sense for somebody to wait out and just get your order.

 According to what I've read, islamic law changes dramatically when a Caliphate is declared.

Islamic law isn't really affected by leaders, the legal precepts come from Muslim jurists. The basics of Islamic law fall into a spectrum of acceptable opinions (to mainstream Sunni Muslims) and deviations. A caliphate may pick and choose from different parts of the legal tradition, but they don't actually themselves have an effect on the law (in theory).

 Alleged petty criminals (usually poor people) don't typically go after the media outlets that paint them as monsters. Police departments however, can. In many ways given that reporters often depend on these guys for local stories. 




 Agreed. We need to stop having the cities dole out millions of dollars and start punishing the cops if we actually want change. 




 No - morally speaking, it's disgusting. Legally, not recording yourself committing a crime isn't akin to 'evidence tampering' (destroying evidence of your crime after the fact).

 He's Dutch - it's a Dutch accent. 




 Well, that's convenient. 




 It's not a reference to the original crusade. They call any Christian who opposes them a Crusader. 




  I'm not sure what do you mean by 'better'.

TBF - he's saying the new govt is better for non-Muslims since Morsi wasn't able to control the localized Copt/Muslim conflicts while the current govt is. 




 The reason the Japanese and Jordanian death created such an emotional reaction was because they made us first think there was hope for their survival. That there was an exchange. Its like a plot twist to make us angry. 

TBF, there actually is always hope for survival. They're like any other criminal gang, when the price is paid, they've let go of hostages in numerous cases (more times than they've killed hostages). In the case of Jordan, you might not be aware that during negotiations, Jordan allegedly ran a (failed) operation to save the hostage. I have a feeling that played a substantial role in what took place. As a specific example, you might note that the American woman they were holding hostage (who died in a Jordanian operation post execution of the pilot) explicitly mentioned her peers being freed (they delivered that letter we all saw).

Currently they're holding a fuck-ton of Peshmerga as hostages and they're in talks about a trade with the Kurds. I'm willing to bet that those Peshmerga hostages will get traded for the ISIS hostages being held by the Kurds as the Kurds don't have that same mentality of 'we don't negotiate with Terrorists' and though our (US) advisers will probably discourage it, they'll make the deal to save their loved ones. 




 They are obviously still upset about the previous crusades though.

I don't think so, there's plenty of modern issues to be upset about. The use of 'crusade' is entirely symbolic, the same way Bush referred to it as a 'Crusade' on one occasion as have other Christians in the military. It's not a reference to the original Crusade which no Christian I've known is particularly proud of - just a symbolic phrase.

They are always talking about killing the Pope and conquering rome.

Killing the pope? That's a mistranslation at best - what video did they say that in? When these guys reference "ar-Rum", it's not a reference to Rome proper in Italy or to the Vatican - it's historically been a general reference to "The West". Today - it's a reference to US hegemony / NATO / Allied powers. It's like when in medieval times, Europeans referred to Muslims as "Saracens" - it didn't mean the Saracens proper but Muslims in general.

My two cents - If we want to know what these people's grievances are objectively (something we need to do if there's ever going to be a lasting peace), I don't think its smart to write things off as an 'age-old' desire for revenge. In their statements, they don't say they're avenging the barbarity of the old Crusades - like ever. They particularly speak about activity that took place over the last 50 years and certain conditions that persisted into the modern age. 




 Wow, so they killed all these people just because some lady was forced to go back to the Christian church? Don't they do this shit all day in Saudi Arabia?

She was also [purportedly tortured at some point.](http://www.thecairopost.com/news/137567/uncategorized/sisi-egypt-has-right-to-respond-to-is-execution-of-egyptians-in-libya)

 They could probably actually have some sort of Islamic State if they weren't so psychotic.

Yea - probably. Doesn't seem like the end game of the leadership though.

I love how obsessed ISIS is with the crusades. I wonder if they realize that most of the western world doesn't even care about the pope. They can't get over some event that happened like 800 years ago.

When they talk about Crusade, they're referring to modern wars - not the actually Crusades or Papal authority.

 




 I'm surprised this isn't receiving much attention.

 Gotta kill as many civilians as possible before the ceasefire comes into effect! Get with the program!

 No - they haven't. They hit mainstream media after the hashtag campaign - CNN (the first mainstream outlet to pick it up) did so 14 hrs after the fact. The comparison is being made to the recent Ottawa killing, or the axe-attack, etc. One type of issue (this one) was getting no attention and even later, only sanitized reporting, while the others were dramatic, immediate and full-day without a massive public campaign....

 It's not "tolerant" of other beliefs to deny Christ's statement that he is the only way to Heaven (as attributed to him in the Bible) - it's just denial of canon... 




 As a rule - yes. But Muslims can't say "so and so" non-Muslim is in Hell. Islam differentiates between a general statement ('anyone who commits shirk goes to the fire') vs a specific statement about an individual (so and so is in the fire because so and so committed shirk). 




 It's pretty obvious Jordan killed her accidentally. If ISIS did it - they would have a well-produced twisted video of it. Their story is pretty believable in this situation. 




 It is. The issue is that media is selective in "trying to understand". In certain cases, no such attempt is made and a rush to conclusions is the drivel you generally get. In other cases, there is an "attempt to understand". 




 It's appropriate for the US to supply cold war era weapons for the new cold war.

 I'm afraid you're just an idiot and this is an urban myth concocted by little hicks with too much free time, internet and a nominal understanding of Islam. Being "tainted" with pigs blood doesn't make it impossible for a Muslim to be martyred (according to Islam). All it does is affect the living (making them ritually unclean requiring them to wash up before prayer).

 That was my immediate thought. My follow-up thought was that the people likely to break the law in retaliation to getting butt-fucked like this are the untethered single individuals with few future prospects in life and no dependents. Which leads me to believe that the people these guys are screwing over tend to be the exact people who can't retaliate - people with families that will just need to get over it, move on and get screwed by someone else in the near future.

 That's not really true though.

 Why isn't there more on Mo from these unbiased sources?

Most of the tribes in Arabia at the time converted to Islam, within Muhammad's life time and the succeeding generations. If everybody is on your team by the time you die - then all sources that talk about you would logically be 'biased' sources no?

There is some material from biased non-Muslim sources as well - you can start [here](http://www.islamic-awareness.org/History/Islam/Inscriptions/earlysaw.html) and then consult the voluminous literature around the early community used in the references.

 100 lashes in Singapore. Not 100 lashes in Saudi Arabia:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4r_izRZYLw 




 He is putting effort into it - he's doing exactly what Saudi/Islamic law permits for lashing (90 degree arm angle maximum, not striking the same spot twice in a row, no more than 100 at a time, no breaking the skin, etc.) 




 Flogging in Saudi Arabia is always public. It would be very difficult to list it as suicide. It also doesn't depend on who's doing it (in Saudi Arabia) since all the administrators need to follow the same rules. 




 The king doesn't directly control the judiciary. 




 You're thinking of the wrong kind of lashes. These are lashes in accordance with Saudi law:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4r_izRZYLw 




 It's 10x the amount given out per session. But they're not administered at once, he'll see 50 per week. 




 1000 lashes like this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4r_izRZYLw

Spread out over the course of 50 per week. 




 Those *are* the norm for Saudi Arabia. That's literally all the lasher is allowed to do (90 degress, no hits on the same spot twice in a row, not allowed to break skin, etc.) 




 [It's not as bad as you think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4r_izRZYLw) - you'd probably easily be able to take one. 




 I think [you'd be fine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4r_izRZYLw) 




 You're thinking of Singapore canings. This is what Saudi lashing looks like:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4r_izRZYLw 




 No. His lawyer argued that he needed it put off while his family wrote to the press. His lashing was identical:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4r_izRZYLw

And all the lashings in Saudi Arabia follow the same guideline (the administrator of the punishment is subject to the courts for overdoing the religious restrictions on how its to be done). 




 It's not, Islam stipulates rules for lashings. Here's Badawi's punishment for the week of Jan 9th:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4r_izRZYLw 




 true:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4r_izRZYLw 




 As somebody else clarified - I should've said twice in a row.

I got caned two strokes at school for splitting someones lip and the bloody housemaster managed to cross the strikes being the sadistic fuck he was.

your experience was probably a bit different from this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4r_izRZYLw 




 A forum for gay minors. So...'An underage boys gay site.' 




 Much of the rest of the world, beyond the Americas and Europe is pretty "anti gay". Historically, much of the West was also "anti gay". Times change of course 




 He is alleged to have specifically and seriously libeled one of two of the major academic institutions of Saudi Arabia - there's a reason CNN will mention the flogging but you won't find anyone actually discussing the blog posts. The change he (and some other young Saudis like him) was petitioning for is increased secularization, but more importantly, an overhaul of the academic and judicial system in Saudi.

By making this a big international issue (which is what he and his family have been doing - since seeking asylum - through the medical claim, etc.) - the regime will have to step in and over-rule the judiciary. The hope is (in addition to his case being overturned) that there will be a precedent set for greater 'freedom of expression', that will include being allowed to make the sort of claims he did about Saudi establishments.

An unintended consequence though is that an action by the ruler in favor of Badawi could stoke tensions within the kingdom. In Islamic law, there has always been a seperation between the judicial system and the executive role. So when Muslim leaders had a dispute with the populace, they had to be judged by an independent third party. When a judge has a dispute with a citizen, they go to another judge. And religion, in theory, places enough fear in the judges from taking sides because so-and-so is a peer or a friend.

You can see exactly what 'lashes' are in Saudi Arabia as somebody snuck a camera during his Jan 9th lashing. Unless he has some sort of critical condition, at 32 years of age, he can definitely take the caning and did just fine during his first lashing. Regardless of what we might think about the Saudi judicial system [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcYK3xqcAEY) isn't exactly some kind of tortuous punishment. It's arguably a lot less painful than some of the things that happen in our own penitentiaries.

And the administrators of corporal punishment in Saudi Arabia also have rules to abide by so it doesn't actually get more 'brutal' than this. You can't go more than 90 degrees with your arm, you can't hit the same spot twice in a row, you're not allowed to break the skin, etc. The shame associated with the punishment has a more powerful effect (except for this guy) then the physical aspect.

That said, I'm not saying I agree with happened - just clarifying that the images most people have of these punishments outside of Muslim circles is more based on surreal superstitions and hypotheses absent actual context. Hopefully that was helpful. 




 just that as Jesus said, let he who has not sinned cast the first stone.

Hate to be that guy - but Jesus didn't actually say that. The popular passage was actually a centuries later interpolation (and that's if we can truely regard much of the Bible what 'Jesus said') 




 You might. Saudis don't (look at their crime rate), they also have other dissuading factors like shame. 




 It's in the comments slightly above. It's interesting though how many people without any knowledge of Islam or Saudi law jump (reasonably) to the same false conclusion that you did. 




 Maybe his really were brutal?

They probably weren't and medically he's probably fit. But you don't create social change by being honest to gullible foreigners. 




 Saudis are the barbarians while we send kids to get their ass pounded. 




  there might be much worse approaches, depending on the crime and person.

There isn't. You don't go more than 90 degress and you don't hit the same spot twice. Only thing to make it worse would've been if he had to take his shirt off (which is plausible). 




 He still has really bad scars on his back almost 20 years later and told me it was fucking excruciatingly painful FAR worse than you'd imagine.

Lashes are different depending on where you go. In Saudi Arabia, they aren't (technically) allowed to pull their arm all the way back and then lash. They aren't allowed to go more than 90 degress. So he wouldn't die, or even scar - its more about slight pain and plenty of humiliation. 




 Oh, well that's not too trippy - I guess you lucked out, I've seen some weird shit. 




 Open the ta'weez and see what is written inside (assuming you're Desi). You may be in for an unpleasant surprise. 




 It's comical. Unless you're American. Than it just becomes sad. 




 That explanation would work for why Miami and NY cater to a Jewish base. It doesn't go anywhere to explain even an iota of what's been going since [documentation at least as early as the tenure of former congressman Findley.](http://www.amazon.com/They-Dare-Speak-Out-Institutions/dp/155652482X)

 Shhhhh 




 You can't blame Bibi for trying - not like we haven't been doing their bidding for years. 




 and the torture

Interestingly, besides the senate report on torturey stuff that we've done - the Extremists aren't actually known for torture. There's no veritable evidence, or propaganda video by them where they actually torture someone. Our allies have plenty of videos like that (the Iraqi army), but the other crazy guys don't. 




 sure 




 Muslims believe it's real. Muslims also believe in angels, so this thing isn't really a stretch.

If we suppose that Muhammad fabricated the entire incident though, it's a bit interesting that he would choose an insignificant sounding animal the size of a 'mule' and not something a little cooler like a dragon. 




 Well he didn't actually get to lead a rebellion against Yazid, even if that was his intention. He was killed before that was even a plausible possibility. 




 Those are just artist renderings. But Muslims do believe that during isra, there was an animal called Buraq which the Prophet rode. 




 Sure - just don't say it in public out of respect for the living who suffered under some of those rulers. Pray for them all you want in private. 




 The people in charge need another old figurehead. May God forgive the Kings. 




 There actions are still documented...the Islamic pov is just not to insult/attack people when they're dead. 




 No. He was Muslim for all intents and purposes. There is no veritable evidence for takfir. 




 IT IS HARAM TO REBEL AGAINST **MUSLIM** RULER. Those are words of Prophet Muhammad!

100% agree with the statement, you respect the ruler even if he's a Khariji Muslim who took power by force. But as for Assad - He's a Rafidi, and an Alawi Rafidi to boot...

I dare you. Go and make revolution in USA or Morocco and see how government will react. YOU WILL BE KILLED too if you will fight the government with froce.

So you're telling me if a group of people took up positions, with weapons and threatened government officials in the USA or Morocco, those leaderships would annihilate that entire group of people (women and children and all) - for the sake of shutting down one rally? And then allow the country to be torn apart by civil war? 




 If a significant portion of an ethnic population in your country ascribed itself to a particular religion, in exclusion to the religion of your own majority ethnic group, and you attacked the icons of their religion (and thereby them) - it's not a leap to draw racism, and at the least, xenophobia...

By your logic, most Stormfront material wouldn't even be racist since apparently in order to implicate racism we need something explicit only. 




 Terrorist attacks are not logical, sorry.

Sorry, you're an idiot. He's saying it's logical for the perps to be Muslim in Muslim countries given that Muslims are the majority in Muslim countries. It's statistics - but you might want to start with a more basic use of numbers before we journey into the world of probabilities and what-not. 
























 Thanks - [I finally got a chance to briefly take a look](http://library.islamweb.net/hadith/asaneed.php?bk_no=664 cid=4564 sid=720) (didn't check that the other wordings are identical) - but I may have had bad information here since some of these are at least purportedly hasan. I was taught that cannibalism was haram by ijma and not by an actual textual proof so I must've misunderstood that at some point to have meant there was no textual proof while there seems to be. 














 A recent fatwa has been placed against calling them apostates

**{citation needed}**

i have heard of bad things they have done but I haven't heard of takfir... I know for a fact some shias do takfir but it is not representative of us, same way daesh is not representing sunnis. 

Look - I'm sure you don't believe this garbage, the idea that the Prophet of The All-Knowing God handpicked a bunch of his closest companions who would turn around and betray him and leave the religion...I'm just pointing out that it's absolutely intellectually dishonest for you to pass that off as a general/pervasive opinion among Shi'ites, or what the religious texts support.

This is not like the issue of Daesh not representing Sunnis. Daesh are literally only a handful of Sunnis. Out of over a billion people, Daesh are a couple thousand. That's nothing.

The takfir on the Sahaba in general *"illa thalatha"* (or some other number) in the Twelver religious texts (**literally chapters are titled by this issue**), and by the founders of the religion (the early scholars) is insanely extensive...This doesn't come from the lecture of some po-dunk Molvi in Pakistan during an Ashura sermon...I'd be happy to link you to examples if you're legitimately unfamiliar with this - do you understand Arabic? 




 The notion "your madhab", "your sect", "your ideology" and various other alternatives were valid, but your religion indicates Shi'as are of a separate religion, like Christians, or Jews.

It indicates that your religion is not Islam, and that your religion does not constitute a legitimate Islamic sect (like Sunnis, Ibadis, Zaydis, Mutazillis, etc.). It doesn't mean you're not Muslim, and the distinction is made by innumerable ulema. I'm not misapplying grammar, and I'm not doing takfir - you're just jumping to conclusions.

Nation of Islam, the Druze Religion, Alawi Shi'ism, Qadiyanism, etc. are not Islam. Tenets of each of these religions, if believed, would in theory put you outside of Islam. But by the benefit of the doubt, and the sahahada, the assumption is that the lay-person of these religions is technically Muslim. The "religions" themselves are outside of Islam. The ruling on the religion doesn't extend to the people who ascribe to these groups unless they adhere specially to those things that constitute shirk.

No backtracking here or lying (I'm not a Twelver like you brother)... 

Therefore point still stands

Your point boils down to the fact that some Imam who ran a seminary did something stupid. That Imam has nothing to do with *me*, or with Ahlus Sunnah as a generality. My criticism is about *your religion* itself and the fundamental premise on which your religion, and every book of Twelver ahadith is built (lying). It's rather sad that when confronted with the absurd nature of *your religion*, the best you can do is attack some *personalities* that ascribe to another religion. I hope you can notice the distinction.

I didn't say you were wrong - the man seems to do what you're claiming he did - saved his life by walking out in a burqa - it's just irrelevant to the Sunni Islam... And as embarrassing as that is, I'd rather be caught in a burqa than ascribe to a set of beliefs that makes 'Ali (ra) look like a pathetic wimp and suggest the Imams (ra) were a bunch of liars.

And easy out, I can feel your anger bursting out from comments, lol, chill out if you may :)

LOL. Wallahi I'm not angry, I'm just sorry for you. 




 A Mormon missionary very vocally made the claim that the Book of Mormon is an authentic book from Divine inspiration. I asked the Mormon why he believes in Joseph Smith and his book - what makes it authentic. He said to go read the Book of Mormon, with sincere intention, and the Holy Spirit would guide me to know its true. I asked him if he could give me even a small tid-bit, a teaser, to suggest that it was authentic and from God, and all I got was the same circular logic. I understand the guy blindly believed in that non-sense and had no credible reason for it, but you'd expect people to at least be a little honest with themselves.

I just asked for the name of a muhaqiq. Khayr inshaAllah, I'll look into it, best of luck. 




 I highlight "your religion" right up there, and that is still not enough for your to read and make stupid assumptions?

Yea, I said "your religion"...how is that takfir?...Qadiyani and Alawi religions etc. aren't Islam either...that doesn't mean me, or anybody else, does blanket takfir on every average Druze / Alawi...

As for your "Taqiyyah" comment, all I say is that our scholars don't go full lunatic and try to escape in women's clothing on broad daylight like Mullah Abdul Aziz here

Right...Because some random Imam at a Masjid from Pakistan attempting to save his life has just as much relevance to my *religion* as the fact that your *religion* is based on telling lies right down to your fundamental books of ahadith, to the extent that your major modern scholars [don't even cover it up anymore](http://arabic.al-khoei.org/falea.htm)...

But I suppose if laughing at some random Sunnis in embarrassing situations makes you feel better about the fairy tales you go to bed with at night, I guess that's something. 




 Also, do you count add a traveller if you're travelling for work? 

You'd be musafir (traveller) even if you were making safr for a haram reason. 

But I would *ask a sheikh* if you want a detailed response with ahadith - there's too many variables in your question for anybody to easily search up all the associated ahadith. Is this boat going to another destination, or are you on a navy sub / aircraft carrier that will just turn around after some time period? etc. etc. etc. 




 I don't understand what you mean by the forward...in the English translation? Can you TL;DR for me one piece of evidence or the name of the muhaqiq who did the authentication and I'll look it up?

Appreciate it! 




 generalization of all Shia begins, leading to you being called kafir. 

Ruling on the generality doesn't mean it applies in specificity.

I find that hard to believe

Why? 




  Shia believe, simply based on fact and evidence, that it is reliable, and would argue (many would say very effectively) that it is sahih.

In that case, if you dont mind, can you tell me which muhaqiq did the authentication? Of all the narrations? It seems like a real feat since the author doesn't provide sanad for anything, the muhaqiq would literally have to first find the asl for every tradition on his own as well... 




 Will there be any Muslims with you on the boat? There's no salat al-juma without a jama. Will the boat be in such a condition that you're musafir? There's no salat al-juma for the musafir.

You should ask a sheikh with your specific details. 




 Source for what? That you're musafir while on the boat? Or that there is no juma for the musafir? (the later is the jamhoor opinion so I'm sure you can google it). 




 Nonetheless, I am comfortable with acknowledging myself as a Shia and it makes me very sad when some people try to disregard us as Muslim completely, even if they do not know what we believe in personally. 

TBF - Very few people do takfir of the majority, or even of the average Twelver Shi'i. Criticizing the religion isn't the same as making takfir of you *personally* 




 Right...well obviously the Shia would not believe that. 

Why not? As a Sunni, if you brought meaningful evidence demonstrating the weakness of a hadith, I won't believe it anymore. As an example, there's a beautiful and extremely popular saying attributed to the Prophet to seek knowledge even if you have to go all the way to China. At some point, I learned this hadith was mawdu at worst and da'if or tenuously hasan li-ghayrihi at best.

If you have substantial and convincing evidence for something, it shouldn't matter how popular it is or what your sectarian affiliation is. 




 No offense but most books written purporting to be ex-Shias that became Sunni are usually hoaxes.

That's a pretty substantial claim. Do you have examples of these hoaxes and associated books? I know plenty of ex-Shias in person as well as a number of people well-known on places like ShiaChat over the last 10 years who left the Twelver religion so it would be rather strange for Sunnis to resort to such cheap/desperate tactics...when there's so many knowledgeable ex-Shi'is, scholars, people who drop out of hawza and hawza "graduates"...

If you have a recommendation of one that's written by the real deal I'd be open to it.

Sure - not in English though. Do you read any other language (Farsi, Urdu, Arabic?). 




 A recent fatwa has been placed against calling them apostates

{citation needed}

And if you're going to point to an aberrant opinion of one of the few reasonable twelver ulema like Fadlallah, it's still intellectually dishonest on your part to imply that Twelvers as a group don't do takfir of Sheikhan when Twelver scholars by jamhoor, historically and today, and hadith books prove the opposite... 




 I like nothing better than people showing their close mindedness and doing a mass takfir like this.

Where did I do mass takfir on any post...ever? I understand you need to build strawmen as you wanted to question the scholarship of Husayn Murad and got exposed on that front - but isn't that a bit much?

I suppose when lying is a fundamental part of your religion you just can't help yourself huh... 




 I have never heard of such so-called esteemed scholar...Another one of those mullahs on the petro-dollar honour roll

GreyMatter hasn't heard of him so he must be a nobody on the "petro-dollar honor roll" [**in Jordan**](http://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/_).... Being on TV or embroiled in politics isn't the only way to be a major reputable scholar - as this guy was in Twelver scholarly circles before he left, more so than the clowns hyped up by apologists of your religion like al-Tijani as examples of people leaving Ahlus Sunnah... [You must suck at using Google btw...](http://www.al-shia.org/html/ara/books/lib-rejal/nafahat/234.htm) 




 He cited everything he said. A lot of shit went missing after Operation Iraqi Freedom... 




 What makes ISIS think they're more Islamic than the early caliphs? 

TBF, a lot of the times destroying some idols wasn't pragmatic. It wasn't a decision to preserve art/history (see Egypt under 'Umar). In other cases, the Muslims never reached some of those areas entirely during the early empires since the Muslims in al-sham and Iraq didn't really mingle with the non-Muslim communities that fell under their protection. Some empires/rulers were also more prone to iconoclastic tendencies than others (Ayyubids, Mahmad Ghaznavi, Aurangzeb, etc.).

That said, these aren't exactly idols. Nobody worships them and its a shame we've lost something that gives us a glimpse into the past. 




 You're arguing for the sake of arguing brother, and you were wrong on multiple occasions in this thread alone. Take a breather and reassess your intentions, your ego shouldn't be one of them. 




 Well a Muslim reddit user said it was not accurate, another said there are more accurate and more respected translations. 

It's not inaccurate - The criticism against it was that it was verbose, and because of how much Keller wrote in terms of notes, it's more of a commentary on the book vs a translation. Some people don't agree entirely with the commentary. The translation itself is as good as a translation will get. 




 Al-Tijani is a clown...

If he read's al-Tijani's books (rudood of which you can easily find in entire volumes in 'Arabic or even of several assertions on English sites or his humiliating representation on mustaqillah) - will you read a book by a Twelver leaving that religion and becoming Sunni? Are you fluent in any language besides English? 




 Shias have always debated, it has usually been others who silenced them.

Right...but even if there was some vast conspiracy to silence Shi'ite debaters instead of disproving them, I can understand why given that [lying to Sunnis as part of debates is allowed in this religion](http://arabic.al-khoei.org/falea.htm)...

:                       
:       . 
 




 they cannot be called apostaes

I don't understand how you're even able to *try* and spin this. There's entire chapters in the major Twelver hadith books on the fact that **ALL** of the Sahaba made irtidad except a couple...in contradiction to the dhahir meaning of several ayat...

It wouldn't take more than 20 minutes to find that same opinion uttered by the major scholars of the Twelver religion outside of primary sources either... 




 Zaydi Shi'ites believe it was unintentional. Their position is that the Prophet made no clear nass to appoint 'Ali - hence why Abu Bakr, Umar and the Sahaba in general aren't hated.

Twelver Shi'ism suggests the opposite (Majlissi - one of the major mashaykh of what I assume is your religion):

                                   ( )                        

The traditions in Twelver Shi'ite books about the appointment of 'Ali are extensive, as you must already be aware. Which means the only way Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman could've become Khulafa is by *intentionally* forgoing the command of the Prophet / not believing in it. Hence the conclusion above (on the kufr of Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman and the Sahaba). 




 Sunni and Shia schools of thought have different principles of jurisprudance...

And completely different religious traditions (ahadith and athar). 




 Search up 1991 iraqi failed revolution and iran iraq war, they killed close to 700,000 of us, and that's the low estimate , the high estimate is about 2 million

Stop playing the sectarian victim bullshit. The 91 rebellion was started by ex-Ba'athis, Saddam didn't single out Shi'ites in exclusion to Sunnis for his reprisals - and to his death even when he became more religious, he didn't care or know anything meaningful about the differences Twelver Shi'ism introduced. Drawing Sectarian lines of targeting is the forte of your compatriots, and the modern organizations that grew to power as the only defense of Sunnis against your compatriots. 




 I don't think that passage exists in what we have of the Gospel of the Nazarenes, any of the other Jewish Gospels or proto-Matthew reconstructions. Which is what conartist probably meant by real Christians (Nazarenes, Ebionites, and early non-prosletyzing "Jewish" / non-Pauline Christians). You can also see some of other MSS (Shem Tov as an example) lacking even the "all the nations" clause - and explicitly contradicting the idea of Christ being sent to non-Jews.

And at best we know that even the traditional Matthew manuscripts were substantially modified in this verse. See "in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit" as the well-known interpolation. So IMO it would be a bit problematic to rely on this statement attributed to Christ exclusively as evidence of his goal being to spread his message to gentiles. 




 Hey, dude, they didn't kill him, he is in custody and they don't plan to torture or kill him.

I didn't say they killed the kid who was referenced by OP. I said that you can't treat a witness as reliable when he's being held captive, especially by organizations known to use torture. The video I posted is of a kid who they *did* kill. He's tied up, being slapped around and ultimately shot in the head.

You just gave a random video and said this is what shia iraqi army does to sunni kids without context.

Do you want videos of Iraqi army soldiers in Iraqi army fatigues doing the same thing? I've posted several videos like that to /r/iraq and /r/syriancivilwar...before the US came in and helped the Iraqi army clean up their PR, the Golden Brigades Facebook page was proudly posting videos of the same sort of stuff (torture, putting corpses and driving them around on vehicles, executions of tied up Sunnis, executions/burnings of Sarkhi's Shi'ites, etc.). My videos are direct from the army page...you can look through my old submissions...

I could give countless examples of sunnis doing all sorts of horrible things to shias

You mean the mass executions? I don't see how that's hardly comparable to torture videos and executions of kids who don't look like they've even hit puberty...

sunnis are not a largely persecuted,genocided and victimized group

Right...Baghdad went from a Sunni majority to a Shi'ite majority through peaceful means... 




 The images are pictures of people in Bashar's prisons. You can see signs of torture and starvation. The pictures are a small subset of what's going to be coming out soon (you can check the NY Times or many other established networks about the pictures to be released). It's irrelevent if they're fighters or not, there's Islamic ways - fuck that - human ways to treat captives.

**The video is of a kid, tied up, being slapped around by Shi'ite soldiers. He's then shot in the head**. A gun is a gun - sure... When you're a POW, you don't have a gun anymore... 




 It makes sense though. He's looking to consolidate his power with minimal use of force so he'll want Imams on payroll for the future of "Islam" in Egypt. What is difficult to implement over thousands of tiny mosques becomes much more solvable when implemented against fewer mosques that just have larger congregations. 




 Sounds peachy - but having your life expectancy halved just to get laid seems a bit much lol... 




 It is evil without a God because the person who is raped did not consent.

The animals we kill and eat don't consent either. The junkie you do an intervention on didn't consent either. The suicidal bridge jumper you pull down didn't consent either. A sado-masochist can consent to real physical harm. An incestuously minded couple can consent to an incestuous relationship.

I don't see how consent being the basis for defining "evil" or morals is at all reasonable. 




 Go to your local mosque. The literal meaning of "Qur'an" is recitation - it wasn't something people simply read in their homes, it requires interactive dialogue. When Islam spread originally, it wasn't through people handing out copies of Qur'an translations but acting as actual delegates who would explain Qur'an/Islam to different cities/communities/kings. Ask if they have a Qur'an class at your local mosque or an Islam 101 sorta thing. Don't be scared - these guys are generally friendly

IMO the best place to learn, whether you're a beginner or somebody who's on his way to being the mujadid of this century as with other people who (presently) know more than you do. 









 Dead - the Arabic English the end....damnnnn 




 If you keep this flair for over a week - you may have bigger things to worry about than this sub 




 If this report is accurate

It's not. He's a Sunni boy, who used to be in Daesh currently in the custody of the mostly Shi'ite Iraq army. You can imagine what they did to him...

Hell, you don't even need to imagine. NSFW [Here's what they do - as of yesterday](https://vid.me/e/IRqX?card=1) to Sunni children that they capture from Daesh. This story has no credibility unless that kid is in a safe place - no testimony of an obvious Iraqi prisoner is real testimony. Same goes for the testimony of NSFW [captives of SAA/Hezbollah.](https://www.facebook.com/StandwithCaesar/photos_stream) 




 [Fake story](http://imgur.com/VxoxFNP)

The image originally came from Quds-news. There's a Jan 15 timestamp, so this kid was injured before that pilot execution video was even released! An Arabic news agency then fabricated this story mid-February after which it was picked up by a bunch of online news sites. And now it's beginning to get spread to English "news" like this website. The entire story, as well as the lousy explanation of how this remote village saw the graphic video is fiction.

No doubt it's tragic that this kid was hurt - regardless of the circumstances. But I find it sicker that people are using the legitimate suffering of others and reinventing propaganda around it. 




 This news story is likely false. I remember seeing this picture a long time back.

ISIS isn't a good group, but OP has an agenda - double check anything an anonymous person (myself included) says to you online. 




 There's different opinions on drawing pictures, but robots are a totally separate category. 




 It makes as much of a statement about a group as the people they kill, if we're going to use that to understand them. Everybody operates with some sort of morals. Neither ISIS, nor the Iraqi army, or the myriad of other organizations go in thinking "heh, we're the villains". 




 Yep. 




 You'd be surprised. Al-Muhajiroon, Sh. Abu Hamza al Misri, Anjem Chowdry, etc. all used to say stuff like this with impunity. The government, in theory, cares more if you actually plan to do something like that (versus liking that it happened). 




  Very very contentious topic and a lot of misinformation due to the emotions relating to it.

She didn't lead a revolt per say. She moved on Basrah before 'Ali had widely been given the bayah. 'Ali actually then moved his army towards Basrah. In any case, here's some in-depth talks based on Muslim historical chronicles:

[Lecture on the topic by Sh. Adnan Abdul Qadir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9ciR5Vwa1k)

[Detailed part of a lecture series by Mufti Abdur Rahman b Yusuf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WH5sdjJ6U5I)

Conflicting views come from the fact that the people to whom this is an important issue (Shi'ites) have their own religious texts produced later on (see al Kafi al Kulayni, Bihar al Anwar by al Majlissi). They record many of the same narrations as all the rest of the sects, but their narrative will focus on attacking Ayesha. The narrations there will pose Ayesha in the most vehemently negative light. They also come from the fact that Sunni historians (like at-Tabari) used to record narrations from all people, including different sects, reliable people and unreliable people, descendents of people who fought in the war, etc.

It boils down to simply, 'Ali was given bayah but people were unhappy that the culprits weren't caught. Talha and Zubair, who originally gave their oath of allegiance to 'Ali, were unhappy with his reluctance to immediately pursue/turn-over/punish the alleged killers of Uthman so they went to one of the highest authorities among Muslims, Ayesha, a Mother of the Believers as she was known. She, based on their narratives, was encouraged to march and convince 'Ali to deal with the issue. She went with a large group of men and this resulted in a short battle. After 'Ali won, he made sure she was safely able to return home. It was a political dispute where 'Ali was in a pickle, for political reasons, he couldn't easily handle the situation promptly, but people wanted blood (their former caliph had just been killed). The majority of scholars held that she was incorrect in her ijtihad, and he was correct, afaik. 




  This was in direct defiance of the quranic verse telling the wives to remain inside their homes after the death of the Prophet.

There are exceptions to that rule ya himar...they aren't under house arrest once the Prophet dies... 




 Khawarij is plural btw...

The kid looks 13-14 at most, they slap him around before shooting him in the head - it's very hard to watch. 




 He condemned violence against mass civilian targets, not necessarily what he was doing. That said, it's possible his life circumstances made him change his mind? Or he believed the people he was executing were legitimate targets for some reason or another? Who knows - there's more to it. 




 They don't generally kill kids. You may remember the several kidnapped Kurdish boys in Syria. They were allowed to speak with their families on the phone and were just given an alternative education. A current example would be the fact that ISIS freed the elderly Assyrian hostages they were holding (they still have around 200 hostages remaining). That's the most notorious group in the region, you can extrapolate that most of these extremists avoid killing certain classes of people. 




 If you condemn Shi'ite atrocities, you must be an ISIS fanboy. /s 




 Before ISIS declared a caliphate and was moving on Baghdad, prisons were full of former fighters against the Iraq government / Coalition forces. After the big move, the prisons were basically empty. 




 Second one was condemned by everyone, so it was probably ISIS(dont lump them with the rebels) 

Nope - I remember that one. That one was FSA or some other group - it was from over a year ago. 




 None. ISIS just has better production value and is more honest about it. 




 They used to post stuff like this - and worse, regularly on the Golden Brigades division facebook page (Iraqi army) - including videos of torture. Not just of Sunnis - they took a video after burning alive a Sarkhist Shi'ite (during their short lived rebellion) and drug the corpse around the street chained to a motorcycle.

There are *tons* of videos like this, they don't have the same production value as ISIS videos and don't get mass media attention like ISIS. Something seemingly hard to comprehend for a lot of people is that almost every major group plays dirty. 




 Shi'ite militias / Iraqi army are generally good about not filming (before the ISIS quagmire, the proof was usually corpses with signs of torture like drill marks). But not always. 




 If somebody gave me money to remove a thread, I'd remove it.
If a 7 or above wanted to suck me off to remove a thread, I'd remove it.
If I got a cease and desist or official request for takedown with lawery jargon on it - I'd probably remove it.

They said they removed it as it was 'misleading' (in this particular case - that might even be an accurate assessment). You can decide for yourself if it was accurate or misleading. But as to why they removed it - nobody here *actually* knows so you're asking the wrong group of people... 




 Yep - you have to do a search for the ones with the "misleading" tag that got removed by mods to find ones that are actually accurate. 




 It's definitely not an issue that can be resolved easily by just replacing corrupt mods. The people who seek power are never the ones who deserve it most.

 No Information = No Limit 




 The current trend in India is Fascist. Modi, of the BJP, who presided over the Gujrat Riots/Massacre of Muslims, was popularly elected. He's what you'd call a strong-man leader. Mein Kampf is a pretty popular read because people are impressed by Hitler, in spite of his ultimate failure, in his ability to drive his nation out of a slump and make it power-house at that time. There's also the fact that people in India recognize the role played by Adolf indirectly in India gaining her independence. You can say that all of this leads to an affinity with the man which in turn leads to denying the things he did which they don't necessarily agree with. You can compare it to the nearly instantaneous response of "Pallywood" conspiracy theories by many people any time Israel commits something egregious. It's effectively the same mind-state, affinity causes you to hype myths and minimize flaws. 




 There was a rally planned in opposition to Putin. The expected turnout was very low. Nemtsov, an opposition politician leading a very unpopular political party was effectively rotting away in obscurity to most Russians while Putin has the highest approval ratings of his dictatorial career. Nemtsov, the basically irrelevant politician, suggested in an interview that he might be assassinated. Nemtsov ended up being shot in the back of the head. The assumption was made by some people that Putin was responsible for offing this man. In turn, a small rally turned into something comparatively huge (50,000 people - or 0.4% of Moscow's population).

 Yeah, that hasn't happened ever. Usually international pressure results in more extreme punishments. I wouldn't be suprised if that's what's happening here.

Which makes complete sense - do you really want to set precedent in any country, as a leader, that will undermine the rule of law? Police forces to ever actually give hostage takers what they want. Many countries refuse to negotiate with those dubbed terrorists or hostage taking criminals, etc. for the same issue of precedent and what it encourages long-term. 




 My gut reaction is that the Saudis have figured out that for the next ten years and every time he is flogged, the story is going to be in the foreign media and will embarrass the kingdom. The would rather kill Raif now, take the bad press over it and let everybody forget about it in 6 months or so. I'm not an expert, but that's how this reads to me. 

That would be exceptional politics on their part. But I doubt it's the case. If he gets a death sentence, he will most probably be convicted without Saudi royalty whispering in the ears of the judge. You have to remember that the judiciary is composed of religious scholars, who by nature tend to be more zealous and less corrupt. The judiciary system in Saudi Arabia is pretty separate from the royalty (at least as far as this case his gotten).

The new king could *technically* let this guy off the hook in an appeal that travels up the chain to him, but he realistically can't do that. It would send the wrong message locally: If you're convicted for something that isn't a crime in the West, appeal to Western media to influence the judiciary. Attempting outside influence on the judiciary is actually a crime in its own right.

And all of that assumes this isn't just Badawi's wife and legal team trying to stir up a story in order to keep him on our radar. 




 **Both** sites you use are actually anti-Shia propaganda

**1** al-khoei.org is the main al-Khoie foundation site.

 Does 4:140 forbid Muslims to talk with non-Muslims if the non-Muslims ridicule Islam?

It's a prohibition of sitting with anyone, even someone who is technically a Muslim, if they're mocking religion (until they stop). Islam distinguishes between dialogue and mockery and there's a rich tradition of Muslim apologetics without ad hominems from either party. Similar verses suggest to give them reminders about what they're doing wrong and about taking existence in jest.

Do 5:57   6:70 forbid Muslims from being friends with non-Muslims?

No, that's a war verse - you'll understand the context better if you read it with tafsir. If we read it out of context, then by that rationale, a person would have to distance himself from his non-Muslim relatives after conversion. Islam explicitly promotes the opposite. 




 Hah I wish - this was before YouTube and WorldStar

 Can confirm, tried to take on 2 dudes boozed out their minds years ago (self defense). Had a golf club - tons of connections right to their heads. They seemed impervious to pain and just kept on rolling with it. Then I lost the golf club...I wasn't impervious to the pain.

 Most organizations do that so its not exactly odd.

Generally speaking, when ISIS and other criminal groups the world over (Africa, Asia, anywhere) get a hold of these goods, they remove the old emblems and put on their own and redistribute the aid in the impoverished areas (non-religious criminal groups also profit from reselling the goods), etc. 




 According to this news agency...but you can't really trust a local news agency to 100% accurately convey the original claim. I'd double check what they actually published in Dabiq. 




 You don't stoop. 




 Let's be real, after 10 years of chaos, almost none of the remaining artifacts are likely real. The good stuff is sitting in the private collections of wealthy individuals who took advantage of the situation. 




 Can someone give me, like a proper example to help me understand the term?

Orthodox Muslims get a rap among ignorant bigots in the West because of this concept which has nothing to do w/ 90% of most people claiming to be Muslim. The issue is that Twelver Shi'ites are in modern times a very substantial subset of the overall population and happen to be vocal in media and politics, and this concept is the bedrock of Twelver Shi'ism. [An example of taqiyyah in action:](http://arabic.al-khoei.org/falea.htm)

:                       
:       . 

That's from the website of al-Kho'i, a venerable mujtahid in modern Twelver religious tradition. He's being asked if it's permissible to lie in debates against "innovators" (non-12ers - i.e. one of the types of taqiyyah) and al-Khoi is clarifying that it is as long as it is useful in winning the debate.

Here's some narrations on the concept from Twelver Shi'ite religious tradition:

http://twelvershia.net/2014/05/29/1184/ 




 The real things are probably in private collections and both ISIS/Baghdad have a bunch of replicas. 10 years of chaos will lose a lot of national treasure. 




 Well countries that have nukes aren't necessarily in good shape either. Pakistan is rife with special interests, targeted assassinations, terror attacks, general bursts of social unrest, etc. Even if Ukraine had nukes, Russia could and would cause problems if they were put in the same situation as they've been put in our reality. 




 If that's the harassment we know about...there's probably quite a bit more we don't know about. Don't see how this is an unreasonable basis for determining a motive towards this path for the man... 









 Really? I've seen it **multiple** times across LA (in Torrence) and beyond. They have a quarter to get in system. 




 It's depressing since this exact illusion keeps a good 50% of voters not acting in their self-interest and ultimately ruining the concept of democracy. 




 "We need peace, and clear skies" 




 Like Pakistan? 




 What does US have to do with anything?

A lot... 









 A radicalized anti-Russian Ukraine is better than a NATO member-state anti-Russian Ukraine on his border. Weighing his options, you have new strategic territory, supportive regions in ethnic Russian territory as a buffer and your neighbor state is no longer fit to approach and join NATO as it was aiming for a few years ago. 




 Academic polling iz 2 hard tho 




 Umm...that makes no sense. Islamic apocolyptic literature suggests that the people closest to that period of time will be the worst of human beings. If you're a 'radical', you want anything *but* Judgement day to come. 




 It's unreal when you think about it. They say that their aim is to create a massive Caliphate that stretches the globe, and yet they haven't built a single thing. They just maim and destroy everything like rabid animals.

The first thing you build is an army. You build an army by having people with nothing to do. When you burn books and music, people have nothing left to do. 




 Men who run off to ISIS at their age are given no mercy.

They should be too. Media + Pussy pass is a whole nother issue entirely imo.

If ISIS let these girls fight on the frontline and kill people, don't you think they would do it?

Maybe. And if you found me 10 years ago and asked me what drugs I was selling, you'd have a very different answer from than you have now. The point is to know about this issue, and put in measures to ensure that youth will *live long enough* to grow out of this phase and prevent them from ever *having an opportunity* to go out "on the frontline and kill people". 




 At what point do a people claim ownership of land? 

I don't think it's easy to come up with some sort of absolute for something like that, and I'm sure you agree. What I do believe though without a doubt is that anyone displaced, particularly anyone (or descendent of one) displaced who is presently getting by on scraps at a refuge camp has every right to go and reclaim their stolen property. That they have more right to the land they were expelled from than a people with a vague and messy notion of "Jewishness" and no provable near memory connection to the land.

Without a doubt, a lot of the Palestinians' ancestors came to the land from elsewhere.

Even if that were the case, there are plenty who are as indigenous as our history books go. Various tribes that the Prophet allegedly interacted with and 'Umar allegedly interacted with.

I also see a gigantic difference between invited, or at least not repelled, early migrants vs a Jew making aliyah in the early 1900s for the express purpose of clandestine political subversion. 

It's possible that Israelis and Palestinians, maybe in a few generations, can live together and respect each other's rights. 

It's possible. 




 And plenty of kids made bigger mistakes than you probably did in your sheltered life. Joining local gangs, stealing and killing in their own community, ending up dead locally or in jail, flying down to Vegas and getting forced to become hookers, etc.

They're still kids who made mistakes.

If you can't empathize with them, you're the only psychopath here. 




 They're young girls. They have about as much foresight as young girls you pull out of the club... 




 Who brought up non-Sunnis? Andy was asking why dhimma were being killed. 




  I don't think a huge percentage of blacks would say

It's not a numbers game. You said the only reason somebody would hurt you for being an annoying asshole and exercising speech is if they're insecure. I pointed out that being an annoying asshole can get you hurt/killed/"persecuted" anywhere and has nothing to do with insecurities...whether you're in Europe and you're academically questioning the Holocaust, or you're in Russia, Africa or pretty much any Eastern country and you mock religious icons or somebody's family, or you're an annoying white kid yelling nigger while walking through the bronx.... 




 If they pay their taxes, it becomes IS' duty as Muslims to protect them (like the Muslims in the territory they occupy) - assuming they still follow some aspects of Islam. But these aren't Moslawi Christians or Christians from other IS territories - [There are Christian enclaves and militias](http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/christian-foreign-fighters-deserting-kurdish-ypg-syria-because-theyre-damned-reds-1976493133) in cities beyond IS. 




 Except that immediately when they took Mosul various Sunni movements gave bayah including non-Salafis - even prominently jaysh naqshbandia, average sunna' from baiji, fallujah, mosul...feel free to pretend that's not what happened and Anbar was just a bunch of "Wahhabi" sleeper cells... 




 It's happening, but Israelis have a way of disconnecting with the crimes perpetrated on their behalf by the IDF. Anytime Palestinians suffer something barbaric by inhumane democratically elected government of the people of Israel, several Hasbara will come along and call it Pallywood, or come up with something to the effect of "well Americans do it too!" 




 He's correcting the statement "open discussions" in the post he's replying too... 




 I mean, where the hell did he get the prophet (pbuh)'s wanting to commit suicide because of his doubts on the Quran?

There's a ziyada through az-Zuhri on a hadith in Sahih al Bukhari which discussed suicidal inclination on one occasion. Not for doubt of the Qur'an, but I can see where he kind of started. 




 Not insecurities. If you walk around a poor black neighborhood in the US calling everybody "nigger", don't think you'll walk out alive or at least not have your ass whopped. It's not because people are insecure about being black - it's simply that they're not okay with you saying something like that.

If you go to any part of the world where mothers are valued (so much of the world outside of US/Europe), you will either die or get your ass whopped for making a harmless "yo mama" joke. Same thing. The guy who's mom you called a whore *knows* his mom is not a whore, he's not *insecure*, he's just not okay with you saying that...

Insecurity would be if the Muslims were as riled up about Haggarism (by Cooke and Crone) as they were by Salman Rushdie. There's a difference between questioning/criticizing something and mocking it - and Muslim empires historically recognized this difference. Nobody was punished for apologetic or argumentation.

I understand its hard to imagine, but not everybody has the same values as you and not everybody believes that people should be allowed to *say* whatever they want. Nobody can control your thoughts, but no country doesn't have some restrictions on what you're allowed to say. 




 And likewise there's countless cases of baseless propaganda by Shi'ites against the various anti-Bashar, anti-Iraq Military militias...

And likewise there's countless cases of actual barbarity by Shi'ite militias...to the point where even Moqtada al-sadr isn't even willing to roll with some of these guys...you can find several examples of torture and vicious killings by Shi'ite terrorists (before Daish started coming up as a uniting Sunni response in the region) in my old submissions (to r/iraq)... 




 I've said some stuff critical of some of the big things Seattle believes in (bikes, public transpo, homos, Murray, etc.) without being downvoted into oblivion. You can get away with articulating a counter-cultural point just fine. It's coming off as a complete idiot or a troll that doesn't work (and why you guys must have the opinions you do about the sub).... 




 I think he has a point as in millions of Israelis have been born on the land. 

I didn't say he doesn't have a point - I just don't believe assuming a state surrounded by enemies can exist indefinitely, or for any substantial period of time, is a good basis to 'move forward' on. That said, its not like the Crusaders didn't have children and influx of occupiers/"emigrants" when they occupied Palestine either. The only difference is the number.

They call it home and they would do whatever it takes to fight for it.

Calling a place home doesn't mean you'll do "whatever it takes" to fight for it - even if we assume that the children of thieves have the right to keep stolen property as their own. 




  If both of those really wanted it, Vietnam or Afghanistan would be utterly destroyed like Germany was 70 years ago.

If you don't believe we really wanted it in Vietnam, you don't remember Vietnam. That failure happened in spite of a wanton disregard for human life and destruction on a massive scale. As I said, that doesn't win wars...you have an advantage if you can level cities at a time, but that doesn't mean you'll walk away having completed what you set out to do...

 You also don't mention that in those proxy wars all involved countries were armed by the rival side: Afghan Mujahideens armed by USA, Vietnam armed by Russia   China, etc ... 

Actually - I basically did: "using antiquated outside technology...using antiquated Russian arms" - its not like the US gave F16s to the Mujahideen or the Ukranians...the technology they used in winning that war (and the subsequent ones) is for the most part no better than the crappiest arsenal held by an Iranian or Pakistani army group... 




 Technology has *always* been important in wars. It doesn't win wars. As the Russians call them, "goat herders" drove out the Soviets with nominal and antiquated outside technology. A technologically in-superior Viet-Cong drove out the USA. Today, Taliban controls substantial swathes outside of Kabul in Afghanistan after the war. A separatist movement in Ukraine using antiquated Russian arms is fighting a relatively successful war against a modern Ukranian army.

Evidence 1   2 aren't directly relevant to military development.

Evidence 3, assuming the iron shield is actually what its proponents claim, is definitely an impressive logistical feat. It's not exactly new technology though, the tools to intercept crude Hamas/Hezbollah type rockets (and better) is widely available in much of the world. You have advance warning sure - and effectiveness against this one very particular type of scenario -Qassams coming out of Palestine. If the Muslim world operated with some semblance of a homogenous unit in the next 100 years, you're now dealing with a hatf or something else less susceptible to what your ABF is tested against...

Your military development is earmarked to handle the very specific scenarios you expect well - its not like you lot are set up for something unexpected, and that's what I alluded to. The Crusaders didn't imagine Salah-ud-Din. They effectively handled the things they knew, but that doesn't prepare you against a surprise 50 years later.

And military development isn't everything either. You guys are amazing at leveling entire apartment complexes and cities, sure. But when IDF finally sent in ground forces, it wasn't exactly a cake-walk, and that's with air-support and a pretty no fucks given attitude to the destruction of life and property in the territory you were occupying. Imagine "terror tunnels" that open in major cities with 100s of Palestinian soldiers fighting the same urban war from within your own cities. You can't just level the buildings. The technology that works so well in destroying hospitals, schools, water sanitation and electrical plants isn't going to help in that environment.

I understand your investment and your hope that the Zionist experiment lasts indefinitely. I'm just not seeing any substantial reason to truly believe you can sustain a country, for any lengthy period of time, surrounded by people who support the indigenous people you've oppressed. At some point, the many battle-hardened Libyans, Egyptians, Iraqis, Somalis, Yemenis and Syrians who are busy killing each other right now (an absolute blessing for Israel) may redirect their anger. It's happened before... 




 He gave an *analogy* of a racist regime of the past who's people thought it would last indefinitely to a modern apartheid government. What does this have to do with *Jews*... 




 This whole discussion is irrelevant, because Israel is not going to disappear. 

The Crusaders occupied Jerusalem for over 100 years, and several generations. What makes you so sure the indigenous people and their brothers nearby won't eventually find a way to work together and send you packing? It's happened before... 




 inshaAllah 




 Forces that will likely be one day shooting at you. Fleeing soldiers aren't an interdiction of enemy forces either, nothing imminent, but historically armies attempt to kill and capture people as they run away as well. Soldiers sleeping in barracks, etc. etc. etc. To put it as you do, no one expect they would be bombed sleeping. No one expects they would be bombed taking a shit.

They're still soldiers. 




  Because it was a fucking political rally. No one expect they would be bombed walking down the street of their own city. There is no excuse for this...

So if somebody in military gear is at a political rally, they're off limits during a war? 




 Well it's not a theological issue - it's a fiqh issue. If we go down to the very simplest understanding of the question, is there a legitimate opinion allowing qisas (retribution) of this nature if the family of the victims ask for it? Sure.

That isn't to say anything about this group, their legitimacy, their ruling over the man, whether the man deserved it, if a pilot's job is comparable (allowing this as qisas), the wisdom of doing it in this way, whether the video was real, whether the pilot is under the rules of a POW or a criminal, etc. 




 Yea it's definitely weird. They were pretty explicit too:

 The footage was faked.

 




 So you agree that ISIS are in fact Muslims but you disagree that they are rooted in Islam? 

The ISIS foot soldiers appear to be Muslim.

And I'm not a relativist at all but when you have are dealing with written sources it often becomes impossible to speak in objective truths. 

For things which are open to interpretation, sure. Stuff like whether to fold your arms above the navel, below the navel (etc.) in prayer are open to interpretation. Textual evidence isn't clear. That's the spectrum. But this is what you said, "who are you to decide what the objectively correct version of Islam is"

If somebody comes along and says, "well sure, Islam teaches this publicly, but Islam was actually transmitted in secret and the true religion was transmitted through a small subset of 'Muslims' and contradicts the openly available and multiply transmitted information" (as a simplification of 12er Shi'ism) - than you can pretty easily say it's not Islam, or not "authentic" Islam. If somebody comes along and says "Here's Qur'an 2.0 - this is Islam, again, easy call.

Likewise, if you have somebody that says Islam allows or encourages stuff like homosexuality, or killing anyone you choose at random, both of which are explicitly prohibited in the source texts - you can objectively say that this is not an 'objectively correct version of Islam'

Permit me a flippant example, there is a legitimate argument to say that Gatsby (of The Great Gatsby fame) was actually African-American. Can anyone objectively say one way or the other? And who is the final judge on such matters? Admitting the impossibility of objective truth in some situations is not a withdrawal into relativism.

And that example is fine, and it addresses differences of opinion in issues where there is an availability of interpretive leeway. Stuff like the details associated with prayer and other things. But you don't need a judge to tell you the incorrectness of someone espouseing values that contradict the dhahir (obvious) meaning of certain verses, as understood in context through chains of tutelage that go back to the Prophet. There's plenty of open issues that Islam accommodates differences of opinion in, even explicit texts which allow for such differences. I only took issue with the broad idea that nobody can objectively say something is or is not "Islamic" when there is abundant source texts which can be understood in context and have had a unanimous interpretation. 




 I didn't criticize OP for simply editorializing - I criticized him because of "BS editorializ[ing]" - the editorialization is not supported by the article itself as Prystaiko doesn't in any way admit that Ukraine wasn't serious about the cease fire....

There's a difference between simply editorializing and flat out lying. If you can't comprehend that difference, I can't help you. 




 We're on the same page, Putin explicitly negotiated the ceasefire so that the rebels could settle Debaltseve without violating the agreement. That said - OP is editorializing the title like crazy. 




  international scientific consensus that we were heading into an ice age

**The scientific community had no consensus at the time**, there wasn't enough data...averages over a 30 year period isn't (and wasn't) proof of a trend...

http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,914494,00.html

What we have today is an actual consensus, with substantial data - not just media picking up and fear mongering both possibilities (as in the 70s)... 




 The footage was faked. 




 Average Sunni Muslims vs IS Types vs Shi'ites vs Secular Kurds vs NATO vs Russia

Israel kicking back with a beer at the beach and watching explosions in the distance. 




 Except its not racial. Anybody can join ISIS! 




  ISIS is rooted in a literal and very uncompromising tradition of Islam.

A literal and very uncompromising tradition of Islam allows burning to death of POWs? This is news to me. Given that there are explicit traditions literally prohibiting burning people to death.

In any case - I didn't say I have a problem with the idea that ISIS lot are Muslims until proven otherwise (theologically). I simply pointed out that there's a fundamental flaw in your modern Western approach to Islam, "all interpretations are valid, there are no objective truths", etc. The spectrum can be defined as whatever fits within the context of the vast set of undisputed Islamic sources. It's not something grey. 




 Welcome to /r/worldnews... 




 Last I checked Allah has no Air Force and an army of peasants with 30yr old ak47s so desperate to escape a life of poverty and boredom they blow themselves up.

Isn't that what the Soviets said in Afghanistan? And what the US said in Iraq 2.0, Afghanistan...

If those were military victories in your mind, you really need to re-assess what winning is. 




  Their radical messianic/apocalyptic stances

What stances are these? Dabiq? Their interpretation of that being in the near future isn't a theological difference imo 




 A well-edited video with a "specific leader" (literally somebody who nobody who's a somebody knows) isn't evidence of a centralized organization with a wide breadth of control. 




 What I'm saying is that there is no way to arbitrate this dispute between interpretations.

Yes there is, interpretation is on a spectrum. Eventually you can fall outside of that spectrum. If somebody comes along and tells you "I'm a communist" and than goes on to expound on the nature of his belief in free-market capitalism, it's pretty obvious they're not communists. The same applies to Islam. You can have wonky Shi'ite sects for example, but if they're stepping beyond the source texts - there is no theological issue in establishing takfir... 




 I would argue that licences should be distributed to all affected (or should I say infected) countries granting them impunity when dealing with these monsters.

So basically, let's keep the cycle going...

'Beware that, when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster' - Nietzche

Even these IS **people** are only the product of what they've collectively experienced. People like you, if you weren't a keyboard soldier, are the exact sort of people that join IS (or the other militias - depending entirely on your location of birth) - quite literally the entire problem in al sham right now... 
























 Yea - the hyperbole, or outright BS, in that post was impressive. 




 If Hezbollah could, they would invade Israel. 

Highly doubt that - Israel's existence is the political leverage that parties relying on economically dis-empowered people can use to stay in power.

That said, I don't know why you're being downvoted. HA is a threat to Israel. Not an existential threat, but definitely a long-term threat. 




 Not really, if "nothing happens" and accused terrorists are tried and found guilty before "anything happens", these organizations would look just fine.

Problem is - the only organization with a meaningful record of "thwarted attacks" (the FBI) has constantly been exposed as deliberately entrapping people, re-contextualizing, relying on unreliable sources for false convictions, etc. Meanwhile, what we get from the NSA is massive domestic spying, international spying on allies, while the CIA is busy running black ops toppling democratically elected governments.

Calling for reform isn't an imposition of a catch-22. 




 Right - because condoning torture by our government is just "a different opinion".

Oh wait, you think China and Russia don't do the same?

Basically: Hey, look over there! They do awful shit. So what if we do awful shit as well. 




  some fighters in Iraq and syria ,specially in Is are [a] bunch of wanna be soldiers who played too much games   paintball and decided to go there. 

FTFY 




 Well, I've noticed one thing about terrorist leaders - they seem to live a lot more lives then the rest of us. The key to longevity is somewhere in there.

Sucks for the grunts though - never heard of one of those guys coming back from a suicide bombing. 




  penal colony

Not much worse then one of our prisons making a few cents an hour, getting raped in the US and coming out a more hardened criminal. 




 Banditry without guns never goes over well. 




 People's thoughts are generally tied to things that they're being pumped with as part of their daily routine (interactions with others, the media they consume, etc.) These issues will never get the sort of highlighting that the apparent aggressions of our opponents will, or the new Kanye interview will. 




 That's not how it works, in this country or any others. The most recent example being the child diddlers in the UK government. There is no such thing as karma in the real world. 




 There are some fundamental oversight issues with the way we do things. 




 The CIA and NSA are the good guys, sure they treat terrorists like shit but that's part of why I like them.

God - I really hope you're not actually in the Navy. You're a disgrace to all the men and women who serve and believe in being civilized. 




 I hope that's sarcasm. Because torturing people, meddling in international affairs, creating chaos in relatively stable regions etc. have a direct correlation with "all our childrens" being "blowed up". We've fucked up a lot, but its not irreversible. It requires us to think outside of the box. Like perhaps, not trying to bomb people into submission as that hasn't been mighty effective over the past several years. 




 /s

You forgot that. 




 Not everyone was paying attention, and in 2007ish, there was the common denial of this sort of stuff being rogue elements and not an institutional problem. New information about old abuses is good - it helps catch up people who missed it the first several years over or tried to plausibly deny it because we're all about being 'civilized' and what-have-you. 




 Sadly 




 They're not investigative journalists, they simply report the material that they've come onto (with the same level of scrutiny you'd expect from a standard news report). Investigative reports, documentaries - the only things short of video recordings - that look into issues take a lot more time, but are often based in part on leaks like these. 









 Environment 














 You just posted this - at least give the hasbara trolls a few hours to brigade properly. 




 the killer himself made a link between his acts and Islam.

No. He didn't. Feel free to provide the non-existent citation. 




 Go ahead and talk to the CAIR chapter in your local area...which actually documents hate crimes instead of random people in Reddit. In the past year, where I live, there's been 100 cases of reported acts of vandalism, and outright beatings. Reported attacks - I'm personally aware of people who choose not to report the occasional hate-crime (resulting in tangible material loss) for fear of further harassment.

It must be fun having living under a rock. 




 Pamela Geller, Ayan Hirsi, Fox News. Sorry, yes they are. 




 Did I say that? I asked you a question about your redefining of a well-known term.

Edit: And for the record, I don't. Muslims who live in the West do so under contract, explicit and implicit, in the gaining of visas or citizenship. Whether you're a born or naturalized citizen, these contracts explicitly demand adherence to local laws.

And even if it wasn't explicitly laid out, these actions have a net negative imposition on every other Muslim living in the region - and no extended benefit for Muslims internationally either as the end result is more money pumped into the war machine for further misguided adventures by our government abroad. The objective of a defensive war in Islam is to repel an invasion, not to invite more.

And these actions also don't accord with Islamic law where even for suriyah or out-right war, the individual participants are required to act under a commander.

And that's assuming that your nonsense of attributing a religious motive to this individual in Chatanooga is actually valid when we have no non-circumstantial evidence to believe it is. 




 "muh joos cuntrul le werld XDXDXD"

Not a single comment in this thread even implied that fucktard. 




 Different sub - but holy cow 




 Yes, it's more serious than a normal dog but no where near the ramifications of a human. 

Legally, no. But I can't imagine it won't be a bumpy ride to your cell, or that you won't get James Boyd'ed in the process. 




 If a civilian attacks legitimate military targets, it's terrorism than? So the private security and other volunteers going into Syria right now to fight IS are also 'terrorists' by your definition? 




  Terrorists commit terror in name of Islam --,which this guy did 

Except that he didn't. There's no proven motive yet. 




 President Barrack HUSSEIN Obama wishes happy Eid to the Mozlems on eve of horrific ISIS attack on our soil!!11! 




 Except that no actual IS rep claimed it. An account of a claimed IS fan, with no corroborated or proven connection, claimed responsibility *after the fact*.

Edit: And that random account didn't even claim responsibility. It simply tweeted "Chatanooga" after the fact. 




 there IS a racial component to the issue

Yeah - that racism is allowed to thrive in some departments is a direct result of the blue wall of silence and police corruption. It's a symptom and not the root cause. 

And I wouldn't dismiss the racial **symptom** of it, I'm at the Black Lives Matter rallies. I'm simply saying I don't like the massive re-contextualization of an racial reform issue having to do with *average citizens vs authority* - something I've worked on for years - over the last year. That said, I realize the ship has sailed and that progressive movements will now be focusing primarily on patching up the symptom and not the actual cause, and I'll naturally be part of that struggle as it's better than nothing. 




 Dunno, but I can think of plenty of unarmed white men who've suffered police brutality and died as a result. 




 That's not even what I implied. The fact that racism is allowed to thrive in some departments is a direct symptom of the blue wall of silence and police corruption. Root causes of this issue that effect all groups of people. Not the other way around. We're now focus on remedying one of the symptoms and not the actual cause. 




 It is a race issue if anything is.

That's simply not true. Racism being allowed to thrive in some departments is a direct symptom of the blue wall of silence and police corruption. Not the other way around. 




 That's not true. Those same people used to rally for white victims of police brutality. Fox brought tons of them out with guns, using their children as human shields, to support the criminals at Bundy ranch.

By re-contextualizing, we've given people who lack the ability to empathize with people different from them, a way to justify their racism as simply being support for law enforcement. And instead of having an issue that affects all of us be reformed, we have half the country (hyperbole) opposed to reform as a result. 




 Bootlickers are gonna be bootlickers. 

Those bootlickers are bootlickers because they are unable, based on their upbringing, to empathize with the black high school drop out. Those same bootlickers were railing in favor of Bundy against the government, and various other white 'criminals' that faced off against cops.

We function in a democracy and need to cater to the lowest common denominator when we push for any sort of reform - if we want it to be universal. And unfortunately, because of the way this conversation has now irreversibly been characterized, instead of average citizen vs authority issue, it's now a black suspect vs white authority issue. 




 Derailing? I've been documenting police brutality for several years... If anything, the new contextualization derailed from a universal problem. To focus on the more central problems of the blue wall of silence, police corruption, and police abuse isn't victim blaming... Racism being allowed to thrive in some departments is just a symptom of the blue wall of silence, not the cause. 




 To focus on the more central problems of the blue wall of silence, police corruption, and police abuse. Racism being allowed to thrive in some departments is just a symptom of the blue wall of silence, not the cause.

Then again - it's too late. The issue of police brutality has already been framed into an almost exclusively race-based one by our own movements and media at this point. 




  The police shoot members of both races, although I agree the blacks suffer from this more. 

It's a shame, by turning this into a race issue, people have inadvertently led to more blind support for law enforcement abuses by more conservative voters. When in truth, police brutality is something we are ALL affected by. By making the issue into a race one, we've killed the possibility of reform in some of the places that need it most. 




 You're getting downvoted, but that's the truth. Saddam kept people in line, and contrary to popular opinion, had Shi'ites and Christians in his government. 




 I don't pretend to understand what is happening in the Mid East, but to me, it just seems like a long road of endless violence. 

I understand what's happening in the Middle East. That's exactly what it is. 




 At least our military industrial complex will continue pumping away. Too bad for all the people who died and will die in the coming years :( 




 Here's a Sunni polemicist site (pacifist missionary style):

http://twelvershia.net/

If you read any of the articles, the main difference is entirely theological.

The current issues, that lead to killings on both sides, have nothing to do with theology though. It's an issue of political alignment with political leaders using religious adherants as pawns.

If you go back to the root of the modern violence, you can go back to the Saffavid dynasty when modern Twelver Shi'ism became a major religious group within Islam due to the ethnic cleansing of Iran of the then Sunni majority under Shah Ismail. And again at the Islamic Revolution in Iran when Khomayni created a new concept in Twelver Shi'ism called Waliyat al Faqih - turning Shi'is to a more active politicized, as opposed to Messianic, religion. This in turn meant meddling in foreign affairs (Iran supported rebellions in Iraq and elsewhere), etc. If it had remained a theological dispute - as it was long ago at many points in time, the worst case scenario today would be zealots and missionaries denouncing one another. 




 Everything coincides with these days over there - as it's a way to taunt your enemy. Saddam Hussein for instance, was executed on the day Sunnis were celebrating Ei'd by the Shi'ite government in Iraq. 




 Depends on the location and the role. A tenured cop that got promoted can make more in 10 years than the average citizen in mid-level, non-executive management (80-120K). 




 I feel like stuff like this must happen, though very rarely. We probably just don't hear much about it - like the domestic terrorist who flew a plane into the IRS building. 




 Their enemies haven't ever played by the rules either. We're not fed that side of the story because then we realize it's not black and white, and there really aren't any "good guys" in this fight. [NSFW](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=6f2_1404371007) 




 Even the semi-sane ones know not to be taken prisoner - nobody there is following international law. NSFW links below:

http://np.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/2xy9lu/link_to_photo_album_of_those_starved_and_tortured/ 




 That's not true, YPG unlike the Shi'ite army and militias aren't known for torturing prisoners or patrolling with corpses on their vehicles. 




 This isn't a confirmed figure from a reputable source...just a blog post and Leith has been known to exaggerate in the past... 




 It's a four year course, Bagdaddy finished in one! 




 This brings me a lot of comfort. If we are just a computer program there is a chance of an afterlife program.

It shouldn't. If we're just going on the chance that there is an afterlife, there's no reason to believe that it will be in any way a comforting after life. Could be endless physical suffering. 




 Every account of him from his friends has him described as 'nice if you get to know him', 'introverted', 'not one of the popular kids, but polite', etc. He may have had a small clique of friends, that doesn't mean he's well-adjusted or didn't face the sort of discrimination his sister spoke out against a few years ago.

To have a tongue in cheek joke about discrimination as the defining statement of your high school career is a good indication that at the very least he was familiar with such incidents, if not intimately and personally so. Likewise, his dad was wrongly detained for questioning by the FBI at a point in his life. His siblings worked to tackle Islamaphobia in the region. Everything is indicative of his experience with discrimination.

That said, you can't expect a CNN piece focusing on this single aspect of the kid's development. They'd get crucified for "blaming the victims" for at least a good year before somebody has the wherewithal, greed and motivation to write a book or serious piece about the issue. 




 They don't need aircraft carriers to be drowned by their enemy...they obviously had to cross the Tigris when they wanted to attack beyond Anbar before they lost Tikrit, not to mention they controlled several dams... 




 By all accounts, he was a popular kid 

Now you're just making shit up. Every account of him from his friends has him described as 'nice **if you get to know him**', 'introverted', 'not one of the popular kids, but polite', etc. He may have had a small clique of friends, that doesn't mean he's well-adjusted or didn't face the sort of discrimination his sister spoke out against a few years ago. He even made a crude joke about discrimination for his heritage as part of his yearbook signature. Well-assimilated kids don't need to do that where assimilation by definition lends to them identifying with the culture they developed in.

Why is it that when you see something like this, your immediate reaction is a classist anti-southerner screed?

Because by all accounts, he was a mal-adjusted kid in a state of inbred Fox News fans.

Not prejudice. Records of anecdotal incidents of discrimination, the sort of rhetoric by popularly elected representatives, and how the majority of districts vote, are all a pretty clear indication of what sort of place TN is with the exception of isolated pockets. 




 Ding Ding Ding 




 Except that Fox News quite literally isn't real news. They don't even self-classify as an actual news outlet. It's why they're able to get away with the bullshit they spin. 




 Nobody said everybody who faces discrimination becomes a terrorist. Same way, not everybody who gets molested as a kid becomes a serial killer. All I pointed out was that these experiences do play a role in the development of antisocial behavior. This is basic psychology. But pretending that past interactions don't shape the future perspectives of people, and boiling complex issues to simple black and White hyperbole would indicate that you don't have the intellectual capacity to have a reasoned discussion on the topic. So I'm out. Have a wonderful life. 




 I feel like the govt should subsidize hookers for engineering departments, as like a once monthly thing. Would really help clear away bad thoughts and isolation and whatnnot. 




 Jeez - I can't even imagine being that Boston bomber's sister. 




 She did. It's not about not knowing him, people change over time. You can tell from his joke in the highschool yearbook that he's probably used to plenty of abuse from authority as a result of his heritage. It's not difficult to see years of being outcast by your peers in bumbfuck TN being a leading cause in your outlook and development. 




 I know of children under 3 being put on terror watchlists (and later being removed). What you cited means literally nothing, except proving the exact antithetical point to what you're implying by the fact that the man was ultimately removed. 




 He has a reasonable defense in court, true or not. He saw this car smoking and began filming innocuously. He then considered helping the victims - prompting him to lean into the car. However, you realized the issue was beyond his scope of expertise so he ceased trying to help and simply continued filming. 




 People often hate on cops, and sure there is a real issue with the blue wall of silence, but what they don't seem to realize is that the real villains are in the legislature. 




 This isn't even about bad cops. This is about corruption among city officials - which led to these cops, good or bad, quitting. I don't know how anyone can spin it different. 




 Nah, by getting this unpopular decision out of the way now, they ensure that people won't remember it years down. Democracies have voters with short attention spans and even shorter memories. 




  I swear politics now days is a game: Get in, make as much money as you can for you and your mates, then retire.

It's always been a game of thrones. The future will be shit, just like the past. 




 Your MPs rape little children. Haven't seen much striking over that. 




 It won't be good. You should get local police at wherever you guys do your holiday prayers at. 




 The people that do, like Russel Brand for instance, have no meaningful role in media or politics. 




 I would need to see the video - I didn't even realize they had a drowning / det cord ones. But I imagine something similar (you sank our ship, etc.) 




 "lost" ftfy 




 Ah - that explains it. They're not being unAmerican, they're just patriotic conscientious objectors. Let's throw away these pitch forks and signs about the 1% 




  Especially since the Iraq war gained us exactly nothing.

Not true. We got a shit ton of contracts for Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Haliburton, and various other firms that are part of the military industrial complex. We also created quite a few jobs. Not to mention we've led to that region becoming epically fucked and unstable - ergo -  more contracts for our private military companies.

And who knows, maybe 10 years down the road, a puppet government - hopefully less subservient to Iran and more to us - will be kind enough to allow our private civil corporations to rebuild that shithole. 




 Haaretz is one of the few *reasonable* papers they print in Israel. Everything else is the sort of right-wing drivel and Israeli fear-propaganda you expect people like OP to post. 




 You won't lose nudity, that can be really profitable for them in the long run. You may/will lose BDSM/rape/bestiality/humiliation/etc. subs. 




 I wonder what the next big execution thing will be. Pulling people apart? Feeding them alive to hungry feral dogs? They seem to have tried and overdone themselves time and time again.

For the creative ones - They base their executions on the nature of the 'crime' of the person they're executing. So if you're thinking about the Jordanian, he was burnt alive and then burried under rubble because he was accused of being complicit in doing that to 'citizens' of IS as a bomber pilot. Bombs incinerate their victims or cover them in rubble (as apartments get toppled). So I don't think they'll be employing feral dogs anytime soon in their short blip in history. 




 Nope. In Iraq, the Sunnis and Shi'ites under Saddam weren't racially/ethnically disprate. There were even large tribes with both Sunnis and Shi'ites. The exception was in the mostly Shi'ite South, but you can't tell the difference between somebody from Basra and someone from Tikrit. After the Iranian revolution, and the Iran supported rebellions within Iraq, there obviously wasn't as much cohesion between Sunni Arab and Shi'ites. That said though, 30-40 years of angst isn't going to change generations of common ethnic background - so they still look pretty alike.

Now if you take an Iranian (mostly Shi'ite) and a Pakistani or an Afghan (mostly Sunni), you'll notice huge differences. And in Afghanistan your theory would actually hold since Shi'ism is more the cultural religion of Hazara who are ethnically seperate from the others. 




 What's funny is that before the media frenzy about ISIS, I had posted videos of everything from torture of Sunnis captured by Shi'ite militias (outright torture celebrated on camera), burning people alive, using corpses as decals on jeeps, etc.

People think ISIS came out of nowhere, or that they're some great evil we need to go out there and defeat. We need to stop fucking around in their deserts, there's no "good guys" out there. 









  He inherited 40-200m, maybe he lost most of it but he's worth 10 billion now...not everyone can make that happen without getting lucky and making the right business decisions.

He's not worth 10 Bn. Probably not even close to that. Forbes, and countless other parties have contested his claims (in some cases - itemized contestations) 




 Any proof that he **recently** expressed support for universal healthcare or expanding 'Obamacare'? 



















 What about Aether? 




 Instituted Urdu over them? Hardly. If you don't have a medium language, Sindhis and Punjabis can't say shit to one another. That Urdu (and English of late) are medium languages is out of requirement of needing *something* to be mutually intelligible to other people in the same damn country. 




 It's a medium language, how English is in most of the world. Everybody speaks other languages, but they need Urdu/English to communicate with people from other regions. 




 I disagree. US media is actual shit. Yours is still, like piss or something. 




 Yes, because rape fixes everything. Let me guess, you're a middle aged white American. 




 Not really. All it takes is time, and growth. If this kid was kept on a watch and never allowed to make way into Syria, 3 years of simply living in a truly inclusive society (another problem in the UK) - and he could've ended up a productive tax-paying citizen.

He's gonna come out a proper criminal now, he'll still lose the fanaticism, but it won't be a beneficial result for the general populace. 




 Also totally cool in WA, way before the Supreme Court decision. 




 Come to Seattle, there's a lot to do till pretty late. Some spots still going till like 5 AM 




 Fuck yea. Let's secede? We've been carrying all this weight like.. 




 Yep, it fails to be mutual at that point. 




 Yep, but be careful with that. When they're drunk and they got a pussy, you're getting booked. 




 It's mutual combat in WA, not a street fight. If one person calls quits, its no longer mutual, so it would be a cheap shot and a basis to argue damages. Of course there's no reason to really believe that happen here. 




 So I haven't used /r/loans in like a year. I come back and all of a sudden new page w/ improvements. Nice.. 




 Actually, I dont understand what you are saying. Sorry to be dense, but the death of Jesus by crucifixion is established history by historians. Islam denies this. That is all I claimed in my comment. 

You said, "Islam rejects that Jesus died on the cross even though this is considered to be a historical fact by scholars."

I'm saying that your statement is disingenuous as there are secular historians who believe that the historical Jesus either never existed, or that the Canonical Gospel accounts of Jesus' life/death aren't relevant to the historical Jesus. If Jesus, as described in the canonical gospels, did not exist - Jesus, as described in the canonical gospels, was not crucified.

Likewise, its disingenuous in that, of the secular scholars who believe in a historical Jesus, there are historians who don't believe he was crucified either. They've proposed other modes of natural death and execution.

Given these two issues, contrasting Islamic and mainstream Christian theology, while saying something is considered to be a "historical fact" "by scholars" carte-blanche isn't reasonable. In the same vein, I can say "[Mainstream] Christianity believes that Jesus rose from the dead even though this is considered a myth by scholars. Islam and [Mainstream] Christianity are very different"

Although evangelicals love making this particular appeal to authority - **it's just not an academically honest thing to bring up - in the context of theology**, and can be easily applied to mainstream Christians - was my point.

Also - side note, one of the principles (rejection) used in the past by some secular historians to conclude that Jesus was likely crucified isn't that strong, particularly in the last 50 or so years - especially with the discovery of Nag Hammadi. The particular Nag Hammadi texts that contradict the crucifixion (btw) are non-Basilidian texts that provide an additional sectarian confirmation of Basilides' theology re:crucifixion (a denial of crucifixion by a subset of early Christians which was known primarily through polemics by Ireneus/Origen/etc. against Basilides). 




 Islam rejects that Jesus died on the cross even though [the idea that Jesus died in one way or another] ~~this~~ is considered to be a historical fact by ~~scholars~~ [historians who believe Jesus existed].

Christianity teaches that Jesus rose from the dead several days later even though this is considered a historical fabrication by historians who believe Jesus existed.

See what I did there? Relevance of a historians analysis, based on the reality of death in the human experience, on theology... 




 Let's leave aside that example - there's tons of examples that the Law wasn't temporally universal for the Jews. There are passages where God himself orders people to wipe out entire towns (down to every living thing) and there are other passages where God prohibits taking innocent lives.

Israel was carrying out Gods judgment on specific nations who practiced idolatry, sexual immorality, and child sacrifice, so many innocent lives were already being taken. There were rules that they had to follow. They had to offer the city terms of surrender, so the people knew ahead of time that Israel was coming. Only those who didnt leave were killed. They allowed the Canaanites to assimilate into Israel if they were willing. When Israel practiced the same sins as the other nations, God judged them too.

You don't need to defend the fact that the OT God was ordering genocidal raids against idolators' cities down to every breathing thing, etc. My point was that God not only allowed, but ordered mass killings in certain circumstances. Other times, God changed it to prohibit victimization of the innocent civilians. I'm not bringing up the morality/barbarity associated with something like this - my point was that you object to the idea that * Something is okay one day, and not okay the next * - but the Bible is replete with examples of this. Examples which you have no trouble reconciling in the Bible but find adamantly problematic in Islamic concept of abrogation.

Im not sure what you are trying to show with this link.

The link was a response to what you said: the Quran is supposed to be the next revelation confirming what was revealed before in the Torah and the Gospel.

I was pointing out that this isn't what is intended, but rather confirming (what is true) from what is left of past books and *correcting* what is false from the past books is the objective.

You claim the Quran corrects the previous revelation. Since weve been discussing...

I'll take it than you have no interest in the Qur'anic corrections of Biblical factual errors (as in the link) as you would rather address other items besides that (which is fine)...

 marriage/adultery/mutah, was Jesuss teaching on divorce a corruption?

I wouldn't know if Jesus' purported teaching on divorce are a corruption or not. Let's assume that his teachings **to the Children of Israel**, for whom he was sent, were not a corruption.

Considering that Muhammad allowed sex with slaves, sex with captive women while their husbands were still alive... I can only assume that Muhammad was correcting Gods previously corrupted revelation.

Jesus never prohibited either of these things - even in what's remained of the corrupted revelations. Having sex with slaves never fell under adultery for the Old Testament God and Jesus never came along and suggested that it is now adultery or slavery is now abolished (the opposite, slaves ought to obey their masters per Christ's purported disciples - Titus 2/9), or that it has become prohibited as part of his new laws...

and married his adopted sons wife after a divorce

Wouldn't be a problem with Jewish law, though in your hypothetical, if we assume that Jesus' teachings were not just for Jews, but for Gentiles, and that Jesus' teachings prohibit divorce, than it would be problematic. That's two assumptions we don't necessarily buy.

Ummm..it sure did!! In fact, you are commanded to tell me you believe in what has been revealed to me (29:46), not some ghost Christian from around the time of Christ. Will you obey the Quran?
As above - [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/2zgomi/where_is_muhammad_mentioned_in_the_bible/cpkdocd)

One of the benefits of having so many manuscripts is we know **no one person** could have tampered with the texts, especially the NT.

Except that they did, unless you're suggesting that ample examples like John 7:53 (onwards) were made by a group of people. This passage, like many other passages, was inserted at some point. For Christians spanning wide physical and temporal regions (literally centuries) - this was canon - they were duped by the surviving MS family into believing that this was a part of the Gospel attributed to John. Until the discoveries of some early John MS' + Sinaiticus (about 200 years ago), etc.

So for centuries, interpolations (such as this one) are able to creep on by *in spite of* the many manuscripts that pre-date these discoveries and improve our understanding of what was actually originally in these texts.

If you're suggesting that no one person alone could've tampered with the text, sure. Instead, many different people with different reasons over different periods of time were able to tamper with the text. And this is just the evidence of tampering in late manuscript families (leading to the widespread propagation of different interpolations which are uncovered only as discoveries are made). There aren't actually any full MS that are contemporary with the purported authors - making early interpolations pretty practicable as well.

 




 No wories. 

Whether it is God directly or God through a prophet, Im not sure I understand the difference.

The difference is that in the history of OT, the particular phrase "God will go" was used to mean the selection of a Prophet. It has never, in the history of the OT to my recollection, meant that God Himself arrives in an avatar (Jesus). You can't on the one hand demand Muslims mentioning Isaiah 42 embrace the context of both Proto and Deutro Isaiah while yourself ignoring the context of these Jewish phrases you're re-interpreting to apply to Christ.

In our example (Hosea 2), the the text is clear. It says God will go to the gentiles. From the context of the OT, it implies that God will select a Gentile Prophet. But you're suggesting a revolutionary meaning outside of the OT context, that this time around, the scripture actually means God will himself come down in human form as an *Israelite* and that the *Israelite* will go to the Gentiles. Can you find one single verse in the OT where this phrase is used and *not meant* that God will select a Prophet *from* the group He's "going to"?

Im surprised you would bring this up. Pointing out that a sect does not adhere to the majority has no bearing on what the truth is.

Absolutely does. You don't hold a monopoly over interpretation. The fact that different subsets of Christians, with largely the same canon at this point, are coming to multiple interpretations using the same text implies ambiguity. Ambiguity allows for interpretation (as opposed to one irrevocable interpretation in "truth").

...

I take my interpretation from Scripture. I cant help if others ignore what Jesus said. 

As above. You take your interpretation from your understanding of what you take as scripture. Another person can interpret  your version of the same text to derive that divorce is completely illegal, or that divorce itself is okay, but remarriage is not, etc. The texts are not clear or there wouldn't be such disparity amongst several subsets of the population that have, more or less, the same scripture. 

And then if we look at the textual integrity of the verse - given that the MS evidence suggests that "except for fornication" is an interpolation, you open a whole new can of worms (making it clear that divorce is never permitted - contradicting your view which is based on a certain subset of our manuscripts). One of the problems associated with the myriad of "minor" MS discrepancies is that they often effect meaning.

Requiring this is a double standard since there are also varying interpretations of things within Islam.

Requiring what? Islamic law, like Jewish law, is open to varying interpretations. This is intrinsically consistent with what the source texts themselves say about multiple interpretations.

All that being an aside however. The main point you were making (as I gather it) is that it makes sense for Jesus to abrogate some/all of the Law because your reading of Paul's interpretation of these passages is that the laws were prophesied to be cancelled?

I quoted the OT, not Paul.

You quoted Jeremiah 31. That doesn't mean your interpretation of Jeremiah 31 isn't influenced by your reading of Paul's suggestion of 'the law in spirit' and not reading Jeremiah as its own text.

I could qoute the Bahagavad Gita to make a point that no Hindu had ever understood from the passage, and which the context and language of the passage doesn't support based on the later supplemental texts. That doesn't mean its what the Gita implies.
But if you find offense to that, we can simplify,  *The main point you were making (as I gather it) is that it makes sense for Jesus to abrogate some/all of the Law because your ~~reading of Paul's~~ interpretation of these passages is that the laws were prophesied to be cancelled?*

There is nothing morally wrong with how someone plants a field of crops or if they mix fabrics, unless someone is doing this in the context of idolatry. 

But who are you to decide what is and is not morally wrong though? If you believe in an Objective Morality, you need a fundamental source to fix that morality. If that source is God, than what God says you should do becomes moral, and what God says you shouldn't do becomes immoral. As you say yourself, "Adultery has always been morally wrong, at least according to Christianity **when God set up marriage.**"

You can justify mutah by saying that its not really adultery since they were technically married and Moses also permitted divorce; however, this is where Jesus calls out the Israelites saying that they even though the Israelites were technically following the law, their hearts were far from the things of God.

I'm not justifying mut'ah. It's prohibited.

If Muhammad was a prophet from God, why did his life and Gods newest revelation contradict the prior revelations?

Where's the contradiction? The Christians haven't (re-)discovered Q - and that's assuming Q is even an accurate reflection of Christ's actual teachings. There are no accurate reflections of prior revelation in existence per Islamic text, in spite of the evangelically forced misinterpretation of one or two ayaat, as mentioned to you by someone in a different thread. Edit: [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/2zgomi/where_is_muhammad_mentioned_in_the_bible/cpkdocd)

Jesus was showing what the intention of the law was.

Right, that's semantics. The fact is that he changed the law. Divorce was okay, with OT examples, one day and not okay the next (abrogation). You can say it was just Jewish hypocrisy, but the OT God seemed to lay out a lot of material that suggest that divorce, re-marriage after divorce and polygamy were allowed in more circumstances than just adultery.

[To be continued...] 




 No, it doesn't. But instead of spouting the tired reductionist BS, why not [actually look into](http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cm0t3/original_research_the_mountain_of_evidence_for_a/) and let us know what you find.[2](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2zzy13/uk_government_rejects_immunity_for_public/cpnv677) [3](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2zzy13/uk_government_rejects_immunity_for_public/cpny2yt) 



















  I heard from people who stayed in the village that [militiamen] were burning down houses, looting and blowing up houses. I went back last week, approximately 10 days ago, because our financial situation is poor and I needed to collect our belongings, especially as winter is coming. When I got there I saw that 99 percent of the houses in my neighborhood were burnt down and nothing was left. While I was there we saw smoke rising from three different places. The smoke was coming from the areas in front of my house, near the main road near the militia offices. The school was burnt down too, and they burnt three [hospital] clinics and four mosques.

This is "liberation" apparently. 




 No, I'm sorry for being abrasive, I can see where the incorrect assumption would've been made based on the translation. 




 Alleged mediums are often women and people of color.

Maybe in America. I can't speak for Afghanistan specifically, but in these areas specifically (neighboring Muslim countries), the fortune teller stands are predominantly run by men. Soothsayers in our countries in this region are open about it, it's not something you're accused of and killed for - regardless of whether they're just bogus entrepreneurs. You're applying an American experience (Salem) to a completely different society. 




 Of course they are, it's extremely naive and arrogant of you to think that there are not people that are unsure that identify as muslims in this subreddit. Having a mature debate about it would be nice, but you are clearly so uncertain in your own belief that you felt intimidated by just the prospect of discussion about it

LOL. Well that escalated quickly. Peace. 




 It's not about it not being mature. I'd be interested in the topic too, but you need to find someone actually "considering leaving Islam" - and I'm sure they're out there, but the people in this sub (usually Muslims and non-Muslims with substantial interest in Islam) aren't the demographic you're going for. 




  Old footage mostly.

Exactly what I was thinking. Re-using a bunch of old clips you pushed out before the initiative doesn't really imply a lot of success. 




 It's not a baby or a fetus falling out of her womb....it's one his two kids that went up to her after she died.....

...   ... 




 That's not talking about a fetus falling out of her...it's one of his two children () coming up and getting splashed with some of her blood.  




 If she is pregnant, yes. But where is this idea of a pregnancy coming from? 




 a pregnant woman

How the Hell did you get that she was pregnant? 




 So by your logic we should ignore textual criticism; a secondary document affirming the Trinity, and the progression of Jesus's mission starting with the Jews then the Gentiles?

We were talking about **the textual integrity of a specific verse** you used, not Trinitarian doctrine in general...and your response is to bring up an unrelated issue and defend the unrelated issue...okay... 




 Here you will find the answer to al-Kheoi

The guy defending Khoi's argument boils down to 'There is a difference b/w plain lying and lying for a cause..' - confirming the fatwa and contradicting your original claim....

The evidence about the absurd nature of your cult - it's distance from the religion sent by Al-Haqq and the garbage you've attributed to the Imams AS, is there for your benefit in both fatawa and ahadith. Being a little honest with yourself won't hurt. Salaam 




 Sure, I can provide two examples off-hand, the prophecy about the volcanic event in Hijaz and a prophecy about the Mongol Invasion.

Re: the volcanic event, he mentioned that people as far as  Busra will observe the light from it. So he mentioned not only the event - but even the magnitude of the unforeseeable event in no uncertain terms. [This hadith](http://www.sahihmuslim.com/sps/smm/sahihmuslim.cfm?scn=dspchaptersfull BookID=41 ChapterID=1209) is in Sahih Muslim (261 AH) while the event took place around 600 AH.

As for the Mongol invasion, the Prophet explicitly laid out the racial characteristics and even the type of clothing of the invaders. [The hadith (179-180 and other recordings)](http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/052-sbt.php) is in Sahih Bukhari (200 AH) while the event took place in like 650 AH.

One especially remarkable feature, besides the detailed recorded statements about appearance 600 years prior to the event, is that he couldn't possibly know that Islam wouldn't spread to the Mongols - which would've falsified the prophecy (as the tradition implies a non-Muslim army coming in). Muslim armies also had never provoked the Mongols afaik so there was no possibility of self-fulfillment either. The Mongol armies had to stop their infighting, unite, and then succeed against China before progressing to the Muslim empires. We're dumbing it down here - but the level of complexity and the number of variables is pretty out there. 




 Let me know what statements in particular you'd like a citation for or found to be "a load of BS" - happy to provide any information you need. 




 I wouldn't know about your lab and I'm not a biologist. My point of reference is popular information about a handful of studies, like the one where they ran a social experiment on mice populations to the point of over-populating a limited space and where the animals began to exhibit abnormal behaviors (until the population ended up dying out). 




 [Reply 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/198xye/from_the_heart_to_the_heart_a_letter_to_the/c8m8gjq)

We'll tackle this first. My claim is that a central premise of your religion is **lying**, contrary to Islam. That your religious traditions have denigrated the Imams (AS) as nothing but habitual, and **needless liars**. And though the claim of your religion, through your version of the Imamah nonsense, is that the Imams are meant to be guides, they (rather their purported followers) generated more misguidance and confusion than guidance.

The premise of your defense is:

Taqiiya is only done when someone's life is at risk

And then you quote an out-of-context Sunni scholar's explanation of taqiyyah as it would be permissible in Islam, and try to extend his definition to your own cult. This is illogical. Your religion doesn't come from our scholars - if you have a defense of taqiyyah being what you claim it is, that defense should come from your texts. Not to mention that your disingenuous sources deliberately took Waheed uz Zaman's statements out of context.

Here's why I'm confused though, Grey - since I'm actually reading the fatwas of your scholars to learn about your religion - and your ahadith. You keep telling us that taqiyyah is only to save your life, that lying isn't okay otherwise. I agree with you, that is what **Islam teaches**. But it doesn't seem to be what your religion teaches, and it doesn't seem to be what your religious traditions suggest that the Imams RA did.

(1) If that was the case, why did al-Khoi give this fatwa:

He is explicitly allowing Twelvers to lie to Sunnis (or any non-Twelver) in debate if it means the Twelver will win the argument. Can you explain why al-Khoi, a venerated mujtahid of your cult would come to this conclusion while you - an anonymous nobody - has more claim to what is and is not allowed in your religion when practicing taqiyyah? This fatwa, and your claim contradicting it, has really confused me! Was al-Khoi just unaware that you can't do taqiyyah in munazarra?

(2) A similar sentiment is echoed by al Khomayni in his rasael:

            

[and again:]

           

He is explicitly allowing Twelvers, in one of the permissible types of taqiyyah, to lie in order to trick Sunnis simply so that Sunnis will be drawn in. This is not preservation of life and limb - it's outright deceit.

(3) A similar fatwa from as-Shirazi explaining how taqiyyah IS NOT what you're claiming it to be and IS allowed even without threat to life - but just to spread your cult (from Qawaid al Fiqhiya):

                                         .            

Over and over, I'm finding your major scholars permitting taqiyyah without fear of loss. Maybe you can clarify the statements above?

(4) I have some copy-pasta of my own from when I began to learn about your religion. [Shiachat thread](http://www.shiachat.com/forum/topic/234993616-ameen-after-fatiha/page-2). The people there are generally more knowledgable about their cult than most people on Reddit so I'll add details I omitted + clarification here. Imam told his followers to say Ameen out-loud after fatiha (hadith saheeh):

    (   )           :    :     

As you know however, in your religion there is no 'Ameen' after the Fatiha. And your books have saheeh traditions which suggest that you not only don't need to, but should NOT say 'Ameen' after the fatiha. The contradiction is easily resolved though. The Imam in one case is doing taqiyyah, and in the other case, he's telling the truth in secret to his Shi'a. Fair enough.

My issue however is that your definition of taqiyyah only allows people to lie when their life is threatened. This means that the Imam's life must've been threatened.

Here's the problem with that theory. In Sunni fiqh, there are different opinions on the Ameen. We all say it, but some say it out-loud (like Hanbalis) while others say it silently (like Hanafis). The Imam was in Hanafi territory. If he feared for his life, why did his false fatwa in taqiyyah match the fiqh position of non-Hanafis? This fatwa from the Imam, and your claim contradicting it, has really confused me! Was the Imam just unaware that you can't do taqiyyah except when your life is threatened? Why is the Imam misguiding us?

(5) And speaking of misguidance + useless lying, maybe you can explain this sahih hadith from al-Kafi to me:

                        :                            :                      :   !                   .
:      :               :    .

If taqiyyah is out of fear of life or limb, why is the Imam giving us **three unique fatwas (2 lies, 1 correct fatwa)**? The Imam explains that its better to confuse people so they don't rely on one another... is this what you've denigrated the holy progeny (AS) to? Absolutely repulsive. As an aside, your religion teaches us that we need Imamah so that we have **guides** who will explain the religion. If the Imams were such habitual liars who caused deliberate confusion, doesn't it kinda kill the whole purpose of Imamah?

---
I would like an absolute consensus on this issue, like how there is in shunning terrorism, or anything major like this.

This is not a major issue. The fact that your cult is sizable is a modern phenomenom. In spite of this, prominent scholars have already commented on the Imami religions that came well before your version was popularized...

Whatever happened to facing consequences like a man, guessing Wahhabis aren't blessed with this basic trait.

No, I guess they haven't. They learned from the best though. Your imaginary cave-boy Mahdi taught them that key to longevity is hiding...

honestly it makes your Sahaba (as per your history, **not my opinion**, nor my claim)

No reason to mince your words, this thread is old enough that nobody else will see it...

As for reading your copy-paste (which is just copy-pasta from AA - I was silly enough to hope for something original and unaddressed), I did, and I'd be happy to address the unrelated parts re:Uthman once you've clarified my misunderstandings about the basis of your religion: Lying. 




 So if you can kill animals in order to eat meat and make tents, i.e., to benefit a handful of people, then a priori, you can kill animals in order to benefit an entire population of people. 

Killing animals isn't the same as torture. And if we're real about - a lot of these experiments are torture - and some of the things that bring us "progress" are outright disgusting. 




  It kind of sounds like you're putting limits on God's mercy. 

Ultimately, it is up to God and we'll never know what's in somebody's heart. But as a general rule, the texts are clear that Islam is the only religion excepted. I agree with what you're implying - we can't truly fathom the extent of God's mercy and what He'll treat as the 'mustard seed of iman' - but we know what the general statement is (and in turn - the importance of dawah). 




 Whoa there bro! Can you be any more biased in explaining the sunni viewpoint? You didn't even make an attempt at explaining it. A naive reader will read your post and think that sunnis believe Allah (swt) has hands and feet like humans, Audubillah. 

The most amusing part of that statement is the reality that tajseem was introduced to Muslims through Hisham b al-Hakim, an Imami Shi'ite. Twelvers may have taken a more Mutazilli route over the years, but there's a good bit of irony there to chuckle at. 




 For me, it's prophecy. I just can't explain away bounds of clear-cut Prophet statements that were put to paper before the events took place. I'm not talking Nostradamus style prophecy, or how Christians contort symbolic OT verses into prophecies about Jesus - I'm not talking about self-fulfilling prophecies - but like, real, literal prophetic statements - many times many years into the future. Falsifiable statements that a false prophet would never have made. 




 My premise is more like if a Sunni and Shia Muslim lived together for 2 years in a college dorm, what differences would they notice day to day?

If you want to know basic differences in fiqh - you'll want to pick a comparative fiqh primer. I would suggest this one:

http://www.amazon.com/Islamic-Jurisprudence-According-Sunni-Schools/dp/1887752978

And then for Imami fiqh, I would recommend man la yadhurul faqih (you'll need to understand Arabic). This is technically a hadith book (since Shi'ites consider the words of an Imam as a hadith) but it's designed as a fiqh book. If you read them comparatively, you'll notice that Imami Shi'ites often have contradictory authentic traditions (like in nikah al mut'a or saying ameen after fatiha) where one matches a popular Sunni opinion and another is aberrant. The general logic is that the aberrant opinion is the correct one for Shi'ites and the one that matches Sunnis was said by the Imam in taqiyyah.

If you speak Urdu - which I gather from your post, see if you can find a comparative fiqh book by Mufti Abdul Kareem Mushtaq. I haven't read it so I can't comment on the content, but my understanding is he compares the majority opinion in the four madhahib of Sunnis and the major opinions of Twelver Shi'ites.

There are tons of differences though you'll notice in the minutiae if you're both religious. The basis of Imami Shi'ism was to be anti-thetical to whatever the 'aam (majority) were doing. In the case of fiqh, this translated to doing the opposite of the major school of Sunni fiqh in your city - and that became the basis for the narrations that Imamis have in their books which aren't found in the books of traditional Islamic sects (Sunnis, Zaydi Shi'ites, Ibadis, etc.)

As an example, Hur Amili said:

               **           **

Basically, Sunni scholars were so misguided by Shaitan that it became a rule in Twelver Shi'ism to simply do the opposite of what the Sunnis did.

Hopefully that helps in whatever you're trying to study. 




 If it wouldn't be considered effeminate in your culture and among the people you surround yourself with, there shouldn't be a problem. One of the sons of Imam Ahmed had his ears pierced (as per their culture). Where/when I was growing up, you did that if you were a homo. Now, it's normal. It's all relative. 




 You can work work on your reading comprehension brother. We were talking about this verse in the context of Jesus telling his disciples to baptize all nations (gentiles). Here's how you used it:

"Jesus's commandment to "Go out and Baptize all nations in the name of the Father, Son, Holy Spirit." Was meant for all. Jesus commanded His disciples to treat the Gentiles, and the entire world."

This contradicts other statements which /u/g3t_re4l quoted you in which Jesus makes it abundently clear that he came solely for the Children of Israel and also conflicts with the Hebrew manuscript tradition for Matthew.

I mentioned the trinity and the baptism part off-hand so it's a shame you feel the need to focus on a tertiary issue rather than the relevant point. I also didn't say anything about the trinity in general, but as it pertains to **this particular verse**. In this verse, it's a widely recognized interpolation - a shallow reference to a non-canonical text doesn't dismiss that. 




  Jesus's commandment to "Go out and Baptize all nations in the name of the Father, Son, Holy Spirit."

Besides the fact that this ayah contradicts the other statements in Matthew that /u/g3t_re4l pointed out, it also suffered extensive interpolation. Within the standard Greek text, the trinity isn't even mentioned in the earliest sources. And in the Hebrew text, that entire statement of going to Gentiles doesn't exist. 




 Don't know what Hasan Sahih means, but I'm gonna take an educated guess and assume that it means better than good, but not quite authentic.

It depends on the scholars. This was used by our earlier scholars and they used it differently.

Not quite sure what Sahih in chain means. Don't know what Da'if in chain means

That means the muhaqiq only graded the sanad and has no comment on the matn. The matn could have gharib wording. 




 If there was a mob in the centre of Mecca complaining about some Islamic thing, it would be obvious that the mob is Muslim. If there's a mob in the centre of a Christian district, expressing anger in the immediate after-math of church bombings and lack of security - it's pretty obvious that the mob is Christian... 




  In Jeremiah 31, it says that a new covenant is coming were God will write his law on the hearts of his people. 

I know the context with which most modern Christians understand it. That said, when I read this - I see God saying his new covenant will be with a people who are very devout (His law is in their heart - meaning they keep the law very well, in contrast to those who broke it). By the context itself, Jeremiah is juxtaposing it with the assertion of how these two covenants are different in the preceding verse (one was broken by the people, the other one will be in their hearts/minds - meaning it won't be broken). That said, I'm not wholly convinced in the reliability of the Masoretic Yirmiyahu anyways given the extremely substantial differences in our earliest text (LXX).

In Hosea 2, it says God will go to the Gentiles, they will become his people, and they will accept him as God.

When God says he will go to the non-Israelites, does He mean he will go thru an Israelite (Jesus) and then an Israelite will go to the Gentiles, or that He will go to the Gentiles? In every verse I can think of where God says "I go to" or "I will go to" in Tanakh or the Nevi'im, God selects a prophet from amongst them (as the meaning of 'I will go to them'). Moreover, if in Hosea 2 God didn't mean he will send a Prophet among Gentiles, but would come through an Israelite, then the verse loses its substance as the chapter begins by first renouncing the status of Bani Yisrael as a Chosen People at the time when this event would take place.

When Christ fulfilled the old covenant that Israel broke, the new covenant came to the Gentiles. There was no longer a need to physically separate oneself from the other nations by the outward appearance. Instead, the separation is to be seen by the change in a persons heart and how they treat others.

Sure, that is your understanding of the verse. But if you've ever met an Ethiopian Christian, you'll notice they won't eat pork but they will eat other meat without keeping the Law of slaughter. Not every Christian sect interpreted Jesus as cancelling all the laws, just some of them. Pauline Christians (like yourself) differ in how you understand the cancellation, or the reason behind the laws.

All that being an aside however. The main point you were making (as I gather it) is that it makes sense for Jesus to abrogate some/all of the Law because your reading of Paul's interpretation of these passages is that the laws were prophesied to be cancelled? Ergo, **God saying** he will cancel some laws is justification for "how something can be fine on one day and then a sin on the next day". If that's the case though, Islamic theology surrounding the abrogation of laws is also wholly internally compatible. As Muslims believe God Himself said some laws/covenants will be adjusted later as well.

Divorce was and still is allowed, but this does not mean there was or is no sin in the matter. There are two parties involved in a marriage and if one of those parties breaks the vow through adultery, the other party is permitted to divorce without committing a sin. There is still a sin that was committed that lead to the divorce. 

As I said, *some Christians*. Your interpretation may allow divorce, many early Church fathers forbade it, many other Christians allow it without considering it a sin and others allowed it while considering it a sin. The Catholics will say it isn't allowed at all and play semantics to annul marriages, the Copts will say that it is only allowed in the case of adultery, etc. My point was though that *the law changed*. For the Jews, divorce was usually discouraged but never forbidden while Christians developed different laws around it based on the understanding of what Jesus meant.

I believe in an objective moral law for all people, so just because something was normal in a culture does not mean it was not a sin....What does the law was abrogated mean in this context?

For God to allow this thing - even order Abraham to do it - implies that it did not violate the law to which Abraham was subject - right? Regardless of Abraham's God being more merciful than the polytheistic gods - he did order it. Abraham also proved his faith in his willingness to carry it out. Abraham had no reason to believe God would save the child, and since *God* told him to do it, Abraham had no reason to believe it was immoral or a sin.

Let's leave aside that example - there's tons of examples that the Law wasn't temporally universal for the Jews. There are passages where God himself orders people to wipe out entire towns (down to every living thing) and there are other passages where God prohibits taking innocent lives. Either God is ordering people to commit a sin in one case (which is illogical since God would be the basis of a set of morals being 'objective') - or divine law/morals were subject to change over time/place/circumstance. Likewise the laws associated with Temple Judaism became defunct when the temple was demolished. King Solomon and other Prophets practiced polygamy and kept concubines vs the monogamy espoused by most Christians today, etc.

I agree that the laws didnt all come at once, but the Quran is supposed to be the next revelation confirming what was revealed before in the Torah and Gospel. Extra-marital sex as a sin was already revealed before the Quran. Divorce without adultery as a sin was already revealed before the Quran. 

Re: Confirming what came before, it means the stories (by confirming [and correcting them](http://www.islamic-awareness.org/Quran/Contrad/External/josephdetail.html)). The Qur'an isn't confirming the Biblical texts themselves as being true - as even extant texts/traditions don't (and didn't) agree with one another. The Qur'an also isn't confirming the old Laws, since it comes with a brand new Law/Covenant that abrogates any old laws. And the Qur'an isn't being revealed to just Jews and Christians, but to all people. Not every group in or around Arabia had the same law. This is a time when people were following one of many Pagan traditions, Mandeanism, Manicheanism, Zoroastrianism, different forms of Christianity, of Judaism, etc. People also had different laws, as the Prophets that God would've sent in India or China didn't come down with all the same stuff as the Prophets God sent to the Israelites (besides Monotheistic theology) - as per Islam, and other people designed laws without any prophetic guidance at all, etc.

The Hadiths seem to indicate that the men recognized they could not just go off and have sex with the local women, since they made the observation that their women/wives were not with them. This tells me they knew adultery was a sin and created a new form of marriage to get around it. Whats the difference between this a prostitution? Im sure you have heard the saying, A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.

Well, they didn't create mut'a, it existed in Arabia before Islam, and it existed among Jews even before that (as the Sages did it - I would imagine they certainly didn't consider it contravening the Laws of marriage or falling under prostitution). The main thing about prostitution that makes it prostitution isn't the term limit imo. 




 The idea of monotheism is rather new

That isn't really a provable statement. Anthropologists are led to that assumption by the fact that there are early examples of possible idols, and the hypothesis is that monotheism arose from attempts to consolidate a myriad of Gods. The issue with the hypothesis however is that in Monotheistic, and Pantheistic, traditions, the top-God (or only God) isn't generally represented with idols. So anthropologists have really nothing to work with here as original monotheism vs original polytheism isn't exactly provable through artifacts. Looking just at the archeaological record though completely ignores the strange coincidence that the many polytheistic cultures seem to often have an overarching top-God. 




  I dont understand how something can be fine on one day and then a sin on the next day.

Before Christ (AS), eating unblessed meat was prohibited, after Christ it became allowed according to some Christians. Before Christ (AS), divorce was permitted while after him it became disallowed by some Christians. In the time of Adam (AS), incest was logically not prohibited - after Adam at some point, incest is prohibited. Before God commanded Abraham to kill his son, killing wasn't exactly something good. The law was abrogated and Abraham's act was not a sin by divine revelation (regardless that he didn't get to complete it). etc. Within Moses' on time - its really not plausible that the entirety of the tanakh *and* the entirety of the oral law came all at once either.

You can see laws revealed in time even then till Abraham. So you have effectively the same thing if you believe in the Old Testament, the Oral laws, or the different traditions of . The laws stipulated in different books didn't come all at once - as revelation progressed, laws were adapted besides the core and besides the essence of the theology (One God - existing outside of matter). If you believe, as Muslims, that God didn't only send prophets to Bani Israel, then there were laws in other parts of the world as well - and remnants of those likely exist in other religious/cultural traditions.

And even with the laws - there are differences of opinion since the beginning and different understandings between the early Jewish Sages till today. The concept of difference of opinion is more enshrined in Islam since the Prophet allowed people who were with him to have a varied understanding in a number of traditions, as well as Qur'anic reference to past Prophets.

So - in much the same way, Islam as it pertains to law wasn't revealed all at once. It's not easy for people to do a complete 100% about-face in their life. There was no Shari' law when the revelation first came down - and then ~500 legal verses came over time. People were directed to things according to the Prophetic methodology by order of importance (which still ultimately exists when Islam spreads today):

When the Prophet () sent Mu`adh to Yemen, he said to him, "You are going to a nation from the people of the Scripture, so let the first thing to which you will invite them, be the Tauhid of Allah. If they learn that, tell them that Allah has enjoined on them, five prayers to be offered in one day and one night. And if they pray, tell them that Allah has enjoined on them Zakat of their properties and it is to be taken from the rich among them and given to the poor. And if they agree to that, then take from them Zakat but avoid the best property of the people."

Ultimately though, laws and sins aren't the essence of the religion. The fundamental premise (tawhid - Oneness of God) is what matters more than anything. 




 If you check the narration you cited, you'll see this part:

'Abdullah then recited this verse: 'Those who believe do not make unlawful the good things which Allah has made lawful for you, and do not transgress. Allah does not like trangressers" (al-Qur'an, v. 87)

This is commentary of the Sahabi and not part of the matn of the actual prophetic saying. In a lot of ahadith, a companion might add elucidation as to his understanding, but the correct understanding is not necessarily what one particular companion, or one particular scholar understood regarding a verse. If you want a detailed explanation of an ayah, you'll need to check tafasir where the various opinions are mentioned as well as the opinion of the jama' (majority) or where a companion will change their understanding based on evidence.

Some companions, for instance, did not know that alcohol was prohibited. So they were drinking in Syria - but when the information arrived, they changed their opinion on it. 




 |What happened was **absolutely terrible**. That said, if r/Islam needs to condemn shit every times some dumb ass Muslim commits a crime, we won't have time to do much else.

|Though what happened at the churches was abhorrent, the two innocent (until proven guilty) Muslims lynched by the angry Christian mobs and then burnt also deserve our condolences and these mobs our condemnation in the same vein. Right after the apparent suicide bombings, these guys caught in the wrong place at the wrong time immediately had the mob's "justice" unleashed on them and the mob re-snatched from the police who tried to rescue them.

|The group that claimed responsibility for this event is Jamaat ul Ahrar. Jamaat ul Ahrar, not Taliban in Afghanistan, not Tehreek-e-Taliban in Pakistan. Jamaat ul Ahrar was a completely new organization led by Abdul Wali. Abdul Wali (or Omar Khorasani) was accused by Tehreek e Taliban and other such groups as being a proper wacko - and doing things they didn't accept (and since then, TTP has been catching the blame for his shenanigans regardless because of the nature of politics/media).

This includes the recent attack on the Pakistani school where several youth were murdered in cold blood - which happened conveniently *right after* TTP and Pak Govt finally got into peace talks. Those peace talks were some of the biggest breakthroughs in redressing the concerns of the tribes without bombing them into the ground, and creating more angry Pakistanis killing Pakistanis, that we've had in a long time. All ruined by a disavowed off-shoot group that conveniently shoots up a school and reignites the war.

It also includes violence he oversaw when he lead Ahrar ul Hind while breaking cease-fires. Same exact shit. Everybody is finally talking peace, and he conveniently goes back and prevents peace from ever being attainable.

And now - his group (Jamaat ul Ahrar) allegedly claimed responsibility for this horrific event *right after* conveniently rejoining TTP a few days ago! TTP and others likely didn't even know about it, and this small outfit will once again ignite the continued strife in that region as opposed the reconciliation talks that the vast majority of people on all sides want.

What's going on over there right now is a lot more complicated, and a lot less black and white then people think. So without minimizing the suffering of the dead, and the loss of their loved ones, just wanted to get some facts out there. 




 From what I got, the mob was Christian mob was pounding on two men, *then* the police tried to rescue them, *and then* the mob retook and eventually murdered the men, lynching them and burning them. 




 Unreliable source...

The guy may be nuts, but he won't be saying shit like this. This sort of shit would push away his base. 




 This was not TTP, it's the new supposed spin-off JA... 




 It's important that the government deals with this appropriately, and through legal channels. We can't be having any of this sort of shit:

The crowd also attacked two men it accused of involvement in the explosions, killing both of them. 

The mob lynchings and violence that will follow this will only exacerbate the situation. :( 




 Before getting your jimmies in a bunch, check the source. This is an important issue for public debate but let's get some real journalism here.
