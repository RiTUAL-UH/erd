 Another interesting part: Some scientists are upset that the risky expedition caused important resources (supply ships, crew, equipment) to be diverted from other research sites in Antarctica. http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/31/rescue-effort-for-trapped-antarctic-voyage-disrupts-serious-science/?_r=0 
























 Renewables now make up 15.9% of U.S. generation capacity, more than oil and nukes combined. 
































































































































































































































 Seems unbelievable, but the key is the size of the wind farms they modeled. The number of turbines ranged from 78,000 to 540,000. An array that large could slow the winds enough that they wouldn't immediately destroy the turbines themselves. 









































































































































































 Yes -- here's what a 2011 Nature study (linked in article) says: "Contrail cirrus are composed of ice crystals thatsimilarly to natural cirrusreflect solar short-wave radiation and trap outgoing long-wave radiation." Because they're so long-lived, the trapping effect outweighs the reflection effect. 









 NBC poll shows that most Americans--67%--support new EPA carbon emissions standards--will policymakers listen to their constituents as we head into the fall election? 




 Portland sets a great example of how to be a bike-friendly city! 




 The West's wildfires are increasing in size and the fire season is expanding along with the costs of fighting them. The most proactive way to fight fires is to fight climate change. 




 Not good news, especially for Pacific Northwest shellfish aquaculture, and a call for increased proactive coastal management that includes acidification. 




 Unlikely place to test agricultural pesticides, especially when so many of Kauai's species are listed as under the Endangered Species Act.  




 Hopeful news for a binding agreement in Paris. 




 The benefits of walkable cities extends beyond energy efficiency and economics to include community development, which contributes to higher GDP per capita in these cities.  




 Obama's proposal to protect 782,000 square miles not only helps Pacific bluefin tuna, but also becomes a sanctuary for marine species long into the future.

 The media's job is not ostensibly to present both sides of an issue. Doing so leads to "false balance," which has been especially apparent in scientifically settled issues such as anthropogenic climate change. See http://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/sciencetoolkit_04 and http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/may/23/john-oliver-best-climate-debate-ever 





























 Agreed -- very cool phenomenon. Here's a link to the video: http://e360.yale.edu/slideshow/blizzard_helps_scientists_visualize_airflow_around_wind_turbines/328/1/ 





































































 Sweden's efforts address a problem that all countries face. At least they are doing something head on to combat the issue of waste streams. Raising awareness about the fate of trash bring attention to the ultimate solution: not recycling, not burning trash for fuel, but rather reducing the amount of trash we produce in the first place.  














 Another troubling impact of climate change on wildlife. 



















 The $2.40 figure comes from an economic study published in the journal of Energy and Buildngs (linked here: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778813007652)
This dollar value was calculated by performing a 50-year life-cycle cost analysis of white roofs versus black roofs. Regardless of cost savings, this article points out that those who are concerned about climate change "should choose white roofs, which are three times more effective than green roofs at cooling the globe." 




 This is an interesting bit of science! It certainly highlights the importance of the field of ecotoxicology and should strengthen concerns over the fate of organic pollutants in the environment. 




 Ocean reserves are extremely important for protecting endangered species and allowing fish populations to recover from over-fishing. This is important work and the vitality of marine ecosystems should not be overlooked.  









 Many ecologists use birds as an indicator species for overall ecosystem health.  If our birds are in trouble, ecosystems likely are as well, and ecosystem approaches (like the wetland restoration programs the article mentions) may lead to more success stories down the road. 




 Historically tropical diseases like Dengue moving to higher latitudes should raise concerns about other epidemiological shifts climate change may bring. 




 Not good news.  As Jarraud went on to say in his statement, "the laws of physics are non-negotiable." 




 The example of solar panels over canals in India is an interesting innovationmaybe sunny, drought-prone regions can learn from it. 








































































































 Stunning photographs. Thanks for posting. 




 This is definitely an important issue. Benzene and other chemicals from these sites are known carcinogens. Undetected leaks occur too frequently, even at local gas stations. Having citizens team up with scientists to monitor local air and water quality makes it possible to sample a wider range of sites and detect problems.  





























 Yes, water usage is a major issue. This study did actually look at the GHG and energy impacts associated with irrigation and water usage. But, you're right, a smaller carbon footprint doesn't immediately put the water back in the ground...even though it may over time. 














 This is a fascinating depiction of both the resilience of nature in the face of adversity and the significant long-term, unintended, and unexpected consequences of the oil spill.  The uncertainty of the science coming from the oil spill makes it more difficult to accurately portray the magnitude of the impact.  First-hand accounts like these, which cite experts who live and work among the impacted ecosystems, are a valuable resource. 




 It's encouraging to see people from such a wide range of experiences and beliefs banding together to challenge climate change. 









 This is the latest in a series of warnings and calls to action by prominent officials and organizations over the last month.  The Pope's [encyclical](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/19/world/europe/pope-francis-in-sweeping-encyclical-calls-for-swift-action-on-climate-change.html?ref=liveblog _r=0) on the environment and an [EPA report](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/23/us/politics/effects-of-climate-change-could-cost-billions-epa-report-says.html?ref=topics) warning of the costs of global warming both came out over the last week.  The Surgeon General's warning is the latest in a series that impress the urgency of taking action to mitigate the effects of climate change. 




 If this correlation exists, it could serve as a significant economic and social incentive to improve air quality.  Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are long-lasting diseases that require significant investments of time, energy, and money by health care facilities, families, and friends.  Moreover, as the U.S. population ages, these diseases are becoming more common.  In 2015, Alzheimer's and other dementias will cost the nation [$226 billion](http://www.alz.org/facts/overview.asp).   




 The influence of infrastructure on human behavior is incredible.  Moreover, it's an important consideration in evaluating the long-term costs of any major infrastructure project.  While protected bike facilities may or may not be profitable at current usage rates, the resulting behavior change could decrease long-term costs by reducing wear and tear on roads and improving general health (through improved air quality and fitness and reduced accident fatalities). 




 These pesticides provided what was deemed a necessary service at the time of their invention.  Recent research on the potential health effects of pesticides like Roundup and 2,4-D is a good reminder that every product has costs and benefits--and that producers should be as aware as possible of both before marketing the good.  

This is a particularly salient reminder as the world seeks alternative energy sources to replace fossil fuels.  These technologies will have costs and benefits as well, and to make sure they are truly sustainable, their full life cycle must be considered. 




 It is amazing to see the breadth of impacts that climate change could have on the world.  Many of the worst harms will have implications for human health as ecosystems collapse, the incidence and severity of extreme weather events increases, and climatic patterns shift.

This panel follows the publication of the Pope's encyclical on the environment, another landmark report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change, and numerous recommendations and warnings from the US Environmental Protection Agency, all in the last year.  Momentum is building. 









 It is amazing to see such a large and influential fund divest from fossil fuels.  A [study by Oxford University](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/08/campaign-against-fossil-fuel-growing) found that while divestment may not have a significant direct financial impact on companies, the resulting social and political stigma can have significant effects.  It will be interesting to see if divestment is able to have an effect on the fossil fuel industry. 




 Environmental concerns have historically been addressed first through governmental regulation.  It will be interesting to see how corporate action, such as IKEA's investments or the six oil and gas companies' calls for a carbon price, effects government policy. 




 If airplanes produce 8 percent of the U.S. transportation sector's greenhouse gas emissions, then they produce over 2 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions.  Improved airline efficiency could have a measurable impact on total greenhouse gas emissions.   




 It will be interesting to see if the climate measures enacted by BP and Shell will have any significant effect on company behavior.  If so, to what extent will changes in supply-side behavior effect greenhouse gas emission levels?  This article states that "Chevron, Exxon, and BP are among the 90 companies that have contributed two-thirds of the greenhouse gas emissions that have caused the climate change of the 21st century." 




 Laws like the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act in the U.S. could provide a practical model to minimize supermarket liability.  The bill protects those donating to non-profit organizations from civil and criminal liability should the product later cause harm to the recipient (assuming good faith).   




 It would be interesting to know what type of solar panels Ameresco is installing.  Recent improvements in technology have resulted in lower cost and higher efficiency panels than those made of silicon. 




 While no specific weather event can be tied directly to climate change, severe weather events are increasing in frequency and magnitude.  In the Northeast, recent winters have been unusually cold and snowy compared to historic averages.  Tying these changes to rapid Arctic ice loss is interesting.
