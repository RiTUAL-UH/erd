 looks like a fun time, i'm in. 




 dat stare 




 i've peed in several places that i'm not allowed to poop.   




 he made a baby man child in computer class?  bravo sir, bravo.  




 why are you wearing my wings on your feet, good sir? 




 just not french canadian, eh!  they talk funny.  like they have peanut butter stuck to the roof of their mouths. 




 Romanianden* 




 i believe you mean Ramen. 




 i also love holding doors for strangers.  the true test is holding a door for someone who is about 20 feet away.  if they pick up their pace they are truly grateful.  either way, a simple gesture can make someones day.  




 is that the stuffed dog from problem child? 




 where do you live?  having lived in south florida (ft laud/miami) for the last 5 years, i must say they have some of the worst drivers in the country.  it's basically canadian tourists vs cuban immigrants on I-95.  don't use your blinker, they scare people. 




 say please and thank you. 




 i recently relocated from fort lauderdale to KC along with my g/f who is a miami native.  she says it's all about layers and a good jacket.  also, as long as your head and feet are warm, you're in good shape!   




 her favorite beatle is a vw 









 i think it's just because you're old. 
























 it appears you received some great info already.

i moved to KC from WI in 2004.  in 2008 i moved to FL for a new job.  i just moved back to KC in july of 2013 because i couldn't stand FL!   i'm so happy to be back in the midwest!

here are a few things i noticed having lived in both states (i lived in boca raton/fort lauderdale area):

1)  the people here are ridiculously nice.  if you make eye contact in public chances are the person will smile or say hi.  
in florida i felt that if i made eye contact with a stranger that they would want to fight or run the other way.  the fake people in So.FL are the worst.  everyone is trying to one up each other.  

2)  traffic.  anyone that has only lived in the greater KC area and complains about KC traffic, you haven't been to FL.  i don't miss the snowbirds or the tourists lost while looking for disney.

3)  cost of living.  when living in FL you're paying tourist prices.  i don't miss waiting for a table anytime i wanted to go out to eat.  

4)  parks.  KC has some amazing parks.  what i experienced in florida was that it was so crowded that parks didn't really exist.  builders in florida would rather put a few high rises and make more money.

5)  the weather.  while people in FL are probably asking how you could leave FL for KS, the weather is very fair here.  people will tell you, if you don't like the weather in KC, just wait a day, it will change.  while living in FL i really started to miss the midwest seasons.  

 




 i ask out of curiosity, why don't you want to pay your own electricity?  i'm sure they take an average of all apartments and sneak that into the rent cost.   




 make sure to stain the carpet on move out day to ensure replacement. 









 i moved from kansas city where i loved living to south florida for a job.  inside i knew the move would be temporary.  after 5 years of living in south florida (ft lauderdale area), i couldn't take it any longer.  home of sunny beaches and shady people.  i approached my boss and CEO and asked to move back to KC and work from home.  they agreed.  i purchased my first home (29 yrs old now) in july and am happier than ever.  i have a great job doing what i want to do and get to work from home.  i would have never gotten this opportunity had i not taken the risk in the first place. 




 i've scratched my forehead many a times trying this maneuver.   




 apparently it's cold in AK. 




 bedazzle wiener 




 needs more bubble blowing and Canadian accent, eh.  




 the San Francisco treat! 




 Clay/Jax = family.  Nero/Jax = 'family'.  regardless, i can't wait for next week. 




 sorry, hypothetically speaking.... 




 how would jax react if he found out nero was responsible for the killing of one of the sons old ladies? 




 he drives it in the snow as well, i believe. 




 lots of random ass grabs and nut taps. 




 if you want a clean kitchen eat at home! 
























 i keep clicking play and the picture keeps moving.

 correct intersection and pool location, young spy. 




 don't judge - it was a long day.

 i think using examples of how to act as a human is more effective than using examples of how not to.  but i get your point.

 Anton's steakbooger is damn tasty. 









 i heard antons has a great booger.  a really great one. 




 eye eye eye 




 mop my palms 




 ah, never thought of exploring the bottoms on my mountain bike!  lots of cool steps and drops i'm sure. 





























 This man had a beard.  Does your grandpa also wear a hat that says 'If you're not wasted, the day is'? If so, I have his business card ;) 




 Man, life is too short to get bend out of shape over funny old people. Even my (awesome and hilarious) girlfriend thought it was funny.  

 




 Ahh, this guy!  I like this guy.   Solid reply. 




 well, when you have no teeth......
 




 i should have been more clear - he was a patron not a worker.  he's always there - that's how you contact him.  oh, and he writes a check every time.   









 having spent 5 years in southeast Florida, i was always happy to see a Packers fan.  down there it's Jets, Giants, Patriots, Eagles.  

i remember being at a bar when the giants beat GB a few years back in the playoffs.  i was one of 10 packers fans in a bar with 400+ giants fans.  we stuck together. 




 18 @ swope disc golf + 18 @ swope footgolf = a damn fine day

 SCRATCH N SNIFF MONITOR, i need you. 




 home repairs. 

not only do you save money but you never have to worry about someone screwing you over.  there's so many youtube videos on how to fix toilets, add thermostats, install garbage disposal etc.  it's not as hard as you think.  (TWSS) 




 happy to help a fellow cheeseheader if i can. 









 I would seriously considering ordering one off of DrWobstarCwaw. 




 shoulda bought a weber 




 my roommate did this several times.

other times he would rip open a bag of salad, pour it on the counter, pour ranch onto said salad/counter and eat with his hands.   




 I've been happy with Kim Miley in the past.  No pressure to come back or get on said 'recommended schedule'.  They have a great masseuse as well.

 hit Dynamic Discs right around the corner from Oklahoma Joe's.  http://www.dynamicdiscs.com/kansas-city-disc-golf/ 




 Agreed 100%.
 









 my concern with the pizza was that the giardiniera would make it really soggy.  was it? 




 it's about one block north of 103rd and pflumm on the west side.  right next to where grinders south is being built.  their beef is uh uh good.  i was in there a few weeks ago and the chef told us he's now making an italian beef pizza! 




 $8000 on dirt?!  that's a lot of dirt.   




 I knew it was only a matter of time.
The internet is a small small place.  




 Apparently they make an exception for him.  He must not be as big of a cunt as some of you turds think. 





























 i just picked up a Gstar TL3.  needs some beating before it flies understable like TL. 




 I have one of these shirts having grown up in FDL. 









 I purchased the Weber Genesis in Green of Amazon a couple months ago.  It was delivered for free to my backyard (I helped the driver).  Assembling the unit proved to be simple - this isn't an Ikea grill.

I've been grilling constantly since I purchased it and am extremely happy with it.

Just rip the bandaid and do it! 




 The miracle of life is so amazing - even when it's what seems like an insurmountable challenge.  You and your wife are great parents. 









 You have to soak the corn for at least 90 minutes in ice water.  Toss it on indirect high heat (400-425 F) for 30 minutes turning every 5 minutes.  

I've done the method twice now and the results are insanely awesome.  The husks pull right off.  Butter. Season.  Devour.   




 parboil the carrots for 8-10 minutes, toss in olive oil, salt, pepper, raw sugar, grill for 10 minutes on high direct heat.  like candy! 









 huge fan of going way NW and walking the beach at La Push. 




 recipe!?  




 DOE! 














 get a steak at anton's. 
























 Have you played in Shelton? It would be a long ride but I promise it's worth it!

 Here in Kansas City, Dynamic Discs handles the lost discs.  I've gotten two calls from them where someone turned in my lost disc and they'll hold it for 60 days.  After 60 days it goes on the used discs for sale rack.  It's a great way to get customers into your shop. 









 i love how the videos progressively improve once these guys stop shitting themselves  



















 Russell Gulch.  It's about 20 minutes north of Idaho Springs in the mountains.

 here's a pic of our camp.  we moved the tents into the trees during hours of operation and had the course to ourselves after 7pm each night.

http://imgur.com/W1EHinM 









 two friends and i camped here last year august for two nights.  they allow one group of campers per night.  it was a blast.   




 I've only played the course twice and was at least 60 feet short both times.  I did manage a 3. 









 kind of hard to share the road with drivers when you're riding the wrong way. 





























 about 600 feet to the end? 




 for those that aren't close do know they allow one set of campers to camp on site each night.  i think we paid $20 a person for two nights of camping and unlimited rounds.  we used their location as the hub for winter park and other activities. 




 Q39.   




 my friends and i play down under at least once a week and only bring a buzzz.  it's a lot of fun. 




 if you had landed on the fairway it would have stuck out more also. 




 conditions?  flat? no wind?  




 learn to throw it and then do yourself a favorite and get a TL. 




 agreed.  definitely grind it finer.

 How are the courses in the Chicago area? 




 That was not the type of history I wanted to see unfold.   




 In the KC area?  Swope Park.  Blue Valley.  Rosedale.   




 i took the water works photo sunday.  history won't begin to unfold until 7pm today.

here's a pic i took at game 4

 that's disappointing to hear.  the fairways are usually manicured quite nicely.  if you do throw off the fairway i could understand the complaint of overgrowth etc.  come back and play! 




 agreed.  i took this about 50 feet past the tee pad.   
























 Her poor husband. 




 did someone say buttdart? 




 throw that all day long!  it will make for good conversation - better than on the wall IMO. 




 What kind?  I need some wizards.  More details please.

 I should have been more specific on 'drive'.  It was a fairway drive not from the teebox.  He was still only 5-10 feet away. 




 perfection.

 We were at Waterworks in KC.  I heard what sounded like another friend hit a tree and when I looked my other friend was laying on the ground wondering wtf just happened.  The guy throwing had a very late release.  Lots of laughs that day. 




 I wish it didn't float and would simply sink to the bottle so I don't have to throw it anymore.  So understable. 





























 What are you - some kind is gypsy?!  You're absolutely correct.  









 Plenty of options in Kansas City.  I would recommend Water Works.  It's pretty close to I-35.

 As someone who plays Cliff on a semi regular basis, thank you!!  People treat that park like it is their own private dump.  Well done sir.   




 looks fake. 




 Name of company?  You might be my customer. 




 Simply perfection.  So many smiles. 




 Hen House had them on sale for $5 each 









 From KC - played Longview today for the first time - loved it.  How does this place and Crestview compare?

 Pizzaman in Lenexa off Pflumm and 103rd.  Chicago family owned - thin crust.  They have a killer Italian Beef pizza - just do it.
