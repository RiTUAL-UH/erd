 Django Unchained
Hobbit 2 
Interstellar 
Wolf of Wall Street
Avengers 2
Dark Knight
Dark Knight Rises
Inception 

those are the ones i can think of 




 The least best film of the series. I didn't think it was terribly awful but not particularly good 
They should have ended at Shrek 2  




 Doc Brown and Django in A Million Ways to Die in the West. (wouldn't say they're my favorite but recent good ones) 
 









 E.T, Jaws, Gremlins (?), Lion King, Forrest Gump (sort of)

just never got around to seeing them :/

 




 Hobbit 1 (64%) and Hobbit 3 (61%) - i like them a lot and think they're hated on too much IMO. 

same with Quantum of Solace (65%)  




 Space Jam 




 oh right, thanks a lot!  




 I'm trying to play all heists in order to get the $1mill bonus so i can buy a hydra. i started playing them and then my WIFI was disconnected for 8 weeks and now im finally carrying on with them. Due to the length of time i havent played, will this affect my chances of getting the bonus? Probably an obvious answer but i need to know. 
























 Stand By Me? 




 that Spielberg though 




 WOW - thats awful 




 i gotta say "Hit by Lightning" 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2402619/   - heres the poster  




 Ratatouille  




 Ferris Bueller's Day Off ("Pardon my French, but your an asshole") 




 this poster isn't new, this debuted with the super bowl spot 




 Harry Potter improved over time (not that it was ever bad)

Shrek decreased (1+2 awesome, 3 poor, 4 bad)   IMO 




 Four guys from the suburbs hit the road, and the road hit back 




 Star Wars: The Force Awakens - Teaser 2 

is one of them 




 Chappie 





























 I bought a Savage and although I love the guns and firepower, it's very defenseless and it leaves me vulnerable flying around in free mode. This got me thinking that R* need to put on the ability to sell Pegasus vehicles, so if you buy the Savage and are dissatisfied you can just sell it. 

not sure what question i wanna ask but comment your thoughts/ideas/suggestions on this topic.   




 church in pacific bluffs 




 the explosion is shit, but the spear is hilarious!  




 i just bought one and i think..

extremely OP, but awesome at the same time
it looks cool (as in the design and colors)

weak amour and defense (1 rocket and it's done)

what are your thoughts? 




 Edge of Tomorrow
 














 Mine..

1. Kingsman: The Secret Service 
2. Mad Max: Fury Road
3. Avengers: Age of Ultron
4. Furious 7
5. Run All Night

fire away! 




 my favorite movie of 2015 so far 




 Godzilla and Pacific Rim 




 either Thor: The Dark World or First Avenger

so many people hate on these 2 and I really enjoyed them. (even though Malekith was a pretty weak villain) 




 The Inbetweeners movies  


































 Captain America Winter Soldier made me appreciate First Avenger more the 2nd time watching it 




 I was looking at the current list and both "Furious 7" and "Avengers: Age of Ultron" are both in it (and still climbing). 
I'm seriously rooting for The Force Awakens to get into the top 10. 
Do you reckon it will? + i'd love Spectre to get there too but im not sure that it will.  




 Skyfall is the best Bond film ever, Casino Royale is awesome but Skyfall is just plainly better IMO 




 I thought she was good in Tomorrowland and just thought she's make a good Oracle. I can imagine her in the glasses and wheelchair, but i know that comic readers will have a different opinion to me. 
what do you guys think of the idea? 




 that was fucking awful 




 for me 

Paul Blart 2
Big Game
Wild Card 
Taken 3
 etc. 
 




 between 60-80%  




 Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and The World's End

there is no best IMO  




 Chronicle  




 Home Alone 4 
























 Jason Statham made this movie 




 My thoughts

Jurassic Park - amazing 
The Lost World - average
Jurassic Park 3 - bad

what are your thoughts on the trilogy?? Are you excited for Jurassic World? 














 awesome 




 Toy Story trilogy, Monsters Inc and Finding Nemo

p.s. i've never seen the Incredibles (yep.) 




 im actually really looking forward to it!  




 the 1 movie i always forget is coming out this year.  




 so many haters. i like the look of this!  




 I just randomly wondered who Clarke could play in the DCCU and i think he would be awesome as Dent/Two-Face (if he ever became Two face) what do you guys think?
who should Clarke play if he came to the DCCU? 












































 lucius fox is in the game 














 seriously what's the point in adding the solid gold jet? Why pay $10,000,000 for a jet when you can go and steal one from the airport and fly it around for FREE? 
Rockstar should only add NEW things and not rehashed exsisting stuff. 

That being said what stuff should be added in your opinion?  




 looks awesome! 



















 Everyone always asks who should play Bond next (I think Henry Cavill) but not too many people ask who the next villain should be. So that's what I'm asking.

I'm thinking Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor (he was rumored for Bond 24) and Idris Elba would be good ones. (Yes i would prefer Elba as a villain rather than Bond himself). 

Who are you guys thinking of? 





























 typical reddit user. wrong again. seen many, many movies, and i like these ones.  




 agreed 




 I partially agree they're not perfect films but i dont take them small criticisms and use them to say they're terrible like everyone else. I THINK they're very good films.  




 not fact 




 no, your wrong, completely wrong 




 The Hurt Locker  




 thanks! 




 I read that they did but no on the Newswire. 
Is it officially coming to PS4? I'd love it if it did.  




 i need someone to give me $$$$s 




 just because a movie you dont like has a high % on RT doesnt mean RT should go. get a grip pls, thanks.  




 I like The Hobbit, Quantum of Solace, Man of Steel, Indiana Jones 4 (what I remember of it) - Dark knight Rises is one of my all time favorites. 

Hipster reddit pricks, Hate me all you want - I like these films.  




 I'd do a Toy Story and Monsters Inc crossover. It's the only one i could think of that wouldn't need any convenient plot points to get the characters together. Say Mike or Sulley goes into Bonnie's bedroom one night, the toys wake and "the adventure begins" so to speak. what would you do? (no hate) 
























 clearly they do 




 yes she was, i've just read it now - lol 




 Title pretty much says it all really. 

Plus Harley Quinn was going to be in it as The Joker's daughter attempting to kill Batman for revenge of the Joker's death. 

I know lots of you guys may already know this but i read it today and found it funny. Thoughts? 
























 Flying around listening to random thugs talking on the street and one of they says (paraphrasing) "All we need now is that freak from Metropolis to fly in". Found it pretty awesome!  




 i meant the JGL rising ending 




 The Dark Knight Rises is one of them for me 




 correction - Owen Grady meeting the Avengers 




 1007% agreed  





























 haha 




 "I CREATE LIFE!....and then destroy it"  




 i loved Cars! 









 I for one think i'm not alone in saying that if the whole John Connor thing was kept under wraps until the movie, my jaw would've dropped at the reveal. It might have even brought the film up a peg or 2 (i didnt mind the movie anyway im just saying) - thoughts? (no hate) 




 Chappie for me too, i was like "was that ok or bad?"  




 I'd actually wouldn't mind a sequel to Origins. I think since there's 5 years between Origins and Asylum there's plenty of backstories and origins to explore in a Origins 2. Which ones would you like to see?

I'd love to see Dick Grayson become Robin and have him (possibly) as a recurring playable side character and allow dual play to return from Knight but it would be a main gameplay feature. I think that would be potentially awesome! 

What would you want to see? (no hate please - keep it friendly)  




 1. it was raining outside
2. get better comments :) 









 Deathly Hallows Part 2 - an emotional, well-made and EPIC conclusion to the series. One of my all time favorite movies! 




 I loved playing as Red Hood in the DLC for Arkham Knight. He was bad-ass and also killed people! If there was to be a whole game with him as the playable protagonist, i'd be down! Anyone else? 
























 What I mean is a prequel focusing on Shrek's life before Shrek 1 and a prequel on Donkey's life before Shrek 1 etc. If Puss in Boots was successful, then these could do just as well in my opinion. I especially would pay to see a Donkey movie!  









 u are not wrong 














 anyone hear the Spider-Man reference? 




 this is perfect casting!!  




 I had no "hopes" for this film. I just saw it was critically praised and me and my friend watched it for something fun to do (+ i wanted to see what all the fuss was about). And imo it was disappointing. 

and sorry "they're supposed to be dumb" thats just idiotic to me.  




 wow. typical redditor. this isn't a plea for attention at all, i just didn't like the film. sick of assholes like yourself assuming that just cus im against popular opinion that im automatically wrong. no. i didnt like it. end of story. no plea.  




 glad im not alone 




 completely agree about the soundtrack! 




 1. I thought the soundtrack was cool but very misused. WHY they played it during the silent driving scenes where there's no tension or fear building up i will never know.
2. The main girl was such a dumb character. On the beach, she should have been constantly looking around for "it" rather than just look out to sea, then she gets hit by it. So dumb!
3. There was no tension.
4. It wasnt scary. 
5. The ending was dogshit. 

anyway, thats just my opinion. (let the hate begin) 




 agreed 














 fake 









 as insignificant as it is, i loved that they kept in the guy saying "fuck you asshole!" i thought they were going to remove it cus of the pg-13 rating but no. when he said it it made me smile :) 




 Im in the UK also

Tomorrowland was called "Tomorrowland: A World Beyond"
The Adventures of Tintin was given the subtitle "The Secret of the Unicorn"
Neighbors was called "Bad Neighbours"

thats all i can think of but i know theres more
