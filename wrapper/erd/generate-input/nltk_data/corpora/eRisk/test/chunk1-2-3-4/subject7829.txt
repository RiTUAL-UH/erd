 I don't see why approaching mental states as legitimate subjects of inquiry should entail that they are irreducible. 

I would distinguish between mental and inner states. A "mental state" could just be a stage of a process, like a machine state. An "inner state" to me presupposes some sort of qualitative barrier between process and perception.

My whole point in this discussion is basically I don't know how qualia could ever be considered "states" in the "machine state" or "process state" mould, therefore we can't talk about qualia without presupposing a different kind of "state" that is not a stage of a process.

In other words, I am arguing that reductionism rules out qualia and consciousness as legitimate concepts. That doesn't mean I consider reductionism *wrong* (I am up in the air about that), merely that I think those are the inevitable consequences of accepting it.

we already know a lot more than we did 20 years ago about how the brain handles vision, conscious awareness, religious experiences...

I'd agree with the first and last of those, but not the middle one. Explaining the neural correlates of consciousness is not explaining consciousness, unless doing so can "explain away" consciousness as a meaningful idea, a la Dennet's attempt.

I think that consciousness, as well as qualia, must either be null or radically other. I don't see the middle ground like you seem to.

The idea that maybe they [animals] are just automata that happen to behave in a certain way while experiencing nothing is a remote skeptical possibility akin to "what if we're really brains in a vat?" or "what if other humans are really unconscious zombies?"

It's not remote since many believe that we humans are such automata as well. We can at least say that humans have the *concept* of qualia, even if it turns out not to refer to anything. We can't communicate this concept to animals so we have no way of telling what qualitative experience they may or may not have.

On the ethical side, though, I agree with you: In the absence of strong evidence otherwise it is ethical to assume that humans and animals both experience qualia.

Since our qualia seem to be in continual flux, that suggests to me that it must be a process (or more likely, a set of processes).

I think you're confusing change in stimuli with mental processes. They're two different things. I'm saying - how does qualia fluctuate *if the stimuli remains the same*? A point stimuli or a constant stimuli can kick off a whole cascade of processes but it only seems to generate one immediate, constant quale. Red only becomes "less red" when the rods in my eyes saturate (a physical process). The fact that the quale goes away when I look at something else is not the issue.

then some subset of those feedback connections would be projecting into the visual cortex and incorporating that information into the stream of consciousness. 

The problem is, it doesn't appear as a "stream" or a "process," but as a pointlike experience. Obviously a process assembles that experience before it is "presented" to the awareness, but what is it that can apprehend the entire process instantaneously?

Again, it's not enough to say "well, it really doesn't happen instantaneously, we've proven in the lab that there's a lag of 40 milliseconds" or whatever. Why does it *appear* instantaneous? Where does this sense come from? 

Why a major problem [with Blindsight]? To me it just suggests that it's possible to have a visual experience (however degraded) that one is not consciously aware of. 

Because it argues against the *role* consciousness has been assigned in current reductionist theories, which is as *the name we give to the processing of stimuli via mental states.* Here is a complex mental state in response to a stimuli, with *no conscious component*. That's a huge problem in my book.

Reductionists could fall back on the older view of consciousness as a pure epiphenomenon, an "impotent narrator," but that view has been out of fashion for some time and for good reason.

maybe there is crosstalk in the circuits which, while relatively data-poor, allows patients to perform slightly above chance (which is all they find in performance tests).

[This article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7794783.stm) seems to suggest something a good deal more shocking than "performing slightly above chance." Key quote:

"A video recording shows him completing the obstacle course set up by the scientists "flawlessly", without the aid of his cane or another person."

Also he can respond to facial expressions which is one of the most complex tasks of the brain and I doubt it can be explained by weak cross-talk.

You might be interested in the work of Colin McGinn on this subject.

I can only wonder if these pessimists have ever actually opened a neuroscience textbook, because the way they talk, you'd expect neuroscience books to be 2 pages long!

A lot of them are Philosophers of the Mind, so I *hope* they have read neuroscience, though you never know. Anyway the pessimists aren't so much saying "we can never figure out the brain" in the heuristic sense of figuring out what region processes what, as they are saying that the "deep truths" we want to find by studying the brain, such as "is reductionism true?" simply aren't accessible, and perhaps aren't even intelligible concepts.

Note this is different from saying "consciousness isn't an intelligible concept," it is a level of abstraction removed. The pessimists are saying "asking whether or not consciousness is an intelligible concept is not an answerable question."

Going back to McGinn again he is also sympathetic to this idea though I think at heart he's a non-reductionist though he doesn't declare openly for that.

I'm not one of these pessimists myself but the way that very smart people (a lot more educated than I am) continually seem to talk past and misunderstand each other on this subject makes me queasy that they may be right.

 Thanks. Oh, and I forgot to add:

4.) The hope that close attention to the details will allow for a better foundation upon which attacks on the "big problems" can resume in the future. This view holds that the previous attacks failed because of shaky foundations. Bad definitions, muddled logic, etc. 




 I have no idea what you're talking about but there's a number of works on the intersection between mathematics and philosophy.

One category is the philosophical basis of mathematics (Godel's theorem, Cantor, etc.)

But I think what you're interested in is the converse: A possible mathematical basis for philosophy. On that topic Badiou has been recently popular. 




 1.) over-specialization, a desire to "professionalize" philosophy so that it resembles other university disciplines.

2.) lack of progress on the "hard" questions leading to frustration, giving up, lack of funding.

3.) the view that there are no "hard" questions, just illusions of language. 




 The tendency to over-define vague terms and then follow those definitions to their logical conclusions gets philosophers into muddles.

True, and that might be the problem with qualia. 

I fear we're constructing a pantheon of very slippery inner states, and then postulating new mental states to cover up for the holes in our initial description. In this practice, we quickly reach a point where our main limiting factor is our imagination.

That's my fear also.

My worry is not that there aren't any such inner states to describe, but that our description is theory-rich and data-poor, and therefore we may be misdescribing them rather badly.

I hope so, and I hope more data might shed some light on these questions. However, as of now I can't see a way out of the trap. Accepting "inner states" to any degree seems to entail accepting the whole ridiculous pantheon of irreducible and incommensurable qualia. Rejecting "inner states" means discounting phenomenological observation altogether, which seems almost as ridiculous.

Can't we be pretty sure that animals experience pain? They behave like they're in pain, they have neural wiring similar to that which processes pain in humans, similar stimuli seem to cause pain in animals. 

I'm not as confident. We don't know where in the brain qualia are produced, if they even exist (and if they are even produced by the brain, if they exist.) They may be produced only in the prefrontal cortex, which animals don't possess to the same degree. Animals may simply process the stimuli of pain without any accompanying qualia. It's impossible to know, but I also think it's immoral to assume that they don't and that it's ok to hurt animals.

(btw, the fact that almost all moral systems are implicitly based on the existence of qualia is what makes a lot of people so leery about qualophobes, regardless of the evidence.)

This isn't obvious to me. Actually since qualia fluctuate over time, it seems to me that they are almost certainly processes.

How do qualia fluctuate in your view? Do you mean only if the stimuli changes? We would agree there. But not if the stimuli remains the same. They seem to be point-like experiences to me. Sure, a color will fade if you look at it too long because the rods in your eyes get saturated, but that's a different issue.

A desktop computer is a serial processor and will process these in sequence... whereas our brain's architecture is massively parallel, allowing it to perform many computations simultaneously. 

Actually, modern computers are massively parallel as well. I'm not denying that the brain processes imagery in parallel. Obviously it does. What bothers me is that these parallel processes then seem to produce outputs that are presented to our awareness as a unity.

Blindsight shows that visual stimuli response can function independently of any visual experience. This is a major problem for reductionists.

I have a feeling you're going to tell me this doesn't help, but I'm not sure why.

I'm concerned with how we experience a process as a unity, a point-like experience. That's where I see a weakness in the reductionist argument. 

If the non-reductionists can somehow tame the zoo of qualia, I might "go over" to their side. I'm not there yet though. I'm more thinking a third approach might be needed, but I have no idea what that could be. 

I'm also more sympathetic now than I used to be to the epistemological pessimists who think the mind can no more think about itself than a hammer can hammer itself, that our minds are designed to be "turned outwards towards the world" and that too much introspection on mental states inevitably leads to logical knots, simply because we're not designed to process that sort of information.
 




 I'm not too familiar with this position. Is this Dennett's view?

More or less. Though he's too canny to ever say so in such simple terms, in my reading he thinks both qualia and consciousness are "null pointers" - words that don't really refer to anything meaningful. For a while I thought he had the true picture - right down the the competing networks of Darwinian neurons fighting for dopamine - but now I'm not so sure.

higher vs. lower functions...

I would take a Heideggerian approach to this question. Anything "ready to hand" that we can use in a transparent fashion without  rational thinking is a lower function, even if it was set by practicing it as a higher function (for example that choke hold, which had to be puzzled out and learned before it became automatic) Anything "unready to hand" that requires us to activate our reasoning skills is a higher function. 

I'm not sure if I agree with the entailment from propositional attitudes to qualia or not. If I say "I believe that 2+2=4" how would we characterize the corresponding quale?

*Believing* it, as opposed to merely using the fact in a process, would entail the quale of the emotion of belief, the feeling we get when we look at something we know to be true. 2 + 2 = 5 is not just a false statement, it triggers a different quale when we see it (in the qualophile's view.)

we want to know why all this processing is accompanied by "inner feels." Maybe 'qualia' is not the best concept with which to get a handle on the problem, but turning a blind eye to it doesn't seem like a solution.

Exactly.  I agree. However, the reason *why* I agree has to do with the simultaneity of visual perception, which I will try to explain below.

I think a strong case can be made for the existence of qualia in non-linguistic animals (think animal pain, blue dot on the forehead test, food preferences, etc.)

I'm not sure. If you believe in qualia, you believe there's a difference between "seeing blue" the way a computer can (or seeing a face the way Cottrel's network can), and really *seeing blue* (seeing the quale not processing the wavelength.) Since we can't communicate like this with animals, we can't know for certain either way.

Damn. Sorry man, I'm just not understanding why this is a problem.

Ok, I'll be glad to try again. Thanks for sticking with this discussion! 

Reductionist theories of mind run into a problem when they encounter mental phenomena that *don't seem to be processes*. Thought is a process. Emotion, Demasio and others have argued with merit, is a process. Qualia are obviously not processes but the very concept of qualia is shaky. 

But what about visual perception? Phenomenologically, it doesn't seem (and seeming is what's important here, since we're talking about inner states) that I see first the cat, then the lamp, and process these two concepts like a computer program would that could recognize multiple objects in a picture (these do exist.)

Rather, I seem to apprehend both of them *at the same time*. Visual perception appears not to be a process but rather a *pointlike experience* that is nevertheless very rich in data.

It is the nature of visual perception, at once pointlike in time and vast in the amount of stimuli that is perceived, that seems very un-process-like.

If we accept that it is not a process, we should also be more open to the idea that other non-processed mental states like qualia also might exist (where there's one monkey, there's more...). 

I'm starting to suspect that qualia might indeed exist, and only be *mediated* by language, which can open or foreclose access to them depending on the grammar, and not created as an illusion of language, and the reason there's no sharp cutoff between "redness" and "orangeness" is because there's just one color qualia that exists as a continuum.

But this opens a huge can of worms. Qualia must either be null or *radically* Other, beyond all category of thought or understanding. Even a thoroughgoing dualism in the traditional sense seems to leave no room for qualia. You would need an unbounded pluralism of incommensurable experiences, each its own separate ineffable Universe and yet somehow united within our minds. That sounds like the sort of conceptual disaster that usually results from having started from wrong premises.

So I'm still torn on the qualia issue.

Is there a wiki page on this?

I couldn't find anything more specific than stuff on qualia and the Hard Problem. There are some technical articles that talk about the problems of simultaneity and I remember reading about this issue in Penrose and Chalmers (who proposed quantum and dualistic solutions, respectively.) 




 making the most serious attempts to give a legitimate explanation of qualia (as opposed to the defeatists who seem to suggest that qualia are magical and inexplicable).

Or those who think they're just a trick of language?

"Language of thought" folks believe that this is essentially language-like whereas eliminativists of the Churchland variety think that the brain's basic cognitive processes are rather non-language-like

I think both views are simplistic. Our "higher" cognitive functions are obviously language-like in processing, at least in my view, whereas "instinct"-type reactions are not. Habits fall in between the two - that's why they can be so hard to break.

As far as I can tell the questions are entirely independent. 

Why I think the two issues are fundamentally the same is that, as far as I understand the concept, a propositional attitude must have an intentional object. It is hard to see how such an object can be anything other than a quale. 

If there truly are propositional attitudes such as "I would like to have a beer," rather than simple processes that report such sentences as part of their functioning, then the quale for the taste of beer is implied.

I know the eliminationists don't believe in these attitudes, and I thought they didn't believe in quales either, but you say they are merely "reductionist" in relation to quales. I don't quite see the difference because according to the classic definition at least, quales are irreducible. A reduced quale is a non-existent one.

Skeptical in what sense? Skeptical that the term 'qualia' refers to anything at all? 

Yes. For a while I was in the "it's all just a trick of language" school and I still think those arguments have a lot of merit. For example, if there is a quale that embodies "redness," when we see a color shift for example in a computer graphics display, we should notice a sharp cutoff where "redness" changes to "orangeness," but we don't. 

Also, people who speak languages that don't distinguish between "blue" and "green," Japanese for example, have been shown to be able to see less shades in that color range than English-speakers. All this points to quales somehow arising from language and not being fundamental.

Where I've started to doubt that view, however, is in the appearance of the simultaneity of visual perception. Looking at the room right now, I see a lamp, and a cat, *apparently at the same time*, and as distinct objects, not a blob combining the qualities of both (a furry, purring lamp for example.) 

How is this possible? If the mind is a mere process, how does this perception arise? There should only be reaction to visual stimuli, as with the Blindsight phenomenon, but nothing else. Yet something else appears that, unlike color quales, it is quite difficult to explain as a trick of language.

Before you chalk me up as a disciple of the Time Cube guy, the two dimensions of time and String Theory stuff was partly tongue-in-cheek, but this problem seems so vexing I wonder if this or a similarly bizarre explanation will eventually be needed.

What I was referring to is that in String Theory there are "extra" dimensions that are not linear, but rather curled around the three dimensions we know and love. Much like a tightrope walker will perceive a tightrope as one dimension, but an ant will see two (the ant can go forward and backward as well as around the "curled up" dimension that composes the rope itself.), in String Theory at a small scale our Universe has 10 or 11 spatial dimensions, not 3.

What I was proposing was that perhaps time also has a String Theory-like "curled up" dimension and that's how visual perception can be a process yet still somehow seem presented as a unity to the mind.

And of course Roger Penrose is a physicist who became interested in the philosophy of the mind and concluded that quantum physics must somehow be involved, launching an entire industry of bad New Age books misinterpreting his ideas. 




 Thanks for the detailed reply. You're lucky you got to work with some of the most eminent modern philosophers - whether I agree with them or not, that's quite an experience and one I wish I could have had.

So obviously your experience with them is very extensive and I'll take your word for it on what their true views are. However, I am puzzled by a couple of things you said:

believe that neuroscience science will explain qualia.

That is the qualophobic position, if I am correct. "phobic" is just an unfortunate appelation that this position got stuck with. It doesn't literally mean they are *afraid* to address the issue qualia, just that they think qualia can be reduced to neurology without either a dualistic or an emergent order.

they all agree that there is something wrong with folk psychology but they can disagree radically as to what (for the Churchlands, it's propositional attitudes, for others it's qualia or consciousness).

I don't think there's really much of a difference between propositional attitudes and qualia, fundamentally. They both seem to refer to mental states that can't be reduced to mere *processes*, and that's the real issue in my book.

I'm pretty skeptical about qualia myself, both internal and external, but the one phenomenon I don't think has been explained is the simultaneity of distinct objects of visual perception, and that one thread kind of lets everything else in again through the back door. 

It's not enough to say that vision merely *appears* simultaneous, obviously it's not and many studies have proven this (including the infamous "gorilla" experiment), because it's appearances that are the issue. Why should it appear simultaneous? How does this unity, however illusory it might be, manifest? I don't know of any reductionist philosopher who's explained that to my satisfaction.

I have an admittedly crazy theory that there are two dimensions of time, the other one curled up around our familiar dimension like the extra dimensions of String Theory, and that the unity of visual perception is processed in that dimension, using some Penrose-style quantum woo-woo hand-waving, and then somehow "presented" back to the ordinary mind as a unity.

So if you don't think I'm entirely bonkers after hearing that, I'd love to hear any further thoughts you might have on the subject, given that even formidable minds have said what we should do with this issue is just "sweep it aside and hope for the best" 
 




 I think he meant in physics, where three dimensions are privileged (see r3m0t's post), but that's interesting - I never knew that. 




 I don't think any philosopher from Plato on would disagree that "love" is a muddled concept that refers to many different things. 

I do think the Churchlands are far more radical than the rather uncontroversial critique you ascribe to them: In my reading of their position, they think "love" refers to not many different states, but to *nothing* - that the behaviors we ascribe to "love" have *no affective states behind them whatsoever*, any more than there is some being called Zeus behind the phenomenon of thunder.

In essence they are extreme qualophobes - they not only deny external qualia like "red," but internal qualia as well such as emotions. Some see them and the rest of the EM school as the heirs to the Behaviorists, but all the Behaviorists said was that the "black box" of internal states could not be studied scientifically - they never said that internal states didn't exist.

I've by no means read their corpus, so their position may have evolved since my last encounter with their work, but that's how I read their position at the time.

 Before you suggest "Ghost in the Shell," this was NOT Ghost in the Shell, I've seen every movie and episode, and this wasn't it.

What I remember for sure: It was quite similar to Ghost in the Shell. It involved cops in Japan with tank-like robot assistants. The plot was convoluted, but in the end it was revealed the evil mastermind was an old man who lived in a giant dome who was trying to merge trees and robots to create a new form of life. In the end his plot was foiled, but all the tank-robots were destroyed in the process.

 It also doesn't take into account the issue of land-values, on which productivity has no effect.

Productivity does affect land value. For example, after the invention of the elevator and modern building techniques, the value of land in or near a city increased dramatically due to the fact you can fit more people and/or make more products with the same amount of land than you could previously.

Likewise, the Internet and telepresence technology has affected land value, but in the opposite direction (reducing demand)

 There might be a mint there, but only if you can get past the media screaming about "ebonics" or some such nonsense. I can just imagine Limbaugh now: "New fake IQ test racist against whites! Makes blacks seem smart when they're not!"

As other posters mentioned, this is really a non-issue: Murray's own data shows economic status was the determining variable, not race, even if we admit "race" as a coherent, measurable concept, which I and most scientists have serious doubts about anyway. Remember there was a time when Italians and Jews were not considered "white," and now they are. 




 I agree, but that's not the conclusion he drew in the book. 




 He also fails to mention the rise of the war on drugs, and the increasingly large portion of the black male population that is in jail.

He did note that he focused exclusively on whites to avoid "ethnic issues." But the fact that this guy's book is called "The State of White America" raises the creepy level in the room just a bit. If this is the same Charles Murray who wrote "The Bell Curve," which suggested that blacks "naturally" have an IQ level 15 points below whites, it all starts to fit together. He's not worried about blacks because he thinks they're beyond hope anyway. 





























 The Dry Tortugas are indeed in the Caribbean. This is a different island with a similar name. "Tortuga" is Spanish for "turtle." 



















 I would prefer to use the term "strength of effect" when referring to a linear coefficient, and I would prefer that it be used in replacement of or at least along with correlation when reporting how variables are linked. 









 Only in our Galaxy. 




 In terms of pure math, you are correct, but when the general public hears the words "strongly correlated," that's not what they think. It is possible, after all to have some form of cancer be "strongly correlated" with weight, and yet have it that a 160 lb. person has a 2.1% chance of the cancer whereas a 250 lb. person has a 2.2% chance of the cancer. In cases like these unit invariance is irrelevant - reporting such a link as "strongly correlated" is misleading, even though technically accurate. 




 No... part of what it's showing is you get the same correlation value for many different patterns. Even if you just look at linear patterns, you can get the same correlation value with radically different slopes on the best-fit line. Two quantities can have a correlation of close to 1 (which would seem to imply a strong relation) and yet still be only weakly related in reality if the slope of the best-fit line is close to 0.

 Cartoons in general, especially old cartoons. The Macy's balloons really creep me out. 
























 I don't really think you get what I'm trying to say. Read the other posts in this thread, they explain it better than I do.

The point is, 0!=1 is not a "tack on" that has nothing to do with the rest of the definition of a factorial and is just there for convenience so we don't end up dividing by zero. It is implied by the original definition. 




 Then the same can be argued about any mathematical function. It's not a "convention" in the way that placing the dependent variable on the left-hand side of an equation is a "convention."  0!=1 is suggested by the underlying concept itself, not just inherited tradition. 




 It's a convention, not a theorem. It's been chosen like that because it's useful.

No, that is not correct, it is in the structure of the idea of the factorial. Think of a baseball team of x players. There are x! ways for the coach to order them on a bench for photo. Now imagine if the coach simply wanted a picture of the empty bench (0 players.) There is only one way to order that photo. Therefore 0!=1

A similar argument can be made for the "inevitability" of such seemingly "hacky" definitions such as a^0 = 1. 


































 The reaction uses a secret catalyst

Stopped reading right there. Just another Cold Fusion scam and-or self-delusion. 




 I don't think we need any fancy Category Theory to solve this problem as some other posters have suggested.

You merely have to distinguish between declarable and constructable entities. For example, I can *declare* "a square circle" by saying these words, but I could never actually construct one.

Similarly, in Set Theory we can say "The set of all sets," but it is not clear if we mean declarable or constructable sets. The set of all declarable sets includes some sets which trigger Russel's Paradox, and thus are not constructable.

When a mathematician is saying "all sets this, all sets that," he is most likely referring to the set of all *constructable* sets.  




 Why a vow to free beings - or even just one's own being- if there are no beings to free?

Empty of *inherent* selfhood does not mean total emptiness of being, but rather than our selves are unavoidably dependent on the existence of other beings (dependent origination.)

So this is where the vow originates to free all beings - it cannot be any other way, since all being is tied up together. 




 I wasn't going as far back as Smith - just pointing out that Libertarianism was around when any person living today was in High School. 




 True, but if you have to have a graphic metaphor, horseshoe beats grid. Libertarianism, if not the modern Party, has been around quite some time. The grid metaphor got started as the "Nolan Chart." Nolan was a Libertarian. 









 Because as any high school politics student knows, political alignments are not on a line (they're more on a grid, with x and y coordinates, etc.) 

I'm more of a "horseshoe" guy. I think that grid is Libertarian propaganda: "Wow, look, there's a party that believes in *both* types of freedom!" 

Right and left are labels given by American propagandists in the McCarthy era.

No, they come from where the factions sat in the French National Assembly after the Revolution.

His mistake was making his country a socialist dictatorship (communism), rather than a socialist republic.

I don't think he had a choice once he seized power. The majority of the Russian people in 1917 were rural and religious. They would not have voted for Bolshevism if given the chance. A Tolstoy-style religious socialism might have had a better shot. 




 Doesn't matter what they actually do or the fact that social programs are not 'socialism'

Yes, I like how people do not get that social programs are actually a phenomenon of capitalism. There is no welfare in Socialism because everyone is guaranteed a job (and compelled to work.) 

I'm not saying that's a *good* thing, but welfare is Capitalism *preserving* itself from a possible Socialist uprising.

One of Lenin's slogans was "He who does not work, does not eat." Makes him sound like a Tea Party guy, which he was in some strange way, that way the far left and the far right always seem to converge.
 




 Elaborate perhaps? 









 Turkey pasta. Better than it sounds. 




  Politics has always contained a transcendental element (often a phony one used as a lure, but that's a different issue.) In terms of an incentive, few things beat the promise or even the hope of transcendence. 




 "the flawed, selfish nature of man" is a religious percept.

Maybe, but also a Darwinian one. I don't think you can ignore that without socialization to the contrary, human beings care about themselves, their "tribe," and little else. 




 The simple man wonders what's for dinner.

 It was probably similar to those old questions on the SAT about culture-specific stuff that were designed to keep Jews out of Harvard. Taffy is probably something poor Koreans don't see much of. 




 The school system can fail kids without repercussions if needed. The budget isn't set according to how many students graduate. 

This is key. In the US there is tremendous pressure on teachers to pass everyone because funding and ratings are based on "on-time" graduation rates.

 My only disappointment was getting to the bottom and finding out Qu8k isn't for sale (yet...) 





























 Very interesting. Thanks for the response. One thing you said in particular caught my eye:

There are castes among Christians and Muslims too. 

We often read in the Western media that low-caste Hindus and Dalits are converting to Islam or Christianity to escape the caste system. Is that exaggerated or false in your view?
 




 I know some Hindus (and a former one) who would disagree with you. It is true though that there is no central authority in Hinduism, so different groups might have different interpretations. 

By and large though, Hinduism is an inherited tradition. You can't just go sign up to become Hindu like you can for some other religions. The "Western Hindu" groups like the Hare Krishnas and the Rajneeshis are considered fake, heretical or just plain laughable by (most) actual Hindus. 




 Assuming "The West" means the current hegemonic system lead by the United States, I would advise you to beware the "rhetoric of decline" which is used for political manipulation and doesn't really represent the underlying reality. The US is still the world's largest manufacturer, food exporter and its military technology is light-years ahead of anyone else's.

Unfortunately a number of commenters here have bought in to this rhetoric full-scale. For example, one stated:

china and other nations find themselves with a young strong backbone 

China does not have a young, strong backbone. They overshot their population decades ago, experienced apocalyptic levels of starvation several times, and are still paying the price. Their demographics are completely upside down now and the very old will soon outnumber those of working age.

I wouldn't be surprised if the US, Latin America and India form the power troika of 40 years hence while China, Japan and Europe all suffer greatly just from demographic pressure alone. 

The US will probably no longer be the lone superpower c. 2050 but it's quite possible it will still be one of the top dogs.  




 American Indians can be Hindus too if they want

Not Orthodox. You have to be born in the caste system to be considered Hindu. They could always be Hare Krishnas or something though. 



















 I suspected it might be something like this. However, would it be possible to create substances that are *digestible*, but, for whatever reason, don't give any energy to the body and/or cannot be stored as fat? Or would that create metabolic havoc?

Ok, maybe not.
 




 The government of Zimbabwe is pretty powerful, at least internally. Just ask all their political prisoners and dispossessed farmers. 




 If relatively harmless drugs like marijuana were legal, people wouldn't do this synthetic stuff. It should be banned, but then, pot should be legal as well. 




 That's my point though. Habitual drug users with no history of violence all of a sudden go nuts when they use this stuff. It might be close chemically to THC but in terms of reaction it's more like PCP. It's a drug that is a danger to the public, not just to its users. 




 [Here is one story](http://www.wwaytv3.com/2011/09/01/one-dead-another-custody-after-overnight-shooting-rocky-point). You can find plenty more searching police registers and medical journals. 

There was a case in a town near ours of a guy high on "bath salts" who tunneled into his neighbor's basement trying to kill him because he thought the guy was having sex with his wife. He had been a longtime marijuana user with no criminal record beyond possession and no history of mental illness.

Part of the problem with "bath salts" is they can be many different chemicals - you don't know what you're getting. I agree with a previous poster who said if marijuana was legal none of this would be happening, because most often this stuff is advertized as "legal pot" and sold in skate shops, head shops, etc. which pot users frequent. 




 He argues that a gold standard would force the government back into the price-fixing business. Not sure that's correct, but an interesting perspective. 




 Do you know anyone who's done this stuff? I'm fine with people using drugs that kill them, not so fine with them using drugs that cause them to go nuts and kill other people.  




 This stuff is bad news. Lifelong potheads have tried it once and ended up in the loony bin. For once I don't have a problem with the DEA. 









 don' think human nature is very malleable (which is the most basic idea of any kind of socialism: that people are programmed by relations and circumstances)

Good post, but I'd disagree with you there. Many Socialists believe there is a basic unchangeable human nature, for example Marx's idea of "primitive Communism" representing the original state of Man that will eventually reappear in the final state.

In this view Capitalism is the temporary, un-natural aberration which is part of the reason why it will collapse. 














 I paid $8.50 for a birthday card at Hallmark. 99 cent store will be getting my greeting card business in the future. 




 True, but you can often counter-sue for damages that include your legal fees. I don't know how often that succeeds though. 









 Thanks, but it doesn't appear to be on the soundtrack. It was just background music to a few of the fights - the chanting might not have even been part of the "official" music track at all, I just really dug the combination. 









 Yeah, not quite what I had in mind, but thanks. 




 I heard such music in the background of a show (Soul Eater) and can't get the idea out of my head. Can't track down the artist though.  




 Ah, it looks like only the first two parts are posted with more to come tomorrow. Sorry guys. I liked the first two parts so much I posted before I realized that was all there was. 





























 It has not been established that the original speakers of IE are related genetically to the majority of today's speakers. The language is thought to have spread more from prestige influence and trade than military conquest, except in its earliest spread into the Danube Valley, where there is evidence of warfare.

So it's not like "some black people speak French" and more like "most people who speak French are unrelated to the original French nation, which we know very little about anyway since it ceased to exist 5000 years ago." 




 I don't think you can conflate "Aryan" and "white." The original people who used the word "Arya" probably were lighter-skinned, since they were from the steppes of Russia, but there are non-IE-speaking people who have light skin also, such as the Finns and Hungarians, and many darker-skinned people who speak IE languages and practice a descendant of the "Aryan" religion (most Hindus, for example.) IE is a language group, not a race. 









 "Arya" was a word in certain branches of Satem Indo-European that meant "priest," "aristocrat," or "practitioner of the correct religion or correct rituals" depending on the context. It was not used to mean "tribe" or "race." 

It is much more correct to speak of an Aryan religion that is the ancestor of both Vedic Hinduism and Zoroastrianism than an Aryan race.
 




 Cash did claim God gave him that song in a dream when he was high on Quaaludes, for what it's worth. 




 Yes, but depth like this is why people like it. 














 Here in Michigan the private schools pay for their own buses, textbooks, etc...

Are you sure? I thought that was true in my state as well until a state senator told me otherwise. I was pretty shocked that my taxes pay to bus, heat and equip religious schools.

Have coaches teach gym class. 

They usually do, but they get a separate salary for coaching, at least in most districts in my area.

Require any part of the uniform that isn't customized to be returned at the end of the year (specifically, pants).

Haha, do you know what football uniforms look like by the end of the season? Usually there are multiple uniforms per player for each season because they rip and wear out.

private schools either learn to manage their finances REALLY well, or they disappear because they can't pay the bills.

Or they get the public to foot the bill for them, without any public oversight or standardized test "accountability" that public schools have to follow. Where I live, even some public schools are run by for-profit companies and are exempt from most state regulations, including the obligation to educate special-needs and learning-disabled students. It's sick. 




  How did these right winger Italians get to be so racist? You'd be hard pressed to find a more motley assortment of racial mixing than within the Italian peninsula. 

You've answered your own question. Racial identity anxiety is known to be linked with increased racism. See the American South with its rampant underground "miscegenation" during the pre-Civil War period for another example.

Niall Ferguson covers this issue in [The War of the World](http://www.amazon.com/War-World-Twentieth-Century-Conflict-Descent/dp/1594201005) - the book can be a bit dry but the section on racial anxiety is well worth reading. 




 Prior to the Putsch, as I understand it, the Nazis were a legal party from 1925 onwards TO the Putsch.

The Beer Hall Putsch was in 1923, you've got it backwards. They were briefly banned (and Hitler was jailed under cushy conditions), but legalized again in 1925. 









 At least in my state, joining the union is voluntary. That may not be true everywhere. 




 Actually, public districts are required by law (at least in my state) to bus private students as well, and even pay for the textbooks and heating costs of private schools (except for religious textbooks.)

Sports cost more than you think - coaches are paid in most districts, uniforms, league fees and transportation are expensive, as is insurance, and "the field" in sports-crazy towns is often more like a minor-league stadium. Then there's the marching band - I know for a fact a large district near me has a marching band budget of nearly $100,000 per year.

Disputes over grades and discipline should be handled by the teacher and the student's family, and maybe the school authorities if necessary. When it comes to grade disputes, parents should be required to provide evidence that their student did not earn the grade received or that the assignment was graded unfairly.

Here I agree with you, but that's not the reality of how things work these days.
 




 Salaries of union officials come from union dues, not district budgets. 









 You're probably right about the present time, there is more violent indoctrination among Muslims. However, most Muslims - ever very conservative ones - specifically forbid attacks on civilians, Muslims or not, and if you've seen movies like "Jesus Camp" you will know that Christians have "madrassas" of their own. 









 Only if you restrict your time frame considerably. Over the long frame of history I'd say both religions are equally bloodthirsty. 




 He is an [Obscurantist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscurantist#Restricting_knowledge) - he doesn't personally believe in the religion, but he thinks it is necessary for social cohesion.

Of course the media won't use that term... it's too, well, obscure. 




 Don't forget: They can expel disruptive students. Public schools cannot (unless they have committed an actual crime, like dealing drugs or assault, and even then sometimes they are only kicked out for 6 months or a year.) 




 A lot of times, the administrators are the Creationists. That's the small-town reality. 




 I'm all for paying teachers more, but where the hell is all that money going?

Administration, sports, legal costs (districts are sued constantly when they dare to actually fail or discipline kids), busing costs (no public transportation in most areas means districts maintain huge bus fleets of their own), physical plant (there are a lot of $100M-plus HS buildings in the US with terrible academics). 




 Save money and hire an inexpensive recent grad. Look good to the school board and the negative affects aren't seen until you've hopped to a different job. This BS goes on all the time in Nursing as well which is why unions are popular in both professions. 




 Those sorts of salaries are extremely unusual for public education. They do exist in some very wealthy districts, though. 




 Yep. Given the attitudes towards education in the US, without unions teachers would be earning close to minimum wage, and the jobs would be filled without regard to qualifications or knowledge at all, and would require a political connection to get.

(This all describes how most teaching jobs were actually filled in the early 60's and before, before the union movement really got started.) 




 Yeah, I get that sensory "vagueness" also, except with visuals which are very clear. 




 I was surprised to read that there is no smell or taste in dreams because that part of the brain is shut off during REM sleep. But come to think of it, I've never experienced smell or taste in a dream.

If this is legit, it could be a very effective way to check to see if you're dreaming. So my question is - has anyone experienced smell or taste in dreams?

I'm headed to bed to test the theory myself...

**UPDATE:** Didn't work. I ate a whole box of chocolates, and I thought I was tasting them, although, upon awakening, I couldn't recall the taste. So, maybe there is no taste in dreams, but if you *think* you're tasting anyway, it's useless as a reality check. 









 The Ice Age was over 10,000 years ago. It did not end in the Middle Ages. 









 I read somewhere you would only need 50 digits of pi to compute the circumference of a circle to the nearest millimeter when it had a radius as big as the Universe, but I don't know whether or not that's true. 




 Also, I've always been curious if there is a similar series definition for pi. Wikipedia was not much help on either subject.

 no one would suggest that the bartender who sold them the alcohol is the one responsible for the death.

Actually where I live, bartenders are legally responsible, so most bars take your keys at the door and you have to breathalyze before you get them back. We have among the lowest rate of alcohol-related driving injuries in the country, so it seems to work. 




 I do agree that there would be far fewer deaths if it could be sold on the open market.

Yes, but no one would want to sell it, because there still would be deaths, and the companies that made it would be sued out of existence unless they were given Congressional Immunity like the vaccine makers.

Then you'd just be back to your shady unreliable local "entrepreneur" just like now. 




 Absolutely correct, I was just demonstrating that probabilities can be calculated over infinite quantities.  




 If there are an infinite number of both, there is no way to start the argument

Sure there is - you can do probabilities over infinite quantities. For example, in almost all randomly chosen intervals on the set of natural numbers (which is infinite), you are more likely to pick a composite than a prime number, for example. 




 Not exclusively, though Marx did use it, and it is a term exclusive to the Left as far as I know (the Right would deny the very existence of rentiers.) 




 Thanks, this is the best explanation so far. I have another question for you: Is the Uncertainty Principle a *universal* principle of any conceivable universe, that is, is it a mathematical necessity? Or, are "Newtonian" Universes mathematically possible, but it just so happens that we don't live in one?

I asked this question on reddit before but no one seemed to have a good answer. 




 Actually, it only works if there *are* infinite universes, the way I understand it.  




 I've seen that before, but his definition of "nothing" was also "quantum foam," whatever that is. Not exactly "nothing" in the philosophical sense. 




 Is there a difference though between "quantum fluctuations" - which would seem to imply a pre-existing set of laws - and actual nothingness? Because Hawking clearly states "out of nothing." 




 There's good reason to think not. For example the ["Boltzmann's Brain"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_brain) argument. 



















 There were rumors about where Brokmeyer had gone; it was said he was conducting a Hegel-focused kindergarten class for the Creek Indians in the wilds of the Oklahoma territory. He assured his friends he was still alive by sending intricately whittled walking sticks to their St. Louis addresses.

 Not that I necessarily believe this "shipwrecked Indians" story, but is a canoe traversal from Greenland to Iceland, thence onwards to the Faroes or Orkneys and Scotland or Norway essentially impossible? Let's assume a well-stocked Inuit canoe that had just finished a large seal or walrus hunt was blown into the open ocean by a storm. They reach Iceland and then decide this was an intervention by "the gods" or something and decide to press on. Could they conceivably have survived and reached Europe?

 The drug is pretty much a key plot element throughout the series though, so I wouldn't call it a deus ex machina. The "machina" at the end of Dune was of a more literal kind!

 Me too, I just wake up. I've never experienced this void state. 




 Nothing bizarre happened, but there were some people roaming around very much alive who are very much dead in reality (relatives, etc.) The realism was pitch-perfect and even though I knew (correctly) that it was a dream, after a while I was convinced that I had somehow entered a parallel universe.

Anyone else ever done a reverse RC and convinced themselves that they were awake when they were really dreaming? 




 Wouldn't surprise me. I think the "changing text" RC is one of the least reliable. There's all kinds of pseudoscience about how the higher reasoning functions in your brain are deactivated during dreaming so you can't read coherently or form complex thoughts. I think there's *some* truth to this (my thinking is always muddy in dreams, even in Lucid Dreams), but the reading stuff is not supported by the first-hand experiences of people on this board and others. 




 Sooo... I was a female librarian in Siberia, in the year 450 AD 




 The theory is, you can read in lucid dreams, but when you check back the same text again, it's totally different. You're supposed to be able to do the same thing with clocks. I've never been able to test this, in my lucid dreams no text or clocks ever show up. 




 While we're at it... I don't think Sacha Baron Cohen is funny at all, and a Jewish guy making such vicious fun of Muslim/Arab cultures is more than a little icky in my book.

 Don't know then. I would see a doctor to make sure you don't have any heart defects and if you don't, then I wouldn't worry about it. The heart rate charts you see at the gym are only population averages, as others have pointed out, each individual is different.

That is interesting. What prophets were believed to have come before Abraham?

 Louie is great, but it's a lot more serious and introspective than Seinfeld. The standup cut-outs are about the only thing the two shows have in common. 

Curb is I know by the same creator, but it just seems fundamentally different to me somehow. It's a creature of the reality-show age - Seinfeld, despite its postmodernism, wasn't. 





























 I have heard this theory, probably from the same TV show as the OP. The argument made by the documentary was that the symptoms of the Aztec plague did not match any known European disease. It's quite possible in my mind that, after being weakened by European diseases, native diseases that the Aztecs previously resisted spread and ended up finishing them off. 

However, the documentary focused solely on the Aztecs and not the wider downfall of the native civilizations in the new world. It is a known fact that a lot of them succumbed to smallpox and this is attested to by skeletal and DNA evidence. It was in part because this evidence was supposedly lacking with the Aztecs that the documentary made the argument that it did. They even had, if I remember correctly, some people on who claimed this disease spread back to Europe and was responsible for some of the later outbreaks of "plague" where the symptoms were quite different from those of the Black Death. 




 A lot of info is from [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Un-pharaon-republicain-Enquetes-Edition/dp/2733906143) (only in French, sorry). I don't know much about the reputation of the author as a historian, but some these sites described in the book do actually exist. 




 Several sources ranging from academic to downright dubious claim he though he had a literally divine mission to rule France, that he was outwardly a Socialist, but secretly part of a Fascist cult known as "The Hood," that he built an obelisk covered in Masonic symbols and would meditate beneath it at night, etc. etc.

It all sounds pretty crazy but unlike most other conspiracy theories this one seems to have some evidence behind it. What do you guys think?

 




 Tuition only covers part of the cost. Taxpayers pay the rest. 




 That's basically what I want to know - can these families be traced back to Roman forebears, are they barbarian families that were "Italianized" over time, or some combination of the two?

Or is their origin genuinely unknown due to the lack of historical records in that time period? 




 For the most part, we have government doing important stuff. 

Not so much anymore. So many important functions have been privatized, at this point I think you can legitimately increase the scope of government without impinging on things that the private sector does better. Study after study, for instance, have shown that private "charter" schools perform worse than traditional public schools, despite the fact that charter schools can pick and choose their students. And of course the privatization of important security and military functions has been widely documented. 




 The breathing exercises, the sitting postures and some of the simpler standing postures can be verified back 1000+ years, though not back to the time of the Vedas.

The more gymnastic stuff is a modern concoction, as was recently shown in the NY Times (link is in the top comment.) Yoga shorn of its doctrinal, religious element is also a modern phenomenon, but you probably already knew that. 




 I second that recommendation. It's quite interesting how he maps out the process by which the ultra-religious society of the Middle Ages collapsed *from within*, not because of papal corruption or the rise of science as a rival doctrine per se, but more because the natural development of its own dogma led to unbearable contradictions and conflicts.

Seeing science as a natural offshoot of religion (study God by studying His creation), that eventually turned against its ideological "parent" is quite revealing. 




 TIL. I never had any idea such places existed. I figured Tom Hanks had to go to get his license renewed just like the rest of us. Any more info on these departments? I am curious. 




 Government is not 40% of GDP in the US. Maybe in some European countries. But your wider argument is valid. 




 Government work is about being compliant with rules, fair to all stake holders, and risk minimizing. 

I see no problem with parts of the economy being run on those lines. If it is the whole economy of course, that is a recipe for stagnation. But I also think that running the whole economy on the profit principle is a recipe for destruction. Call me a mushy moderate but I think a proper balance is necessary. 




 Unfortunately the Supreme Court doesn't see it that way. In my state, taxpayers already fund all the expenses of religious schools (mainly Catholic) except teacher salaries and *religious* textbooks. Everything else: Physical maintenance, other textbooks, transportation, even heating and air conditioning costs, are borne by the public. 




 Almost all folks in the government are sincere and trying to do a good job. And they do accomplish big, complex things. But when we bid on government work, we routinely doubled the time required.

Might that not be because of the very complexity of what government does, as opposed to, say, Starbucks? 




 Maybe so, but I've lived in a number of different areas (rural, suburban, urban), and not particularly wealthy areas either - and one or two were definitely downscale, and I've never had a bad experience at either place.

Contrast that with the hundreds of frustrations that I've had with private corporations' customer service makes me look askance at people who say government is always less efficient. 









 I haven't noticed much difference between any of the three on the receiving end. When choosing shipping I just use whatever's cheaper. When shipping things I always use the post office. They are a lot more knowledgeable and helpful in my experience (and cheaper too.) 




 Debt levels really aren't that extreme in Europe, the problem is there is now a disconnect between the people making fiscal policy (nations) and the people making monetary policy (the EU). 




 I've been to the DMV.

Me too, and I've never had any problems. In fact I'm impressed with how well they handle the volume and the complexity of what they do. Same with the post office. 









 All true, I've just never thought about it in terms of energy output per unit of volume before.  














 It's any object whose existence depends on the existence of another object. For example, a physical body's existence is conditioned upon the existence of the atmosphere, the sun, etc. Since there is always change in the Universe, all conditioned objects are linked together and are thus always changing and ceasing their present form without end.

An unconditioned object, by contrast, is a metaphysically necessary object. It *must* exist, and stands outside the chain of dependence and change. Various philosophical traditions have differing views on this object. Of course in the Christian tradition it is God, the Buddhists call it Nirvana, etc. Some philosophies deny that any such object exists. 




 Technically, the rule in Buddhist doctrine is "every *conditioned object* is impermanent." Nirvana is considered the "undying element" since it is not conditioned. 




 Yep, I came here to say this. But it goes back further, to the long Tokugawa peace, when the warriors of the previous age were romanticized. Ironically, when violence came back to Japan in the Bakumatsu and the Boshin War, a lot of the combat actually took on the highly stylized "chivalric" character that the combatants *imagined* was how the Samurai fought pre-1600.

Legend became reality, and that continued right up through how the Japanese fought in WWII (courageously, but recklessly.) To take one example, Japanese fighter pilots were known to hold *live duels* with each other in their planes, sometimes even shooting each other down. This was tolerated by commanders as part of the "warrior spirit." Combat discipline was a huge problem in the Japanese Army in the pacific theater. Troops would charge when ordered not to, and would refuse to retreat to more defensible positions when ordered to do so. One cannot imagine Ieyasu or any other actual samurai-era commander condoning such foolishness.

It is interesting to read the accounts of actual samurai who fought before the Tokugawa period. There are lots of passages like "we encountered the enemy, but they outnumbered us, so we ran away," and "we were paid off so we switched sides," not so much emphasis on suicidal charges and undying devotion to the Daimyo or the like (though these things did happen occasionally - every legend has a kernel of truth.) 




 here was the Holy Roman Empire, which kings were eventually elected, which seems counterintuitive considering how the system is generally known.

Yes, but only by a handful of noble "electors," not by the general population. 




 Awesome, I didn't realize I was a government! 




 They are products of the modern media culture where everything has to be over-the-top and confrontational. Bertrand Russell they are not. However, I am not too worked up over this. The Religious Right have had their way bullying and silencing the rest of us for some time now, and if they're now getting fed a bit of their own medicine, well, turnabout is fair play. Facebook is not trivial - it's a major social forum these days, and if religious bigotry and ignorance goes unchallenged there,  that is a big deal.

However, that doesn't make Krauss someone who's actually had insights into fundamental ontology. He obviously hasn't, and to claim otherwise unfortunately weakens his political arguments, which I do by and large agree with. 




 I agree with you about Krauss, he really comes across as a charlatan. People who buy his book expecting a real answer to the Big Question are going to come away very disappointed. 




 Sure, I know some old white guys like that - blacks are "fine in their own way" but their culture is too different from ours and it would be better if we just split up into separate countries. They even say they like Malcolm X and guys like that because they also have the same beliefs (blacks and whites should be separate.)

They are just trying to make their racism seem more politically correct in my mind. But if you actually take them at their word, how would this ever be done? Can you imagine the chaos? It would be like the India-Pakistan partition times a thousand. And there are too many mixed-race people now for it to ever be practical.

Also I can guess which "country" would end up with all the economic and military resources. It wouldn't be the new "Negrostan." 




 I liked how the guy who said "you can tell I'm not Jewish just by looking at me" kinda looks like Adam Sandler. 




 Hey God, stop squeaking your chair! 




 The girls in the film have grown up now and have publicly renounced racism.  




 It makes a little more sense now, thanks. Relating it to something I know more about, it seems similar to using the Poisson distribution (where there are technically an infinite number of draws) to model a process that, while technically finite, is so large as to be practically infinite. 




 That last little bit of fat is good for you. Your body and especially brain need some fat reserves. I wouldn't freak about it as long as you feel good. 














 From what I understand, you can get it and be overwhelmed by the pleasure and snap out of it. This happened to me a few times, it wasn't a "freak out," but certainly a sense of "whoah, too much!" In my mind it's closely related  to Lacan's concept of *joissance* (overwhelming or "surplus" pleasure.) You have to "enlarge" your mind before you can handle it. 




 Yes, the brain processes complex stimuli. Where I think consciousness differs from this processing activity is in the *presentation* of the stimuli as an immediate whole.

I would say that "the awareness that one exists" as a "self" is subjectivity, or at least the beginnings of it, not consciousness. I would say consciousness precedes self-awareness.  




 I think that better defines subjectivity rather than consciousness. Consciousness seems to be immediate apprehension of a complex set of stimuli, not a process.  














 That's not a glitch, that's a peek at the assembly code. 




 You are defining consciousness as a disconnect between two elements, one of which is already consciousness. 




 He might have, but it is far less likely. Choice of venue is important. Attacking an institution where one studied or was employed instead of random civilians is psychologically significant.  




 consciousness is merely a disconnect between the automatic operations and the conscious operations of the brain.

Not trying to pick on you, but that contradictory sentence right at the beginning of your post shows just how hard it is to get at any coherent idea of consciousness. 




 My friend once had a dream where she was given a phone number *and address* by the "reincarnation" of a friend of hers who had died (yikes...) 

To my eternal frustration, she never called and soon forgot the number!! 




 The immigration part is what's illegal. And $250/month would be well under minimum wage. Still doesn't stop a lot of people from trying. 




 The link, again, does not lead to a workplace or school shooting. Also:

as of April 2008 he was unemployed and had to face severe financial difficulties.

which sort of goes with what I have been saying.  




 The higher incidence being at least partly related to guns was part of my original point (and the author's). Smith was not a school/workplace shooter.

If Goh had stayed in Korea he probably would have committed suicide without harming others, as that is how social antagonism often plays out in that country. 




 They have been shown to have a much higher incidence in the US than in other countries, and for different motivations, that is, they are almost never *overtly* political like the recent killings in Norway and France were.

Of course Goh was a sociopath, but you can't ignore the culture either. His most likely inborn mental illness was exacerbated by his cultural context, whereas other contexts would have been more likely to ameliorate it.  




 Night-vision goggles have infrared light emitters that aren't supposed to be seen with normal vision. Given the amount of drug trafficking and associated military/police activity in Texas, I don't think this was an alien. It's not clear to me from the video what the figure's distance is and if it was downhill or not. 

Also, Brad Steiger is not an "image expert," he is an author and a journalist.  




 There was a clear motive of self-interest - revenge and regaining lost honor. Perhaps the oldest motivation for violence and killing that exists. Focusing on the "irrational" aspects of this case denies the strong forces of cultural determination that the author of the article pointed out. The workplace/school shooting is as much a product of modern culture as the duel was of the 18th Century and the lynching in the 19th. 




 True, but what you said was such mass violence isn't influenced by poverty. I think that's incorrect and the African bush wars are a very good example. 




 That's a US Army soldier wearing night-vision goggles. I don't see where it appears "gigantic" at all.  




 I disagree, especially when the "war" is more of a chaotic mass looting and killing for no reason. The media interprets events in Africa through the lens of "Genocide," one tribe trying to wipe out another. What goes unreported is how often these forces *attack their own side*. 




 Actually in places like Africa, spree killings are so common, they're almost an institution. Ever hear of a brush war? 














 I don't think it was a protest - at least a conscious one - but I do think it was an economic decision. People with low economic status have "less to lose" by such acts and thus do not have as strong a motivation to repress violent urges as others. 




 250 million guns aren't connected to our political culture? As for poverty, that is definitely both a cause and an effect of political culture. I don't see how population really has much to do with it. If you wanted a similar unit of comparison you could use the European Union which has 300 million plus population as well. 




 Would you deny that there is a link in general between the very high levels of violence in America as opposed to other industrialized countries and the political culture in the US? Because if you admit that link I think you would have to admit the link between mass killings and the culture as a special case thereof. 




 You should have read that link a little more carefully:

Not included are school massacres, workplace killings, hate crimes or familicides, which form their own categories.

Each culture has its own version of the "rampage" or the "beserker" which says something about the stresses of that particular culture. In America the workplace and school shootings are more common - in Europe and Africa, overtly political rampages are more common. Again, don't discount that book before you read it. 




 You should read the author's book "Going Postal." This is by no means an isolated incident. It is part of a repeated and widespread sociological pattern. That Goh had problems beyond what society can be blamed for is not the point. The point is instead of ameliorating or controlling those problems, Goh's social context exacerbated them until he exploded. He is the latest in a long list of workplace and school shooters. 




 Every society has its psychopaths, but how that psychosis manifests does say something about the society. The 9/11 attackers did *say something* about Muslim society - even though of course they didn't represent the views of most Muslims. Anders Brevik's killing spree did *say something* about the tradition of White Nationalism and Nazi sympathy in the Nordic countries, even though most Norwegians abhor his views, etc.

Likewise, Goh's shootings do *say something* about the pervasive culture of economic scams and hypocritical religion in the US, even though there is of course much more to the US than scams and fundamentalist hucksters. 



















 [Here's an interview with Shostak](http://www.astrobio.net/debate/3036/technology-worlds) where he goes more in-depth and mentions Seyfert galaxies. 




 The two top candidates for these kinds of structure are Hoag's Object (a strange galaxy where stars have been separated by type - no one knows how), and Seyfert Galaxies - badly disturbed galaxies that some have speculated are "industrial accidents" left behind by Type III civilizations.

The artificial nature of these structures is by no means proven, but some reputable astronomers have speculated in that direction. 




 There is a very long taboo in a lot of Buddhist groups about claiming attainments, because it would start endless arguments about who was really Enlightened, etc. This kind of attitude was learned through hard experience. On the other hand, being super-mysterious about it has its disadvantages as well. 




 Sounds like you have Sleep Paralysis. Sufferers often report experiencing an evil presence in the room with them, often slowly coming towards them. It's something to do with the brain's self/other perception going haywire.

If you don't mind me asking, what's so terrifying about this "ghost"? It can't be appearance, since you describe it as a cartoonish "bed-sheet ghost." 




 No, but sometimes a dog is following me and I think I've dropped my keys 




 Imagining exercise might cue the body to think that exercising is immanent, cuing increased heart rate, etc., just like imagining food can cause salivation. But yeah, I'd like to see a source too. It seems like that would be too weak of an effect to result in any noticeable weight loss. I could see where an ill-controlled study that didn't monitor subjects' eating habits might see that effect - if you imagine exercise every night you might become more health-conscious and change your eating habits. 




 Agreed. Part of the problem is that "white" has always been defined negatively, that is, a "white" person was just someone who didn't fit into one of the more identifiable racial or ethnic groups. Might as well just call us "blank" people.

Another problem is that the "white" population in the US came from so many different European cultures that they really don't have that much of a common cultural background at all. Just like the Indian in the video who couldn't explain his culture as anything more than "dancing around a totem pole and stuff," what is "white" culture to the average American today, that is, culture that only "white" people can participate in and enjoy? NASCAR and Country Music? Hardly worth defending against some other culture or subculture that may be more appealing. 




 Depends when you date the beginning of the Civil War. 




 The U.S. and Canada got away with it.

And the British Empire. Read the book "The Victorian Holocaust." They killed more people in India alone than Hitler did in all the places he conquered. Of course, they had a lot longer to get the killing done. Mainly they used deliberate starvation like Stalin, but they weren't above gassing people either (Churchill suggested that the Kurds should be eliminated by gassing their villages- Saddam wasn't the one to think of that first.) 




 Quite eye-opening. The dialectic of White Nationalism eventually leads the thoughtful racist to sympathize with the Indians (!), and equate his own ancestors with today's globalists. 




 Google "Nazi Cultural Revolution." I think I'm remembering a proper book when it was just a review I read of "Werewolf!" plus some chat-board discussions.  

They're interesting nonetheless and would certainly make a great novel should someone choose to write one. Heck, I'll get us started:

Basically, Goebbels and the other surviving Nazis (with an ailing and increasingly demented Hitler in tow) carry out the "Alpine Redoubt" plan they were considering in 1945, and manage to spark a war between the US and the Soviets using false-flag attacks with the connivance of Patton and Churchill (both of whom considered an immediate attack on the Soviets in real life.) While the two former allies pummel each other, the Nazi Party is reconstructed along ultra-radical lines in rural Bavaria and Austria, paralleling Mao's Long March. The Party is toughened up, and (like Mao's forces), realizes that the total collapse of civilization is not enough to stop a determined group of radicals from seizing power. In fact, it rather helps things along.

Shadowy bankers from Switzerland cross the border into Nazi-held territory with gold and other resources for re-armament. Remnants of the Italian, Vichy French, and other fascists also make their way across the high passes of the Alps and join up with the Waffen SS. Ironically, the SS is now "multicultural" (this was happening to some degree in real life before the end of the war - they even had a Muslim battalion!). Some "adjustment" of racial views take place - success in battle is now evidence enough that you must have "Aryan" ancestry somewhere (Jews still need not apply, of course.)

In the chaos of the US-Soviet war, the Nazis manage to re-take a lot of their former territory and become a "Third Force" that neither the US or the Russians want to piss off for fear of putting the Nazis in the opposing camp. When peace finally arrives in late 1947 (Truman has threatened to nuke Moscow with his new long-range bombers), the Nazi regime is re-entrenched and there is no trust left among the former allies to take it down. Cynical politicians on both sides also see the advantage of a Central European "buffer state" between the American and Soviet Empires to keep border tensions down. The Holocaust is known about, but it is lost in the sea of the mass slaughter of an expanded and elongated World War II.

Hitler was already quite sick in 1945 and dies by 1950, succeeded by a triumvirate of Goering (who is also sickly and morbidly obese by this point), Bormann and Goebbels. Himmler defected to Sweden when all seemed lost in 1945 (his actual plan in real life) and is now a Trotsky-like figure. By the 1960's, the Reich has become a bizarre cross of Switzerland and North Korea, committed to neutrality but also ruled by a totalitarian political party which is armed to the teeth with some of the most advanced weaponry in the world.

By this point, Goebbels, always the master propagandist and politician, has pushed aside Bormann. Goering died in 1955, a 500-lb. monster, surrounded by harem girls and plundered art. Goebbels was always on the left-wing of the Party and wants to revive the "Socialist" in National Socialism. However, he faces strong opposition from conservative Christians and business interests who are now doing a booming trade with both the US and Soviet spheres. 

However, Goebbels has a potent weapon: A new generation of "Aryans," raised by the Hitler Youth and the "Lebensborn" movement. These cadres, now come of age, assail the conservatives and try to revive the dream of world conquest and the Master Race. They protest at Universities and party conventions, carrying their "little black books" - abridged copies of *Mein Kampf* of course. They occupy Albert Speer's grand buildings in Berlin and demand the downfall of the "bourgeois  Junkers" and the "foreign elements" within the Waffen SS. The rest of the world grows nervous that World War III is about to begin...

take it from there!

 




 I haven't read that but I did read "Young Stalin" by the same author. It actually prompted my question as it had a number of incidents of Stalin acting in a very reckless manner that could be suggestive of psychosis or clinical paranoia. 




 Yes, I think that's where I heard it too. Great show. 




 I've heard this story too. Apparently this happened back in Georgia. He was with some fellow Bolsheviks and he wanted to prove his toughness and mercilessness so he killed the animal (in the version I heard, he strangled it.) I'm not sure how much validity this story has or where I heard it. 




 Yes, I know he did a lot of that early on in his rule. I'm more thinking of later on, the Great Terror and later, all the people who died shouting "long live Stalin!" and actually meant it. Did Stalin think those people had secretly betrayed him (clinical paranoia), or was he killing people he knew to be loyal for some other reason? 




 Don't forget the "Blues," the supporters of the Provisional Government! 




 Interesting question. I may take heat for this, but there are a lot of similarities between Hitler's expansion towards the East and the genocide of the Native Americans in the US. Indeed Hitler thought of the two as similar and used that to morally justify his invasions. See the book *The Wages of Destruction* for a good discussion of this.

Science in Nazi Germany was highly politicized. Anyone who didn't get on the mythical "Aryan" bandwagon was sacked or worse. In a scenario where Hitler "won" the war - not necessarily conquer the world, just survive as a regime into the 1950's or 60's, I don't see this really changing.

Most people who have thought through "Alternate Histories" about a postwar Nazi regime see the main threat coming from even more radical Nazis - the pagan/mystical SS clashing with the more Christian "preserve traditional German values" crowd. There was a great book a while back, can't remember the title, that was set during a Nazi "Cultural Revolution" during the 60's where radical ultra-Aryan students "assaulted the party" for its conservatism under the direction of a new Fuhrer who took over after Hitler's death.

In short, no, I think the Nazi ideology was too extreme to ever moderate like the American "manifest destiny" ideology eventually did. Instead it would probably have turned inward on itself and collapsed in a series of purges and crazy attempts to resurrect Atlantis (Thule) or genetically engineer Aryan supermen or some such craziness. 



















 According to something I saw on TV, you can do this in Baltimore just by asking people to say the name of the city! Not sure how accurate or scientific this is however.

 Numbers like 24, 60 and 360 are useful because they have lots of factors. That is, there are lots of ways to subdivide them without remainder. That is one reason these numbers show up a lot in calculating everyday things like time and angle.

 If you are considering math grad school, you will probably see plenty more of both. Are you more of an algebra/stats person or a geometry/physics person? 



















 I had this practice described to me though I haven't tried it myself. Basically, your read alternating chapters of works from opposing points of view (materialism vs. dualism, right-wing vs. left-wing politics, etc.). 

This supposedly avoids the effect of reading the books in sequence (first one and then the other) and being convinced either by the first or the last one you read, depending on your disposition.

Also you are supposed to see hidden connections, points of agreement or common flaws that the two arguments share. 









 Not for Central Banks, there it's the opposite.  









 I am more thinking, long-term, the team worst off in this new system is the one that shares a division with the Yankees. 









 Until very recently it was a good move as the pay is often a lot better. There is a "special needs" teacher at our district who is assigned to just a single student. The teacher's sole job is to follow this student around all day, and slap her hand back when she tries to touch things/people. Oh, and a bit of paperwork every 6 months. She makes more than twice the salary of a regular teacher.

However, if our state follows NY and some bureaucrat decides that this student needs to take the state standardized tests, this teacher is out of a job.  




 I go out of the way to use examples that involve pop culture, drugs, booze, speak the same way as my students

Advice from someone who's been on the job a bit longer than you have, perhaps: There is nothing more uncool than the "cool teacher." This does not earn you respect from the students.

 A friend of mine had a dream like this: She dreamed that a friend of hers - who had actually died in real life at 16 - appeared and told her she had been reborn as a baby in Italy, and gave the name of the town and the street address and everything.

Now I don't believe in reincarnation or anything, but I would have at least looked up that address when I woke up! My friend however, just wrote it off as a "weird dream" and never looked up the address. She said she remembered it for some time, but by the time she told me about the dream, she had forgotten everything about it except that it was somewhere in Italy. 




 Isn't this illegal in the US? I remember a similar site being shut down last year because "peer-to-peer" lending violated American banking regulations. Have they found a way around this? 



















 Very good explanation. Thanks! 




 Interesting, I am not really familiar with model theory. I am confused as to how if you only have the symbols 0,1,+,x,, how you can get anything other than whole numbers anyway. 

Even if you add Z to that list, I assume it is a Boolean function of some kind, telling you if a number is an integer or not? Wouldn't any number still come out to be an integer if you only have 0, 1,+ and * to work with to make other numbers? (I am assuming you mean "x" to be multiply, not a variable name.) 




 Thanks for the reply. I understood the first paragraph but kind of lost you in the second. I've been through Analysis but it's been a while. Maybe time to dust off the old notes... 







































 Some of it is semantics - the law differs from country to country. In the US if you had like some kind of hippie love nest (no offense intended) it would be easier to organize it under corporate law than civil union law. In fact there are communes in California that are so incorporated. 




 A partnership is a contract, usually between two people - it can be a few more - about how to operate a business (or, in this hypothetical case, a household.) More people involve forming a corporation, where stock is issued and there are more set rules, a board of directors, etc. 




 They took a lot of the outer stone casing of the pyramids - they might have pilfered some of the larger building stones here and there, but not very many. At the time the pyramids were built a canal ran to the site at Giza and the course of the Nile was a good deal closer to the site than in the middle ages, making stone transport a good deal easier. 




 Yes, but your relationship with more than one other person is fundamentally corporate, not a partnership (I'm speaking in technical legal terms, not emotional ones.) 




 True... I might fall into that category at times. I consider Lacan a great philosopher but by no means perfect and he sometimes descended to charlatanism - a trait he shared with Freud... 




 I tried looking online, couldn't find them either. I saw them on a TV documentary on the pyramids a while back - BBC probably, but I can't remember the exact name. You might want to try to contact someone who's an expert on that time period in Egyptian history, probably a professor in Middle Eastern History, or, since they were European engravings, European cultural or art history. 




 In the engraving I saw (on TV admittedly), it looked like the sand came halfway up the side of the pyramid.  




 It does, but polyamory could be covered under corporate law (strange as that sounds!) 




 The "stolen lunch money" theory of Roman expansion is sadly under-appreciated.  




 Yes, that is how it's argued but the other purpose is there as well, people just don't like to talk about it. 




 I don't really see the connection. Quasars are phenomena of the early universe. The Quasar Period was long before any sort of life - at least life as we know it - could have evolved. There are no Quasar-like objects in nearby spacetime. 




 Since forever. The adjudicated mentally retarded and some other classes of adjudicated mentally ill are considered legal minors and are not allowed to wed. You may agree or disagree with this but it is the law most places. These are state and not federal laws though. 




 I support Universal Civil Unions and getting government out of the marriage business altogether. Every adult should be able to designate one other person as their legal "civil partner," which might be their marriage partner, or a sibling, or a best friend.

This makes any sort of gay vs. incest debate irrelevant and lets the State get back to more important business (hopefully.) 




 There are engravings from the Renaissance that show the Great Pyramid about half-buried in a sand-drift. No, nothing in orthodox Christianity or Islam says that biblical figures built the pyramids, but in demotic folk religion this belief was common. You will hear it from taxi drivers in Egypt to this day. 

As for wanting to make a bigger structure, as I said, it was thought that the pyramids were the work of legendary figures so I doubt anyone thought it was possible. The Ptolemaic Dynasty in Egypt did brag that the Great Lighthouse was a successor to the pyramids. At 450 feet tall it was almost as tall as the Great Pyramid though of course its volume was far less. 




 True. It did sound like she sent her daughter to a "progressive" school, not a traditional upper-crust or religious private school. 

There used to be progressive public schools as well in some areas, but the standardized testing era put an end to most of them. 




 I know that for some of the time period in question a good deal of the pyramids were obscured in sand drifts. 

However, it's wrong to suggest that people in previous times were not impressed by the pyramids. There were a good deal of legends about them, such as that they were built by biblical figures (usually Aaron, Moses or Mohammed), and that they could cure ailments. 

As the pyramids were seen as the creations of legendary figures, not ordinary men, their vast size was somewhat taken for granted. In that sense people in those times might have been less impressed than modern people as to the immensity of the achievement. 




 As someone who teaches in one of those "disasters" I can tell you the admin is even more scared of lawsuits because they have no money. As soon as a lawyer shows up we roll over and give the parents whatever they want, no matter how ridiculous.

And in most of the country, the church school is the only private school option. Seeing as we both seem to have the same opinion of church schools, you may want to consider where all those kids will go if you succeed in demolishing the "government" schools. 




 Keep in mind not all Lacanians are Zizek fans. 




 You will find a lot of private schools with endowments that don't really care what parents think - they will always have a line out the door for the snoot factor.

Then there's church-funded schools which also have powerful constituencies that are often indifferent to parent needs. 

In my experience public schools are often over-sensitive to parent demands because of a fear of lawsuits or a nasty story on the local news. 




 She thinks the bullying and political correctness will be less in a private school? Maybe so, but I doubt it. 




 The golden number is aesthetically pleasing to humans, so it makes sense that a building would be designed that way even if the mathematics behind it wasn't known. I don't know about the meter stuff but they definitely degenerated into "History" Channel tabloid nonsense at the end so I wouldn't give it much credibility. 









 this is not about Aliens, or any mystical lines and such.

Positing an advanced ancient civilization that had modern or even super-modern technology levels is just as much of a stretch. 

I'm not familiar with all the stuff in this movie, but the pi stuff at least was explaining long ago: the Egyptians used circular measuring tools instead of rulers, so pi shows up "naturally" in their structures. 









 There's a house where I used to live that was half-finished by one of those remodeling shows. For some reason the producers cancelled the episode that family was going to be in and they just abandoned the place and left the family homeless. It was all over the local news and papers and there was fundraising for the family. I don't know whatever became of it because I moved around that time.

 Apparently it's realizing how the dual and non-dual aspects of reality arise from each other, but I am no expert on such subtle states! 




 If this is the ultimate realization, I'm not interested. Suffering seems pleasurable compared to the spiritual lobotomy this guy apparently suffered. 

Others say the non-dual experience is important but it is not the final experience. That seems more likely - and more like a goal worth attaining. 




 There was a biology professor who did a study that concluded there simply isn't enough nutrition in the NW forests to support a population of large primates unless they came down to the salmon runs, in which case they certainly would have been clearly documented already.

Can't find a link to the study I think it was on a documentary where I heard this professor speaking. University of Washington maybe? If anyone has more info please post. 




 Awesome response, thanks. Very thorough. 




 I know the feeling. Just beware that when you meditate sometimes small sensations can seem very amplified because your mind is quiet. I am not sure if chakras are "real" or not in a spiritual sense but I have been disappointed by these experiences in the long run - they seem to be leading to something great then it just fades. 

On the other hand some other mediators report quite impressive things that happen after the whole chakra/kundalini experience. I guess what I'm saying is don't get your hopes too high just yet but don't dismiss it either. 




 Nice, but beware of sensations that are just fabrications of the mind. I have these experiences every now and then as well but don't assume they can be used for healing.

 Right, but that was still a bunch of the current plates stuck together. My question was do the plates themselves change over time, not just their positions on the Earth. 




 I know the oceanic plates get subducted and new ones form, but are the continental plates permanent? Can they split apart, merge, or be subducted as well?  




 No, the "shocking" part was apparently that Voltaire was against metaphysics and that Godel believed (in his delusional period) that there was a conspiracy to hide these works of Leibniz. 




 There was interesting stuff in this video, but I feel I have to downvote because:

1.) There was nothing "shocking" in the video whatsoever.

2.) It veered into conspiracy theory nonsense and is apparently part of a huge video series on the "secret history" of the Earth

3.) Ouch, the music!

 Didn't he ever consider that the road atlas in Episode 1 was arranged alphabetically? That would be a much more common-sense reason for an obscure town starting with "Ab..." to be the first entry. 




 The "absolutist relativism" that is so often attributed to Postmodernists can be easily destroyed as a coherent concept by any halfway with-it college freshman, and already has been many times of course.

However, you'd be hard-pressed to find an actual "Postmodern" philosopher who actually held or holds such an extreme position, it's more of a straw-man position ascribed to these philosophers by their opponents. 

Part of the problem is there was never a coherent philosophical school called "Postmodernism," no Manifesto with bullet points nailing down specific beliefs, or anything like that, because after all, what could be more anti-Postmodern than a Manifesto? 

So therefore it's hard to point to any ideas that are specifically "Postmodern" in nature. It is/was more of a mood of epistemological skepticism and a style of argumentation than a defined set of positions. 

 




 From what i've been told, taxes are unreal in America. What is all that tax money going towards?

 None of the people on trial were in the documentary. In fact the documentary didn't even mention Birmingham. The BBC was baffled not only that the judge banned the doc but banned them from even saying why or who had banned it. That's downright Orwellian. 

Edit: And for people who were saying it was only banned until the trial ended, there have been 10-year-plus trials in the past, and we have a government in the US that invented the infinite, undeclared war in order to bypass the Constitution, I can easily see the UK government inventing never-ending trials in order to do the same.

 The Federalist Papers (Anti-Federalist Writings preferred)

Haha, was this in there to see if anyone was paying attention? Or do you have a serious reason for recommending it? 




 Yikes, I will never call myself "depressed" again after reading that. 




 Google "Hitler's Second Book" 




 Correct, but the conventional wisdom is that he was trying to contact those in the government who had been pro-German before the war and would be most open to a peace treaty. Besides any peace treaty between Britain and Hitler would be a de facto alliance since if Hitler could have purchased goods or obtained loans from the vast British empire, his chances of winning the war would have been greatly enhanced. 




 There are several good sources in the Rudolph Hess wikipedia article under "motives for trip" - and one horrible one, a conspiracy theory book published by "Ancient Aliens" type people who claimed the Hess who flew to Britain was a body double  and the real Hess stayed in Germany (!!).

Of course there is also Hess's own statement (under a pseudonym after landing) that he was a friend of the [Duke of Hamilton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Douglas-Hamilton,_14th_Duke_of_Hamilton#World_War_II.2C_the_Hess_Affair.2C_and_after), and later on that the purpose of his flight was to negotiate a secret peace treaty. Hitler certainly believed that's what Hess was up to and ordered him shot on sight if he returned to Germany (although he may have changed his mind in the highly unlikely even that he returned with a treaty in hand!) 




 I have noticed this too. However, it is not universal. The fans in my place now go 0 1 2 3 0 (there are two off settings.)  




 Yes, in fact he wanted an alliance with Britain against the US, where he thought the Aryan blood had been too corrupted by Jews, "Negroes," and other inferior types. And also he thought that two "Continental" powers would always be antagonistic, whereas a "Continental" and a "Maritime" power could work together. He saw both Germany and the US as continental but the British Empire as Maritime. All this and more bonkers geopolitics can be found in [Hitler's second book](http://www.amazon.com/Hitlers-Second-Book-Unpublished-Sequel/dp/1929631618/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1342462243 sr=8-1 keywords=hitler%27s+second+book) as well as some passages in the original Mein Kampf.

Some people in Britain, by the way, thought about an alliance with Hitler. It wasn't just a one-sided love affair. How many people in Britain and how much influence they had in the country is a matter of debate, but Rudolf Hess was almost certainly trying to contact these elements when he flew to the UK in 1941. 




 What is the distinction between Ur and Sumeria? 









 Quite right, but you would not expect the kind of correlation that Paulides is claiming. You might expect to find several kids who took their clothes off, and several others who hiked great distances, and several others who couldn't remember what happened to them. What you wouldn't expect to find are clusters where *all* of these things happened to multiple subjects without there being a causative etiology (which is a fancy way of saying, something other than random "patterns" in the data.) 














 Actually, Paulides is a bigfoot investigator, and probably first heard about these cases while interviewing park rangers about bigfoot. He tries hard to keep the areas of his life separate because he doesn't want to be the "crazy bigfoot guy" who also does missing-persons cases, but his Amazon page gives him away.

Still, the pattern of cases is no myth and they can be verified in local newspapers and police reports. They could use an advocate with better credibility than Paulides. He is ex-law enforcement but whether it's fair or not, his involvement with bigfoot will make many people immediately discount his other work which is unfortunate. 




 Right, but that 1/3 was down from nearly 90% before the Civil War. 









 A hundred years ago, a large percentage of women were homemakers.

"homemaking" was a hard job and often included much child care and farmwork. Yes, people still have kids today, but caring for nine or ten as compared to one or two is quite different. Today hardly anyone cares for nine or ten kids without it being an employed position (teacher, child care center worker, etc.) I would not count the housewives of the 19th century as being "unemployed" in the modern sense. 




 Sort of correct. The tractor and mechanical thresher did force millions of farm workers off the land. They moved to the cities though and found industrial work in the factories which were booming, but when the 1930's depression hit they could not just "go back to the farms" like city-dwellers had done in previous downturns. That's when the starvation and homelessness started.

It's interesting to read about the Great Depression in France where smallholdings, gov't policy and social customs limited farm automation. The Depression was less severe in France (though still bad) because many laid-off workers simply went back to the family farm. 




 I assume we're not planning on digging mass graves

Don't assume so quickly. I've been reading Ben Franklin's accounts of his trips to England. He had conversations with the upper class where they openly discussed how to start a big war to get rid of the excess population. Eventually they decided (economically) forced emigration to North America and later (legally) forced emigration to Australia were better options, but they considered mass graves. I'm not so sure things are too different today. 




 It doesn't really matter. If the LLC you created defaults on the mortgage, the lenders still repossess the house. Besides most mortgage lenders use standardized contracts and I doubt they would lend to an LLC.

Someone more experienced in these matters, feel free to correct me though. 




 No, the one guy specifically said it had aired on PBS and that "you could watch it" (presumably online.) The two guys looked kind of weird themselves and I was too chicken to butt in to their conversation! 














 It was about a woman who had kept a dead Christmas tree in her house since 1993, decorations and all, and documented its decomposition over time. She lost friends over the "creepiness" of the tree, but wouldn't give it up. According to what I overheard, she even got the tree declared an "artistic landmark" by "the city" and exempted from laws which would have made her throw it out. (not sure which city, but it could be NYC or Philly.) Supposedly it aired on PBS - though maybe only locally.

Has anyone heard of this documentary, and if so, is it available online? I tried asking r/documentaries. Two people had seen it, one thought he remembered the title as "Mad City Tannenbaum," but I couldn't find any reference to that title online. The other could not remember the title.

Further details: The two people talking knew this woman personally, and she seemed to have some mental problems but also some political influence. 




 That's illegal two different ways (stock manipulation and libel), but as long as you don't broadcast your plans on the Internet, sounds like a good scheme... 




 Good point. However it seems like most of the people on here are into sociology or social psychology, not the interpretation of dreams. I think you would find more experts over there. 




 Probably represents the subconscious or something like that. Try r/psychology instead. 









 You're the Zombie Lenin, get on that job. 




 Why did they keep making payments on their car? It's not like the repo man was going to come knocking on their door.

If you stop making car payments, the lender gives your license plate number to the police. Especially with the increasing numbers of police departments with automatic plate-scanners mounted on their cruisers, you will probably be found.

Edit: Oh, and I forgot, it is also possible that you will be charged with stealing the car. In your car loan it says if you can't make the payments you must immediately surrender the vehicle. Technically, the bank owns the car until you make the last payment. Trust me, stopping car payments is not a good idea. Better to sell the car and get something cheaper if possible. 




 There were really two economies in colonial America, one in the South and in Latin America that was more like the old world with huge landholdings and slavery/serfdom. The other was in the North and was really anomalous in world history at least since the early Roman expansion in that ordinary people could and did become landholders, often large landholders.

You can look at the political map of the US in recent elections to see that this divide is still with us to some extent. 




 was simply the marketplace trying its best to shrink the amount of people competing for work in a post-industrial setting?

more the government than the marketplace, but yes. The other main "method of attack" on this economic dislocation was to create "perceived needs" for goods that people "didn't know they wanted." This is more of a marketplace function.

What happens in 100 years if only 10 percent of the planet needs to be employed to adequately fill the market's labor uses?

Ask your Uncle Karl. Also, there will probably be an effort to bring the population down by discouraging children except among the "chosen."

 I ask this because the other day I walked into a restaurant with my girlfriend. The maitre d' station was unmanned and beyond it was just a stairway leading down underground. We knew the place was open because I could hear rock music and people talking plus normal restaurant sounds (plates, glasses, etc.) coming from downstairs. 

But... there was creepy clown stuff everywhere on the walls in the entranceway and leading down the stairwell. I could also see the edge of a jukebox downstairs and this frightened me too for some reason. I am not afraid of clowns in the least and neither is the gf but something told us to get the hell out of there and we did. 

We had to walk blocks and blocks to find another restaurant and now I feel somewhat embarrassed at being such a chicken and running away from a restaurant because of clown stuff on the walls. By the menu outside it looked like they had good food and beer too. 

On the other hand, we might have just barely avoided being chopped to pieces by killer clowns. It got me to thinking, who here has had the strong instinct to leave a place for no specific reason but ignored that instinct? What happened then (good or bad)?   




 Can't find anything by that or any similar name. Do you remember when or where you saw it? 




 This sounds more like the legendary origin of the [Hata Clan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hata_clan) as opposed to the Yamato (Imperial line.). They were supposedly descended from the Qin Emperor who did indeed have an obsession with immortality. Unlike today's obession with "purity," many Japanese clans of the early historical periods proudly claimed (or invented) foreign lineage to make themselves seem more prestigious. 




 I've always had a soft spot for the Polynesian theory but I must admit most of the recent evidence is against it.

I still think there's a Polynesian influence on Japanese architecture - perhaps spread by merchants which became a prestige form - and on the pronunciation if not the underlying grammar and root syllables of the language. I can't prove any of this, it's just a semi-educated hunch. I used to think Japanese was most likely an Altaic-Polynesian trade creole but this seems increasingly unlikely, especially with the discovery of proto-Japanese forms in Korea. 




 I think it's pretty well-established that the Imperial line originated with a well-organized and warlike tribe in the Yamato region around 300 AD. Sure, they probably had ancestors on the Korean peninsula 1,500 years before that, but it wasn't like they were a "foreign" dynasty *recently* imported from Korea, a la the Normans in England. 




 Possibly a sonic boom caused by a micro-meteorite? Just a guess. Metallic grinding noise could have been the rock disintegrating by atmospheric friction.

 Derivation of the Poisson Distribution formula and its statistics. I have to re-memorize it every year in case a student asks to see it, which someone does about half the time. 




 Cool, I've never heard of these before. Thanks. 




 IIRC, 90% is the upper limit for Korean ancestry of the modern Japanese, not the lower limit. Estimates range from 60-90%, with the remainder being "Jomon" in origin. 




 Well, if the Japanese are Altaic in some distant respect, the Altaic languages were thought to originate in Siberia, as were the Amerindian languagues. It's quite a stretch though to connect the two, other than through some very basic elements such as Shamanism which is widespread throughout all of E. Asia and the New World. 




 would be a strong indication that a people migrated in from that neighbor.

*Some* people, yes, but not necessarily a large number that would change the genetic character of a population. Material cultures have been known to spread in pre-history without corresponding changes in the physical characteristics of a population. Interestingly, there are sometimes small numbers of distinct "foreigner" burials - probably remains of the merchants or outcasts who spread the material culture. I'm not sure if this is the case in Japan or not. I know this phenomenon is documented in prehistoric Britain and elsewhere in Europe.

The culture you're thinking of is the Jomon. Studies I've seen have said that modern Japanese ancestors are anywhere from 10-40% Jomon, with the remainder being Korean in origin. 




 No, we eat far less. I remember reading that the average farm laborer in Ireland the 19th century consumed up to 10,000 calories per day. This was part of the reason so much of the population was rural: Farmers ate a good deal of the calories they produced, leaving much less of a surplus than today. 




 you can trace the migration of Koreans into Japan from the spread of cultivated chestnut trees and later through the introduction of different rice strains 

A common misconception. The spread of a material culture does not always imply the spread of large numbers of immigrant peoples. The same rice culture spread from China to Korea, and the Chinese and Koreans are genetically distinct.

There is a strong argument to be made that the Japanese and Koreans are closely related, but not based on the sort of evidence you site.  




 This is because the author knows nothing of America below the elite 1%.

quite unlike their saw-handling knife-juggling fire-eating American redneck counterparts, for many of whom a greasy fast-food burger and a beating at the hands of a semi-drunk parent before bed will comprise the best coddling they can hope for. 

the hypocrisy, it burns... 









 Assuming you're serious... I'm sure if you traveled back in time you would find that Spartans had a greater pain tolerance than other Greeks, but that would be a cultural difference, not genetic. Probably the same story with the Japanese. They are certainly culturally and linguistically unique, but genetically they don't form a separate population. 

As for the intestines stuff, I've never head this before, but it sounds dubious. Move to Denver and in a decade you'll have larger lungs. Doesn't make Colorodans a special race of being. 




 True. Americans of recent generations aren't really used to hearing foreign languages spoken so commonly. There's a sort of instinctive paranoid reaction of "oh, I'll bet they're talking about us." Growing up in a rural area I found this attitude a lot. If an immigrant was seen to be making an effort to speak and learn English, he was accepted a lot faster than if he was seen in public speaking his native language. 









 Not to mention he was quite racist even compared to the standards of his own time, which is saying something. "Mediterranean" people (like, Italians) disgusted him and of course he was terrified of "Negroes." A lot of this comes out in his writing where this xenophobia gets sublimated into actual "alien" creatures from other worlds.  




 Presumably, with a better economy relative to other rich nations at that point, the US will be able to attract still more immigrants. 




 Yep. I read an opinion somewhere that really stuck with me: A person is only a true, ideological "racist" if he would rather have a family of hillbillies for a neighbor than, say, Colin Powell. Few people these days would make that trade. 




 Tried that, didn't work. I'm starting to think this woman merely claimed she had a documentary made... on the other hand someone on here remembers seeing it (he thinks). Grr... 




 That's one of the things they were talking about, that it still had electric decorations on it and they were afraid it would catch on fire. I got from the gist of the conversation that the woman in the documentary is more than a little crazy. 














 I'm thinking specifically of four bubbles:

Japan in the late 80's.

The US in the mid-2000's.

Spain in the late 2000's.

(Perhaps) China currently.

 Actually I found downloading the update fixed the glitchiness netflix had been plagued with recently, and it isn't doing any of these things on my wii. Which version wii do you have? 




 I agree. I personally don't believe that AP is "real" as in scientifically real (it would seem so easy to get hard evidence if it was - just put random words on a piece of paper inside a locked room or something), but nevertheless it is "real" in the realm of experience, and I find it fascinating.

Personally I think AP is a kind of lucid dream but one where the dreamworld is a replication of the room where you went to sleep and it is not easy to change which is a different sort of experience from a normal lucid dream. I had one such lucid dream in college where I wandered around my dorm, then "fell" through a wall and ended up on the street outside. Unfortunately, then I woke up so I didn't get to further explore the experience.

 Too bad the online version of the book doesn't have this symbol on it, or maybe I just haven't read far enough yet. 









 I've always thought that the utilitarian and contractualist ethical schools can be reconciled, at least in part, by adopting the [geometric mean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean) rather than the better-known [arithmetic mean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean) as the measure of aggregate utility. 

That way, a single person in total privation (like the girl in the Le Guin story who must be tortured in order to provide Utopia for everyone else) would set the measure back to zero. 









 Or a chip in their ear connected to a guy with a laptop. I think the ease of cheating might eventually destroy chess and make something like Go more popular. 




 I'm thinking it was in a book - maybe "Outliers" or "Talent is Overrated" 




 Correct, that 52% is arrived at by counting all words that appear in a given text exactly once. If a non-standard word like "deletable" appears once, it counts just as much as the word "person" which might appear 30 times.

Edit: I just discovered that the Firefox dictionary at least *does* know the word "deletable." 




 There was a study I read about (can't remember where), which measured the IQs of chess grandmasters, and the mean IQ was actually subnormal to a statistically significant degree. Not terribly so, it was somewhere in the mid 90's, but it put paid to the myth of the chess "genius." 

Apparently these grandmasters had spent so much time focusing on such a narrow skill (often from a very early age), that their wider reasoning skills had never developed properly. 

Could at least partially explain all that Bobby Fisher conspiracy theory madness. Chess doesn't drive one mad directly, it merely makes shabby intellects believe that they are geniuses in fields they know nothing about.

 Sounds like the Iron Masks case... 




 That's not even close to the worst that could happen.

Yep. Back in the landline era, you could get your "lines crossed" and end up listening to someone else's conversation. My mom heard two guys talking about how they were going to defraud some company of millions of dollars. It was no joke they were later on the news being arrested by the FBI. 




 That's what they always do with the nutty coalition partners in parliamentary governments, make them the tourism minister. 









 Yeah, same here, and in my opinion the "Lab Animal" was even scarier and the "Pandora's Box" was mighty creepy too. That whole book is still seared into my memory. Major childhood trauma!! 









 In theory. I'll guess that doesn't actually happen very often. As school discipline is opaque by law (at least in the US, don't know about Canada for sure), the public can't know how this policy is actually being implemented. This is to push up graduation rates, it happens in the US all the time. In many districts the lowest grade you can get for a mark is a 50 even if you never attend class once. That way, you can still "make up" the grade and get to passing by the end of the year. 
























 Yeah, 2000 calories per day is "starving" you. Maybe if you're an athlete. Not if you're a lazy fatass who sits in a hospital bed all day.

Depending on how fat these people are, 2000/day might be a pretty significant calorie deficit even if they are just sitting in bed. Larger mass bodies do take more calories just to keep everything "ticking over." This can be an advantage to weight loss, actually, the fat works in your favor in the beginning, but if a person feels forced into it I can easily see it setting off a panic response (which is why "fat camps" for kids rarely work...)

 Right, but declaring bankruptcy destroys your credit, so if you have the income, just paying the loan is the better option in the long run, and if you don't have the income, you're never going to get that much credit. 




 If you have the income, why aren't you just paying your loan? Is it worth the opportunity cost of defaulting on credit cards and going bankrupt? I guess maybe some people don't think that far ahead.

 














 But that would be fraud

How would it be fraud? Credit card cash advances are unsecured debt. However, good luck getting a cash advance large enough to pay off a student loan. 




 It is a local thing. Outside of NY, people still say "in line," though I have noticed an insidious rise in the British "queue," mainly written though, not spoken, and mainly in places that want to act snooty. That's how these language changes often start though. 









 I think Y(t)/t converges to 1. My reasoning is:

Given the Law of Large Numbers:

E[Y(t)]~=E[sum(x)]

E[Y(t)]~=n*E(x)

E[Y(t)]~=n*mu

E[Y(t)]/E(t)~=n*mu/sum(x)

E[Y(t)]/E(t)~=n * mu/(n * mu)

E[Y(t)]/E(t)~=1

 




 Y(t) will grow without bound as t goes to infinity. It doesn't have an asymptote. You will always need more and more instances of x (over the long run) for their sum to surpass higher and higher bounds of t. 

This isn't a very interesting question the way you've worded it which makes me think you might have missed something in the question. Can you go back to your HW and copy out the problem exactly as it is worded? 




 Good reply, thanks. 





























 I didn't say that, etzhadaat did. You, however, said that no one, and thus no Republican, has ever said that, when quite clearly there were some who did say this. 




 All I ever hear from Republicans is that we should let the poor die because they haven't earned our hand-outs.

No one has ever said that. Ever.

I guess you didn't catch the Republican primary debates this year. The audience cheered and shouted "yes, yes" when the moderator said "do you think people without health insurance should just be allowed to die?"

 Cool I will with-hold my skepticism. There have just been too many false claims in the field for me to put too much hope in any one company. Quantum computing was starting to seem like the cold fusion of the computing world. If they really have made some breakthroughs, that would be epic. 




 Here's what I've heard from some people who are "in the know" (or at least plausibly claim to be):

Far from being "material," our universe is actually a very dense form of spiritual power. The point is to compress it to a level that it basically ignites, sort of like nuclear fusion. Consciousness appearing at the "material" level is the spark of that ignition. 














 The CIA also invested millions in psychic "remote viewing." D-wave has always smelled scammy to me - they've been promising huge breakthroughs for over five years now with nothing to show for it. 




 IIRC from a documentary on the subject, this was tried and it didn't work. The algorithms came back with the result that the text was most likely gibberish and there was no code hidden within it. A lot of historians think the manuscript is a hoax (though an old hoax) that was cooked up by some "alchemist" as a secret text and then sold to a gullible nobleman for a tidy sum. Not everyone accepts that conclusion though. 




 To be fair this is only the O'Reilly/Limbaugh wing and Romney and Ryan saying this. The rest of the GOP is telling them to shut the hell up because they known they need some minority votes to win in the future.

On the other hand, that wing of the party really is the Republican Id. Others in the party share those sentiments they just are too smart to express them openly.

 Possibly. I know they had at least one event at the Nuwabian compound, a barbeque or something. I'm no expert on the subject, I just know there is some kind of link. The wikipedia article lists a ton of other acts that were associated with the Nuwabians, most of which were a surprise to me. It seems like Scientology they make an effort to recruit celebrities into the ranks. 




 True. They are about the same level of dangerous. I'd give the edge to NOI though -  they have political influence in several cities including Philly and Oakland. I don't know of any city council members going to speak at Scientology centers. 




 The NOI teaches that the Earth and Moon were once the same

That's a very common occult/fringe religion belief. I have no idea where it originated (medieval alchemy, maybe?) but it shows up all over the the place. 




 That's the only thing you found that was weird? 




 The rappers OutKast are/were loosely associated with the Nuwabians, though I don't think they are official members. 

You can see references to Nuwabian beliefs in the videos for [ATLiens] (http://www.metacafe.com/watch/sy-18086078/outkast_atliens_official_music_video/) - ancient Egypt - and [Elevators](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptPj6K_jJQ) - blacks coming from/returning to another planet.

 Nooo, I meant the equivalence of the Halting Problem and Goldbach has not been proven. I repeated it in the hopes that someone would be familiar with the issue. 




 I'm not saying that's correct, just that someone had mentioned it. I guess you could think of checking each even number as a yes/no question? Not sure what the basis for the comment was, I don't think the poster ever elaborated. 




 Now *that* would be a supremely interesting number - the first number that is not a sum of two primes... 




 Does group theory help at all with these kinds of problems? I don't know much about Goldbach - though I once read a comment here that in the opinion of many it is equivalent to the Halting Problem and thus unsolvable (though this hasn't been proven either.) 




 A shame I think, no?

Did anyone else read this in a Russian accent? 




 United Airlines was union-owned for a while. Unfortunately, it was a bunch of *different* unions and they fought amongst themselves more than they had fought the previous ownership.

Unions don't necessarily represent the pure working class. There are middle-class unions and even business-owner unions. In countries like Venezuela some unions are conservative and oppose the Socialist government. In Poland the trade union Solidarity was a big part in bringing down the Communist government.

This is part of why Communists such as Lenin are not necessarily big fans of unions. Lenin criticized "trade union consciousness" as just another form of bourgeois thinking.

 Enough so that future generations can have the same benefits from HS sports that they enjoyed.  




 Almost all pro sports players played high school sports. Of course, only a small fraction of HS sports players become pros. However, a pro player would be silly to say "HS sports did nothing for me, I don't think I should have to pay any school tax." 




 In general, those decisions which increase economic growth in the short run by depleting non-renewable resources. 




 But Spongebob is also incredibly friendly and warm to people, a trait not characteristic to autistic people.

That varies. Some autistic children are actually overly friendly, want to talk with strangers   trust them instantly. 




 That is correct, but political decisions are taken on the basis of GDP being a good measure of economic value, that is the problem. 




 And if you're looking to measure the value of open source software its contribution to GDP is just about the least exact measure.

I think that was his point, that economics needs to broaden its definition of value beyond GDP.

Someone who walks or bikes somewhere instead of drives is at least preserving value (if not creating it), by reserving the gasoline for someone who may have no choice but to drive (a disabled person, for example.) 














 True, I forgot to specify, stock-based soups, not cream-based ones. 




 Yep. 




 Seems traceable only back to a NewsMax "journalist." I don't consider that a credible source though presumably you do.  




 More teen pregnancy in red states is probably more a function of poverty than religiosity, though I'm sure the latter contributes as well. Condoms are a sin and you can't buy them in town, but come Friday after the football game, that sex is a sin as well can get forgotten for a while. 




 You can have a Christian-inspired socialism, as exists in South America. Not all socialists are Marxists.

 What do I not understand about Adlai Stevenson?

The "yellow dog" Democrats at the time - mainly southerners who would rather vote for a "yellow dog" than a Republican. Stevenson was pretty "yellow" in their eyes - he was a northern intellectual, but they voted for him anyway because of the D by his name.  




 Abraham Lincoln was a white supremacist...

That's oversimplified. As a younger man he did think that the "characters" of the races were too different from one another for them to live together in peace, and the best solution was for the slaves to be freed and emigrate to a climate more suited to their culture, like the Caribbean. I think he mentioned Haiti as an example of a successful black Republic being formed in that region.

Also, that was the Lincoln of 1845. The Lincoln of 1865 had come to see the long view of history, and supported not only emancipation but voting rights and the right to hold public office for blacks who owned property or who had served in the military - which is what got him shot by Booth.  




 Any source on those Johnson quotes?  




 Even if so, it would be interesting. The movement seems to be falling apart right now, with so many high-level defections and even heretical offshoots appearing that claim to be the original Hubbardism! There are even rumors Cruise is leaving. 




 I should specify: Not a leader or a PR person, just an ordinary member, preferably one who's been in the organization a number of years and spent a good deal of money on the courses. 




 If I remember correctly, Bush campaigned on letting younger people opt out of the system altogether, and letting everyone, even those already retired, put their money in 401(k)-style accounts that they could choose to place with mutual fund companies like Fidelity. This is why Gore kept hounding him on the "lockbox" that he was so mocked for. As for the actual bill that got introduced, I don't know if it was that radical in its final version.

At least as it has been reported in the media, Ryan's plan involves replacing Medicare with $6000 vouchers (the per-person cap) with which people could buy private insurance. The government would still subsidize insurance for the elderly, but would no longer guarantee it. Again, this would be phased in, with people over 55 allowed to stay in "traditional" Medicare. 




  Even Ron Paul's budget preserved SS and medicare. 

It envisioned phasing them out, as does Paul Ryan's budget, at least for Medicare, and Bush II tried to privatize SS. I don't think there's as much of a gap between the old and the new Right as you think - they're still fighting the New Deal. 




 how is the modern right progressive? Because it supports foreign interventions? Other than that I don't see too much difference ideologically between the "old" and "new" right.  




 well McCarthy went down in flames once he started questioning Eisenhower and the Army, but it launched Nixon's political career, and Bobby Kennedy's, though the right-wingness of either of them later in their lives is debatable to say the least.

I thought you meant the Right in general. For the old Taft wing, you have a point.

 Salads aren't actually that great, especially with the stuff most people put on them. Soups and stews have the lowest ratio, dried breads and grains (crackers and chips), and nuts have the highest.

 Good explanation, thanks. It makes sense they would not want to appear to be giving in to a "Red Scare" given the time period and the memories of the 50's.

To ask a a follow-up question, how in the world did Trotskyists gain positions of power in the local unions to begin with? Your typical American union would laugh them out of the hall, unless they felt like beating them to a pulp instead. Were/are things different in the UK? 




 I never understood why the leadership tolerated the Trotskyites in the Labor Party at all. In the US, where you can join a party automatically when you renew your driver's license, it's hard to keep figures like David Duke or Pat Buchanan out,  but I always thought party membership in the UK was more tightly controlled. 
























 The mods will nuke it sooner or later... too bad because under the inane comments there's some good ones. 




 There are some nutty billionaires trying to do this. Peter Thiel wants to create a giant floating cruise ship/city-state/tax haven for Libertarians only that will sail around the world spreading the gospel of liberty or something. 

I think the whole thing will degenerate into an argument about whether or not lifeboats are a collectivist monstrosity, and end with a colossal legal battle concerning homestead rights in the buffet line, but I wish him well. 




 I know this was a username joke, but I'm sure there are plenty of people who were with you until the "elimination of inferior humans" part. 

It's hard for us to admit, but the continued fascination today with Nazis (and to a more limited extent Communists) points to a very deep human political need for exactly those things: Vision, will, strength, beauty...

 Certain people of an occult persuasion believe the Earth and the sun formed "one body" in relatively recent times (like 10,000 years ago, not 4.5 billion).  This "plasma formations" theory might be a variant on that belief. 




 Let's go with the subtle satire explanation... less embarassing... 









 I agree, to me there's no difference between the two belief systems, but the fact that the Mormons aren't in the majority but are trying to "fit in" these days make them downplay these doctrines, and plus, as I just demonstrated, it's real real easy to make them sound like a UFO cult. I'm surprised South Park hasn't done them yet. 




 It used to be better known, but the LDS today downplays these teachings in an attempt to be more "mainstream" (mainstream as defined by religious right - Republican, etc.)

They don't exactly want it widely known that [Mitt Romney is a Bishop a church that believes God is an alien from the Planet Kolob](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolob).

 I combined my responses to your two messages here. In case I got too wordy for you I put the **TL;DR** main points of my argument in bold.

.


Holding a belief, just because famous people held, is in general poor form. It is no defense for that belief.

As a non-expert, I am unfortunately reliant on the opinions of these "famous people." Alas, these vary greatly, from transcendentalists like Gdel to straight materialists like Krauss, and every shade in between, so I attempt to find among their views those that seem the most consistent, and which accord most closely with my own phenomenological experience. I admit the possibility that I have failed in this task.

.

 don't know any experts (I.e people who study consciousness and have a grasp of quantum mechanics... Note these are very few) that hold your view. 

Who are some people you know whom you feel have a grasp of both cogsci and QM? I would be interested to read the opinions of these dual experts. Penrose I think comes closest, but you're obviously not a fan.

You are quite right that the debate has mainly been a few adventuresome QM experts saying their field has implications for consciousness, and neuroscientists disagreeing with them (although *philosophers of mind* are sometimes a different story, and are occasionally more receptive to the views of these physicists.)

.


A notorious example is David Bohm and his holonomic brain theory. 

I am not a fan of Bohm. I don't even think his ideas are even coherent, let alone correct.  That the lenses in our eyes somehow keep us from seeing the holographic universe? It sounds like the ravings of a schizophrenic...

.

 In general, there is nothing wrong with being a dualist

Ugh, I disagree. Trying to formulate one fundamental ontology for existence is difficult enough, let alone two. I am not a dualist, at least not in the "two original substances, matter and mind" sense of the word. I don't think you can be a dualist without ultimately falling into the absurdities of Descartes and/or Leibniz. I do think though that a non-formal element is entailed by the existence of the physical world (see below.)

.

How would quantum computing be anti-formalist? How do you think we study quantum computing? It is an extremely formal field.


**I will address QM in general here, as I get to its computing aspect below: QM is extremely formal, perhaps the most formal theory ever devised, but precisely in being so it "heightens the contradictions" of formalism. It resorts to such things as negative probabilities, objects that are both waves and particles at the same time, and, as I learned from your article link, probabilities that don't add up to 1 and that violate the sure-thing principle.**

**This sort of thing, to me, points to the fact that we are trying to study a non-formal aspect of reality with formalist tools, and, however successful the mathematics has been, at root logical incoherence is the result. I will perhaps further irritate you and name-drop the ultimate famous person here and say the Einstein had similar criticisms of the ultimate logical validity of QM.**

.


To me it sounds that by non-formalist, you mean non-physicalist.

Not exactly. My philosophy is closer to people like Tarski and Gdel who wrote on the limitations of formal logic. I would consider them to be anti-Formalists under my definition, though usually this term is not applied to them by historians of philosophy (they reserve it for woolier figures like William James...). 

[And before you say Gdel wasn't a physicalist, I would disagree. To me Platonists are the ultimate physicalists. I won't elaborate more here as we'd go down a very long side-path.]

.


I would also distinguish between a *non*-formalist (someone like Meillassoux who thinks the Universe is a "hyper-chaos" that only *appears* sensible) and an anti-formalist (someone like me who thinks that there is more to the Universe than formal processes.) 

.


For me the physical universe is very real, it is not just the dream of a butterfly or some such nonsense, but, by the very virtue of its being real, it contains a non-formal, though not necessarily non-physical, element, that is, something that can *never be explained* by a formal system. Note that this does not mean the element is mystical or supernatural in any way. 

.


**To me it is no coincidence that QM and consciousness both seem to produce a "decoherence" of logical discourse - it is very difficult to talk about either of them using ordinary logical principles, a sign that they both belong to the non-formal aspect of reality. Do they share any connection beyond a connection of type? My intuition is that they do - and that the vast computing power promised by Quantum Computing and the vast apprehensive ability possessed by consciousness are signs of this link.**

.


Without boring you with an entire manifesto, my "anti-Formalist" view is that formal systems cannot provide a complete description of reality, that logic always needs to refer to a non-logical "ground" in order to avoid contradiction, and therefore there is always a gap between a formal description of reality and the Real itself, and that consciousness lives, at least in part, in this gap.

Where do I get these weird ideas? Well, I see an unnamed but important line of thought in philosophy passing from Hegel to the post-Incompleteness generation of mathematicians, and then through figures like Heidegger and Lacan to modern thinkers such as Badiou (though I don't share the latter's politics.) I've come to think of this as the "anti-Formalist" line of thought, though that's my own term for it, nothing official. If you are not familiar with any of these writers, they hold that each entity contains a gap, a "not-all" within itself that not only allows for but *insists* that something radically "Other" must emerge from within.

.


So yes, I've outed myself as one of those damn Continental-philosophy fanboys, the kind of dupe who you probably think would have been fooled by the Sokal Hoax had I not been in grade school at the time. Do with me as you will!

.


Their ideas on consciousness were very naive and motivated not by a psychological problem but by the physics/philosophy problem of measurement in quantum mechanics. 

I am interested on your views on the measurement problem. Do you think it can be resolved (or dissolved as Wittgenstein would say) without a reference to consciousness, either on a human or a cosmic level? If so, how? [You might be interested in this article](http://www.bigquestionsonline.com/print/138). It is close to my views though I wouldn't use the term "God" as it's too historically freighted.

.


The reason I would like to see this is because I'd've never seen an intelligent defense of quantum mysticism and I would really like to see one. 

You won't get one from me - I'm not a quantum mystic, at least if by that you mean the belief that, say, entanglement means people can have psychic powers, or things of that sort. I am open-minded towards the paranormal, though not a believer. I like to say I don't want to be so open-minded that my brain falls out!


 




 Interesting links, I will check them out. I'd heard of the first idea but not the second. 

I am not an expert in these fields, but my opinion is not just "empty statements," as it is informed by and resembles that of some people who are experts. If I'm going to expend the time conversing with you I do expect some civility on your part. 




 I was just pointing out that many famous scientists have believed in or theorized about a connection between *biology* and QM, and if we accept that consciousness is a biological process at least on some level, then there may indeed be a QM component to consciousness, just as there is in other biological systems.

You might think the links between quantum effects and cell biology are "nothing special," but until recently biology was thought to be explainable in wholly classical terms, except by some visionaries like Schrdinger,  and now we know that's not true. 

You are right that Gdel was a Platonist, and also right he didn't think that the link between his Theorems and consciousness was related to QM, but you were rubbishing that idea as well, so I thought I'd admit where I stand on that issue as well.

Fundamentally I am an "anti-Formalist" when it comes to consciousness, meaning I think that somehow (whether through QM or Platonic Forms, or some other mechanism), consciousness exists at least in part outside the formal, "billiard-ball" world of classical physics.

Oh, and the fact is I have read what you've read, we just disagree. I don't claim to be an expert, but when the experts disagree, the layman is allowed his opinion.

 




 Well, to Penrose you would also have to add the even more formidable name of Schrdinger, who theorized on this issue in his "What is Life?" 

As for Gdel I guess this will get me in an even deeper hole with you, but I do indeed think there is a link between the Incompleteness Theorems (there's more than one) and consciousness as well. Of course, Gdel himself believed this, but then, Gdel wasn't a brain scientist and he went crazy, etc. etc. (You can tell I've had this argument before.)

Anyway. I'm not saying microtubules are what links QM effects to consciousness, it could be some other mechanism. Recently some solid links between QM and biology have been found, for example [in the navigational systems of birds](http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.3725). It's not consciousness - yet - but it does show a link between the biological and quantum worlds. 

I am "agnostic" on this link in a strictly scientific-method sense, but in a broader philosophical context, due to what I see as weaknesses in traditional naturalism, yet as someone unwilling to accept dualism or a purely "mystical" explanation for consciousness, the link to quantum processes seems suggestive, though not conclusive. 




 I have not read much technical literature and I realize popular articles on the subject can be sensationalistic or misinformed. However I still think there **might** be a connection between quantum states and consciousness, and there are some well-informed experts (Penrose, for example) who believe so as well. Do I have definite proof? No - that's why I used the word "believe" instead of "know" or "can prove."

 




 Haha, very civil reply. Anyway, ignoring your nastiness, my hypothesis is that the ability to process information and yet be in observation of the same process simultaneously, which seems to be an ability of human consciousness, might also be a characteristic of these sorts of computers. If quantum computers are possible, being able to calculate in super-position states might grant them this ability. 




 Are any of those episodes online? I stopped listening to C2C once it got so political but I'd love to hear Dr. Taff interviewed.

 It wasn't him, it was one of his followers. According to legend, the follower was killed for his discovery since it went against the Pythagorean belief in the sanctity of whole-number ratios.

According to another, more cool legend, the follower was killed not because he made the discovery but because he *talked about it publicly*, revealing esoteric knowledge that was only meant for the Pythagorean elite.

In addition to being mathematicians, the Pythagoreans were also a religious cult. Imagine a cross between the MIT Pure Math faculty and Scientology. 




 See [here](http://www.mpg.de/5925490/meta-consciousness-brain) 




 Chalmers sees consciousness as a Cartesian theater when he talks about consciousness is "presented" to him, as if he were a member of the audience watching his senses take the stage. He questions why processes are "accompanied" by experience, as if experience is an extra effort of theatricality for his enjoyment.

But isn't this exactly the case? That the conscious perception of a color is somehow different from say, how a computer would analyze visual wavelengths seems undeniable. Do you believe that a computer sees the color blue just as you do, that it has the same experience? I don't.

This element of theatricality, of presentation, is *precisely* the hard problem. Even if it is an illusion, it seems that this illusion could not arise except from a *prior ground of theatricality* that already exists!

Where I might differ from the Clarmers position is I think computers, probably quantum computers, will someday begin to have these presentations. That will be quite the interesting day. 









 Bad statistics... the US is coming off a much higher base of education than most of these other countries. Percentage growth in this sort of context *must* level out over time (you can't have more than 100% of people getting higher degrees than their parents). 




 a favorable deal for the union means higher taxes or less gov't services

Not necessarily less services if a good deal attracts better employees or helps to reduce turnover. 




 That's a shame your local is so messed up. 




 AFT or NEA? 




 Some students live in chaotic homes, have to take care of their siblings, etc. Yet both are graded on the same rubric?

Eh, not really. Almost all teachers, myself included, will give a lot of breaks and extra help to kids we know are having trouble at home.  




 Haha well I am the young guard - believe me most locals are looking for people. I agree about the PR. 




 A student can choose how much to study and how much to pay attention in class. A teacher cannot choose his or her students or force them to study. That is the difference. 




 From my experience most union locals are desperate for people to fill executive positions and often have to beg people to run. Yes it's more work but you can't complain if you don't get involved. 




 That's funny, the gist of the article was exactly the opposite, that MWI is the only thing that can save physicalism. What is your thinking on that argument? 









 Israel is held to a different standard because it came into existence as a *modern* Western-supported state, and, in part because of the pressure of modern Western morality, it didn't kick out or kill *all* of the people in the conquered land, though it did plenty of killing, don't kid yourself.

Had Israel been established and expanded in the 19th Century, like the US, and killed, ghettoized or expelled most of the Arabs, as the US did with the Indians, there would be no big debate.

That being said, the rich Arab oil states could easily pay to resettle the Palestinians - say in the Hejaz - but have chosen not to as that would be "giving in" to Israel . The Palestinians I have a lot of sympathy for. Both Israel and their Arab adversaries, though, not so much.

 Lee repeats the story himself, but I don't know of any independent confirmation. It sounds like the sort of grandiose story he would tell about himself. 




 They didn't think much of Japan militarily. It was a huge shock when Singapore fell. The British Navy removed a lot of fleet elements from Asia to reinforce the homeland. This might have been necessary, but they also didn't think it would be that big of a deal and that the forces they left behind would easily defeat the Japanese.

When the British blew the bridges into Singapore, legend has it that a man asked the future leader of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, what the sound was.

Lee replied: "That's the sound of the end of the British Empire." 




 I doubt he was. Usually however there was a picture of his invention with a black slave working with it. This is how this misconception got started. I believed it in elementary school too. 




 Actually it does, it's more malleable and platable than most other metals. And many people prefer how it looks to silver and platinum. That doesn't necessarily translation to monetary value though, platinum has often traded higher than gold per ounce. 




 Talk about stuff people were taught wrong in school... the gold standard had not been honored domestically since FDR. Only foreign drawers were allowed to exchange Federal Reserve notes for gold into the 70's, and this was only because basically no one did. 

When the French and Swiss governments decided to express displeasure with Nixon's inflationary policy and redeem all their notes for gold, Nixon and the Fed said "screw you" and closed the international gold window as well. 

It had nothing to do with economic growth and insufficient amounts of gold being dug up.

 Britain was already fighting in both wars, I don't think this holds up. 




 No, in most states further education is a state requirement, often at your own expense. Imagine continuing to pay for college classes or pile on more debt while making $30K per year.

You do get a pay raise for attaining higher degrees, but it's often not enough to make up for the additional cost of classes, and because you're trying to cram in summer and weekend courses, it can often take 10+ years to get a further degree.
 




 In my opinion the content knowledge is usually easier to acquire than the teaching skills. It's ironic that it's very hard to teach people how to teach, even though in aggregate it's just a bunch of simple skills and habits.

 I have always been a fan of the "Yoda was in on it" theory - he knew what was going to happen, but let it take place because the Jedi Order and the Republic had become too corrupt and complacent.

 The party should bring back the old slogan from the FDR days: "If you want to live like a Republican, vote for the Democrat." 









 some of his contemporaries held the materialist position we now associate with modernism, and the Buddha explicitly rejected it. 

I still think it's fascinating that there were materialist-atheists in 400 BC. One would be inclined to assume that these were just "strawman" positions people pinned on their opponents, but no, we actually have texts from these groups! Similar ideas show up in Greece not too long afterwards.

 That's not too impressive. A lot of HR departments use the same set of tests on prospective hires. I took the same stupid computer psychology test at least five times. 




 The new age, pseudo spiritualism that is often saddled on it.

Do you distinguish that from traditional belief in the Siddhis, or is it all superstitious accretion to you?

I'm ambivalent - some mediators I respect have claimed supernatural experiences, but I can't bring myself to totally buy it. It's easy to enter into a dreamlike state when you're in meditation. I've yet to see anyone levitate, in other words, and that Discovery Channel "documentary" doesn't count. 




 Sort of... but to a materialist suicide is annihilation, whereas the idea that Nirvana is annihilation is classified as a wrong view.

Suicide = Nirvana in the absence of rebirth is a false implication. 




 The final goal of Buddhism is Nirvana which only makes sense as opposed to Samsara which is the circle of perpetual birth-and-death. 

What about the view that Nirvana and Samsara are just different attitudes or reactions towards the same reality? Hippie talk and not real Buddhism, some say. I'm not so sure.

In fact, Nirvana is absolute bliss, and is not like nothingness or blackness at all. 

But bliss is still a sensation, and Nirvana is supposed to be super-sensate. Not trying to split hairs but I think it's an important distinction.

 




 I'm not sure about the first picture, but the second looks pretty accurate. 


































 What is a deleriant exactly? I see that term thrown around a lot but I've never seen it well defined.

 Yep, I've read that page carefully. Thanks for the advice, I am considering steering clear of amanitas for the time being. 




 After reading this board and other sources for about a year I think I'm ready for my first psychedelic experience. I've sort of settled on Amanitas since they're legal, readily available from high-rated sellers, and organic (the white-powder RC's from shady vendors scare me).

However people seem to have very mixed experiences with with these mushrooms, with a large number of dud and bad trips. Is there anyone who's had success with Amanitas that would like to offer some tips on how to make the experience a good one, or am I off on the wrong track choosing them for a first trip? 














 Thank you, someone with a common-sense answer to this silly debate. There might be areas of reality evolved minds are blind to, but that's not the same thing as saying they're just as likely to produce false beliefs as true beliefs.
 




 Force or not, we need a way to describe gravity on quantum scales, and such a thing has proven elusive so far.

Wouldn't entropic gravity be a description of gravity on the quantum scale? That is, the theory is that there are more random quantum "opportunities" for a particle to move in the direction of the gravitational (pseudo)-force than in the opposite direction, or am I misunderstanding? 




 Nope, it was in a chapter before the CLT was introduced. 




 Mostly makes sense -  what's still weird to me is that the math seems to be implying that *averaging* more than 4 strokes over 18 holes is *more likely* than getting more than 4 strokes on any given hole. That seems backwards... 




 Informative answer, thanks 




 The problem in question stated "a golfer has a long-term mean of 3.9 strokes per hole. What is the probability that he scores more than a 72 in an 18-hole game?"

The textbook said to solve this using Poisson and P(x4) for a mean of 3.9 - I don't think this is valid since the probability of getting more than four strokes on any given hole cannot be equated to *averaging* more than 4 strokes over the course of 18 holes, because of the Law of Large Numbers.

The problem is, when I solved P(x72) using a mean of 70.2 (3.9 times 18), it evaluated to a *greater* probability than what was in the textbook. I would have thought the Law of Large Numbers would imply a smaller probability.

Here are the relevant calculations. Can anyone tell me the error in my reasoning?

 Moribito? It's a series not a movie, but it matches the description otherwise. 




 One guy who was given an intravenous drip of DMT in an experiment in New Mexico recently estimated he was "gone" for 1,000 years. 




 Very curious. Lucid dreamers also report that it is hard to reach the moon while in a lucid state. 









 We could ask about it over on /r/yoga, but I took a look around and it doesn't seem like an esoteric sort of crowd over there. There are some instruction manuals and youtube videos floating around - and a debate between people who say "it's all a metaphor" and the tendon-cutters. Ah, religion! 




 I would hesitate to call someone a fanatic unless they are imposing their beliefs on others. It is a recognized yogic practice in India, it wasn't invented by some nut on the Internet. Those pictures of Indian gods, especially Shiva and Kali, that you see with long tongues sticking out are supposedly references to the practice. 

Apparently though, there is a reasoning behind it that goes beyond the merely spiritual: According to what I've heard, in the throat cavity there are two sensitive regions that are very similar to what is found in the genitals. "Celibate" yogis would get their tongue up in there and basically get themselves off. Bizarrely enough, this was basically the plot of that 70's porno "Deep Throat" though a tongue wasn't the instrument used...

I do not know if any of this is true and I'm not about to cut my tongue tendon to find out, though if anyone on here has done such a practice I'd love to hear from them! 




 The Pranayama crowd is pretty hard-core. Some of them even cut the tendons under their tongue so they can stuff the tongue up into their throat cavity to better conduct the Prana. And they say people who take drugs are nuts! On the other hand, there must be something to the experience if people are willing to physically mutilate themselves to get more of it. 














 He was part of the same organisation as Einstein, von Ossietzky and Kurt Tucholsky?

Those must have been some interesting fundraisers. 




 Understood. I see your point. I read his reply as "No, we don't have any evidence for a Crusade involving actual *children*, it was a misunderstanding of a real Crusade that involved *peasants*" which does in a way answer the question. 




 True, but you can look up the book and see what its sources were. He's not just making unsourced claims. 




 He did provide a reference. 









 It's been an open secret for a while that disability has become welfare for white people. I could name several people I know on disability who could certainly work if they really wanted to, but would rather sit around all day pontificating on how Obama is a Socialist giving money and "free health care" to people on welfare - as if they aren't on welfare themselves. 




 Hmm, it might be a bit of a stretch but could we consider a function with a variable arity, perhaps one that varied according to a probability distribution? 

For example, I could imagine a random walk that always changes its x and y coordinates for each step of the walk, but only changes the z coordinate when a uniform random variable on [0,1] that is calculated at each step of the walk has a value above 0.5.

Could such a walk be considered to be moving in 2.5 dimensions? If so, what would the probability be that it returns to its starting point? We know that for two dimensions it will always return, but for 3 it only returns about 34% of the time. 




 I was thinking this myself yesterday. I heard a documentary on in the background with a female narrator and I just knew it was early 80's without even seeing the video quality or hearing much about the subject matter. Turns out it was 1981. 

My completely unscientific theory is there was some leftover "hippie" intonation that sort of merged with the "polite secretary" but was then pushed out by the "valley girl" and the "local news announcer" sometime in the mid-80's. I fondly wish for the return of that old female accent but I'm not too hopeful. In fact the default female public-speaking voice seems to have become even harsher and more aloof-sounding in recent years, especially on radio commercials. 




 [Fractal dimension.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_dimension) 




 They're just the galactic hicks who haven't figured out the spin-foam stuff yet. 




 If there is a quantum component to how the brain works (which is highly speculative), then changing our brain chemistry might give us access to their realm.

PS those Tulpa people are nuts! I thought I had some crazy ideas but they take the cake! 




 We need one of those really smart people to come along and tell us how gravity works in fractal dimensions between 3 and 4... 




 Interesting. But what if gravity was 1/r^2 regardless of dimension? 




 This discussion presupposes that by "volume" it is meant some type of hyper-volume (the type changes with the dimension.) A ball in 4D has a "surface" that is a 3D volume. It still might be nonsense from a physics perspective (unless you're into String Theory) but the math is interesting. 




  Now what is the expected value for age of coin in this magic room if you pick one coin randomly?

It depends on how long this spawning process has been going on for. However, that doesn't apply to my original post because we are looking at a *ratio* of young to old universes, not the expected age of a randomly chosen universe. In the magic coin room, it's pretty clear that the ratio of "new" (1-year-old or less) coins to "old" coins will always be 1:1, and in the theory the ratio of young to old universes will always be very very large. 




 True, but chances are (if this theory is correct), that we are at the beginning of this process, not down the road. Even if our Universe will ultimately have many civilizations, chances are we're the first. I don't necessarily believe in this theory (it's pretty out there), but the lack of aliens could be seen as supporting evidence for it in a Bayesian sense. 




 Not if this particular brand of Inflation Theory is correct. It goes against the intuition though, I agree. 














 It's part of Eternal Inflation Cosmology (EIC), which states that universes are constantly bubbling into existence as part of an Eternal Big Bang. You may have heard the saying "The Big Bang never ended." That is talking about EIC.

Depending on how you set the parameters for the formulas in this theory, the rate of universe production might appear to be increasing drastically every second. 

Imagine a room that, for every person of age "x," has a million people of age "x-1." The vast majority of people in that room will be very young.

What does that have to do with the Fermi Paradox? Well, imagine that room again. Take the number of people in that room who have had time to have children of their own. The vast majority of people with children will have had only one. There are a trillion 18-year olds for every 20-year old, after all. Replace "children" with "spawned an intelligent civilization," and you have the idea. 




 This one's my favorite:

Cosmologist Alan Guth proposed a multi-verse solution to the Fermi Paradox. In this theory, using the synchronous gauge probability distribution, young universes exceedingly outnumber older ones (by a factor of e1037 for every second of age). Therefore, averaged over all universes, universes with civilizations will almost always have just one, the first to develop.

Always thinking outside the box, that guy.  




 Your description of the chakras, especially considering you had never studied that subject before, is particularly intriguing

I don't know, dude knows terms like "merkaba" yet he's never looked into chakras before? Could be, but I doubt it. Sounds like he had a real mind-blowing experience but I'd be willing to bet he had some knowledge of the classical depictions of chakras stashed somewhere in his memory banks. 




 I'm not sure, but it wouldn't surprise me. It seemed the obvious "next step" in his analysis, the fascinating thing might be to investigate why he never got there (ideology? a "scholarly" rather than a "critical" approach to mythology? maybe he was trapped in the myth himself?)

I've read some criticism of Campbell that claimed he was proto-Fascist for reducing all of human culture to the struggle of the Hero, I think that's going too far, but it could be that he was too wedded to his idea of the Monomyth to see the dialectical possibility in the Hero breaking out of it. 




 Also, both these empires relied on Arab tribes to guard their borders.  The Ghassanids and the Lakhmids, specifically. When these tribes were successfully converted to Islam, all of a sudden the gates were wide open.  




 On two occasions I did see some weird shit. 

Care to elaborate? 




 Campbell was very erudite but he consistently missed the dialectical turn that always lay just beneath the surface of the Hero's Myth: The final monster for the Hero to slay is the constrictive, neurotic-repetitive form of the Monomyth itself in which he is imprisoned. 

I was certain when watching this series for the first time that this was the "twist" waiting at the end, but Campbell either never saw it or didn't think it was suitable for public consumption. He maybe hints at it in his discussion of the Native American "twins" myth cycle (where the twins witness their own story being written by the gods and try to reject it.) 









 If you're asked to do a probability in the problem, you have to be careful. If all the outcomes in the space are listed first, then one is picked at random, the probability of that outcome is just 1/(30 C 10). *However*, if each *card* is chosen at random one by one, then things become dicier and you get a (generalized) Binomial Distribution. The outcomes with more repeats will be less likely than those with fewer. 




 No problem. These used to stump me in school too. Some texts avoid them because it is hard to construct probabilities unambiguously on multiset spaces without being very careful in how you state the problem. Their sizes are clear, but it is not always clear if all outcomes in such spaces are equally likely. 









 You don't need Excel, this is one of the simpler spaces: It is called a multiset (or a multichoose) Sometimes it is called a "stars and bars" problem because of how it is diagrammed. A multiset shows up when you are choosing with replacement (allowing duplicates), but you don't care about the order in which the choices were made (which I assume is happening here since you used the word combination.)

You can turn a multiset into a regular combination by using the formula (n + r - 1) C (r). So, n = 21 and r = 10 for your example, so the size of the sample space would be 30 C 10 = 30,045,015

If you *do* care about order then the size is just n^r, so 21^10 which is around 16.7 trillion. 




 I often encounter these terms when reading about the Middle Ages, but they never seem to be well-defined. Confusingly, monasteries often tend to be headed by abbots, but abbots are also found in abbeys. 

Are these vague terms that were used interchangeably, or did they have specific meanings in Church law, etc.? 









 The claim is you can't read in your dreams (or if you can the text changes) because the part of your brain that controls reading is "still asleep" during a dream. I don't know of any scientific evidence to back this up and I've found it not to be true for me.

That having been said, many people *do* experience changing or unreadable text, and use it as a good reality check. 









 I don't think that, you misunderstood my comment. I said that line of reasoning does not make sense. 




 I never did understand that line of reasoning. If the brain creates or even mediates consciousness, and consciousness causes the wavefunction collapse, giving rise to "classical" reality, then what collapsed the classical systems in the brain that allowed this process in the first place?

These views seem to try to split the difference between science and mysticism and end up making a mess of both. 









 *Sunyata* is a term in Buddhism that is often translated as "emptiness" or "void." But as with most translations, it leaves something to be desired. *Sunyata* is like the emptiness of a cup, not the emptiness of "nothingness." The air or water inside the cup is not part of the cup itself, yet, without it, the cup would cease to be a cup. That is, the cup's very identity as a cup depends on some part of itself being not-cup. 

If we reflect on it, the same is true of ourselves. If you are not willing to change yourself, if you are not open to growth or new experiences, then you might as well be a pre-programmed computer or robot. Anyone who actually attains an eternal, unchanging self (*atta*), immediately ceases to be a self at all, and becomes an object with no more life in them than a rock has. 

Therefore our continuation as subjects is dependent on being open and receptive to non-self, to a willingness to incorporate that which is non-self into our identities (using discernment of course.)

Sometimes for these reasons you will see *sunyata* translated as "receptivity" instead of "emptiness." My feeling is it's somewhere in-between these two concepts.  




 All good points. I've heard of Assagioli in passing but have not read his work.  




 (yet Reich was out of the mainstream both among Freudians and Marxists)

That's an understatement. Reich would be classified as "New Age" if he were alive today. In fact his works are still popular in New Age circles, whereas both Freudian and Marxist thinkers tend to dismiss them. Reich was sort of a latter-day Jung with even more of a mystical bent, but the US government found him threatening enough that he was actually imprisoned and died in jail. 
























 Maybe you have someone on witness protection living on your block - or a crime boss looking for a "nice, quiet retirement." You never know... 




 A possible explanation comes to mind - they could be kids doing one of those all-day fasts for charity/hunger awareness and the pizza shop agreed to feed them at Midnight. I would expect getting through that last half hour could be pretty intense and there probably wouldn't be that much socializing going on. 




 It sounds like you stumbled upon the end of a police surveillance shift. 
 




 That's because it's a mix of "traditional" Buddhism, the native Bon religion, and Tantrism. Whether this mix is a higher form, just a different vehicle, or a degeneration of the original teaching is very much in the eye of the beholder.

 




 Chakras aren't discussed in *Therevada* Buddhism. Tibetan Buddhism, they're all over the place. 




 Done. 




 If/when I am able, that is the plan. But if someone with more access to the stuff wants to try first, I will supply the number, keep the key primes private, and wait to see what response comes back. 




 I was inspired by a skeptic who was contacted by a woman who claimed to be in contact with intelligent supercomputers from the future. The skeptic told the woman to ask these supercomputers to factor a large random integer. Of course "they" couldn't do it and she was cured of her delusion.

So my ambition would be to convince someone to go on a DMT trip - or to go on one myself- armed with a large random integer and ask any "intelligences" they meet to factor it. 

Any takers? 









 Universes that appear to be undergoing a singularity state change from the inside (quickly, from rare to saturated intelligence) are being run in order to generate shared concepts, used to communicate with peers.

I think there might be something to this. Of course one would expect technological change to accelerate over time, but the rate of acceleration we've been experiencing lately seems somehow "unnatural" to me. If the rumors going around about reactionless drives and successful LENR (cold fusion) prototypes actually pan out, that will reinforce my suspicions.  




 [It's in Chapter 2 of his book](http://www.homeschoolnewslink.com/homeschool/columnists/gatto/lesssch.shtml)

Thats an ancient Egyptian idea symbolized by the pyramid with an eye on top thats on the other side of George Washington on our one-dollar bill. Everyone is a stone defined by position on the pyramid. This theory has been presented in many different ways, but at bottom, it signals the world view of minds obsessed by dominance and strategies of intervention to maintain that dominance.

 




 I get the nagging sense when watching the Simpsons that Bart is somehow smarter than Lisa, he's just hiding it, playing a game with life for some reason or another. I can't point to any specific scenes that would "prove" this theory, or if it's anything intentional that the writers put in the show.

I'm wondering if anyone else ever got the same hunch and can flesh out this idea a little bit more... 




 The giant white pyramid in Tibet I swallowed, but I stopped watching when he claimed the average temperature during the Ice Age was 50 degrees below zero.  




 The actual doctrine is "anatta" which is usually (mis)-translated as "no-self." The Vedic concept of the "atta" is very different from the modern Western ideas about a "self." The atta was said to be eternal, unchanging, and identical with the Universal Principle (Brahman).

This is the "self" that the Buddha demolished philosophically, not the idea of a changing, growing, interconnected self.

If you think about it, an unchanging self isn't a subject at all, but an object. It is those who believe in an atta who have to ask "for whom is this done?" since there is no way to change the atta. Buddhism can answer - it is done out of compassion for our future selves as well as other beings. 




 What was the book about? I sometimes get this with music and it doesn't seem to be any song I remembered hearing while awake. It is mostly Classical music and I don't listen to much of that (while awake anyway.) 




 On the contrary, I think this is great for beginners. Buddhism can seem so gloomy with the "all is suffering" aspect to the teaching that it turns so many people off to the practice.  














 I just read that cosmic "ray" is a misnomer and they are not photons - my mistake!  




  nuclear gamma rays we observed at 10^7 eV or astrophysical gamma rays that we observed at 10^13 eV would, to this cosmic ray, have energies of over 10^18 or 10^24 eV, respectively.

It seems like here you are describing things from the point of view of the cosmic ray. 




 Over on the "what came before the Big Bang?" thread, it was stated that photons don't have a frame of reference and can't be said to "observe" (measure) anything. I take it you disagree with this? 



















 Perhaps he should have phrased the question "Is the spacetime created by the Big Bang part of a larger system." 




  I got to the part where the theory is that each bubble universe could have radically different physical laws, and my reaction was like this:

Wow that's really cool ......... wait....... why? ...........

Even beyond that, there must be some super-set of laws that governs the eternal inflation itself. And from there one could speculate about an ensemble of super-multiverses where the inflation laws worked differently. 




 Can photons have a point of view? That is, can they make a measurement in the quantum-mechanical sense?  














 Good point... I covered it up.  




 There are a number of theories. One is that it externalizes/structures the fear of the audience (mostly teenagers) of being caught and punished for what many of them are planning to do after the movie. In that case it is not so much trying to promote conservative values as it is simply reflecting them to increase the fear/enjoyment of the audience. 




 Uh, I doubt that Hollywood has killed every character who ever said "God dammit." On the other hand, that punishing disbelief thing is very real though you're not the first to notice it. Part of it is just the convention of telling a good story - it's hard to make a good ghost story where the ghost turns out to be a hoax*, so of course the disbelievers in a horror movie will end up looking like idiots, but part of it is indeed playing to the desire the audience has for the paranormal/supernatural to indeed be real.

Critics have also long noted that supposedly "liberal" Hollywood movies also tend to punish people who have unconventional, kinky, underage or casual sex, especially in the horror genre. Say "God dammit" and you're probably safe, but be a teen having sex in a horror movie, you're screwed.

 I know for sure one of the gang days was October 30 of that year, but I'm not sure if they go that day every year.

Well, that explains my odd experience at Six Flags on Halloween. It gradually dawned on us that the "Zombie" blocking the line was a crackhead, not an employee in costume... also my gf at the time bought one of those velcro monkeys and someone stole it from around her neck. 




 I've come across this guy's blog several times. Either I'm not educated enough to understand what he's talking about or he writes very incoherent blog posts on everything from black holes to psychology. He's obviously trying to say something about the Qualia debate here but beyond that I can't make sense of it. 




 There are, I just went with the print version. 









 I don't know much about the history of that area except for the Acadians who were Catholic. You might want to ask a local historian about any weird religious groups or cults that might have existed in your area. 




 It reminds me of the Byzantine Empire and the riots of the Greens vs. the Blues in the Hippodrome. I think eventually something similar did happen there - the Emperor banned chariot races and turned the Hippodrome into a Monastery.  




 Is that exactly how the problem was stated to you? Because I can't make much sense out of it. It looks like a Combinatorial problem, those sometimes have special cases for n=1. 




  Also, it says alcohol prohibits lucid dreaming but i've had plenty of them after a night of heavily drinking, (some of my longest ones also) I think this misconception needs to be addressed. 

Same here. Once I was drunk in the dream too and at a bar (that was interesting.) The bartender offered me a drink and I told him no, I'd had enough when I was awake! 









 Names were things like Guy, and Girl, and no these weren't infants, though many were children or in their early teens, sometimes whole families.

That reminds me of something I once heard or read that there were certain schismatic Anabaptist groups that went out into the backwoods - if you were in one of these groups, you wouldn't get a "Christian" name until you were formally baptized into the church, and even some adults were not given that privilege (perhaps they had misbehaved or offended the church leaders), so they were just called "man" or something like that for their entire lives. 

On the other hand, an Anabaptist church probably wouldn't have an organ. Where was this church located? 




 'speedtrap hill'... At the bottom of the hill was a rather large pond that some of my naughtier friends and I used to smoke weed at pretty regularily. 

Ghost deer aside, that might not have been the best place to smoke weed. 




 Thanks, great reply. Are you a lawyer? 




 I've gotten used to it at those places too, but for the first time today I got the same question at a convenience store. I wasn't actually buying gum but pretty close. 




 And Gatto is a crank who believes the Illuminati put secret messages in the dollar bill. The enemy of your enemy is not always your friend - especially if he's crazy. 




 I'm sure this has something to do with customer tracking, wanting to spam me, etc., but is this really so lucrative that companies tolerate slowing down their lines and pissing off their customers like this?  




 All true, my skepticism was over whether or not this was a conscious choice (in the US at least) to lower long-term wealth in exchange for present-day power monopolies. It is more likely that the "plutocrats" simply subscribe to a feel-good ideology that believes the measures you mention *promote* long-term growth (even though they don't.)

African dictatorships, whole 'nother story... 




 I'm skeptical of that - I don't think "they" are that self-aware and have any definite agenda of that magnitude. 




 But the pie doesn't grow as fast, or at all, so over the long run even they lose out. 









 I was trying to read The Hobbit...it was around midnight when someone knocked 3 times on the front door.

That would have been Gandalf. You missed out on quite the adventure. 




 I still think stuff like "Yea we should totaly do that" in my head when I'm thinking of something I should do ALONE.

Sort of embarrassing but I started doing that Freshman year of college when I was having a tough time socially. The "we" was me and one of my friends from HS who had gone to a different college. I don't know why I picked him probably because he was the most laid-back of my HS friends so he was a good imaginary companion. The weird thing is I talked to the real friend online but never told him I made an imaginary version of him to keep me company... I think that might have ended the real friendship pretty quick.

Anyway now years later I still say "we have to go shopping" to myself but I'm not thinking specifically of that friend anymore, it's just a generalized "we" made up of all the different aspects of myself. 




 Elsewhere on this thread which has unexpectedly turned quite creepy a few people mentioned such things might be imaginary friends who *became real* (aka [tulpas](http://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/) ). That is somehow more creepy than ghosts in my book. That link by the way goes to a sub full of people who actually want to create these things. 




 Yep. It was within two minutes of 6:30. I think I encountered my inner body clock or something! 




 Story please?? 




 I was leaving a regular, non-lucid dream when I suddenly became lucid. I was hovering above an "overview" timeline of the next morning and saw a graphical "menu" of three "exit" times when I could wake up: Noon, 8 AM and 6:30 AM. I chose the earliest time, and, sure enough, woke up at 6:30. 

Not the most exciting lucid dream ever, but I thought it was interesting enough to share. 




 It depends who the host is. Since they went to the rotating hosts, some are much more political than others. Basically the political spectrum on that show now spans from "Obama is evil" to "Obama is evil, but so was Bush."

Edit: If you go to Art Bell's Facebook it says "I wish my name was no longer associated with what Coast has become!" As an avid (if skeptical) fan of the show back when I was a kid, I couldn't agree more. 














 60 is a good number for measuring time because it has a lot of factors: 2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30 - and thus a lot of ways to divide it without remainder.

Same with 24... 




 No, your math is right. Paradoxes like this one form part of the philosophical argument against Actual Infinities. 




 After all, a de facto government agency cant serve only one small group of people. 

Somewhere a DoD procurement officer is laughing... 




 There would be a shortage in the consumer markets before the government (especially the military) felt any real shortage. At least in the US the government controls huge energy stockpiles. My guess is these would be used to build the nuclear plants, along with strict consumer rationing. This isn't too different from the situation in WWII. 




 If they were working trades I would be all for it, but that's not what they're doing. They are going to McDonald's and Wal-Mart. 




 It's a bad idea because they aren't getting any job experience that would integrate with a high school education. They're doing jobs that someone with a 5th grade education or less could do. The fact that they're getting HS credit for this is ludicrous. 




 The school let him leave at lunch his jr and sr years so he could work.

Funny, that is now the hot trend in education again. Our Juniors and Seniors get three class credits for "job training" at the local fast food places and Wal-Mart. They can leave school at lunch. Needless to say this program is quite popular. Our district has even won awards for its "progressive" "apprenticeship" program. Of course it is all nonsense. Sometimes these students get fired and the employer forgets to tell the school and the kids just go home at lunch or hang out on the streets. 




 Things get done in a hurry when people are desperate. Almost overnight (really like five months), a whole Depression's worth of closed factories were turned into massive arms production centers for WWII. Granted, the tech of a nuclear power plant is more complicated than a bomber assembly line, but don't count civilization out just because it (always) needs a crisis to get its ass in gear. 









 he didnt have any Jesuits found in his basement

Might that have just been good luck on his part though? What do you make of the theory that Shakespeare was a closet Catholic? 














 Was it available at one point outside the US and then taken away? Or did they just never have it outside the US? Sounds stupid either way! I fail to see why businesses deliberately antagonize their customers like this. 




 This was seven months ago, the instant queue is still there - I think it's safe to say this idea went nowhere. 




 Check out info about the Ajna or Third Eye - lots of mysticism to sort through, but perhaps some useful data as well. 




 Me too, except my mom is more a believer in that stuff than I am! 




 Any sources on the more obscure items? This reminds me of the "Tales of the Weird" booklets they used to sell at supermarket checkout counters. A lot of the "tales" were misreported or just plain made up. 














 How do people pay for stuff there? Barter? Or do most people still live off the land? 







































 eh, not really - very heavy tourist traffic there in the summer. Abbie Hoffman is famous for hiding out in the 1000 islands, but he actually lived in a resort town under a fake name, not on some shack on a deserted island. 

However, head north into Canadian lake country from the St. Lawrence, that's a different story. Plenty of Unabomber shack possibilities up there. Just sayin'. 














 Unless black holes are producing new Universes, then it is reproducing (though in a boringly asexual manner)

 His great unfinished work was planned for a premiere at the base of the Himalayas. Scriabin believed it would cause an apocalyptic transformation in the nature of the universe and give rise to a race of spiritual hermaphrodites. 




 He also created a quartet for helicopters and an enormously long allegorical play that was supposed to represent the days of the week. One scene for "Thursday" involved a man dressed as a pencil shoved inside a giant pencil sharpener.

One weird dude. Scriabin was even stranger. 




 Sounds like an Indian Caligula - what was his name? 














 An individual doesn't need to recognise something as being an adaptive mechanism for it to indeed be such.

True, but if you *tell* him it's just an adaptive mechanism, he's likely to disagree vehemently. My point was there is a conflict between religion and science *on this level*. Other than that I think we agree. 




 That is correct - or they thought they were just giving the right to traverse the land or for whites to settle in the area but who would still be subject to the native chiefdom. A lot of treaty wars started with these kinds of misunderstandings. 

Of course a lot of the time they were *deliberate* misunderstandings, on both sides. Tribe X would sell land that had been occupied by Tribe Y for years, and Y didn't know anything about it. The white settlers knew Tribe Y lived in the area, but they just wanted a legal fig leaf to conquer the area. All of a sudden white settlers show up and begin kicking the members of Tribe Y out of the territory. 




 Seriously, their last emperor had an entire city slaughtered because their king would not give him a tree that would not even survive in Tenochtitlan's climate. They took the tree and it died.

Do you have more info about this incident? Seems like the king refused to give a symbolic tribute. It seems hard to believe that the Aztec emperor really cared about a single tree if there wasn't some symbolism attached to it. 




 Calvinism   Predestination was always a very small minority belief within Christianity. Very few Christians were Calvinists even at its height and it has virtually died out today. Even churches that are still officially Calvinist (like Presbyterians and Dutch Reformed) do not promote the belief (sort of like modern Mormons and the whole Kolob thing...) 




 otherwise the human race would be full of good looking people by now. Obviously this person doesn't go to walmart very often.

All in all, saying that darwinian evolution worldview cannot align with a religious worldview demonstrates a lack of understanding of evolution and a lack of understanding of religion.

Maybe, but religion considers itself true, not just useful. There is a conflict on that level. Very few people follow a religion just because they think it is a socially convenient myth. I've only met one person like this in my entire life, and he was a very creepy and manipulative psychiatrist at a "Christian" hospital. 




 Social Darwinism used race as a virtual synonym for species, which it clearly is not - human races are 100% inter-fertile. 

Similarly, Social Darwinism argued for a political authority that would wield a kind of "artificial selection" that could replace and "hurry up" the process of natural selection, and used dog breeding as an example. 

The problem with this was dog breeding took hundreds of years on an animal with a much shorter generational cycle than humans, and actually increased the diversity of dogs - it did not lead to one breed of "Master Dog" the way many Social Darwinists wanted to (re)-create the "Master Race."

So not only was there moral horror from Scientific Darwinists against Social Darwinism, there was scientific outrage as well, since Social Darwinism was the crudest form of pseudoscience used to advance political ends. 




 You might want to look into the Catholic answer to this question. Catholic dogma today accepts evolution but suggests that during some point in the process of Evolution God gave the developing man and woman a soul, and this was Adam and Eve.

I personally don't believe in this, but it is an example of a belief that attempts to reconcile Darwin and the Bible. 




 First, the theory of evolution makes soul-body dualism hard to conceive of, which in turn poses significant problems for explaining how the afterlife is supposed to work. 

I know this is picky, but orthodox Christians don't believe in soul-body dualism, they believe in a bodily resurrection on Earth, not body-less souls floating around heaven, despite the popular "folk Christian" idea that this what the afterlife is like. 


































 Nope, but it was similar. Younger presenter, still in HS. In some of the videos she is a Freshman in college. I think they are pretty recent. 




 Nope, it was a lot more professionally done, with a theme song, much higher rez video, and a lot longer. 




 It's one of the funniest things I've ever seen on YouTube - I want to show it to some friends but I can't remember what her name was. It was part of a series, she does makeup advice, study skills, etc. too (those obviously aren't as funny.) 



















 Quite creative, you should turn this into a short story or novel!

 And yet, some of us have multiple pieces of Bill the Cat merchandise. I don't know if that counts as a success or a failure... 




 Whichever one was assigned to the file to begin with. Let's assume I open iTunes and load song "foo" with ID number 12345. A line appears in iTunes called "foo," and behind the scenes, iTunes knows that when I click on that line, it opens file 12345. 

I could then re-name the file "foo2" and move it to a different folder. It doesn't matter, all that does is change where *I* see the file. To iTunes it's still 12345 and it's still stored in the same place on the disk. 




 At that stage of development humans are totally obsolete. I'm talking about the intermediate stage where people who can't attain a very high level of skill are shut out of full-time labor markets. 




 They will probably try to find some niche that has not yet been automated, probably in personal services or some other kind of face-to-face interaction, or in making creative content for the internet. "odd jobs" like this might not provide a full-time income, but I can see people pursuing stuff like this in the future in order to get the extra stuff they might want. There will still be economic incentives, but no longer will there be economic devastation for those shut out of regular labor markets. 




 So are you saying that things could have been designed this way, but now it's too late because of the assumptions that programmers make about how files are stored?  




 What I was thinking was a system that gave each file a unique ID number, and *that's* what iTunes would look up. Putting it in a different folder would only change how it appears in the user interface, not where it actually is on the disk for iTunes to load. Same with changing the name of a file. It seems like it would be so simple. 









 I think most people will always want something "extra" - nicer apartment, newest video game system, etc. that will encourage work. 




 Give the poor just enough so they don't starve/riot is not socialism. It's just warehousing and we do a lot of that already.

 Is there such a concept as malemployment in economics as there is with malinvestment? That is, reducing UI might lead to a lower unemployment rate but a higher malemployment rate - people working in jobs that are not close to the economic optimum because they feel forced to take the first thing that comes along. 

Underemployment doesn't quite get at what I'm thinking about here because someone could be underemployed just because there are no jobs equal to his or her level of training, whereas malemployment would be more of a search problem for those jobs that do exist. The difference between the two would sort of be like the difference between a liquidity and a solvency problem at a bank. 




 And the UK hopes no one finds out the reason Iran turned into such a freak was because he and the US teamed up and stole all his stuff in Middle School. 




 If OBE's represent physically real phenomena, they should be relatively easy to test. Just put some random objects in a locked room and have someone who is out-of-body float over and take a look at them. Very simple and very scientific. Monroe claimed to have a technology that could reliably produce OBE's.

However, he seemed far more interested in cataloging scads of "other realms" and altered states which he numbered like Focus 1-100 and encounters with alien beings that were completely unverifiable. It is interesting stuff and might very well represent real *inner* experiences (that is, I don't think Monroe was just making stuff up - he was a wealthy man before starting his paranormal research), but he was not a proper scientist.  




 Yikes, I would not call Monroe scientific. He's good reading though - a modern Swedenborg.  




 It took me two whole years to make good friends at college, but once I did I made two lifelong friends that I would not give up for anything. Keep your head up and don't give up - your college friends are out there, you will find them if you stay true to yourself. 




 I beg to differ. I liked the future tech tree and the space/sea expansion - added a whole new dimension to the civ experience. I wasted much time in college with CTP. 




 Don't do what, kill yourself or get married?? 




 If you really are contemplating suicide, please seek help. Killing yourself at 25 because of relationship issues is not the right solution - trust me, I've been there and at the same age too. Several years later I am now married (though no kids yet!) - so keep your head up, it does get better!! 




 Or the bathroom was where the bomb was hidden. Alert /r/conspiracy  




 Lovely sentiments, until you realize that Rutherford is a pro-privatization outfit that helped to fund "Waiting for Superman." 




 Good points. I would say that this willingness to "go under" is what stays out of the cycling and is the part that is done with the cycles. 




 Nietzsche would probably be horrified at the "dialectical" interpretation that you just gave his work, but that's not a bad place to start. However the bermensch is in some sense "done with" that cycling you describe (although it continues in a transformed way under his gaze.)

 




 Happy birthday thanks for getting me hooked on Italian rap music. 









 The two are not mutually exclusive. There were many occult-oriented Christians in the Nazi Party, and yes there were some outright pagans too. Himmler and Hesse to name the two most prominent. Himmler advised his SS officers to have sex in graveyards so their wives would give birth to the reincarnated souls of German warriors. I don't remember reading that in the Bible. 




 You might want to edit out the cat in the SS uniform before putting this on your slideshow... 




 What's that green area? The Aldi Neutral Zone? 




 Ok, I will attempt a real answer: That looks like reflex tearing, which can be a sign of dehydration. However, I have no idea why he'd be that dehydrated *before* the game even started. That would be really dangerous for an athlete.  




 Consider the fact that you might be feeling the same way had you made the opposite choices. The other woman might annoy you also. The safe job might make you feel bored and wish that you'd followed your passion instead. None of this is the end of the world or the end of your life - believe me, I've made some *terrible* choices in my life too - you can recover. 

But... you can't be wishy-washy. Either commit to the woman you're with now or get out of the relationship. Either commit to grad school and being poor for a while or get into the family business now before you have family responsibilities of your own. 




 Haha, yeah, that's the step where I'm stuck too. 









 how'd this guy even get elected?

Six-way race - anything can happen! 22-way California governor recall election resulted in Governor Schwarzenegger. Jesse Ventura and Al Franken getting elected to high office, just blame that on Minnesota being weird (though Franken has turned out to be an excellent Senator.)
 




 I agree - I am going to change how I present this in class this year and ditch the "two daughters" stuff. 









 Most great killers are also great romantics. Stalin wrote love poetry, as did Mao. 



















 It does more than "stink," it will strangle the economy in the long run. Health care doesn't work as a market because prices are opaque, there is no time for price discovery anyway in an emergency, demand is almost completely inelastic, and there are no substitute goods (can't buy anything else if you're dead or incapacitated.) 

If Obamacare fails companies are going to push more healthcare costs on to their workers or drop plans altogether, and then you really will see perceived disposable income start to fall, since most will consider health insurance a necessity. Consumer demand will take a big hit and the economy will suffer further. 




 True but to someone who doesn't know the technical economic definition of "capital," it does sound Orwellian. 




 I suppose the question then is are these health-care plans worth the money the insurance companies are charging employers? Wages are fungible, health care plans are not. 

Even if a worker is being "compensated" more that he realizes with a health-care plan, how much of the value of that plan ever flows to the worker, and how much is captured in excess profits by the medical industry which benefits from endemic market failure in the health care sector? 




 In the introduction to de Voto's "The Course of Empire," there is a very strange and poetic paragraph about the Age of Exploration attributed to an "Emery Heywood." I figured he was a writer or a historian and his writing style was so unique I decided to look him up to see what else he wrote. I can find no trace of any writer or historian by that name on the Internet. 

Does anyone here know who this person was and what his (or her?) connection to de Voto was? I am quite curious now... 









 Read "Before the Storm" excellent book about Goldwater - he enticed Southern evangelicals into voting Republican by opposing Civil Rights in the 60's. Later, he regretted what he had done and even began to call himself a liberal - but it was too late. 





























 True, but not all creative train wrecks are so bizarre. I could see a "postmodern" Cop Rock where half the show was behind-the-scenes "reality" footage being strangely entertaining.

Plus, Broadway spinoff... 









 Cop Rock lasted eleven episodes before it was yanked for good in December 1990and it went out in its own inimitably weird metatextual style, with everyone breaking characterI cant believe they cancelled us, one cop says. Yeah, I know, I only got to sing one song, another respondsand crewmembers coming out from behind the scenes to join the cast in one final number.

Please, please, bring this show back. They're re-making Ironside so why not?? 
























 You can respond, you just can't vote on them I think. 




 Going through all the old threads I saved and never had time to read

 That's like just your opinion maaaaaaaan 




 Since OP has disappeared, I assume one is the UK. There are now govt-subsidized mortgages around 1% there now. They're basically paying you to buy a house. 














  we know a person will become unable to function after ~48 hrs of wakefulness

How is this changed by drugs like Provigil, which (supposedly) allow you to stay awake for five days with normal functioning? 









 Haha, this is uplifting news, no wishing death on the elderly. 




 If you look at the age breakdown you'll see why. It's 96% among people under 30. 














 Interesting your experience was so different from mine. Probably because I was not really looking at the face at all - I usually looked down so as to better concentrate on what was being said - to me looking at the face was distracting! 




 Believe me, people notice, they just don't say anything. I was in college before I knew that I didn't do this. My roommate was the kind of blunt person who would point out stuff like that, but afterwards when I asked other people they confirmed that I didn't make eye contact, they just never mentioned it, assuming I was shy or whatever, but honestly I'm not that shy it's just not something I ever thought to do. 




 There were a few groups that split off from Catholicism sooner than the Lutherans, but most were crushed militarily. A few are still around. The Lutherans were the first major group to split off from the Catholic church and not get largely killed off. 




 And what about monkey butlers? Inquiring minds want to know... 









 Low-status groups tend to be more aware of honor/respect issues than high-status ones, at least in my (modern) experience, just as someone with food insecurity is going to worry a lot more about the state of their fridge than someone who can just go to a restaurant if it breaks down. 

Obviously in feudal times things were different and no I am not suggesting that all blacks are low-status, but there is a correlation. 





























 Yep, that's the big mystery. I would guess that mysterious exiles from neighboring societies would sometimes wander in. Sometimes they might have been seen as divine emissaries.  




 What is the difference between love and attachment in your opinion? 




 Very good point, thank you. 




 What do you think it means? 




 Very insightful, thank you! 




 I mostly agree. I do think there is an element of enclosure to the self, but it's not absolute - and that trying to make it absolute does cause a lot of (unnecessary) suffering. 




 Wow, awesome quote. I've never heard that one before thanks 




 Not so sure it's arbitrary. At least with the specific example you refer to (xenia), the Greek religion believed gods would travel disguised as humans, rewarding good hosts and punishing bad ones. 

Of course this reflected/reinforced an underlying cultural attitude, but I don't think that just comes out of nowhere. Caring for a guest can be expensive, not to mention possibly dangerous. There must have been reasons why such customs arose despite these costs. 




  Not treating travelers well has been considered a very bad thing in a lot of older cultures because if you were unwelcoming to travelers, you may very well be sentencing them to death. 

And because those travelers might have an army somewhere behind them! Mistreatment of merchants and diplomats sometimes got you a visit from Genghis Khan. 




 They are not registered anywhere, so we are assuming money is an appropriate gift. Thanks for the tips. 




 I don't believe in a "solid" self (atta), however I am not willing to give up the notion of a changeable, open-to-the-world self, even if suffering results. I agree totally with your last paragraph, very well put. 




 Al-Jazeera is not owned by oil companies, though it is supported by an oil-producing state. You could say the same thing then about Fox News Saudi ownership.

 I've always liked what Al Gore said more than how he said it - he's always had a tin ear towards looking hypocritical or like a preachy high school principal. 




 No kidding. This is the first time I can ever remember it, in fact. Usually they just quietly fold when a better money-making scheme comes around, like Moral Majority and the Christian Coalition did. 




 I thought it was a dramatized portrayal, not a documentary. I have not seen it but I might go this weekend. 




 He said he'd go back to Sweden (not Switzerland), if they agreed not to extradite him to the US. They refused. One of the women making the accusations against him has known CIA connections. He is not even being charged with rape but with some other weird sort of sexual offense that doesn't even exist in most countries. Both women admit that they slept with him voluntarily. 




 I think that's a good approach but I'm not sure it's one a lot of Buddhists share - there is this idea that Nirvana is the end of *all* emotion, indeed all sensate experience period, and the release into some totally unfathomable realm. 




 Yeah, I've thought of that - NOT that I am claiming to be a bodhisattva!

I always thought the compassion and non-attachment sides of Buddhism were in conflict with each other. Compassion seems to all be about caring for others, and non-attachment seems to be about withdrawing from the world, including others.

Maybe it's a creative tension though. I can see how compassion can get people past their self-attachment, but that makes compassion instrumental (i.e. "I am only trying to feel for you in order to ease my own suffering"), and I'm not really comfortable with that.

But I am only a Level 1 Laser Lotus so I'm sure your insight is far more advanced! 




 I don't necessarily believe in some of the "mystical" aspects of Buddhism (cosmic Buddhas, reincarnation, siddhis, etc.), but I've been influenced by Buddhist philosophy since I was a young teenager. I meditate and admire Buddhist leaders and speakers. 

However I've never called myself a Buddhist or even a "secular Buddhist" and recently I've realized my main "block" to the tradition is that I'm ok with suffering. If that's the price for loving the world and trying to build a self, I can accept that. To eliminate suffering by giving up that attachment to life seems like a bad deal to me.

Anyone else feel the same way? 




 I don't think that actually goes on a lot in the US. It is so easy to destroy someone's character image or reputation, you don't need to be blatant about it and actually kill them (see: Assange, others.) JFK himself is a different story since he had real power to change things, but I doubt any witnesses to the assassination were themselves assassinated. In any large group of people there will be strange deaths.

Extreme Republicans got themselves worked up thinking Hillary Clinton was offing dozens of people to cover up her shady real estate deals by basically going through the list of everyone she knew. Guess what? Some of them had died in weird ways... that doesn't mean she killed them, it means she was a politician who knew a ton of people. 




 No good. I'm sure that symbolizes loneliness. 




 I'm not so sure about that. That statement was made before she got a 4-6 year prison sentence. Her family believes it was suicide and she told a friend she would rather die than go back to jail. I would not be surprised if some compromised politician did her in, but the evidence does point to suicide. 




 It is one Japanese and an American ex-resident of Japan. Since the wedding doesn't appear to be involving any of the American's religious traditions, my sense is the Japanese side is going to predominate. A lot of people have said the even number of bills thing, which makes more sense - I think that's where the divisible by four nonsense got started. 

Thanks for the advice! 




 Good point... $150 it is then. 




 Action-movie music in the background was laughable - still interested in seeing it though I will wait for the reviews. 




 Don't panic. This happened to me when the landlord lost the check then I went on vacation so I didn't get the late payment notice (they never bothered to call.) Since the rent has now been paid, there's no basis for the summons and it should be cancelled. The landlord has to call the court - and they will - if the landlord lets a case come before a judge when the issue has been resolved that is going to be one upset judge - he or she might even fine the landlord. 




 Beautiful, I feel the exact same way a lot of the time. I'm beginning to realize that I've had a lot of pain in my life, but I wouldn't trade the rawness you get from that pain for anything, it's made me who I am today. 









 Maybe someday. Since most members of Westboro are actually just the lead guy's family, it would probably take an epic family feud. If you leave his church you are cut off from all your family members as well. 




 There is not a charge for the reception. I guess I should have mentioned the wedding is going to be in the US, so some US and some Japanese traditions mixed, probably. $300 is a lot considering we are already spending about that much on travel. Thanks for the advice though. 




 Very good points, but there are examples of knights, or armies led by knights, suppressing peasant revolts in the Middle Ages. I can think of several in England and Germany. I guess you might defend that as a time when feudalism was breaking down - they all did occur in the Late Middle Ages, 1300- 1550 from what I can remember. 




  Sounds like "horsepucky" as my mom would say.. I don't think giving them $100 or $150 would be horribly offensive to their culture - but I thought I'd ask here just to make sure. 














 Online phone directories today are really powerful. They'll often not only give you multiple phone numbers for that person, but their address and (this shocked me when I used one the other day), people who they are associated with (don't know how the phone company gets that information, but whatever). Give it a shot. 




 Same here, just posted about the same thing. Keep your head up, I know how it feels. 




 Are you sure it wasn't a coyote? They make all kinds of weird sounds. 
























 This should be for real life not just reddit 




 How long ago was this? In the past few years devices have been invented that are basically lasers for sound - they can direct sound at a particular target without anyone else around hearing it. Someone could have been pulling a prank on you. 




 What about Penguin? Wasn't he a demented aristocrat? 




 He's arrested a lot of the top generals and literally all of the admirals. Unless there are colonels willing to act independently, he probably doesn't have much to fear from the military.

On the other hand, colonel-led coups are not unknown in history... 




 It's like he actually wants to spur a revolution.

That might be exactly what he's doing. If he really does want to consolidate power, the chaos of a revolutionary situation might be his best bet. Of course, if you lose that bet you lose the country, but he might be willing to roll the dice. 




 I did not realize the Chinese had troops garrisoned in North Vietnam. How did the alliance go sour so fast that by 1979 they were at war? 




 I will check it out thanks for the links 




 I don't think NATO ever stopped fearing a Soviet invasion, right up until the fall of the Soviet Union. Also, I don't think it was ever proven that the more extreme actions of some Gladio groups were directed by NATO, or part of a coherent NATO strategy to undermine native communism in Western Europe. Most historians believe that a few of these groups decided to take matters into their own hands, or that Gladio recruited extreme rightists thinking they would follow orders, and they didn't. 




 I would distinguish between a honeypot and something like Gladio. A honeypot is a government agent or false group that poses as an extremist leader or oganization to attract followers, then the whole group is rounded up, since of course the leader knows who everyone is, etc. 

Gladio was a covert stay-behind guerrilla force set up by NATO in preparation for a possible Soviet invasion. Unfortunately the kind of folks who are eager to join covert stay-behind guerrilla forces are not always the best-disciplined people on the planet, and several Gladio units started freelancing in organized crime and extreme right-wing activities, most notably in Italy and Turkey. 









 Personally I believe the EDL and Anjem Choudhry are both state honeypots to attract extremists.

I'd say that's crazy, but then I remember Hal Turner here in the US (Nazi radio host who was really working for the FBI), so who knows... 




 Or maybe Yaxley-Lennon just doesn't seem fascist enough... 




 I think that just means he is a gold member, not that he got gold for that particular post. 





























 Guilt about spending too much time on the Internet (created worlds) instead of with your girlfriend? Or maybe you are afraid of her mom? Just a guess. Sometimes dreams are just random and don't really mean anything, even intense ones.

 What are some that are still a mystery? I thought these had pretty much all been debunked or shown to be hoaxes.  









 I think he wasn't as drunk this time 




 Interesting. What did the professor think was going on with the phenomenon? 









 I realize this is a very broad question, but I've seen some pretty out-there claims being accepted uncritically by the media recently. Of course, tech breakthroughs do happen from time to time, so I'm not convinced these devices are scams either. I would like to know what a group of people inclined to be skeptical about extraordinary claims thinks about this issue. 




 Metaphysics simply means the search for a reason behind the laws of physics as they exist, it doesn't mean channelings and crystal healings. 

If you posit rules, you still haven't reached an absolute nothingness. You still have to explain why those rules and not others, or no rules at all. 




 No time, no space, but there is a rule set. That's not a metaphysical "nothing," which would not imply a rule set. 









 "Nothing" turns out to be "Quantum Foam" with the laws of Quantum Mechanics already built in. Not exactly "nothing" in the philosophical sense. Quite disappointing. I would recommend "Why Does the World Exist?" as an alternative although it gets sort of wooly too at the end.

 Unless you plan on living hundreds of trillions of years, apparently the answer is no. 









 I had a good experience, but I didn't come away feeling like I'd gone to the spirit world or anything. I will say that it's worth the money.

Interesting. You always hear about the breakthrough trips but I'd imagine there are a lot of people like you out there as well. What was your experience like and why do you think it was still worth the money even if it wasn't "as advertised"? (I'm thinking of going next summer...) 



















 sorry about that 




 So they make you *do* crazy shit, not just *see* crazy shit? Yeah, no thanks, that's not what I'm after. 














 Someone who is (consciously) a huckster wouldn't talk in such an obvious huckster voice... 





























 The poles shift. Bigfoot gets his own reality show. The Prime Minister of Canada turns in to a werewolf on live television. Cats and dogs living together. Miley Cyrus elected to Congress. Chaos. 




 I'm not as pessimistic. This is one issue where committed liberals and conservatives are pretty much in agreement. Yes, the "mushy middle" and "think of the children" people might support forfeiture, but politicians quite often cave under pressure that comes form *both* sides of the political spectrum. For every 10 soccer moms who vaguely support forfeiture, there's two left-wing and three right-wing activists who hate it with a passion. Passion often wins out over numbers in politics.  




 Before becoming an officer you must complete extensive firearms training in terms of safety, skills and tactics in most jurisdictions. No one is issued a badge after firing 50 rounds at a range. Even probation officers who rarely carry are required to do far more training than that. 




 I doubt that's true. However I have no problem with civilians owning firearms if they pass a rigorous background check and training program first. The point of this article was that even a pro-gun group found that just a "random dude" with a weapon can't stop a massacre. Someone with proper training, either police or civilian, might have had a chance. 




 There is nothing wrong with training police in military tactics. The problem comes when untrained officers are given military-grade equipment without knowing how to use it or when it is appropriate to deploy it. 




 No, *trained* people with guns did, not amateurs. 














 That subreddit sucks, actually. It's 90% "HEY GUYZ I JUS HAD MY FIRST LUCD DREAM XDDDDD"

Plus weird taboos. There was a whole discussion about chakras and and the third eye in which even some of the mods participated, but so much as mention shared dreams or dream characters having their own personalities outside of your subconscious, and it gets deleted immediately. I fail to see how one topic is any more or less New Agey than the other. 









 Negative numbers don't get equal treatment in mathematics. "-2" really doesn't get the respect as a unitary entity like "2." Instead, it's tradition to read it as "-1*2," so when you see -2^2, the tradition is to read it as -1( 2^2 ) = -1(4) = -4.

I personally consider writing -2^2 to be "bad grammar," since its meaning isn't clear as you've demonstrated by asking this question.

If we mean to say "the square of negative 2" we should write (-2)^2, and if we mean to say "the negative of the square of 2," we should write -( 2^2 ) 




 Using combinations, since there are 13 animals total, therefore P(no cats)=P(all dogs)=(7C4)/(13C4)

So P(at least one cat) = 1- P(all dogs) = 1 - (7C4)/(13C4) = 0.9510

If you haven't learned about combinations yet, you can find P(all dogs) by doing (7/13)(6/12)(5/11)(4/10) 














   Zaman is part of the Gulen movement, whose leading figure, Fethullah Gulen has been exiled from Turkey and accused of Deep State - or State within a state - operations.

Yep. Another major activity of the Gulen movement is running privatized "charter schools" in the US with your tax dollars. They operate over 100 schools in the US, often with minimally-trained teachers brought over on work visas from Turkey. 

Turkish politics overall is terrifying. There is not one "deep state" but several and they are currently at war. I remember one twitter quote from a few months back that said "unsubscribing from Turkish politics on mental health grounds." Anyone who looks into this subject will sympathize. It is one place in the world where pulp-fiction conspiracy theories actually stand a good chance of being not only true, but understatements of what's really going on. 




 His story feeds in to the "became great with no formal training or higher education" myth that people (especially Americans) love. Except that in his case it was actually partially true. Combined with the whole "paranormal" element to his story as I mentioned above, I think this is what makes him a popular favorite more than any "exoticization." 




 I am confused, what does this list have to do with Ramanujan? 




 I am surprised with all the awful "paranormal" TV shows around these days that there is not one that has devoted an episode to Ramanujan, as far as I know: *I'm not saying it was psychic communication with a Hindu goddess, but...* 









 This pasty white redditor who grew up in an all white suburb but then lived in iffy urban neighborhoods and then a suburban apartment complex with a lot of Section 8 housing for several years can tell you he's pretty much correct. 




 You make some good points, but as other readers have pointed out, Japan was prosperous when the Yen was less than half its current value versus the dollar. The CB has a lot of room to run before it encounters depreciation issues. 




 Japan was forced into the Plaza Accords, otherwise Reagan was going to give in to Protectionist pressure and limit auto and steel imports. The inflation and bursting of the real estate bubble did more damage to Japan than Plaza. 




 When that someone is the Central Bank of your own country, you don't really have any worries in that regard. Japan's economic problems come from epic mal-investment due to the all-powerful construction lobby and make-workism, not from a lack of demand for government debt. 
























 By the time the bubble burst in 2008, the banks had a gun to the whole world's head, and our only choice was to either bail out the fraudulent bastards or suffer global depression and war that might have killed a couple of billion.

Or, you know, a rational restructuring that would have given equity rights to bondholders. A lot less dramatic than a nuclear holocaust, I admit, but far more sensible. Sheer corruption prevented this remedy, not the risk of atomic warfare. 














 There is the issue of information transparency, in that the Mexican consumers did not know that they were getting US goods instead of Mexican ones. The farmers in general did not want to leave their land.

[Here is a good summary of the impact of NAFTA on Mexico] (http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/11/24/what-weve-learned-from-nafta/under-nafta-mexico-suffered-and-the-united-states-felt-its-pain) 




 More like they are under a lot of pressure to pass kids who have a minimal level of knowledge or effort. 




 If I am ever in charge of a school, I would immediately ban crosswords, word bubble searches, coloring-in maps and PowerPoint "presentations" that are 90% pictures as homework assignments in high school. It is astounding how meaningless these assignments are - and how long they take. I hated them in school and thought they were on their way out (well besides the PowerPoint stuff). 

Sadly, as a teacher 10 years later I see they are just as prevalent as ever, if not more so. 




 I guess it depends on whether or not you think 20% of a country having their way of life destroyed overnight and being forced into factory work is worth the other 80% having marginally cheaper food (in a country with a huge obesity problem already.) 




 Trying to limit trade will only decrease the tariff revenue. 

Tarriffs impose an inherent limit on trade by raising the price of foreign goods as opposed to domestic goods. There are more marginal domestic producers in the market with a higher tariff than a lower one.

ut if you're trying to put more limits and regulations on trade that will actually be a bad thing.

The only regulatory limits to trade I support would be ones outlawing child labor or slave labor conditions, and egregious environmental pollution by the importing country. Supposedly the new trade agreements being negotiated have these regulations, but I'll believe it when I see it (and see it enforced.) 




 In the bizarro world of the inner city, a lot people make this choice for real (not endorsing it, just pointing that out.) 




  Completely orthogonal issues. You can have trade and free education if you want.

I don't think that they are. A badly regulated free trade regime makes it much easier to avoid taxes, starving the state of revenue that might have otherwise gone towards education health. 









 A subsistence farmer relies on his own crop for food, that doesn't mean he (or she) doesn't sell any of it. Even subsistence farmers need to sell some crops to buy fertilizer, pay rent if they are tenants, and buy equipment. Often they "pay in kind" for these items which means they pay in crop, but if the price of the crop decreases they can buy less than they used to, and may be and in Mexico often were forced off the land. 




 products get cheaper, that means that the people who live in the US can buy more.

Not if more of their income is taken up with essentials such as food, energy, education and health care which is what has happened. 




 [I thought this was parody... I guess not for everyone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QDv4sYwjO0) 




 I still don't see how the examples you cite show how the median household in the US has benefited more from globalization in the form of lower consumer goods prices than it has been hurt by it in terms of lower wages, higher food and gas prices and much greater job insecurity. 

Rice and sunflowers? Those are niche products. Let's talk steel, textiles, tire and rubber manufacturing, electronics, all of which were once mass employers in the US but are now mostly gone.  




 Having had success with Monster, is there any way to distinguish the genuine job offers from the spam? That is the main complaint I hear about Monster, that 90% + of the postings are not legit. 

When I used it in my job searches I had zero success. I had one callback, from a company that claimed to be Citigroup but was not Citigroup (instead it was a franchisee that had the right to use the Citigroup name for its financial advisory business), offering a job with no salary, only commission, when the posting gave a salary. From what I hear my experience is fairly typical of Monster. 




 Good things tend to come with some uglies, but there is no reason to throw out the baby with the bathwater.

Agreed, but pour in too much water too quickly, and you don't wash the baby, you drown it. 




 Spengler was a pessimist like Schopenhauer who thought European civilization was ultimately doomed. He's part of the romantic Western tradition of the glorious loser who cannot prevail but fights on anyway because he is spiritually superior even if physically weaker. Once you're aware of this trope you see it everywhere in Western culture, from the religion of the Norse to Rorke's Drift to the Alamo. This attitude comes from the long history of Europe being less developed and less populous than the great Eastern Empires, and always in fear of being overwhelmed by them (especially the Mongols and the Ottomans.)

But like Schopenhauer who inspired a Nietzsche who was willing to "fight to win,"  Spengler has legions of fans in the fascist and far-right worlds who accept his diagnosis of history but not his prognosis. In my view Spengler has now become part of the "rhetoric of decline" that is used to justify right-wing views (our society is corrupt and decadent, it must become more disciplined because a big fight is combing with those other guys who don't look like us, etc.). 
 




  You are speaking as if free trade was literally sustained by violence 

The sad fact is that this is often the case, from political repression in China to assassination of union officials in South America, to cocoa plantation slavery in Africa.

 




 It's been around for a while, but one of the sides of the "dual" being conservative Christians is relatively new. The studios saw the pile of cash ol' Mel made with the Passion of the Christ and decided to get in on the game. 




 I would imagine a conversion, false or not, might stop such a person from torturing. Certainly this is what jihadists do. One of the reason ISIS is rejected even by other extreme groups like Al Qaeda is they have executed people even after forced conversions to Islam. 




 Also subsistence farmers are 1 draught away from famine, so it's not like it's all roses.

Somewhat of a myth, at least in Mexico. Africa that might be closer to the truth. There is (or was) enough community/state support in Mexico to counteract famines. 

the borders may be a sad necessity in terms of order but it doesn't follow that arbitrary trade restrictions need to be bundled with it. 

Not arbitrary. I do favor the gradual lowering of tariffs and immigration restrictions over time, but do it too fast and you risk a political backlash, economic panic, and collapse of the integration project.

If restricting speech and banning certain kinds of porn by people who claim control over pieces of land is considered bad, why is restricting/banning certain products good?

If you want to go with a porn analogy, right now we are allowing abusive porn where it is obvious that the women (workers) are being exploited/raped but we (investor class) get so much pleasure (profit) from it that we look the other way.

Full open borders would be like legalizing child porn and would be a moral and political disaster. 




 Almost all cars are made in high-wage countries (US, Germany, Japan). I fail to see the parallel. 




 Cheap gadgets is not real prosperity. A lot of families would trade in their computers and cell-phones in an instant if they could have affordable health care and college education again.

I agree that the billion people lifted out of poverty is a very good thing, but trade integration is happening way too fast. A neo-fascist actually has a good chance of getting elected President of France. Genuine Nazis sit in the Greek parliament and the Greek elections might lead to a radical left-wing government that has promised to cut Greece off from the global trade and finance system.

Yes these are extreme cases but they are also canaries in the coal mine. If there is another crash like 2008 we could see similar things in the US and that would make all the progress we've seen for naught. A Buchananite or far-left political party arising in the US if there is more economic chaos and inequality is not out of the question. 




 Cool, please share this with TracyMorganFreeman 




 why are you hating on poor people who would spend decades longer working in subsistence farming and in hardcore sweatshops? 

No hate towards the sweatshop workers, but the subsistence farmers who are often forced off their land into sweatshops by free-trade deals that dump subsidized US agriculture products in their country might not agree that free trade helped them all that much.

In fact from purely utilitarian perspective it's better to lift billions from true poverty than to spare millions of special snowflakes some hardship.

I agree, but free trade doesn't always do that (Mexico is the country I had in mind above), and even when it does (such as China) if the disruption is such that it imperils economic integration through the rise of nationalism and ideological as opposed to pragmatic (and phased-out) protectionism then in the long run it is counter-productive.

Without lines of the map and people enforcing bans on shit, free trade would be a default state of the affairs.

Without those lines on a map, total chaos would be the state of world affairs. If you really want to see a race war, declare open borders tomorrow. I want to abolish those lines too, but it has to be done slowly. The past thirty years has seen this process proceed too fast, and it risks a big crash that will set humanity back. 




 Depends on who you believe and how you interpret certain passages. However, hell as a place of eternal torment is what most conservative US Christians believe, so that is what matters pertaining to my question, the cultural assumption, not what's actually in the Bible. 




 I fear your "proportionate to interest and ability" is merely a charitable perception of Title IX you've been led to believe, and not its wording or what the HEW's interpretation of it is.

Perhaps so, though I think that's what the third prong says. Like I said, time for an expert opinion. Knowing lawyers, they will probably disagree on the interpretation just like we have but it's worth a shot.
 




 Well maybe we can get AskLawyers or something to weigh in on this because we're obviously not getting anywhere with this discussion because we don't agree on what "proportionate to interest and ability" means. I don't think the law operates the way you think it does but make a post on there and see what the experts say. 




 The recent torture scandal has me wondering how much of our acceptance of torture comes from having a mainly Christian religious background in the US. At first glance, torture would seem to be very un-Christian, love your enemies and all that, but what else is Hell but eternal torture for "bad guys"? 

And if torture is something that God does, can a Christian say that it is categorically bad? And if a Christian meets someone (say a terrorist), that he is sure is going to hell, what's wrong with giving that terrorist a little foretaste of what he has coming to him, especially if you might also get some useful information?

Obviously this critique applies to all religions that believe in a hell, not just Christians. 




 If all you're able to show is that the average female athlete gets 10% more scholarship money than the average male athlete, I hardly think that's an injustice worthy of such outrage. Yes it should be equal not 10% more for women but that's no reason to get rid of Title IX.

You should read your own link: Schools are in compliance with Title IX if they meet *any* of the three prongs, whereas you are arguing as if they have to meet *all* of them.

Also an interesting tidbit in the article: Title IX has been used, though rarely, to increase the number of male sports or to give more funding to male sports as in the Kentucky case. 

No they don't. Further the NFL does not do that at all; you're referring to a particular source of revenue that is shared among them; it's not the case for ALL revenue.

Nor is it for college athletics under Title IX. The salaries of the football coaches alone often equal the entire budget for female sports. 

I'm not as equally productive as you. Paying me like I am doesn't prove that.

No, but nor are women's sports "paid" equally to men's. Only the *opportunities for participation* (proportionate to interest) must be funded equally. Like I said at some schools the football team alone is more than half the budget. If Title IX really meant an equal division of revenue, that would be illegal. 




  I spent under 5 minutes searching a single job site (monster.com) for the man's chosen title. After culling unrelated jobs I came up with 10 jobs within 50 miles posted in the last few weeks.

How many are spam postings that a company is required to post either because of internal policy or federal regulations? In the case of the former, the job has already been "filled" by an insider but they have to go through the charade of a public posting, in the case of the latter, it is usually so they can qualify to bring in a foreign worker under H1B or another visa program.

I don't know anyone who got a job through Monster, do you? 




 Hollywood has been doing the "dual marketing" thing lately, where they market the same movie as an action-adventure to mainstream audiences and as an explicitly religious film to evangelical groups. It has led to a bunch of Bible-movie stinkers in recent years (Noah, anyone?) because they have to appeal to both groups, kind of like those bland romantic comedies with some gross-out humor thrown in to get single men into theaters.

The success of a rather mediocre band called "Creed" comes to mind as a similar example from the music world. 




 but why would the third world slow down its economic development so the feelings of the well off west are not upset?

They wouldn't have a choice. Growth in third-world economies could have been constrained by a tariff system geared to some level of continuing median wage growth in the rich world. Tariffs could have gradually been brought down to converge the wage lines so that both still sloped upwards instead of the current race to the bottom. 

Free trade agreements and open borders aren't a force of nature like electricity, they're a conscious policy decision. People are waking up to the reality that the impoverishment of middle America was not some kind of inevitable process. It was the direct (if perhaps unintended) result of government policies or lack thereof. 
 




 Equitably to them meaning either similar portions of either sex, or women guaranteed their interests met but men not provided that same guarantee, which means only thinking of one sex, which isn't equitable.

Women are not guaranteed anything under Title IX except that *if* they are interested and *if* male sports are also funded, then female sports must be funded equitably. 

Disallowing the same rate of expansion that females have by mandating women's interests be met first

There is nothing in Title IX that says women's needs must be met first, only that they must be met concomitantly. 

If you need special inducement-which by virtue of getting disproportionately more funding as I showed earlier-then you don't prove equal interest.

You did not show disproportionate funding, nor does Title IX require that. In fact quite the opposite.

Division I football is a huge revenue source

Right, and nothing in Title IX prevents head football coaches from being paid for a single game more than a lot of coaches of female sports will make in 10 years. Nothing in Title IX would prevent a school from taking all that money and using it to build a science lab either. All it says is that if that money is going to be put back into athletics, it must fund male and female sports equally if there is equal interest and ability.

I tell you what. Let's start a business, and as a rule no matter who works more or sells more, at the end of the day we'll split the profits 50/50. 

Sounds good to me. Lots of law firms operate like that - as does (gasp!) the NFL, the biggest and malest sports league of them all.

 




  I disagree that the law is a quota, because quotas mandate percents and Title IX does not, but that comes down to semantics. You don't have to fund *any* sports under Title IX, but if you do, you must fund them equitably. 

There has been a huge increase in female athletics at all levels since Title IX (with no concomitant decrease in male participation by the way) which makes me think that millions of girls enjoy and take athletics just as seriously as any boy.

Look at viewership, participation, and funding of athletics outside the education system. People by and large value male athletics more.

When athletics is part of the educational process, the number of *spectators* is irrelevant, just as the number of people who watch the Math Olympiad vs. a Shakespeare play says nothing about how math classes should or should not be funded compared to English classes. 




 If you read the article carefully, he is staying in the union so that he has a shot at a pension, not out of some "brotherhood" thing. 




 Actually yes it still can be. If your quota for hiring is "X% of employees must be female unless none apply", it's still a quota.

Not really. It would only be a quota if there were mixed teams, but with separate male and female leagues for everything but ping pong, you can't call that a quota. It just says you have to fund male and female teams equally.

Well if you cut a female team you're not longer in compliance

If you cut *just* a female team, you're no longer in compliance. But if you cut one of each you're still in compliance. Title IX just keeps athletic directors from *targeting* female teams for cuts because of the perception that women's sports aren't as "serious" as men's.  




 Looking at the numerous sports leagues that don't rely on funding enforced by Title IX suggests otherwise. Title IX's quota mechanisms masks male interest.

You have not shown a single quota in Title IX - because there aren't any. A school where girls just don't want to do sports could have zero female sports teams and still be in compliance with Title IX. That's not a quota system.

And when budget cuts happen in athletics departments, they can't cut female teams. 

I see nothing in the law that precludes cutting female teams for budgetary (as opposed to exclusionary) reasons. In the past female teams could be cut in tight budget times because "girls don't really need sports" or some such sexist rationale. Now there needs to be equitable treatment which I feel is a good thing. 




 "Responsive to interests and abilities" means that females at a school have to show an interest in athletics and ability to take part before Title IX kicks in, which is just what I have been saying. The huge increase in female participation in sports since Title IX shows that this interest is there. I would not say that males are vastly more interested in sports - watching sports, maybe, but not playing them. 

This prong of the test is satisfied when an institution is meeting the interests and abilities of its female students even where there are disproportionately fewer females than males participating in sports.

This means a school is in compliance with Title IX even if they have more men than women in sports as long as those women who are interested and able can participate. 




 Please show me where in Title IX these requirements exist, I have not heard of the law being implemented or interpreted in this way. From what I know funding is on a per participant basis, not a pre-set quota. 




 Like I said, I don't think Title IX works that way. It simply says that if girls *want* to play sports, their teams must be funded out of the same pot as boys' teams, not that at a school with 10 male teams and 1 female team, that the female team gets half the money. If that were true it would be illegal for all-male schools to have sports and they obviously do. 




 All of that might be true, but it doesn't explain why this would cause a stock market crash. Why should a fall in the oil price mean that companies overall are less valuable? Aren't cheaper resources good for the economy as a whole, leaving long-term environmental issues aside? 




 If that is true I agree, but to the best of my knowledge Title IX only requires equitable funding *per student*, not that if a school spends $x on athletics, that "x" must be split evenly between men's and women's sports.  









 They may not be allowed, but when has that stopped anyone from doing anything, ever?

I don't know, maybe the chief saying "where's car 6?" and the reply being "Barry took it to Vegas for the weekend" isn't a good way to keep your job. 




 Probably not DDT since it's still such a notorious chemical, but there are plenty of EPA and OSHA regs ignored by companies in states like Texas. Especially if they are small they figure the Feds don't have the resources to come after them and the state does not have specific laws against what they are doing. 




 It does mean that if there are female sports teams, mens teams get cut, and since not all sports require the same kind of equipment, it doesn't equal out like people expect.

Big equipment costs relative to other sports are really only an issue in football as far as I know, and most football teams have active booster clubs that take care of a lot of these costs. I have not heard of any school cutting football because of Title IX. 




 The manager is afraid that the high-skill person will leave after a couple of months for cleaner, better work. 

Or take his job. Or report him for a labor violation like overtime laws that his other employees are too ignorant to even realize exists. 




  Why are the people in the first world countries entitled to a better living standard?

We're not, and as far as trade improves the median well-being in the world, I am for it, but a decline in rich-country living standards imperils the political stability of those countries that are crucial to the political stability of the world as a whole (and imperils the whole free-trade project to boot.) 

It's stupid policy in the long run. Third-world wages could still have been increased in a more gradual way to converge with those of the first-world without causing an absolute decline in first-world living standards. 




  Title IX legislation that functions in reducing boys sports teams when not enough girls are interested to form a girls one

That's not how Title IX works, it simply guarantees equal funding per student for male and female sports. It doesn't mean that the football team gets no money because there's no girls' football team.

synthetic phonics yield better results for both boys and girls than analytic(suggesting that those pushing for it merely wish for girls to outperform boys than optimizing education for children in general).

That's the first phonics-based conspiracy theory I've ever heard. I hope it is also the last.
 




 GDP per capita in 2009 was $600, one of the lowest in the world. No accurate data available after 2009, as the country slid into utter chaos (aside from a few bits that managed to break away Kurdistan-style.) Funny definition of "healthy" from our buds at the CIA. 




 Nowhere in my post did I even mention government intervention to fix this problem

Or maybe we could talk about how we handle post secondary education in this country?

I hate to tell you, reforming that sector's giant debt drag on the economy will require massive government intervention, even though it was stupid government intervention (loan subsidies without price controls) that helped to create the mess in the first place. 









 Maybe, but cops on duty are rarely in a rush to get anywhere unless on a call. Remember, they're at work, on patrol. They get to the end of the patrol circuit all they do is turn around and start again. Unless it's a very small town, it's very unlikely that they're allowed to use a patrol car as a personal vehicle when not on duty. 




 And FOP licesnse plates/stickers = no tickets. I am one of the rare pro-cop liberals around these days, but that is one that has always bothered me. Some cops (especially state cops) don't like it either and may even go out of their way to pull over cars with FOP tags, especially if it looks like it's "just" a family member trying to use the plates to get away with reckless driving, 




  Of all crimes in the USA, armed bank robbery has the highest conviction rate... At 60%. Crime doesn't pay? For 40% of bank robbers, it does. 

Unless they take enough to set themselves up for life, they're going to have to keep robbing banks. Chances of pulling off just 5 robberies without getting caught at a 40% individual success rate is just 1%. Most bank robbers are desperate drug addicts or people with a debt to organized crime and are quickly caught. There are a few exceptions (like the North Hollywood shootings) where an organized gang still attempts a bank robbery Bonnie and Clyde style, but those days are mostly gone. In the era of swipe cards the amount of physical cash at banks isn't that high anymore. A lot of the more knowledgeable robbers go after the safe deposit boxes and try to break in after hours. 




 The smart ones are in Congress. 




  I see at least once a month- a cop with NO lights on and NO siren speeding 20+ over- a huge safety hazard for all other vehicles on the road. 

This means they're on a stealth call or pursuit and have been ordered to approach with lights and siren off so that whoever they're after doesn't get tipped off.

And don't say "could've been thru the light for a call" no he pulled in to Burger King.

Did he go to the drive-thru? Otherwise that could have been a call. Lots of drama goes down at BK, Wal-Mart, etc. 









 The comments on the NYT site give some very good reasons why people don't do this.

[I've summarized some of them in another comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/2p3d0q/the_vanishing_male_worker/cmtbb90) 




 We probably don't agree much on politics I'm guessing, but you make some very good points about the counter-productivity of *means-tested* benefits, ones the article and the comments on the NYT site also touch on, namely:

1.) Child care + cost of car + commuting would cost more than many of these low-wage jobs pay. 

2.) "Job lock" syndrome where taking a low-paying job makes employers in your former industry far less likely to hire you, and also severely cuts down on your time to search for a job (witness the one guy who was fired for asking for a single day off to care for his dying mother.), and, if you get fired again, the fact that you had a low-wage job even for one day can reduce or even eliminate your unemployment benefits (I know this is true in Michigan.)

3.) "Abuse" of the welfare system by people making phony disability claims. The fact that SDI is welfare for white people is an open secret in Washington. There are counties in West Virgina and Kentucky where almost half of households get the majority of their income from SDI. You never hear the GOP screaming about cutting SDI, and for good reason, it's their most loyal voters who are on it. I know a woman who gets physically disgusted whenever someone so much as mentions Obama, and yet has been on SDI since 9/11 for "psychological trauma" from the event (she did work in New York, but not in the immediate vicinity of the Twin Towers). She uses her income in a so-far futile attempt to launch a singing career.

My solution would be to have a *universal* Basic Income and a *universal* health program and child care, this removing the economic dis-incentive to work that many of these men face, rather than just slashing these programs which will probably only increase the social destruction.

Fat chance of that happening in the current political environment, but one can dream. 









 The Christianization of the Viking kingdoms coincided with the end of the raiding period, but more than that I do not know. The pagan Viking religion emphasized strength and cunning, so I doubt that there were many moral qualms about raiding prior to the coming of Christianity.  














 I've never heard that way of explaining it before - I like it! I know that "rifleman" implies function (rifles only fire one projectile at a time), but you might want to make that clear to the OP.

Come to think of it, we can extend this metaphor and say that in non-function mappings at least one shooter has a shotgun instead of a rifle.

 




 This is more like the Franklin Affair in the US then the Satanic Panic. Shady, shady shit that was never fully investigated. It might have been delusional people making up stories, or it might have been that some very powerful people were pedophiles and murderers. In the UK you also have the Libel Laws where journalists are guilty until proven innocent (opposite of US) which could explain the very careful and low-key nature of the reporting on this. 




  Putting downward pressure on mortgage rates helps regular folks. 

Only those that already own homes and can trade on that equity, assuming that any gains they get from that aren't outweighed by the negative effects of financial repression on other forms of investment.

Any decrease in the interest rate just drives up (or maintains artificially high) real estate prices. QE is welfare for both the rich and the property-owning upper-middle class and unfortunately it has become the primary welfare channel in recent years. It is far from an ideal way to to help the real economy and has a ton of negative side effects. 




 I will agree with you as far as the treasuries go, but for the MBS side I really do see QE as fundamentally different - in my mind it's the difference between purchasing healthy cows for more than their milk is worth and purchasing potentially sick cows that give toxic milk (thereby encouraging the issuance of more sick cows - bad mortgages.) Both are bad, but one is far worse. 




 I think we're at the semantic lower bound of this argument. 




 It is a giveaway to banks greater in scale and different in kind than previous giveaways. Whether you call that "special" or not is up to you. 




 It is not special in terms of the monopoly aspect. It is special in that for the first time the Fed is acting as a purchaser of non-government assets and has circumvented the zero-interest constraint on monetary policy, allowing for a far more massive intervention in the markets than ever before. 




  Interest is a policy variable and doesn't have a natural rate.

So there were no interest rates before the government started setting them? Please... 




  Sure smells Ron Paulish in here right now.

I think you are confusing Paul's perfume with that emanating from us who want *fiscal* stimulus that supports median income, not *monetary* stimulus that, while staving off another crash, really only improves things for those who already own a lot of financial assets. 




 Its always Fed policy. That's how the system works.

QE is not always Fed policy. I have my issues with "normal" Fed policy also, but QE is something we haven't seen since the 30's, and never on this scale. 




  But you can't then argue that the public is getting screwed when they can purchase for the same price.

Yes, the public still is screwed because the price is higher than it should be. My (saved) dollar that I earned through actual economic activity can't earn its natural rate of interest as a result. It's called [Financial Repression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_repression). 




  The Fed announced that they will spend $1,000 on cows every month. Every month, an auction is held, and the Fed buys $1,000 worth of cow from whoever highs the lowest price in the auction.

And if there are not $1,000 worth of cows out there, sick ones still get bought. The mere fact that the Fed is in these auctions means the natural demand is not there, implying the assets don't really have these values. 




 In any circumstance, it wasn't the bulk of the purchases

37.5% of a multi-trillion dollar program is big enough to be considered bulk in my book.

As long as the values track over the life of the bond, who cares?

Because if this happens it is only because of Fed policy, not because of actual demand for the asset.
 




 So when the Fed can put any value it wants on a financial asset, the meaning of an "equal-valued" swap is not the same as if these prices were solely determined by market forces. 

To dredge up an old analogy from the 2008 crash, if I owned some sick cows and the Fed announced that it would give me a healthy cow for every sick cow I handed over to them, that would be an equal-valued swap in your book, because I could also sell my sick cows to other institutions on the open market for a healthy cow, since those other institutions know they could turn their sick cows in to the Fed for a healthy one. 




  It means that other institutions purchased it at the same price.

Based on the expectations these institutions had about Fed policy... Surely you know that when the Fed announces that it will purchase Asset X at Price Y, the price quite often automatically adjusts to Y and the Fed ends up not actually making any purchases at all. 




 Only the first mortgage purchases can be argued to be this, but I've seen no evidence to back your position

That's why I said "who knows what" quality. I have my suspicions but due to lack of transparency in these financial instruments we will probably never know.

 They traded an interest bearing dollar for an interest bearing reserve.

They traded a bond with a fixed payment structure for a demand deposit. These are not the same thing even if they both bear interest. You can't argue they have "equal value" when the "value" on one side of the transaction can be arbitrarily determined by the Fed's authority. 




 So as you can see from your chart, QE was mostly treasuries.

Yes, but also almost 40% mortgage-backed stuff of who knows what quality...

It was a dollar of reserves for a dollar of bonds. Its a swap, like four quarters for a dollar.

What defines a "dollar" of bonds, their current market value or their face value? Only if it is the latter do you have an argument that it is a swap, and even then not really because the sellers in QE traded a future dollar for a present dollar. 




 QE did not just buy treasuries, it bought mortgage-backed securities as well. As for the treasuries, their value is determined by demand for them which while QE was underway was determined by the Fed. You can't say it was a swap for equal value when the Fed could put any value on the treasuries that it wanted.

[Here is a chart from Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing#mediaviewer/File:U.S._Federal_Reserve_-_Treasury_and_Mortgage-Backed_Securities_Held.png) 




 I got an unexplained $700 check of "helicopter money" from the government in either late 2006 or early 2007 - labelled as an advance on future tax rebates or something like that to keep things legit. 

I think the majority of Americans got between $400-800 in that early stimulus from Bush, which was arguably more "socialist" than any of Obama's policies. 




  Its not free. QE was an asset swap of equal valued assets.

Equal-valued like all the supposedly safe AAA-rated CDO's that were bought with the bailout money? I doubt the swaps were really equal valued assets. I agree with Krugman on some points, but QE was a continuation of the bailout by other means. 

I think he knows that, but does not want to criticize the "only game left in town," even if it worsens inequality, since it is the only thing left propping up the economy. 









  I suddenly started getting lots of scary visual images of a woman with a monstrous face saying she is going to eat my soul :(. 

If you are a traditionalist, that would be a manifestation of Mara, the demonic power in Buddhism, trying to impede your progress. But yeah, I would just stay away from nosleep. 




 You seem to be right, it has dropped recently (though is still very high by European standards and is above the US native birthrate.) 




 And the reverse tragedy too: Too many are forced into higher education who don't really want or need it but see no other way to get beyond the McJobs level due to a lack of apprenticeship and training programs. 




  I'm not going to rush out to have a child, a life impacting decision, because the government's willing to write me a check. 

Maybe not, but it might convince people on the fence, especially if there are strong services as well. The only European country to have an above-replacement native birthrate is France, and no surprise France also has basically free childcare. (This is not an endorsement of French economic policy in general, just saying they have it right in this particular area.) 




  Fewer people equals more resources per person. ipso facto.

Not really. Fewer people decreases the supply of labor, which is definitely a resource, and, depending on the type of immigration, of technical skills and innovation as well. If you are bringing in more working-age people which increases the worker:dependent ratio, the supply of labor/skills/innovation per person will increase.

I am anti-H1B because it is exploitative to the immigrants themselves and unfair to American workers who paid for their higher education (as opposed to countries where it is state-funded), but your argument isn't very good. 




 The savings will go to the shareholders as increased profit.

To the company acting as the supposed agent of shareholders, to be more accurate. And considering that Apple is already sitting on a huge pile of cash, it will flow right into one of the biggest "dead zones" of wealth out there instead of continuing to circulate in the real economy. 




 Only half of STEM majors work in their field - they may not be unemployed, but they are underemployed. Granted, not all STEM grads are engineers.

Also, sometimes the unemployment rate for engineers is calculated using only *certified* engineers. This is a selection bias because most engineering grads don't bother to get certified until they get a job (certification is time-consuming and expensive.) It's not like teaching where you need to be certified *before* you start work. 




 He willingly conflates the quantum mechanical definition of the "void" with physical laws and probability distributions already baked in with the philosophical definition of pure nothingness (which implies a state with no physical laws), and when called on that conflation, he responds that philosophers are not qualified to talk about physics. That seems pretty arrogant to me. 

It's a shame because I used to admire him, but recently he's been adopting some really extreme positions - I think because his religious debate opponents have scored some points off him on the old "ex nihilo" debate.  




  I mean, when you combine super easy money with cheap oil it really ought to lead to increased economic activity.

Unless of course you massively raise consumer taxes at the same time... 




 He claims to have answered the Ultimate Question, but when you read the book he wrote about it... not so much. His theory is pretty much the same as the one in this article - it presupposes certain laws of physics that logically precede spacetime. 




 Assuming something cannot spring from nothing by definition, then 'something' always must have existed.

I would not assume that by definition. I actually think the eventual philosophical answer, if we ever find it, will be similar to the physical answer, that is, that nothingness is somehow unstable/impossible, and the logical fact of that is synonymous with what we mark as the first moment of time, whether that was the Big Bang or something further back. I don't find it tenable to hold that something has always existed. 




 I would disagree. Even if we accept the cosmos as eternal/infinite (which I don't, due to problems with Actual Infinities), there still remains the question as to why that state of affairs pertains instead of others.

If by "level IV" multiverse you mean ontological maximalism, the idea that all possible universes exist, that has numerous difficulties besides that of onotgeny.
 




 The theory tries to show how spacetime itself can arise from quantum mechanics, which is fascinating from the standpoint of advancing knowledge in physics, but doesn't explain how the laws were established to begin with (the philosophical issue.) 




 ontology = the nature of being

ontogony = the origin of being 




 So according to this chart a Lithium-6 fission reactor would be theoretically possible? (though obviously not practical.) 




 This "nothing" already has the laws of quantum mechanics baked in - it might explain why the physical universe came in to being, but not why it was preceded (logically if not temporally) by these laws.

The theory in this article has little or nothing to contribute to the philosophical debate on fundamental ontogeny, unfortunately. 














 Well, that's what the Mormons believe...  




  it makes a lot more sense for their to be consciousness first and a universe created from it

I agree, but...

instead of a universe spontaneously creating conscious beings through a series of evolutionary missteps.

Both of these propositions could be true, they don't necessarily conflict. The Universe could be the product of a primordial consciousness, and our own consciousnesses could indeed be simply the products of evolution.

The interesting question is - why would the primordial consciousness generate thought-forms in which material simulacrums of itself come into being? 














 Pretty thin comfort.

  The people in this riot are not the forefathers of the people that live in Istanbul right now. 

Actually they most likely were. The Turks didn't just kill everyone in the Byzantine Empire when they conquered it. They interbred with the local population like most conquerors. More than one historian has pointed out that Constantinople/Istanbul has always been an unusually riotous city, right down to the present day.  




 And how do you know that Justinian didn't kill one trillion people? You weren't there, man. 




 Neat, I was unfamiliar with that notation - thanks for sharing! 




 I think you are right there is some ambiguity in what the sign means. It can mean "is not an identity," for example you could say a^b  b^a without raising any eyebrows, even though that statement is false when a = 2 and b = 4, for example.

On the other hand, a statement such as x  x + 2 is always true, and would seem to employ a stricter meaning of the  . I think you are on to something that the way to avoid this ambiguity is with logical quantifiers:

 a,b such that a^b  b^a is always true, but it is a much weaker statement. The original statement isn't just true for some values of a and b, it is true for almost all values of a and b.

x, xx+2, on the other hand, doesn't seem to lose any of the strength of the original statement.

I wonder if there is an extended logic system with a symbol for "almost all." Someone wandering by these parts will probably know. 




  Is below-target inflation good for the poor? 

Yes it is. When you don't have any assets that tend to move with inflation, and food and gas are major expenses, inflation is a killer. 














 There are a lot of conflicting interpretations of mahaparinirvana. It's curious that animuseternal identifies himself as Mahayana, as the interpretation he gives of "final extinction" is certainly not what is found in the Mahayana Parinirvana Sutra, which you should read if you are interested in this subject. The Wikipedia article isn't that bad of an introduction and there are some good sources to explore further from there.

 I'm wondering if anyone else has noticed this. In lucid dreams I've always been tempted to touch or smell things and I'm always amazed at how "real" they seem, but unfortunately engaging more senses seems to make the dream dissolve.

Last night I had a good (if boring) lucid dream going where I was walking through a forest. I resisted the temptation to touch or smell anything and I noticed no dissolution setting in. Then, to experiment, I touched a birch tree and almost immediately woke up.

Has anyone else experienced this, and if so, have you found a way around it? I'd love to be able to do more than just look at stuff. 









 Or Fulton Street - going back there now and seeing upscale suburban mall style stores mixed in with the old used clothing and sneaker shops that are still around is surreal. 




 I think Lonelobo was referring to his blanket dismissal of all philosophy and metaphysics as useless or nonsense after being criticized for his "universe from nothing" views and not really having a good response to the point that presupposing the laws of physics is not "nothing" in the philosophical sense. Rather than responding with a real rebuttal he basically said philosophers are not physicists and should not be able to comment on cosmology - which is what got him called anti-intellectual by a lot of people. 




 Dune 84 is one of my all-time favorite films, I cannot understand the hate for it either, or why Lynch had his name removed as director. No, it does not do the book justice, but even a ten-hour movie could not do that. It is a different vision of the story and it is spectacular. I think the sheer weirdness puts some people off, but to me it is original, bold and peerless. No movie even remotely like it has been made since. 




 I hear it more in the opposite context, when someone is describing something new. For example, I know a "nature guide" who uses it a lot to describe animals or animal behaviors that his audience is not familiar with. 




 I would agree. It is definitely more rare in the city, but it's not particularly southern. Rural men tend to use it the most. 




 I've never come across a good explanation of this, or even what the phenomenon is called, but I hear it all the time in casual speech, especially when an "expert" is addressing an audience. For example, on a nature show, the host might say "That's your yellow-bellied sap-sucker" instead of "that's a yellow-bellied sap-sucker," or a political radio host might say "That's your Republicans, always saying [whatever]"

Does anybody know a name for this and how it might have developed?

 I think in this sort of situation exceptions would be made. We saw how fast the government invented "emergency" powers out of thin air during the financial crisis. It would be even more inventive in the case where the President was killed by his own VP. 
























 Weird... so he placed a paragraph by a fictional character he created in one of his other books, and didn't explain it? That would clear up why I can't find references to this person, but that's bizarre.

Edit: Actually, it says "a novelist" called a character "based on him" Emery Heywood, not as I first read your response to imply, that De Voto himself wrote the novel. Still this is intriguing and that result did not show up in my original search. Thanks!! 




 I saw that result in my previous search. I am sure it is a reference to the same person. I am not inclined to buy this book though just to see the footnote, because I am 99% certain it will just be a reference back to the Course of Empire. 









 Yep, nothing except links to the book itself (which tells me nothing about who he was.) 




 In the introduction to de Voto's "The Course of Empire," there is a very strange and poetic paragraph about the Age of Exploration attributed to an "Emery Heywood." I figured he was a writer or a historian and his writing style was so unique I decided to look him up to see what else he wrote. I can find no trace of any writer or historian by that name on the Internet.

Does anyone here know who this person was and what his (or her?) connection to de Voto was? I am quite curious now...
 














 save them hood 




 Nope, I'm sure it's still there. It's a series of videos and the girl who created them is obviously trying to make a name for herself as a "teen advice" specialist or something like that. She has a whole channel. The video had like 60,000 views or something like that when I watched it. 




 Blond hair, long and curly, more than that I don't remember. She talked like the stereotypical "valley girl" which made it all the more funny. 





























 Lorber was criticized for never publishing these findings in a peer-reviewed journal though. I would be a bit skeptical about his claims.  









 With the exception of 1976 and the three-party elections of the Bill Clinton Era, when the Democratic share of the vote actually went down, but Clinton won some Southern states due to Perot, the GOP swept the field in the South after 1964. The democratic share of the congressional delegations from the south more gradually deteriorated as incumbents held on, often by becoming Republicans in all but name (Zell Miller comes to mind.)

The whole discussion is confused by the fact that the political parties were not as ideologically aligned back then as they are now. There were plenty of Republicans more liberal than most Southern Democrats.  




 Those links show exactly the trend I was talking about... there was clearly a shift in the Republican attitude towards Civil Rights after Goldwater won the nomination in '64 and then with Nixon's Southern Strategy (yes, 5 deep southern states went for Wallace, but the rest went for Nixon.) 




 The racist white southerners voted for Democrats locally and at the State level but GOP at the national level? For Senators and Congressmen?

Correct. That voting pattern persisted for decades and is well-documented.

30 out of 32 GOP Senators voted for the CRA.

What CRA are you talking about? The Community Reinvestment Act?

Why would racist white southerners vote for Democrats locally who didn't push civil rights but a national GOP that did?

Because the GOP was to the right of the Democrats on Civil Rights on a national level after 1964. Goldwater and Nixon were seen as being more sympathetic to Southern white "interests" than LBJ and Humphrey. 

P.S. LBJ was a southern Democrat

So was Al Gore. Politics is strange.
 




 Because Civil Rights wasn't pushed at the state level by Southern Democrats, inertia and incumbency kept many of them in office for decades. 




  1) The Republican party lost the the black American vote over civil rights in the 60's. 

More accurately, the Democratic Party lost the *white* Southern vote in the 60's due to Civil Rights, then the GOP lost the black vote as they swept in to pick up those voters. At the time, the Republicans were trading a smaller voting bloc for a bigger one. Smart politics. At the time. But karma's a bitch. 









 Not necessarily. To be regarded as scientifically valid, a phenomenon needs to be replicable. Most reports of "supernatural" phenomena indicate an unpredictable and sporadic pattern of occurrence. A person might claim to experience precognition, or see a "ghost" once or twice in a lifetime. This could very well be because such phenomena do not in fact exist, and are the result of malfunctioning brains or sense organs, but if they do exist, this unpredictable pattern could be why they have never been scientifically proven.

Another thing to consider is the relationship between subjective states and physical objects. Some subjective states (for example, seeing the color red) have a physical correlate (an object that emits light in the red wavelengths). These states can thus be studied by science in an indirect manner since their causes are known, even if the exact relationship between the object and the subjective state it engenders is still a matter of fierce debate.

However, if there are subjective states that *do not* have a physical correlate, than these states might forever be outside the realm of scientific examination. Examples might include mystical experiences, the feeling of subtle energies such as chi or prana, etc.

Science can certainly observe the brainwaves of people who claim to be experiencing such states, but that is different from directly studying the (potentially supernatural) *object* that could be engendering these states. Note how this is unlike studying a brain that is seeing a color red, where the object emitting the light can be directly observed.

None of this proves anything about the actual existence of the supernatural of course, it merely casts doubts on those who believe that science itself is an "all-seeing eye" with a truly universal method for obtaining knowledge.

I think these considerations answer your second question as well: Science has no choice but to assume that only naturalistic phenomena are at work because its method can see nothing else.  



















 "Actually collect taxes" would be good, but it's difficult. There is actually a clause in the Greek constitution preventing the taxing of shipping. Guess what the biggest industry in Greece is? Therefore Greece relies heavily on sales taxes, and even taxes on utility bills, which fall most heavily on the poor.

Some labor market reforms are called for, but severely cutting the pensions of people who are already retired, and often supporting multiple unemployed adult offspring, will only be counterproductive. 




 "Reforms" that would privatize major public assets and hand them over to the same banks that defrauded the Greek people (and the EU) to get them in to the Euro in the first place. I wouldn't have stomach for that either. 




 From a Libertarian perspective that most people here (including me) will not agree with, but I thought this was interesting nonetheless.

 I think you're on to something here. The Chinese leadership might be evil, but they don't have a track record of this kind of blatant stupidity. 

This is the first explanation of this move that I've seen that even halfway makes sense, and that manipulation is documented already in the case of Hanergy, where the CEO was borrowing from shady shell companies he controlled so he could buy more of his own stock every time the price threatened to go down. It wouldn't surprise me if this scam was a lot more widespread than has been reported.

 Never knew this had a name. Pretty cool. Also pretty cool to see a mainstream media outlet discussing the paranormal without the usual sneering dismissal. My wife experienced one of these when her grandmother passed away. Not conclusive proof of anything in my book, but certainly something that warrants further investigation. Unfortunately the scientific method is not geared to look into sporadic phenomena such as this. 




 It's a shame because they were ahead of the curve on a lot of issues, but they ruin all their credibility with juvenile posts and over-the-top "the world is ending" stuff. I'm not sure if there is any editorial control at ZH at all - there doesn't seem to be. 




 The Yoga Sutras are old enough (c. 400 AD) to qualify as "ancient" by most people's definition of the word, and they draw upon an obviously older tradition. The 84 classic poses, some of which you will learn in an intro class, have been codified for well over 1,000 years.

A lot of the "fad" yogas ("hot" yoga, dog yoga for chrissakes) are recent inventions, but yoga itself is a very old tradition. This idea that yoga is some modern invention is just [intellectual hipsterism](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2pv/intellectual_hipsters_and_metacontrarianism/). 




 That "treatment" was used in the past and failed, most famously on an unwilling Alan Turing. Gays have normal levels of testosterone, etc.

 There is some speculation (and it is only speculation), that GID might be tied to long-term use of drugs that influence hormone pathways, including steroids. In addition to Jenner who everyone's talking about, I remember a Navy SEAL and a champion mountain climber being in the news recently for going from super-"macho" men to wanting to become women. Anecdotal evidence to be sure, but interesting nonetheless. 




 It is also that many priests in the past tended to be closeted homosexuals who joined the clergy so no one would question why they remained unmarried. If they chose to act on their desires at all, often the only available (and vulnerable) population was underage boys. 

Technically that is "homosexual predation" rather than "classical" pedophilia, but you will never hear right-wingers mention the context surrounding it. Instead they want you to think that gays are inherently predatory regardless of their social circumstances.

 We still have never figured out how he knew. 

License plate scanners were just coming into use around that time, he could have had access to that. Now, if a cop pulls you over, he can see exactly where you've been unless you've been out in the middle of nowhere. There could have been a scanner at the concert to look for drug activity.  




 ...and since he "died" before his sentencing, his family got to keep all of his ill-gotten gains. I would look in the Caribbean or Switzerland before assuming he's got a cottage up there with Jeb.

On the other hand, his second-in-command Skilling who seemed the smarter of the two actually did some serious jail time, so he probably really did die of a heart attack from the stress of the trial. Nice plot arc for a soap opera though. 




 Yep. The ones with a nice, predictable "twist" at the end immediately arouse my skepticism. This one, if it is is fake, is an incredibly unique and chilling story that doesn't give off the "spooky movie" vibe. I can't believe it didn't get more upvotes. 









 Good point - I should have said objects that can be satisfactorily approximated by spheres.  




 It means that we can't think of infinite sets as "menus" where you can freely pick an element like we can with finite sets. Some go further and say that the whole idea of infinite sets is incoherent. 

My position is that infinite sets are good approximations of things that are very large but in reality finite. We can "use" infinite sets in applied mathematics with little reservation, but we should not take them "literally" as representations of physical objects like spheres. 









 Depends on the state. In my state it is not required and there is one (wealthy) district nearby that does not provide bus service - parents are expected to carpool (or hire a taxi/towncar).

 Whoops, sorry, forgot to actually link to the article! 




 I've read a good deal of Hegel and he would probably say something quite similar to your explanation. Now that you've expounded more on your point I can say I agree. 




   This is barely relevant, 

You are too modest sir...

yet "something" would be similarly empty--it would be merely static existence.

Good post and I agree with 95% of what you wrote, but I think we need to explore this statement a little more - why would an "absolute" something be static? 
 




 Quantum physics shows that vacuum states are unstable, and while this is very interesting, it doesn't tell us why there is something rather than nothing, and if we feign that it does by defining "nothing" as vacuum states, or something like this, then we're guilty of a fallacy of equivocation.

Good point, and actually one I've made elsewhere, pointing out that Leonard Krauss commits this fallacy. To clear up what I meant, QM "nothing" is obviously not an *absolute* "nothing" with no laws, no physical objects, etc., but the fact that the state as close as you can get to "nothingness" within that system is unstable is suggestive of the theory that "nothingness" within *any* system, even a necessarily true one like formal logic, is also unstable. Not a proof of this assertion by any means, but suggestive none the less.

How can something be both necessarily true and contradictory, i.e. necessarily false? 

Logic is necessarily true, but it's not necessarily contradictory. It's only contradictory if we allow it to refer only to itself. 

Also, why should not having "a final referent to something that's not a logical statement" make a logical statement contradictory?

If logical statements refer only to themselves, eventually they will form a self-referential loop with all the self-reference paradoxes arising. Many attempts to axiomatize logic put limits on logical self-reference, but this requires a ultimate "ground" or referrent that is not itself a logical statement.

But if we re-frame consciousness as being primarily about choice...
Then we're just changing the subject.

I think there's a connection - [see my reply to OP here](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/32kp1i/the_connection_between_the_origin_of_matter_and/cqcxfj9). 




 I'm having a hard time conceiving of what you mean from a hard materialist position. Do you have anything else you could say about it?

It's hard to stay a "hard materialist" once you start contemplating these questions, in my opinion. Basically there needs to be some sort of free agent to make the primordial choice for what exists. It doesn't follow that this is a conventional "God" in any sense, however. It could be more like Schopenhauer's Will. 

I'm not familiar with these, what are they? I can also look it up myself of course but I'd love to hear your thoughts if you don't mind. 

The multiverse theory holds that this not the only Universe, there are other Universes out there, perhaps with their own laws of physics, etc.

As for the paradoxes of the actual infinite, you can start with Hilbert's Hotel or the fact that the infinite sum of the series 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 +.... actually equals negative 1 if we assume you can actually do "infinite sums" instead of treating them as approximations of very large but finite operations.  




 I've recently realized that "why is there something rather than nothing?" is actually the *easy* question of fundamental ontogeny. While scientists and philosophers don't have an exact answer yet, it is obvious that somehow "nothingness" is unstable/impossible, as seen in Quantum Physics.

My own personal preference is for the theory is that formal logic is necessarily true, but also contradictory if it doesn't have a final referent to something that's not a logical statement (that is, a material object or something like it rather than an abstraction like a rule of logic.) This creates a need for a "necessary object."

So if what was called the Ultimate Question is really the easy question, then what's the hard question? It has to be why *this particular* something, rather than any of the other possibilities that might have served as adequate necessary objects.

Even if we live as part of a "multiverse," this doesn't solve the problem, as there can be only a finite number of universes, or else all the logical contradictions of Actual Infinities would arise.

What does any of this have to do with consciousness? Not too much, if we define consciousness in terms of awareness, qualia, etc. But if we re-frame consciousness as being primarily about *choice*, with those other qualities emerging later as consequences, then I think we're on to something. 




 Awesome reply, thanks, that's what I was looking for. 




 Thanks for the reply. I think my question is a little more philosophical. If there is no "master clock" for the Universe, then how can we say that the Universe as a whole has an age? Is 13.7 billion years just the age as it appears to us because of our "position" in spacetime, or is it somehow an absolute age?

 Probably the case. Most likely the boat was happened upon in open waters by a Chinese vessel that was fishing illegally in the area. Because they were poaching, the Chinese crew did not report finding a body, but they still gave it a proper burial in their custom, and even thought to leave the jawbone above ground for easy dental identification.

 Is it that the Universe is only this old from our perspective, or is that that this dating is a simplification of a more complicated reality? 
























 How is it guaranteed that such a function exists? He says that all predicates have a fixed point like this but he doesn't really go into it. I found that confusing because among ordinary "mathematical" functions, not all of them have fixed points. 




 I am trying to make my way through Yanofsky's "Outer Limits of Reason" and I am on the section about the Incompleteness Theorems. I was following his argument pretty well until it got to the following:

He defines a predicate as a function that takes a number as an input and gives a logical value (true or false) as its output.

He then defines a fixed point of a predicate F(x) as a logical statement C such that F("C")=C, where "C" is the Gdel Number of C.

It appears that our predicate F(x) now outputs a logical *statement* instead of a logical *value*. Am I missing something here or is the author being sloppy in his explanation?

(This is all on p. 320 - 322 if you want to do a Google Book search.) 




 What type of argument does he make for that assertion? I can think of so much evidence against it: Optical illusions, the scientific evidence that qualia (whatever they are) vary between individuals who speak different languages, etc. 




 I don't think that Rupert Sheldrake accepts the reality of physical objects at all, but I'm not sure. I don't know much about his work other than the controversial "dogs know when you're coming home" stuff, unless you're referring to a different Sheldrake. 




 Actually I have immediate mental images for all of those, but even if we accept that point, do reports of qualia seem to be referring to functional roles, or to images? 




 Seems most likely to me that any solution would involve tapping "dark energy" directly, if it exists. It is speculation to be sure but it's never too early to get started on a problem this big! 




 Summary:
Although psychedelics can induce temporary confusion and emotional turmoil, hospitalizations and serious injuries are extremely rare. Overall psychedelics are not particularly dangerous when compared with other common activities, says Krebs. 









 I don't think this representation would arise without an actual sensation behind it. Representations can refer to "imaginary" objects, but I don't see how they can refer to things that are not even subjectively real. I can't talk about pink unicorns without actual mental images behind those words, even though there are no such things in physical reality. Even contradictions like "square circles" refer to actual sensations, although each term is distinct from the other. 




 Then G still exists as a semblance. Since qualia are nothing but semblances or appearances anyway, G exists as a quale. 









 Penrose Triangles don't exist as physical objects, but they do exist as sensations. No one is claiming that qualia are anything but sensations. Anything that "resembles" a quale is a quale, since it is nothing but a sensation anyway. 




 If qualia don't exist as subjective phenomena, why do we have a name for them? It is hard to see how the concept of qualia arose if there aren't any. 




 Dismissing qualia as an "illusion" doesn't really help solve the problem. Everyone accepts that qualia are illusions in some sense in that they are not inherent in physical objects. The question is why this type of "illusion" arises and is perceived. 




 They can't even stamp out marijuana after 70 years, what hope do they have versus something like ayahuasca? A crackdown would only help to make it more famous. Imagine all the Hollywood celebrities speaking out about the poor shamans in the rain forest getting sprayed with herbicide from DEA planes simply for practicing their ancestral religion.  




 My ex went to a school that as a matter of *policy* would not hire its own graduates, as it would "look bad" if they were working for the school rather than in the private sector.  









 I am not sure how long the effects of a MAO inhibitor stay in your system. Look, if they really wanted to ban it, they could, but they don't. No one "serious" sees it as a threat yet. By the time they do, it will be far too late.  









  obligatory drug tests after traveling from certain areas..

DMT doesn't stay in the system long enough for that. 



















 To kick things off, I am going to submit a bunch of links that got tagged or deleted off of other subs for petty reasons. I am sick of this and I would hate to see reddit turn into another Wikipedia where people are afraid to contribute anymore. 









 I think the cat (or perhaps the jaguar in this case) is out of the bag. Uncle Sam might try to co-opt it, but it's too late to contain it.  



















 Thought this was fascinating - my impression was that the Little Ice Age was well-established history -apparently not. 









 Shocking that this appeared in the Wall Street Journal... 
























 People tend to confuse your typical American Masons, whose mystical objects of worship don't seem to extend far beyond the buffet table and the beer stein, with the serious Manly Hall-esque guys. Both exist although I think the serious types are in decline. The former only seems to exist to provide dues money and PR cover for the activities of the latter.
 




  ..Who had a bunch of human bones buried under his house, discovered in 1998.

Probably from conducting underground anatomy lessons. Dissecting human cadavers was illegal at the time. Medical students would actually rob graveyards or pay others to do so in order to practice surgeries. 




 Do you have a reference for this? 









 I was thinking about doing that, but free checking accounts are actually quite rare these days.  



















 Interesting - why would I have to buy an altcoin first? 




 I meant the combo of routing+account number, obviously. 









 If there is fraud on a credit card, isn't the card company liable for the fraud, not the merchant? Or is it that because of fraud, credit card companies won't deal with Coinbase? 




 I have fraud protection through Visa on my credit card, but I don't think the same protections would apply if someone had my routing numbers. I could be wrong - not an area where I am an expert, so that is part of why I'm wary. 




 Ok, but then why don't they just let me use a credit card? Basic prudence dictates you just don't give out your bank routing numbers to people. 




 Sorry if this is the wrong place for this type of question.

Edit: Thanks everyone for the detailed advice. Lots to consider! 









 Source is most likely David Icke who is shockingly looking a *little* less crazy than he did before this story broke (though I still don't believe in Lizardmen.) 














 Got it. Thanks. 




 Yes, but as Ribet himself says, that "first" bridge (from known results to Taniyama-Shimura) was much harder to construct than the "second" (from Taniyama-Shimura to Fermat.) 




 What does the article mean by marginally normal? I have not encountered that term before. 














 Ironically, I avoid clicking on anything starting with the "death of x" precisely because it is almost always a vast exaggeration of whatever the article claims to describe.  









 Source? You just linked to a graph from 2011. 














  In the long run, though, that's suppressing demand and driving yields even lower

I agree with everything else you said, but wouldn't suppressing demand pressure yields *higher*? That point is not really significant to your overall argument since, as praxulus says below, the bottom 50% have hardly any wealth to invest, just trying to understand why you said this would drive yields lower. 




 People hate not winning the war quickly and cheaply as it was sold to them. 














 Doesn't this contradict a lot of evidence that violence was very common in the Paleolithic? I find it hard to believe that all those combat-looking wounds in Paleolithic skeletons were caused by ritual cannibalism.

A world free from war and violence is something we want for the future - we should not delude ourselves that it existed in the past. 




  Well, it's a very long story that only gets weirder

That, sir, is called teasing. I am up for the long version for sure. 




 New Age convention in town? 



















 Enlighten us - how would he get a competitive advantage from tax increases? Not meant to be a hostile question, corporations have been known to support more regulation to crush competitors, but how would tax rates make a difference? 




  He complains that billionaires should have to pay more taxes. But there is nothing stopping him from paying what he thinks is fair. He doesn't do that though.

No, he's just giving everything to charity. There are limits to what private charity can do, but in the absence of government action it is putting your money where your mouth is.

 ... and now someone has the opportunity to coin a word that describes the coining of a word that describes itself. 
























 Pick any number. Let's use 30:

2 is a factor of 30. But the next number after 30 that's a multiple of 2 is 32...

3 is a factor of 30 too. But the next number after 30 that's a multiple of 3 is 33...

...and so on.

See what happens? Poor old 31 is always left out. It can't ever share any factors with 30 (other than 1 of course.)

As for a formal proof, take any whole number "x" such that x1 and x is a factor of n. 

Since x is a factor of "n", then n/x is a whole number. 

But what about (n+1)? Well, for "n+1" to have "x" as a factor (n+1)/x would have to be a whole number. But distributing the division in the previous statement yields n/x+1/x. 

We already showed that n/x is a whole number, and 1/x is obviously not a whole number (since x1), and a whole number plus a non-whole number is never a whole number.
