 So, where do i start? Well, it's 11:06 P.M. My blind is half way closed, and I'm sitting in my chair reading nosleep non-stop. I've always wanted to wright a story that send's shivers down people's spines. I wanted to do that for the longest time, though I just keep finding myself stuck in this limbo. I know I have the writing skill, but god damn! I wish I could pull one off from right under your nose like the rest have. Those people could fool all of you with the press of a button. I honestly found it laughable when people think the authors stories seem real, but the cold hard fact is most of them aren't. It's just plain, and simple story telling talent. 

That's until you find a real one.

You know when people wright bullshit tales that end with them being possessed? How about when they commit suicide while, ironically enough, they can type it out on the computer. And even better, becoming insane only to somehow collect your thought's for an hour or two in order to tell your story. It's just complete fucking disregard for quality. When following the list above, your sure to achieve ruining the atmosphere the reader has let themselves build around them. I came across a total of six of these. Each filling to the brim with awkward writing, awful build up, and not enough stupidity to give me even a single chuckle. I was just fed up, covering my face, and let out a sigh. one last story. if it's another shit storm I'm heading to bed.

Well, I'm still up.

Have you ever read "Just one last time, I want to see your face." It was crudely written piece by the author, " \ | / " And yes, it's just three line's literally, and no words to the username. It was an out of the box looking username. Hell, an out of the box username may contain an out of the box tale. Unfortunately, to my surprise, It looked worse than the other one's. I cringed with the first few lines. It had so much more potential to fill the shit list criteria than to be a dreadful tale to keep me up. 

Well, I'm still up. Why? Just keep following along and you'll see.

It start's out with the title repeating three times. Then, break's into someone trying to act like a madman, typing at his computer. In my head, I checked the childishly insane typing at his computer off the good ol' criteria. In all honesty, you've probably noticed I'm a bit of whiner. And because of that tendency, I shrugged. Being a bit of a  brat, I had to point out to myself, aloud, how the material I was reading was indeed a heaping pile of bullshit.

I feel so stupid for that now.  

Soon, it started to not be so funny. From what I'm guessing, this had to be an individual whom was interested in a particular woman. This person was writing as if being chased at the same time. There were no comma's or periods; He just started typing away as if grammar and proper spelling didn't exist. Now, at first i thought this was just a mess wearing a bad make shift ghost costume. But, just then, this individual started to write clear as day. I had saved the story in order to simply copy and paste these line's here. Funny thing is, the story itself is gone. I wouldn't exactly recommend trying to look for this story. Been there, done that. And I did it all just to find that damned story again. You can guess the outcome. Though, i still remember the story. I'll try to be as accurate as possible. "I would couress her for the end of time's and kiss her soft angelic skin above her eye's. I would whisk her away for her beauty and would hush children's tongue's for her red wine." I wouldn't call it beautiful, but it was surely a lot more poetic. This user started to wright poetic rhymes that tickled the spine. I won't lie, i was a bit intrigued. I asked myself all kind's of questions, they spanned from who was this poet? Who was this woman they talked about, and why write it... like this? soon, this poem started to turn sour. He started to talk about perverting her to his will. I will NOT tell you what he wrote at this point. It wasn't shocking or even disgusting. What he wrote from then on was merely disturbing. It was so subtle you didn't notice it at first. But as you closed in on the distorting, intriguing words it all became clear. I didn't notice right then, but i was actually scared. Though, despite how hard i tried to just move on, I was hooked on every word. 

Now, I will show you this last bit of the poem. I know what your thinking, I'm going against what i said earlier. I promise, this is the last bit you'll need to know."Bashful, my love. I know you will be here. I will one day feel your cold breath against my cheek. The story will be full. And your love bleak. It's as dark as your hair and pale face. I will free you from your golden cage, together haven will we rest in our special place. Your skin touches that of the moon. Your complexity ensues. I will break your glass door. My shadow at your red door. You will be scared. It is okay my love. for I am prepared. I will lay with you and fill your vase. I will come soon. And you, my love, will sing a wonderful tune." 

This last bit terrified me to the core. I decided to, as you already know, save the story. I then turned my computer off and hopped into bed. I started thinking about this story whilst trying to sleep. It was a haunting story that filled my mind with unspeakable horror's. I just couldn't get to sleep. I then did something i shouldn't have; I made comparison's. The golden cage with dove's, my bedroom wallpaper. Dark hair and pale skin that touches the moon, my black hair and pale white skin. But these were just coincidences, right? I hopped out of bed to check outside my window. I was so scared, I just wanted at least to know that no one was there. I wanted to just have that little sliver of hope. But when I looked out, I saw a man standing there. He was looking into my bedroom window. It's 1:30 A.M. now, and he still hasn't left. 
  




 ya... 




 History facts... i like it and dig it :] 




 i am an awful person. Why? 

Cause i chuckled a bit...

I'm awful... 




 well everyone has there opinion's but i hope ya got a little something out of it. 
If so im glad :] 




 I'll get back to you on that one. I'm busy digging a hole right now :D

... For flowers... (ya, that'll fool em) 




 i know it's not the best but if it makes someone giggle a little im happy ;] 




 Bring a shotgun 
























 Wait... the smiling man is a Let's not meet post? My day just got a whole lot more sleepless... Fuck. 




 I actually just looked it up. I feel like an idiot... Thank you though. Criticism isn't something to take as an insult, but an opportunity to learn. :]        




 I will admit, I ain't really good at grammar and such. I tried my best but I'll keep working on my writing skill. I'm looking up the words you gave me. Either my teacher's never taught me that in school, or I forgot. I wasn't a good learner in school. But I'll work on it for sure. 




 Ya, I'm trying to get better with my grammar and such. Sorry about that. Though, I'm glad you found it interesting. Fun fact: Never have eaten a cake after that. NEVER AGAIN. 




 For the past five or so week's my throat has been having this itch. It started out simple enough. 
Ironically, it happened on my birthday. My mom, dad, little brother, big sister, and her two kids were there. 
The cake was very beautiful. Icing roses, and amazing artwork by my sister made with some gooey candy stuff that I can't quite remember the name of. 
A little card, kind of like the one you would get from a business place with contact info on it, seated itself atop the cake with the writing "Happy Birthday!" It was a good day. 
One of my nephews was whacking around a foam sword, unintentionally breaking three of the most expensive things in my house. 
I joked with my sister that we should keep a tally on how many things would be in pieces before the day would end. 
She laughed and turned to face me. 
Because of this, she didn't see my nephew coming full force with his foam sword. 
Splat, the cake was mushed to a pulp. My sister scolded her son for a second. 
She then took away the foam swords and apologized. 
I told her it was nothing. She gave me a look and fixed her eyes on the cake. "It's still good" I said. 
I then proceeded to convince her along with the rest of the family that this was the case. 
After all, it would be a bitch to fix up another one. And, I honestly didn't think I deserved that much treatment. That was the reason I convinced them it was fine; the cake was still good. 

When all was good and done, I said my good bye's to my family before they went home. 
I was in good spirits, I didn't even notice that little tickle in my throat. 
It wasn't until I was laying silent in bed, moon looming over me. Swallowing, I felt this strange tingle of pain. 
I got some water, and then the pain seemed to settle. over the course of two days, it got worse. 
It wasn't pain this time, it was a tickle. After the third day, I just couldn't concentrate on anything. 
Because of this, I decided to see a Doctor. I thought of a bunch of thing's this tickle could possibly be. 
A sexual disease, flu, my smoking catching up with me, and loads more. 
If your curios about the first one, I just started dating this wonderful girl. You never know. Let's move on. 
The Doctor thought nothing of it when i told him how it felt. He "diagnosed" that I had a sore throat, or an allergy. I took what he had said as the truth. No reason to worry, right? 
It wasn't really hurting at this point, so I couldn't say other wise. 
Well, unfortunately, it turned back into a sore throat a day later. 
I decided to call in sick, my throat bothered me enough to do so. 
With enough sleep and a healthy dose of water, I would get over this I thought. 
I had no idea how bad things would escalate.

That same god damn tickle turned into an itch. Sooner or later I started to scratch the outside of my neck. 
Then, inside my throat as well. It wasn't like before where I would swallow constantly to stop the pain. 
This time I used my nail's to sooth the pain in my throat. My neck for some weird reason became more of a problem as time went on as well. I started scratching a lot there too. Without even thinking, I started to scratch. 
When the pain would engulf my throat and neck, I would scratch. 
Later on, If I wasn't scratching, I could feel the pain. Over a short period of time this itch got out of hand. 
The pain kept getting severe, and more so as time went on. I kept scratching. 
From then on, the blind's remained closed since the light from outside started to hurt my eyes. 
With the blinds closed, it hurt less to see. Funny enough though, with the blinds closed I could barely see. 
I was okay with it though. I always preferred the dark anyway.  

After awhile, I started getting call's from work after four days of being absent; I stopped answering them. 
After three week's of this itch, I was kinda loopy. I knew this wasn't normal, something was going on. 
The problem with knowing something's wrong is when you don't quite know what that problem is. 
A day literally felt like a week. 
In the back of my mind, I even started to think that a ghost or a demon was behind this. 
I never thought that was the issue, though it was hard trying to keep it out of mind. Soon, it got hard to talk. 
At one point, I almost felt as if i couldn't say a word without pain rushing behind my sentences. 
My throat was completely void of any moisture. 
Truthfully, I didn't think it was as bad as it was, despite knowing this was not your normal sore throat. 
In my head, my logical calm self was in charge. 
It said "Mike, you should really see a doctor soon and get back to your boss about this." 
I was worried, but not as much as I should have been.

After some debate in my head, I decided to call the doctor to schedule another appointment. 
My head started to feel clouded, and I couldn't think straight without mustering enough mentality to do so. 
My hand reached for my cell, it was charging in front of the alarm clock. God, when was the last time I used it? 
I stopped as my hand touched the phone. Something looked off. 
I didn't notice it at first, and I cannot comprehend how I didn't notice sooner. 
How often I was scratching, all I did was sleep, thought's seeming cloudy, thinking it was just the same pain I had in my throat from the very start. I had blood on my fingers. 
I tried to yell out "Jesus Christ!", but it was so painful I couldn't bear one letter. 
If the light from the alarm clock didn't alert me when I went to grab my phone, I don't know how much longer that stained hand would have gone unnoticed. 
Despite the major headache that ensued from getting up too quickly, I opened the blinds. 
The Light felt like a literal stab in the eyes. I didn't let that stop me from turning around to check my bed. 
I couldn't tell that there was a nice big blotch of blood on my bed, my vision was way to impaired too. 
I just stood there until I could see exactly what I suspected to see. 
The only thing that scared me is it was a little bigger than I first thought. 
I looked down afterwards to see a puddle forming in front of me. 
I shoved my fingers down my throat to where I had been scratching. There was an indent. I felt my neck. There was a slight, shallow indent. And from what I could see, a whole lot of blood. Things started to blur. 

I was absolutely terrified.

I started to black out, so I tried to reach for my phone to call 911. 
I tripped, and landed with my face leaning against the bed. 
I tried my best to get up, yet due to my blood loss I kept fumbling over and over again. 
I really thought I was going to die right there. 
Although, my will power, or instinct, whatever you call it, came over me and I forced myself up. 
My vision was literally coming in and out as I stumbled over my bed. It felt kinda like slow motion. 
That's the best way I could describe it. 
Sounds a little dramatic, but I wasn't scared anymore; I was trying to survive. 
I finally got to my phone and then attempted to dial 911. 
I don't remember if I got it wrong once or twice, just that I wanted to cry when I messed up. 

Finally, the ring. *ring* *ring* *ri-* "Hello, this is 911, what's your emergency?" 

I felt so woozy as I tried to speak. When I finally did mange to focus enough to speak, I couldn't. 
My throat, my fucking throat hurt so immensely that I couldn't even say a word. I was dying, I could feel it. 
Once again, I was scared. I then screamed in my mind "Your gonna die, so just yell. Yell as hard as you can." 
I slammed the phone on the counter, Then I yelled at the top of my lungs. 
It was the worst pain I have ever experienced in my life. After that last desperate call for help, nothing, black.

I woke up in a hospital bed, light hurting my eyes. My family wasn't there yet. 
I looked around until I saw a doctor walking towards me, he wanted to make sure I was looking fine and stable. 
He then explained everything that happened to me. how lucky I was to be alive, my family should be here soon, the condition I was is, and the surgical process they went through. 

You want to hear the funny part of this story? 

During surgery, they removed a certain something from my throat. 

It was a small, cardboard like paper. You know the one's they give to you at business places with their contact info and all that? It was like that. There was also something written on it.

"HAPPY BIRTHDAY!"
 




 Honestly, I haven't seen him in a few days. I'll keep you posted. 




 Honestly... I agree with this. Damn, guess i gotta start being a bit more nice... 




 My apologies. As you read, I wrote this late at night. I was really tired and posted this once I thought I proof read it as much as I needed too. Oh dear god was I wrong. I'm in the middle of editing it now, so soon it can be legible. Thank you for being honest. criticism isn't something to take as an insult, but as a lesson to be learned. Thank you, friend. :]   
























 Grammy wasn't dead just yet. Grammy was just curious to see what her own granddaughter would do once she died. As you can see in the photo she was quite shocked. Grammy wished she knocked some goddamn sense into her granddaughter. #duckface   




 The music being played in the video doesn't quite set the mood... But hell, just an opinion. 




 I kinda feel bad by saying this but... should have pinched yourself before doing that bro... I'm sorry for you bro... really, really sorry. :[ 




 This right here... This right here was a good read. A read iv'e been waiting for. thank you :] 




 "Hello, Doctor?" "Yes?" "I'd like to quit my therapy." "Oh really? I thought we were making good progress?" "Well the thing is I found a guy..." 




 A little here, a little there. Make sure you tell someone before it ends up everywhere. 




 Goddammit [faceplam]
                     




 That end line... Did not see that one coming.

Damn. 
























 I have no idea how this would work, but I wish we had pedo detectors that would alarm sayings such as "Stranger danger" or "Beat it, I'm ten ya man cougar!" (In rare cases super cougar.) 
 




 Jeez, that is really creepy. Working around drunk people who pass by all the time gives me the impression you have enough story ammunition for a 12 hour party (get together, etc.) . But I'm glad your safe and that it all seemed to work out in the end... Just hope he doesn't come back.  




 Don't worry, I believe that you will believe for I believe in you.  




 This made me cry. I love you humanity... And those big bottomed girls make the world go round, Right Freddie?  




 It's like Facebook is that awkward guy at a party trying to make everyone laugh with jokes that go too far. No one is laughing. 




 Just gonna leave this here

 Tree says: "Don't you or your dog even fucking dare!" 




 It could be a murderous, rampaging, insane, psycho monster, but it's still cute as fuck.   
























 You know what makes me feel better? Not this. Maybe I can imagine it as a sleepover, but fuck it is hard too.  




 Cozy? 




 I don't know whats cooler, this story, or the fact that death has a Reddit account. 




 This is special.  




 Thank you so much! :] 




 Can you feel it? Your thoughts draining from you. There is a slit in your head and everything is starting to leak out and float away. You start to feel all that imagination and those genius ideas of yours become harder to pin point in your head. You just start zoning out instead of thinking about the most interesting things. Actions that were never executed due to the lack of the ideas and thoughts that your imagination spawned in that little head of yours. I cuss and swear but it's all pointless in the end. I go through life everyday losing more and more of what I had. I'm defeated.

I even start to notice that I don't look with my eye's anymore. I don't really see, it's more of a daily grind of usual events that never seem to change guiding me to where I'm supposed to go. It's as if someone is grabbing my hand and pulling me where to go next while I just stare blankly into the ground. I'm lifeless, and my thoughts are leaking. Who I am is leaving me, but somehow I'm still here. My consciousness is rolled up into a fetal position inside my head as it's stripped of everything. I am merely a viewer now, but I just want to leave you with one last thought before I depart.

Who's pulling the strings when we become thoughtless, what guides us, and who or what happened to my head. I mean, you don't just start losing your thoughts by yourself, do you? Is it that I need something to blame all this on or is it just me? I don't know if I should feel scared, angry, or just plain concerned. Something Inside is telling me to just loosen my grip and submit. Something wants me to let go, and you know I could just let go, but I won't.

How could I let go of all this, my thoughts, feelings, memories. As I slowly lose my grip and fade to black, I see that little bit that I have left. I don't want to leave all that behind, because that made me happy when I felt bleak. Just giving up to this dark void? Fuck that. No. I refuse.

I will fight till I die inside. Sure, you can scoop everything I love and hold dear out of my head and just leave me to become a husk, but I am for damn sure not letting you do that easily. I will fight you, whatever you are, and grip as tight as I can to all those amazing child hood dreams and memories that made me smile and laugh. Fuck letting all of that just fade away and fuck you. You will win and I will lose in the end. But, I will love, I will smile, I will look back on those times I had done both, and I will remember. I will remember what it was like to live.

I will live until I die, and I will remember as much as I can before I float away. 




 It's good to know that things are good :] 




 Hello 60 year-old woman. Meet my friend, Shotgun.   
























 "Hey..." "Hey..." "So, uh, you okay?" "Ya, ya I'm just... doin my thing... you know..." "Uh... ya. I, uh, see that." "Ya..." "So, what are you doing around these parts?" "Oh, just hiking, you know, getting those thighs in shape and such." "Oh, really, my brother is a huge fan of rock climbing and hiking." "Really?" "Ya, big adrenaline junkie that one. Mom always said he was the most out going." "Well, that's... neat. Uh, anyway, I should get going." "wait!" "Ya?" "could you do me a biiiig favor?" "uh, well... ya. Ya, I guess so. *sigh* What is it?" "Could you by chance help me get down from here?" 




 expecting a comment of pure shock and terror from something with such a title, and instead we get a spelling correction. Number one priorities in this subreddit people, at least someones doing it right.   




 Mom, what the fuck? 




 *Girl scout leader hands paper to each girl scout selling cookies* 
"Whats this?" "It's so you don't do anything stupid." "Is this really necessary?" "Your girl scouts selling cookies to complete strangers, you never know."  




 Every party everywhere needs this man, right now, this instance. 




 this right here makes me unbelievably sad. 




 Look, Asia, not just japan, not just china, not just Korea, but I mean the whole god damn shubam. I need to know where this creepy juice comes from. Do you inject the creepy juice into ones self only to then gain the mental ability to creep people the super duper fuck out, or do you guys just have it right off the bat from birth? I'm not even making fun or anything, I just want to know. 




 Isn't having to see and hear a real one cry a nightmare enough for people? No? You say we need some robotic skeletal mother fucking god knows what baby demon thing from hell that is burning in pain and wants it's life to end now? Well, sir. Fuck. That. 
























 No, he was never an employee of the school staff where Sam attended. From what pieces I could put together, he was a complete stranger who befriended my son at school. The school he attended had woods surrounding it, thus, from the only conclusion I could come too, Jon lured my son into the woods when they chatted. As I stated, I wish I asked more questions as to what happened at school and also as to who Jon was. I'm very sorry for any confusion I may have caused. Thank for reading. 




 I really enjoyed reading this and found it to be really well written. Overall, good job my friend! :] 




 I heard three knocks. Just three loud, head aching knocks and that was it. I got up and walked to the door. I looked through the peep hole and saw just an open hand in the field of view given. All four fingers and thumb sticking out widely, hand placed deliberately for me to witness. This individual was anticipating for me to look through the peep hole. Why? I didn't know, so I opened the door to see who would be standing before me. I saw no one, nothing, not even a trace of evidence that anyone had been standing there a minute ago. I was creeped out. A tingle down my spine and a bad feeling in my gut were all that accompanied me that night.

The next day I had to take my son to school, so I prepared breakfast which consisted of microwave waffles with butter and syrup as usual. The sunlight creeping up on me through the kitchen window was refreshing and welcomed. My son ate breakfast and when we were all packed up and ready to go I dropped him off at school. I drove back home thinking of work and the papers I had forgotten to hand in yesterday. My mind was completely void of everything else with the papers and more piggy-backing my brain. 

When I arrived home I got to work on my computer. I felt lifeless as I fiddle with files and write up reports. My routine, as you noticed through my little story here, was never interrupted for anything since nothing would stand in the way of it, but something did right then as I heard three loud, head aching knocks.

*Knock* *Knock* *Knock*

I got up and walked to the door. I already knew who it was, but to make sure I looked through the peep hole. Once again the hand was there, but this time the pinky finger was folded down. I opened the door quickly hoping to catch this sad excuse for a prankster. With the door wide open I once again saw nothing. This agitated me and left myself with an unsettled feeling at the same time. Who the hell was that and what the hell is going on?

The next day I dropped my son off at school again and ventured back home in my car. On the way to my house I didn't think about work, I thought about who was behind the door yesterday. I sat there at my computer with files open and blank reports in need of being written up. I didn't touch a thing on the computer, Just sat there staring at the work I needed to do. I just couldn't muster up the concentration, I could only think of the prankster who had kept knocking at my door.

*Knock* *Knock* *Knock*

This wasn't funny anymore, nor was it ever, but this joke became a lot more annoying the instant I heard those three loud distinct knocks again. Looking through the peep hole I saw the same hand that presented itself the last two times, ring finger now folded beside the pinky. But right then it hit me like a brick, it was a countdown. I opened the door as fast as I could only to find no one there. Now I was more than unsettled, I was mad. This mystery prankster was going to get one thing for sure, and that was an ass whooping.

I picked up my son from school that same day and continued on with the routine like nothing happened. My son would tell me of the things he learned and the adventures he had at recess. Today, he told me about his good mark on the spelling test he had in class and how this girl, Rachel, tricked him into rolling down the hill straight into dog crap. It always brightened the rest of my evening to hear his tales in school. He was about to tell me about the new monkey bar set they were going to install in the playground and how he made new friends, but it was getting close to bed time so I told him we would save those stories for tomorrow. I washed the dishes before getting myself ready to read a story to my little buddy before he went to sleep. Afterwards I headed to bed myself. 

Laying in bed I started to wonder who it was who knocked on the door everyday. When I thought about it, it started to creep me out more and more. You see, I'm a little bit of a paranoid kind of person. Things tend to easily spook me, thus, I tend to take things a little to far. Because of that the whole thing turned into a tremor in my head. It looked to be deliberately targeted at me, and that thought while laying in the darkness became a whole lot more scarier, but that's not the thing that really got me. What really scared me was the fact that this was real and that within a few days something was going to happen. Though, this was my paranoid self taking control. Yet, even when I tried to rationalize it, it turned into a lot more than a joke to me. I closed my eyes and did the best I could to prepare myself mentally for the day to come. After that restless night, tomorrow rolled in through the window and gently awoke me with sunlight. I was almost about to drift off back into sleep, but right then, 

*Knock* *Knock* *Knock*

My eyes shot out from my eyelids. Silence. 

*Knock* *Knock* *Knock*

I slowly raised my whole body out of bed anxiously. I didn't utter a word, nor even a thought in my head. All that accompanied myself was an uncomfortable feeling.

*Knock* *Knock* *Knock*

Well, what else could I do now but answer to the call. I walked from my room to the door, not checking the peephole, and answered. I was met with a little girl selling goods for a fundraiser. She just looked at me with a concerned gaze, so I guess I must have had one seriously petrified look in my eyes. I regained myself and asked what she wanted. She explained she was selling cookies door to door. "This early?" I spoke out in a droopy tired voice. "Early? It's eleven o'clock, Sir." Great, Sam is going to be late today due to me being a wimp and not getting any sleep. She left and I proceeded to wake my son up. "Sam, you alright bud?" His adorable bright eyes greeted me along with a yawn. "Ya, why?" "It's eleven in the morning, you never sleep in." "Eleven?!" "Yup, sorry about that. It seems your old man was a lazy bird this morning." "I gotta get to school! My friends will be super mad now!" "Wow, someone is full of energy today." My son proceeded to get ready and I did too.

While in the car it struck me as odd that he didn't ask for a sick day like usual when we were going to be late, so I asked, "Hey, don't you want a sick day today?" "If I did I wouldn't get to play with my friends!" "New friends?" "Ya!" "Okay then." Were the only words I could pull out of my mouth before I parked. "I talked to Ms. Renby on the phone so don't worry about having to explain why your late. Now, get a move on, bud. You don't want to be any later than you are already do you?" "I'm moving, I'm moving. Love you dad!" He smiled and waved at me before walking through the doors into his school. "I love you too, bud!"

Once I got home I went to work on the computer. A call came from my boss about a costumer complaining about a corrupted file. As I start trying to find the original file I hear,

*Knock* *Knock* *Knock*

I asked my boss for a moment as someone had knocked on the door. He understood and told me to call him back. So, simply, like the last time, I walked to the door. This time though, once in front of the entrance, I recalled the knocking. I looked into the peephole and sure enough, like life had smacked me in the face, there was the hand. Another finger, the middle one, had been tucked away into the palm. I didn't open the door at that moment, I just put my forehead against it and took a deep breath. Opening the door as slowly as I could I peered out from behind it. 

No one. I knew it. I knew that I wouldn't see the bastard who had been knocking on my door. That would be too good to be true. I sighed, depressed about that very detail. I couldn't just go back to doing my work, there was no way in hell with this obsessive knocking on my mind. So that's how I ended up watching supernatural until it came time to pick my son up from school.

When I picked Sam up from school I noticed he didn't make as much as a peep halfway through the drive. "Sam, is there something wrong?" He looked up at me and gave a smile. "No, I'm good dad." But when he returned his focus to the road that same smile quickly faded. "Do you wanna see a movie? Get some McDonalds?" He didn't even try to seem happy when he replied with a simple and quiet "No." I was concerned. "Are you sure?" With the same tone he dragged his next sentence. "I think I would just like to go home." I waited until we got home to ask him what was wrong. 

I sat my son down at the table and proceeded to ask him what the matter is. "Sam, you know you can talk to me about anything that's on your mind. I won't get mad, I just want to help." "Well, me and Jon got into a fight." "Well, what happened?" "He wanted to come over to my house on the weekend, but I told him that you and I had our guys night out on Saturday." I was about to ask why he didn't just invite him over on Saturday after our guys night out, or even on Friday night instead, but I had a better question to ask in place of that one. "Is Jon a good friend?" "He is really nice to me most of the time." I went on to ask about his other friends and, from what I could tell, all of his friends sounded like good people. I figured that the fight he had with his friend at school was a small one that they would get over and make up afterwards. After our talk Sam headed to bed and I would be getting ready to read him a story. When I was approaching my sons room I thought I heard my son saying something, but when I went inside his room he was staring in my direction awaiting story time. I shrugged it off and continued to read to him. Later, I myself hit the hay and called it a night.

As I'm getting ready to have a good sleep I turn off the lights. I hear something right then. What it sounded like were footsteps walking through the bushes outside, but these footsteps were as loud as loud can be. You could hear the rustle of the grass and the snap of a twig each step. And as they seemed to get louder than normal footsteps should, they just suddenly stopped. Turning away from the wall to face the window I saw a silhouette of a head peering inside my room. I instantly froze. they quickly ducked out of view. I ran over to the window and looked out of it to see who was there, but I saw no one. I didn't get a wink of sleep that night.

When morning came I didn't say a word to my son. I just made him breakfast and got him ready to go. Sam didn't say a thing to me either. Once I got back home I waited for it. I waited for the knock. I didn't touch my computer or take any calls coming from work. Those precious few hours were devoted to simply sitting there waiting for the sound to break through the silence.

*Knock* *Knock* *Knock*

Sure enough the silence had now shattered. I debated what to do. I could say I chose to not look through the peephole, but truth be told I just couldn't. I sat there, scared, thinking about the one who looked through my window and how the last day was tomorrow. What thought bugged me the most though was what would happen once tomorrow came. I never looked into the peephole once, nor did I open the door.

Picking my son up from school, I noticed he was oddly quiet. I thought it was simply the reaction he had given to the tone I gave off on the drive home. Thus, the day went on, but not before one last reminder of tomorrow that I had no need for. 

I made Sam dinner and sent him off to bed. I skipped story time since I had absolutely no drive to do so and went straight to bed. Once I turned off the lights it took me a minute to turn around, scared I would meet another silhouette. When I did turn around, I saw just that. I could feel my heart rattle while I tried to process what I saw in front of me. Though, as my eyes slowly adjusted to the dark, I could tell it wasn't a head. As it turned out, what I saw was a note taped to my window. I slowly made my way over to the window. I took the note down and began to read it. "I'm so excited for tomorrow!" This drove me up the wall in ways I could not comprehend. I threw the paper to the floor and jumped in bed writhing under the sheets with fear and a wicked headache. I just couldn't believe that whoever this was had taken the pleasure to assure me something bad is going to happen tomorrow. It took me what seemed like forever to get any sleep.

But I should've stayed up. At twelve in the morning I hear the most frightening sound imaginable to any person who would have to have gone through my ordeal.

*Knock* *Knock* *Knock*

I awoke. Fear pulsating through my veins at speeds unnatural to a human being. Shaking uncontrollably. Breathing sluggish. My eyes puffy. Vision slowly coming to me. Pure terror. This is what I had been waiting for, but It came when I least expected it. There was no trance. I knew exactly what I was doing. I got out of bed and made my way to the door. 

*Crunch*

Faster the fear pushed through my entire being. I look down. It's the paper. Before I can regain my composer I see a figure in my window. Right then, they were aware I saw them, and like clockwork, let out the most inhuman laugh I had ever heard. This laugh was one that took its time and crushed any courage that I may have had. I could never in my whole life put it into words, but I will never forget it. They ceased Their laughter and darted away from the window. Once they were no where to be seen outside, the knocking came even louder than before.

*KNOCK* *KNOCK* *KNOCK*

I ran for my bedroom door to get to the front entrance. The only goal in my head at the time was to not let this person find their way in. Then this frightening realization clouded around my head. The paper note. It wasn't taped outside of the window, it was taped inside my room. They had already found their way in. I ran for Sams room first in a full sprint, but when I got there he was nowhere to be seen.

*KNOCK* *KNOCK* *KNOCK*

I ran for the entrance. I tried to open the door but no matter how hard I tried it wouldn't open. I then looked into the peephole and saw something that to this day I have never forgotten. It was my son. He had a knife to his throat. I shuddered. The look on his face wasn't the look of someone scared, sad, or even angry. I couldn't figure it out. Why that face, a face that looked lifeless, a face that had looked destroyed, yet a face that conveyed something I couldn't pinpoint at the time. How could I? I was so scared. I snapped out of my frozen state and started to try and pull the door open while still trying to see through the peephole. I screamed and yelled, but my voice sounded so weak and shrill as it crackled pleads to let my son go. The stranger held up his index finger and slowly started to curl it into his palm. I started to scream "No!" over and over again in my same defeated tone. I was crying. I could feel my heart rattling in my rib cage as if it was about to burst right out from me. My blood circulated through my body at intense speeds. I didn't take a single breath. I trembled as I stood there unable to do anything. I was so close, right there, yet I couldn't do anything. I was scared, purely, and nothing else.  

His index finger finally clasped into his palm, and he did it. He grabbed my son's head and slit his throat. The man then let go of Sam letting him fall to the floor. Then the man walked out of view from the peephole, and as soon as he did so, the door opened. I ran over to Sam and plopped on to my knees while picking him up to put him on my lap. He was trying to say something, but he couldn't due to choking on his own blood. All I could hear coming from him were whispered gurgles as he gasped for his last breaths. How I felt could never be explained by anyone, ever. He looked at me in the eyes, and I could see him, second by second, fade away. All my memories with Sam playing in my head while I watched him die. And then, he was gone.

The police never found who it was, and they knew for fact it wasn't me. Why, you ask. When they searched through my sons room, they found something. It was a drawing Sam had made, and on it was the most horrid thing. It was a picture of his new friends. Two boys were drawn with names above them reading "Keith" and "Mark." But to the far right was a full grown man wearing a hoodie 
with a name above him reading "Jon."

Right then I knew that face, the face my son had moments before being murdered. It was the face of betrayal. I'll never forget it. All I wish now is that I listened to my child more than I did. Maybe this wouldn't have happened, maybe I could have prevented this. If I asked him more about what went on at school, always listened to the end of his stories, found out about Jon earlier, maybe I could have saved him. But It happened, and I wasn't able to prevent it. I never asked those questions and I never listened to the end of his stories. I never found out about Jon until it was too late. 

My little buddy was seven. Seven. That is not a full life that has been lived. I think of him everyday and remember him as the beautiful child I loved and raised. So, from one parent to the other, listen to your children. 
    




 Cool or not, must be a bitch to get off of. 




 Do you like chills? I like chills. Let's chill.

I found this website a little while ago and Would really like to spread it around a bit because honestly the creator of the site damn well deserves a little publicity. To boot, I just feel like posting something so here ya go you fluff balls of furry and... stuff? Ah, I don't know, but hope you enjoy

The Ghost In My Machine:

https://theghostinmymachine.wordpress.com/ 

Have fun getting a little more creeped out today. 




 This subreddit has been up for awhile now. You see the thing is that right after I made this I found out about the subreddit uplifting news. Now I'm sitting here feeling dumb for making this. You see that rules bar to your right? Ya, about that, no rules. Bye rules, I loved you. You can show your humanity by doing what ever the fuck you damn well please here or anywhere else on Reddit and face the consequences. The thing about here is there are no real consequences I guess. Just don't go way mother fucking over board. God, It's like when I was in grade 11 science and tech class and everyone in that class drove my teacher insane... Literally. So, fuck around all you like on here. Enjoy! 




 That twist...  




 In all seriousness, I really do hope there is such a place like heaven that exists for those poor children. I agree good sir, may they rest in peace. ;_[ 
























 All Assholes! All Assholes! Free Dogs! No Charge! 

Get em riiiiight here! There's one for you sir, and one for you my good lady! And oh ho ho! We can't forget little Jimmie here who cries constantly now can we! Frat boys! 

Shout out to all you big fat beautiful asses! Get Your free dogs here for a limited time!

Free Hot dogs right hereeeee!!! 




 Thank you, my friend. 




 Life has all kinds of surprises in store for us that we do not expect. 




 Sorry for cutting those onions. 




 Thank you, I truly appreciate it. 




 Yes, they have. They questioned all staff who worked at the school, and unfortunately they never saw or heard anything about Jon from my son. Hell, I even went as far as to talk personally with both Keith and Mark. They had no idea that my son was friends with a man named Jon. I tried to find as much info as I could, but the frustration came when I had literally nothing to go on as to find his whereabouts. But trust me when I say I will find the bastard. I don't think even God would forgive the things I would do to that man once I have my hands around his throat.     




 My friend, in this life we are given cards on the table that, at the time, can overwhelm us and even give us a true fear. Sometimes our guilt lingers beyond being able to comprehend what we have done or could have done. As with my son, I can tell by your comment that you loved your mother, and I have no doubt she loved you. Pressing on and doing our best to help others, including ourselves, is the best we can do in the end. I hope wherever your road leads you, it will lead you well. Not because you followed it, but because you chose too. I wish you luck my good friend. Never give in, and never give up. 




 Thank you, I worked hard to improve my structure and use words that are less used and feel fresh. Hope you have a great day today! :] 
























 Did you try to find out where the door lead too? 




 Even if this is fake, this still gave me the chills unlike a lot of content I see here on /r/creepy, so I give this props. I'm pretty disappointed in this sub for being filled with pictures that are more, for a lack of a better word, weird instead of creepy. This had a story that really does disturb you, and, despite being fake, gave me a little bit of the creeps. This is what I look for on this sub, but it's incredibly rare that I do indeed find this type of disturbing material. I think we should have a rule here that explains behind every creepy picture that there needs to be a story. No more artwork unless there is a creepy back story to it, no more "My cat is giving me a creepy stare" type pics, etc. I find that the "meat" in these posts just aren't there. In my point of view, when I see artwork uploaded to this site, or a pic in general, it's more of an "oh, that's cool" kind of vibe rather than a "damn, now that is scary." But this is just my opinion, and I just needed to get this off my chest without getting a bunch of "dude, chill man." comments. I think with an improvement to the rules here we can filter out the "oh, that's cool" type posts and get more "damn, now that is scary" posts. Once again, this is just my personal opinion and something I needed to get off my chest. Thank you for taking the time to read, cheers! :] 




 Thank you for this. I've always had a fear of sleep paralysis and after reading this I feel a bit better as to at least have an idea of handling it. (Hopefully I won't have to experience it in the first place.)   




 Thank you very much. 




 What do you think would push him over the edge like that? This is becoming a lot more of a curios case when more questions are asked. Hell, I think there is a whole lot more to this when you look at who exactly wants this information and why they do want it in the first place. This is really tugging at my strings here, and I think everybody, including myself, would love to be updated on as to what you find out. Keep up the good work, Meredith. I'll be looking forward to what secrets you uncover next. 




 Thank you. 




 Thank you. 




 May I have your autograph by chance? 
























 r/creativewriting hope I typed it out right. It's around 2'500 people subscribed there, but I think it's a good place to share with others and get some feedback. Cheers! 




 I like this, but I think I would like this even better on a different subreddit. It sounds to like an epic tale about a crime fighting cat is about to begin, and that very fact is quite awesome indeed, but I would find, personally, that this would be more well received on a different subreddit, friend. Just letting you know ;]  




 Every night I hear something howling outside my window, but I guess it would be better described as a wail. It starts off booming and loud until it shatters into high-pitched screeches, kinda like fingernails on a chalk board. It scared me every single night before I went to bed. After much debate, I decided to go outside and find out exactly what this awful sound originated from. With only a flash night and a couple batteries, I descended into the dark forest.

I'd say it was about thirty minutes of hiking aimlessly before I heard it, the booming wail.

It was loud, indicating that it, whatever it was, was near. I, now hearing it from this close, did not want to stick around in order to find out exactly what it was. I ran. The bushes and twigs I made my way through snapped and rustled violently, loudly. I ran till I found I had no more air in my lungs. Huffing, I could hear the queasy sound of my breathing. After I was able to breath somewhat normal, I took a look around and found that I was lost. "Shit!" I cried. I was so frustrated that I was lost in the dark scary woods. But in a matter of a second, everything became undyingly terrifying as I heard the sound of bushes from afar rustle. Something was coming, and it was coming quickly. Unfortunately I didn't get to see what it was before this large figure popped out from the bushes and jumped right for me.

Everything went black. 

When I first opened my eyes, I found that my vision was fuzzy. Although, I could tell right away where I was, and that would be my bedroom. I was in bed now staring straight at the closet like I normally would every morning. "Was that all just a dream?" I thought. One look in the mirror and I was proven to be wrong. My hair completely rustled unlike the usual morning wake-up do, little pieces of leaves, twigs, and dirt speckled on my shirt and pants, and especially the fact I was wearing a hoodie and jeans of which I wore that night.

This was a very creepy thing to happen to anyone, so that is why I'm here right now telling you this. I thought you might get a kick out of it, hell, maybe even a laugh. I don't know how I got home though, and why I can't remember getting back... Oh well, I'm not dead or anything so I guess I should count myself lucky.

But, there's just this thing getting at me... I've been getting this pretty wicked headache all morning. That's not all, I've had this itch ever since I woke up on the back of my neck. I haven't looked at it yet but I will soon. Everything worked out for the better I suppose. 

Lord, as I'm typing this out I can feel that awful taste in my mouth. Jesus, it really does taste awful now that I think about it, ugh. It's just about the worst thing I think I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. 

This taste in my mouth, It's not completely unfamiliar though... It's not like anything I've ever tasted before but... How can I describe it?

It tastes kind of...

Meaty.    




 It's nice to meet you sir! 




 I'm honestly confused as to why your comment is downvoted. The picture is indeed hilarious.  




 Thank you very much. It was a long read so thank you for taking the time to read through it all! 




 Holy... Shit... 




 Intense. 




 wow... Thank you! 




 I had the worst nightmare. It started out simple, and from there, it took a strange turn. From the get go anyone could tell something was wrong. Hell, I didn't even think nor knew that this was a dream, I just opened my eyes wondering what in gods name I was doing there naked and cuddled up to a tree. Funny enough, it was like I had woken up, as if someone snapped there fingers and there I was, naked and alone. But this was a dream, nothing more. 

The first thing that came to my attention was an old building that seemed to resemble a school or a college of some sort. It stood there being the only thing in the endless field of grass that I truly believed to stretch on forever, the only two things accompanying it being me and the tree I snuggled up against. I had this feeling that whatever I had to do, whatever happened, I should not take one step into the building. Though, then came the rain. My naked body started to freeze and shake uncontrollably as each drop felt like being pelted by a rock. It was painful, cold, and the first sign that this was no ordinary circumstance. It became so unbearable that I forced myself over to the building. The dew on the grass in between my toes and on the bottoms of my feet sent a spike of frost bite each step I took. It was so painful. I had no choice, I had to enter the building my consciousness warned me of. The pain was just too much. 

I had finally made it to this building and entered through the wooden doors. My body returned to its slightly chilled temperature as I gazed upon the giant entrance way. 

The entrance... how does it seem so hard to describe when it's so easy too? 

You see, The entrance was huge, but not in the way one would think it to be. It was empty, bare, completely stripped of life. It was big in length and width, though it was enormous in height. All the walls were completely concrete and the only things that stood out were a huge stair case leading up to a door that was the exact same size as the entrance I had just made my way through. Two tiny windows to the left and right of the door, not to far apart from the door itself, looked to touch to the ground on the floor that the door was on. Now, with this environment I stood in painted out for you, Something seemed completely off about this entrance way. It was familiar, but looked different from the image I was trying to picture in my head. To no avail could I remember where this familiarity came from. The entrance way looked as if something was meant for it, but that something never came to fruition, just like the picture in my head. I felt that, as much as this place started to tug at my mind, I shouldn't wait around for nothing.  

When my eyes met the ground, I saw clothing. Being naked at the time, it was only natural for me to put on whatever clothing I could find. A perfect fit. What I now had on seemed to be a hospital gown, but I knew for certain I wasn't in a hospital. I didn't let this bother me for long though as I wanted to move on. I felt that I needed to keep moving, and when this feeling came, so did the feeling of someone lingering behind. I turned around and looked all over, yet I could see no one, and there is no way anyone could have hid from me in this bare, completely stripped place. I decided it would be best to head for the door at the top of the stair case. 

When making my way up the stairs I heard something humming quietly. As I made my way further up the steps, It got a little louder. It kept building up in volume each step I made, so I ventured a little faster. Though, the more quickly I went, the more quickly the sound dominated the room. At one point it became clear as to what the sound was, and that sound was breathing. It was raspy and forced. This breathing got louder as I made my way up the stairs further and further. I looked behind me and all around but no one was there that I could see. I started to run up the stairs and the breathing got louder at a faster pace, as expected. But when I got closer to the door, the breathing became ear splitting. I nearly fell over when I rushed through the doors. But when I did get through to the other side, the breathing had stopped.

When I took a good look around where I was, I found myself in the hallway of a school. It was dark, and something told me to not go into any of the classrooms. Opposite of the door stood an elevator and two stair cases to the left and right of this elevator. It struck me as odd that there were two staircases, but I didn't question it much. The air was intense and struck this unbelievable feeling of dread coming my way. The silence was, for a lack of a better word, wrong. It was too silent, and that made me think that it was in preparation of something, something bad that is. 

*DING*

I jumped. It was the elevator. I looked over and found that the elevator was coming down to the floor I was on. The only thing that really tugged at my curiosity though was that there were no numbers for the floors. I know this sounds strange, but I didn't feel that the dread was coming from the elevator, but that it would come from somewhere else. Then I heard it, a door opening. It came from the entrance hall, if that's what you could call it. I didn't want to go back inside to check who it was, but right then I remembered the two windows that laid low to the floor. I went to look through the one that was onto my left since it was closer to me. I had to lay on my belly in order to look through to the other side, and when I did, I saw the silhouette of a man who looked no older than I did from what I could tell. He walked into the big empty entrance way and stood in the middle of it, something large in his right hand, and something quite small in the other. He just stood there and looked to the floor. Despite the entrance way being quite dark, this mans silhouette was unable to hide itself in that same darkness. He was, in the only way I could explain it to you, blacker than the whole room. I couldn't keep my eyes off of him. I just sat on my belly, wondering and contemplating as to what he was doing there. Then, catching me off guard, was a -   

*DING*

I turned around to see if the elevator had made it's way down to my floor. It hadn't. From what I could tell, it was just indicating that it had made its way a floor down. Though, even as a small detail, it struck me as odd how it took longer to make its way down a floor than the usual elevator would. I got up on my feet to investigate the elevator. As I did so, the moment I was about to gain full composure standing up, I instantly felt something very wrong. This itching feeling of being watched by a thousand eyes caught me from right under my feet. I looked to my right down the hall, and in each of the door ways, all the way to the end, was one silhouette peaking out from a classroom. I looked to my left to see the exact same thing. Although, it was only when they opened their eyes that the true terror had struck me. The eyes of each silhouette had been wide, and the whites of the eyes glorified by the small black pupil stained over. They made their way out of the class rooms and walked towards me, never blinking once and keeping their eyes wide with the look of pure and absolute terror. I stumbled back and landed on my ass, screaming. I couldn't think straight, so I ended up slowly trying to escape on my hands and knees. Each slap from my palms and the thuds from my knees on the hard, slippery floor hurt. Tears quietly seeping through the cracks of my eyelids while I tried my best to avoid the looks of the silhouettes was emotionally traumatizing. Go, go, go, was all that played throughout my mind. 

And then, the elevator made a ding. It was one floor closer now. Everything, the elevator, the silhouettes, the crawling, had made this the longest minute of my life. The pain I felt now could not even be compared to the pelting rain from before. That rain, as much as it hurt, would have been my haven from this. 

*DING* 

*DING*

Another ding, and another, each time coming sooner than the last. Something is coming, something is coming, something is coming, over and over in my head. Faster and faster the sound of my palms and the echoing thuds from my knees quickened pace as I tried so hard and desperately to get away. The feeling of hands reaching out towards me pumped me with more fear than I thought possible for anyone to go through. This forced my thirst for survival. I needed to get up, and I needed to do it now. I held my breath in and gained the strength to shoot upwards on my feet. I ran to the door as fast as I could, legs seemingly moving on a will of their own, and opened it. As scared as I was, something stopped me dead in my tracks. 

The whole entrance way was on fire. 

I couldn't believe it. When my head locked on to some small portion of sanity, I saw him there. The person who had walked into the entrance way, on fire. Now on the floor to his left and right was a gas can and a lighter. I didn't see the lighter since it was so small and hard to make out from where I was, but it was obvious given the circumstances. 

Then he did the funniest thing. He looked up at me and spoke in fuzzy distorted voice like a broken TV and said, "I did this all for you." 

He then backed away from the middle of the entrance way, and as he did so, a path among the flames emerged. The small separation between the flames was wide enough for me to run through to the entrance, so I ran. I ran fast, furiously with purpose, and made it to the doors that lead beyond the hell I was in.

But before I opened it, I looked back. I saw through the windows that lay low to the left and right of the door up the stairs. behind the glass of each window were the eyes of the silhouettes staring dead straight at me as if they wanted me to come back. That's when I noticed something about them I didn't when I first saw them, it was their skin. It looked as if  each silhouette had cracked skin since you could see tiny slits of pink show through. I was so confused as to what this was. It didn't hit me until I noticed the pain all throughout my body come instantly. I looked at my hands, and they were charcoal and cracked. I felt as if I had been burnt alive. As that thought came, I realized. 

They weren't silhouettes, they were burnt people. 

Then, complete defining screams wailed throughout the hall. Words were in the midst of the screams too, but they were so incoherent that I couldn't make out anything that was said. Now was the time I needed to leave. It took everything to open the doors, but when I finally did, I was greeted with the most calming sensation. The air was light and easy to breath, the rain that came was misty and refreshing. I looked up into the sky in relief and embraced the peace that was present. And as I stared into the ever calming sky, everything slowly faded to white. Then, from white, slowly, the blackness faded in.

I woke up. Once I landed back into reality from the nightmare, I looked around my dorm room, everything seemed normal. It was quiet, not a sound to be heard. I needed to get out for some fresh air after something as traumatizing as what I just went through, so I looked over at my room mate, Samantha, and forced her to wake up.

"Mmmm... What?" she said in a groggy voice.

"I had THE worst nightmare, EVER."

"Oh, really. That's swell." She whispered as she was about to fall back asleep. I didn't want to go alone, so I forced her with some good old fashioned Angelina bribery techniques.

"I swear to god, anything you want right now can be yours. Think of the cheetooooos."

"Cheetos... I would like some cheetos..."

"Then lets get going!"

"Okay. I'll, uh, get something street worthy on and then we'll rock'n'roll in a sec here." She replied, getting up to put some clothes on in place of PJ's.

We walked to the gas station that was open 24/7 and got some snacks and slurpees. I told Sam all about my dream and, with a sleepy smile on her face, comforted me the best she could in her tired state. After talking about some other things, I heard something that took my breath right out from me. 

I heard a fire truck go by. A second later it became apparent that there wasn't just the one,  because after that fire truck sped by, I heard a bunch drive right down the road full speed...

Full speed towards MY college.

I ran back in a full-on sprint, my friend behind me trying to catch up wondering what the hell was going on. When we finally arrived, I just became dead inside, dropping all the groceries to the floor. I stared, completely floored by what had just happened and to what I was looking at.

the college was in complete flames.

My friend and I didn't know what to say, but I don't think we would have said anything anyway even if we did know the words that should be spoken. Not after having me talk about my dream and then seeing this could we even comprehend to what was going on. 

After the fire, they told the community what had happened. No one in the college survived. After many weeks of not even knowing where to start in order to understand what happened, we went through the mourning of our friends. Me and Samantha have become closer friends after that. Each day she says its because of me that she's alive today. I am her guardian angel, as she always tells me. And so on, after all the chaos, I started to wonder about the dream. I'm I a psychic, a fortune teller, why the fuck did I have that dream?

Even after all the questions have been made, I found it unnecessary to answer them. I'm alive today, and hopefully for a long time. In the end, Isn't that all that matters? Even so, That dream... No, that nightmare, has haunted me since. I have never had a dream like that since, and I hope I never do, or, to better put it, never have to. 

I can't just leave it here as I have something I need to tell you, but this is all I will tell. 

If you ever have a nightmare that scars you in a way you'll never forget, it may not just be a nightmare. It may be a warning. Heed that warning, or you may never see tomorrow ever again.
   




 Oh, he knows whats going on. Smart little bad ass is looking out the window straight at a tiger. This I assure you. 




 Smelling salts, huh... smooth, guys. Smooth... 




 Will do, Thanks! 




 I have never thought of this before! I always wanted to try and do some research on what really happened to my friend, but I never knew where to start. Thank you for giving me another theory to work on. This incident is something I'll never be able to forget, and something that I hope to solve, thank you.  




 Look, I still don't know what happened, but for years it's haunted me. Keeping something inside your head as scaring as this is like having a lion in a rusted, old, creaky cage. At one point, you have to tell someone or that cage will break and let something dangerous come out. So here's what happened, or at least to an extant.

When I was twelve, me and my friend, Pat, wanted to try "The jump." "The jump" was this infamous legend passed around the school that captivated every kid who heard of it. The legend was that if you and  anyone else with you at the time jumped off a certain cliff and called out "catch me!" someone would catch you right before you fall. The thing about the legend was no one knew which cliff along the river was the right one to use. Almost every kid in my school had tried and failed. The assumption was that they had all picked the wrong spots, but this only motivated kids further to find the right cliff. I, at the time, thought it was something made up by a student at my school to scare others. But that didn't mean I wasn't a little captivated myself.

One day, my friend Patrick came running to me with this excited look on his face and told me, "Matt, I swear to god, I found it!" Patrick was always a little infatuated with this tale, and as a result of this, he had wanted to find the real cliff ever since he heard about it. He continued on by explaining how he over heard his parents talking about a cliff where someone had died.

"It's got to be the real thing! Someone died there! They have to be the ghost that catches you before you fall!" Pat exclaimed. I was curios, so I decided to tag along and see the cliff that Pat was so sure about.

Now, before I go any further, I need to explain that this is where things got strange. This is the point where I cannot for the life of me explain as to why these things happened. I wish I could, maybe then I could get closure.

When we got there, I could feel a chill down my spine, the uneasiness in the air, and felt as if I had stepped directly into another dimension. But all that was topped off with the drop from the cliff. Even as a twelve year old, I knew that the fall would most likely kill someone. With all of that into consideration, it was Pats enthusiasm that really got to me. I knew that this whole time he had doing the jump in mind, and after seeing the hell-bound fall, he looked all to ready to just fall a good few miles down to his death.

"Pat, are you crazy!? That fall will kill us!" Pat gave me this confused look and said, "What in the world are you talking about? Sure, it's a good few feet, but kill us?" He then continued with a hint of laughter and legitimate confusion, "I think you're the crazy one here."

I was shocked. Pat was always a down-to-earth, smart, and sensible kind of guy. His answer was a slap in the face to me. A few feet? No way in hell that this drop was a few feet. I didn't know what to say, and before I could get any words out to Pat, he turned to face the cliff. 

"Come on!" he said, "We gotta do it together!"

I couldn't. I was scared and could feel my mortality tugging at me. I shook my head and quietly said no. Pat still looked confused and started to even look a little worried for me.

"I'll tell you what, I'll go first and then you can see for yourself if it's okay or too much for you." He then took a good run and jumped.

I ran as fast I could to catch him, but I was just to far away to get to him in time. He yelled "WOOHOO!!!" as he took the leap. It only took three seconds of him falling until he broke out into a horrid scream. I saw him flailing his arms and legs all over in protest until he reached the water. A defining splash sounded out silently as if two hard rocks collided with each other. I knew for sure that the fall had killed him. There is no way he survived from a drop that far down. I didn't cry, I didn't fall on my knees either, I just ran as fast as I could.

I kept running in a full on sprint through the woods. I didn't care about the bushes that scratched at my legs, or the low down branches that whipped my face, I just wanted to run away from there. But out of no where, catching me completely off guard, was the most terrifying thing I have ever heard. It was screaming. It was the loudest, most helpless scream I have ever been able to experience in my life. This literally sounded like the act of murder being committed right in front of me. I kept running and running until I made it out of the woods. When I finally did make it out of the brush, the screaming slowly faded away.

I have never told anyone, not even the police about what happened. Patrick was declared missing, and I somehow grasped tight onto my secrecy of what really happened to him. You have to understand, I was so scared, and I still am today. 

Years later, here I am writing this out in hopes I can find at least some closure as to what really happened that day. It's just that... Out of everything that happened to me that day, It was the look on Patrick's face that has haunted me the most to this day. He looked So... Excited.  




 The Haunting - Absolutely awesome.
