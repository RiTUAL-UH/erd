 i sleep all night and i sleep all day. i have fatigue and exhaustion where i fall and can't walk.  




 i always need someone to talk to.  




 his dose is 60mg or citalopram.  




 he has tried changing antidepressants. at first it worked but it made him have a breakdown so he went back to the first ones.  




 i watch movies and listen to music and read books. i used to be very active but can no longer be.  




 i am in a very loving relationship. we have been together for 2 years. we live together. but our sex life is unfulfilling. it hasn't always been. at the start we had sex all the time and it was amazing. but he is on antidepressants and it crushes his libido and he can't get hard properly or for long. we have tried viagra but it wasn't the same. i don't know what to do. he was a virgin before me. and he is the 17th guy I've had sex with. so sex means a lot to me. it is making me unhappy. we bought a vibrator which spices things up but its not being fucked with a cock. am i being selfish? we do oral which is great but it gets boring. i have thought about leaving him. i have thought about cheating on him. i don't want to do either. should i just be okay with sex every 2 months? we usually do other stuff like fingering and hang jobs weekly.  




 I'm trying not to do anything stupid. my boyfriend is going to hide any dangerous objects in the house. i tell him i want sex but he has got a low libido because he is on citalopram so we don't do anything. i suffer from fatigue and exhaustion and have no energy to lose weight.  




 thank you for the kind words. i just wish i wasn't this way.  




 i wish i was dead. i am usually really apathetic about it. i just want it to happen and me not to have to do anything. 

i have no more energy. 

i want to slice my skin open. i am fighting it. i have self harmed in the past but managed to stop. 

i don't care about myself anymore. i don't wash. 

i feel like i need to do something quick. 

i am in a loving relationship. he has depression and is very stable. he is understanding. but the sex life is diminished. i want sex. 

i am all over the place. 

i managed to ring for help when i wanted to kill myself. i wanted to jump off a bridge. 

i have no friends. 

i have borderline personality disorder. i was on citalopram. i have started a new antidepressant but it is not working. 

i am fat and i over eat. 

i need to vent. 

there us more information but i can never remember all of it.  




 I am in a very similar place. I have been dealing with depression for the past 5 years. i have tried to kill myself in the past. i have self harmed in the past. this is my first comment on reddit and i have joined reddit about 15 minutes ago. i have no one to turn to. i have been in and out of doctors rooms for a while now. I have my first psychiatrist appointment in 2 months and i don't think i can last until now. i haven't self harmed for a long time but i really really want to. i want to kill myself and am fighting it. i am really unhappy. i can't find my way out. also i get really severe pain in my back and neck from the stress of it all. 

its good you are getting help. the line you wrote ' I have a lot of trouble concentrating and sometimes it's hard for me to speak clearly or in complete sentences. ' its like i was writing it because i get that.  
























 ill be your friend  




 thank you for the advice and support. i do want to be with him for as long as possible in my life because i love him loads. he supports my problems as i take antidepressants as well but I've never had a decrease in libido. i will talk to him about a sex therapist. we can think about exploring new things to do. i do get quite upset when he can't make me orgasm but that is rare. i give him direction in what i like but i think the problem is also that he hasn't tried anything in terms of sexual experience and experiments. i have in the past done sex acts outside of the bedroom and in the public but he hasn't so that is something we can do together. maybe get a new sex toy purchase.   




 that is the dose that works for him but not sexually. i think he's going to try and lower it and take something else as well so he doesn't feel as bad  




 are you being sarcastic?  




 i have talked to him about it. I've told him various times recently and in the past I'm thinking about leaving him. i told him yesterday i was thinking about cheating on him. it made him cry.  




 i know how you feel. i am angry all the time. everything annoys me. my body aches. i get fatigued. 

keep venting. keep talking.  




 i dont recall the one that he took at the time  




 he said he will go on different antidepressants  




 i havent  




 i told him it was making me unhappy 
























 i self harmed in 2012 but stopped. i am now having thoughts and urges to self harm.  




 that sounds really cool. what do you study?  




 without antidepressants his libido is completely normal. its a side effect of the medication.  




 i like to go to rock gigs. i watch movies at the cinema. i listen to music. i collect film cameras. what are your hobbies?  




 i can text.  




 i started crying as soon as he started to cry.  




 yes you can be my penpal.  




 i have no friends. 
i disabled facebook. 
i am an introvert.
i have depression. 
i need someone to talk to.  




 i go to all sort of things alone. cinema, concert, restaurant. you go.  




 i go to rock gigs alone. i sometimes go to the cinema alone. i go out and eat alone. its kind of refreshing and independent.

 does anyone else pull out there eyelashes? but tries to say I'm only doing it because i don't want my eyelashes to fall in my eye? 

i also have depression.  




 i have depression and i pull my hair. i haven't had any bald patches. i think my hair pulling is quite mild because i go for long times without doing it. then pull out loads in a few days. i haven't had any professional help about the hair pulling but i have for the depression.  




 i pull out my hair and i have so far not had any bald spots. i am 27. i think mine might be mild because i still have hair. 

i love cats too.

 i have had laser hair removal on my face and neck and chin for 2 years and i stopped because i couldn't afford it anymore. i am still hairy as ever.  




 I have always been hairy. i have been hairy since i was 10 years old. i have tried everything. i have bleached. i have threaded. i have waxed. i have tweezed. i have used the no no hair removal system. i have tried a home laser kit. i have used scissors. i have shaved. i had professional expensive laser hair removal. i get hair everywhere. also i am indian so that makes it even worse. the doctors don't do anything. i feel so ugly. i don't know what to do anymore. i can't keep up with it. i am 27. my mum and sister get hair but its not as bad as mine. my boyfriend tells me it doesn't bother him. he says as long as he has the better beard. is there anything i haven't tried that i can do? is there any meds i can take to lessen the hair? what have you tried? how do you try and not let it get to you?  




 I've been a lot better in the past. I'm going through some things and am really ill. how are you?

 i just feel like i can't distance myself as he comes to the house all the time  




 i have finished my studies but have become ill and can't work. my sister is very religious just like my dad and she sets rules in the house and even my mum is scared of her. my brother is also religious but very laxed.  




 theres a lot to say so i will try to say all the information. i don't even know if this is the right sub reddit to write this in. this will put me in bad light but i need all points of view. 

i am currently 27. i am a woman. i am british. i was brought up in a sunni gujarati muslim household. my childood was pretty perfect and nothing bad happened. my parents were married but divorced when i was about 17. my dad was a sikh but converted to islam to be with my mum when they were both at school. 

my mum started to distance away from islam and is one of the reasons why they split up. my dad got more strict. my mum no longer believes in islam. 

i started to have doubts about islam at a different time to do with my mums doubts. 

i moved away to go to university and felt conflicted because i wanted to date but felt like islam didn't let me. i started to move away from islam a lot. i became very westernised over a couple of years. i lost my virginity at 21. when it was time to move back to my parents city after finished university i confided in my dad that i had met someone and wanted to see them and maybe move in with them. he was a white non muslim and my dad freaked out. what then happened is i ran away to be with this guy. things settled then my family and parents visited me. my dad straight away told my boyfriend to convert to islam and have a islamic wedding. he didn't want to do that i didn't want him to do that either. we had only been living together for 5 months and known each other for about 8 months. the relationship ended for different reasons. 

2 years pass and i get a new boyfriend. he is also white non muslim. i don't move in with him and take it slow. i think he is an awesome guy. i find out through his Facebook that he has extreme anti muslim views and is a member of the uk group edl or english defence league. i like an idiot tell my family and my dad finds out. everyone freaks out. my dad over speaker phone shouts that he is going to hurt my boyfriend and that i need to break up with him and stop seeing him. i shout some hurtful things at him on the phone. he says he is going to get his brother and him and beat up my boyfriend. i say that i am not going to break up with him. things settle down. the boyfriend then dumps me 2 months after all that happens. i move on. 


i used to be very close to my dad and we had a lot in common. we both like the same tv shows and movies as we are both very geeky. we like the same type of stand up comedy as well. my dad used to really support me and i looked up to him. 


the thing is since me moving away from religion and having boyfriends my dad tries to control me. when i was young he ripped off a good charlotte poster off my wall for having eyes. i used to be a goth and he would tell me not to wear certain clothes because it was promoting satan. i had a skeleton necklace and he tore it off my neck once. once when i was 13 he hit me really bad with a flip flop because i was making loads of noise in the morning and he was sleeping because he had done a night shift on the taxis. 

ever since the age of 17 me my brother and my sister would see him on saturdays and get picked up in the car. we would go to the cinema or go to a restaurant and it would be our dad time. 

i had facial piercings when i was about 18 and my dad hated them. said i looked ugly. 

i became vegetarian when i went to university and when he was shouting at me on the phone and threatening me and my then boyfriend he said something like 'this is just like the time you had the goth phase or the vegetarian phase' 


in the past my mum said to him to not mention islam in front of me because i don't believe it anymore and he still did. he went and bought me a book on islam. 

ever since the phone call shouting I've been avoiding him. i don't reply to his texts. i haven't talked to him in 2 years now. he keeps wanting to sort things out and fix it but i don't feel safe around him and i don't feel like i can be myself around him. 

i am now in a new relationship with a white non muslim athiest. i consider myself agnostic now. 

i live with my mum and brother and sister. my dad lives on his own. 

i managed to block his texts on my phone but i ended up getting a new phone. my brother ended up telling my dad my new number and has started texting me again. i want him to say sorry but i feel like i don't want to bother with him anymore. 

my sister and brother want me to talk to my dad again. they still see him weekly. 

when my dad comes in the house i stay upstairs in the bedroom and avoid him. he doesn't come up stairs. 

one time i was going out and my dad saw me, he said hey. i said hey. then i just got out of there. i was panicking. I'm scared he might attack me because I'm so far gone from the little girl he used to know. i feel like he doesn't know me anymore. 

my dad and my mum no longer talk to each other unless its an urgent matter with there children. 

my mum re married a white non muslim and hides it from all her relatives. 


should i try and talk to my dad and sort things out? twice before we have had bad arguments over the same thing. 

should i keep avoiding my dad? 

what else should i do? 

any questions you have or advice will be helpful.

i know I'm going to get lots of hate.  




 i also like to add that my dad has a bad temper and used to beat up my mum when they were together. he said he would break my then boyfriends fingers.

 police  




 i went to my doctor and had some blood tests done. my testorone levels are really high. i also have never had my womb and ovaries checked so in a month i am having a ultrasound to check for cysts. i am on birth control pill. i have been on them for about 3 years now.  




 i am a guji british ex muslim. i was sunni.  




 sorry to hear that you are going through a tough time. i am quite ill also and can relate.  




 i have got a new doctor and will talk to them about my problems and concerns. i had a blood test at the new doctors also. they might not even say its pcos.  
























 my boyfriend tells me to keep not talking to my dad. i have told my boyfriend more stuff about my sister and agrees that she is a nasty piece of work. I've always felt like the outsider but that could be because i also have bpd.  




 thank you for calling me a sweet sweet woman  




 when i did see my dad the most recent i would just be silent and not talk and be like that for hours and it would be easier because i would try to talk and he would call me stupid for asking a question. or my sister would tell me to shut up because i said the wrong thing in front of our dad. so i just got sick of it and removed myself from it by not going and not talking to him.  




 im worried that if i talk to my dad even once it will go back to the way it was and ill have no life. he doesn't even know I'm bisexual and he doesn't even know I'm going to get tattoos done soon. so it seems easier to ignore him.  




 i did a bachelors in photography but i got an ordinary degree  




 i am currently on esa which is a disability benefit.  




 i didn't get a job out of uni because i was suffering with severe depression and still am. i am also ill and in and out of hospital and doctors. i don't have a job. when i am not too ill i get job interviews but never a job. i moved in with my current boyfriend but he couldn't look after me all the time and it was a strain on him.  




 my sister and my mum attack each and i don't know what to do. my new bf has met my sister brother and mum but i don't want him to meet my dad. i have tried to block his number using an app but I'm not sure if it blocks texts.  




 I'm going to have a talk with my mum because she has a rocky relationship with her dad as well. my granddad hit my mum with a walking frame but they still manage to talk still.  




 i also get a lot of hate from my sister about it  
























 i have been to a therapist before and they have referred me to a Psychiatrist to be assessed.  




 sorry to hear that  




 i have 0 money. i have no job. i am on a disability benefit of 73 pound a week. i am really ill and been to the hospital and doctors so many times this year. i have really bad depression. i have unknown illness that is still being looked into. i don't have any friends. 

i want to have a job. i want to have a car. i want to have my own house. 

i know now that i can't listen to anyone else and to do what makes myself happy.  




 i never did 




 i was thinking of showing my dad this post but then i was thinking about writing my dad a long letter. is that a good idea?  




 i really liked the last sentence you said.

 also months ago i replied to one of my dads texts and say that i want an apology. no reply. i block him. on my new phone the most recent text says something like 'i want to know what it is i need to apologise for'  
























 good luck and glad you are getting help  




 my cousin committed suicide on thursday morning. i am going through a tough time. i suffer from depression and have borderline personality disorder. i have been in and out of hospital and doctors about 50 times this year. i had a pain attack a few days ago and screamed down the house from all pain and anger. i screamed at the top of my voice for 5 minutes and someone down the road called the police so i had to explain everything to them. also my sister and mum are abusing each other and hit each other. i have two hospital appointments coming up. one is to get a ultrasound to check my ovaries because i have polycystic ovaries. the other one is to see a psychiatrist and to get accessed. i also collapse from stress and exhaustion. i sleep more than half the time.
