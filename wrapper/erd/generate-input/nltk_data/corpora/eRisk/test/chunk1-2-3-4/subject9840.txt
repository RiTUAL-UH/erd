 Air conditioning. Why is it so noisy and never the right temperature?! 




 I have a laptop with a 10" screen. You can make it full screen and I can read those on the train, but I generally don't like reading off a screen if it's more than 10 pages. 

Also I hate reading off my laptop in bed. I will usually print it off or buy it cause the laptop gets hot.  




 Did you get it? 




 I've got it. I'll email it through. 




 Haha wow how do they enforce that?  




 Yeah fair enough. I was thinking more of publicly available statistics, but of course the insurance companies would record those.  




 I don't think anyone actually records those types of statistics. 

Also, I was providing statistics relevant to car insurance, so I think this is relevant for that purpose.

I am not really saying women are better drivers than men, only that they are involved in different types of accidents. 




 Some stats from my state ([link](http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/roadsafety/downloads/accidentstats2007.pdf)):

* 2007: "More than a quarter of all speeding drivers and motorcycle riders involved in fatal crashes were males aged 17-25. In contrast, only four per cent of speeding drivers and motorcycle riders involved in fatal crashes were females in that age group."

* 2007: "Fatigue was assessed as being involved in at least 20% of fatal crashes. Thirty-one per cent of the fatigued drivers and motorcycle riders involved in fatal crashes were males aged 40 years or more."

* 2006: 374 male road deaths vs 122 female road deaths 


Women and men may have the same number of accidents overall, but women may have more smaller prangs than men but fewer big accidents - so claims cost less ([link](http://www.carinsuranceexplained.com/car_insurance_explained/men_vs_women.htm)).

 




 I agree with this. As much as people pretend like they are okay with a mental illness, they can't shake their misconceptions. 

A girl where I work told some people she had suffered from severe depression and was on anti-depressants, and I heard hush hush comments from people about it, saying things about how she wasn't stable. It was not done in a nasty tone at all, in fact more of a caring tone, but I still feel she is treated differently to other people. She is very capable of doing the job she was hired to do, and I don't think this should be on people's minds when it comes to her work.

 Computer Science! 

I started out in pure science and ended up veering towards Comp Sci.

I know a lot of people who've done IT and a lot of them have ended up working at banks and consulting, but a few are doing different things. 

Downside is that I graduated in a downturn period. Was really hard to find my first job. I went back to uni and studied more and when I came out again it was great! 

I also like how what I can do can be applied to a lot of different industries. As someone with a short attention span for one particular topic, this is important to me.

What I don't like is that IT is often perceived by business as a service, because in most cases that's precisely what it is. 

I love that I am in IT, and wouldn't do anything else given the choice again now. Now it's just a matter of finding a job I like too :)

 Night and Daycare 




 That describes my organisation exactly! I am going a little bit insane here. I don't think I will hang around for much longer in all honesty, but I hope to do something good while I am here.

I like your advice, and I will keep trying to focus on constructively moving things forward. I guess sometimes I have been a little impatient, and don't always understand management's decisions. I will follow your advice though and listen to my manager and other people who have been around the organisation.

Unfortunately, most of my peers aren't much help. I have asked them and a lot of them seem to have given up on improving the organisation as it has proven to be too hard, and just focus on their technical work and the other job benefits, like the paycheck and leave. I've become rather de-motivated lately, as my peers tell me to enjoy the pay/leave benefits and not to worry about the problems of the business. At this stage in my career I am not yet prepared to do that though, and I am hoping this becomes a valuable learning experience no matter what the outcome.  




 It sounds like you have a lot of really good advice to share, so I thought I would ask a question. It's a bit detailed, but I would greatly appreciate any advice on how to deal with my managers.

I have been working at a large government organisation for 18 months and am quite junior.

Although I'm technical I can see a major problem with the organisation (it is primarily a business issue but has ramifications for IT), and I previously raised it with the 2nd in charge (sort of like COO). I regret that I didn't have a solution at the time, as he asked me what I suggest we need to do. I told him that I would need some time to think and reasearch a solution. After I explained that I may offend my managers for raising it directly with him and not my immediate manager, he said he would send an email inviting me to sit with him and with the head of IT to discuss my ideas. 

After this meeting I told my manager that the 2nd in charge would like to discuss my ideas, and he said I needed to present to him first. I saw that as a good thing as it was a chance to get some valuable feedback.

However, since then I've moved to another manager in the IT department, and this manager would also like me to present to him first, and then if he approves I can present to my senior manager. After presenting to the senior manager, if he approves then I will be able to present to the head of IT and all the other senior managers. If they are all okay with it, then I will be able to meet with the 2nd in charge to discuss my idea. 

I believe this process is going to take a few months and it is quite frustrating, as this is just an idea (and hasn't been approved by anyone yet, and is primarily a business idea), and also the 2nd in charge has asked me to go see him.

I don't know what to do in this sort of situation. I know I can go directly to the 2nd in charge and say that I am still very keen but I have been asked to present to others first before I can talk to him, but I know that will annoy a lot of people. I have spoken to my manager to explain that it wasn't really necessary to present to all senior managers first before going to the 2nd in charge as it was more of a business issue. He couldn't give me a good reason why I had to and in the end said he would talk to the head of IT to see if we can just present to him. 

I just feel that they are putting up roadblocks for me and I am not doing this for me but because I really honestly believe that the organisation will benefit from this (and I have attended senior business meetings where they have raised issues relating to this problem that affect the work). The main reason that I think they are doing it is because it will probably create more work for the IT department, but I believe that if the business thinks it is important then that is up to them to decide and not IT.

I would just like to know what you think is the right thing to do in this sort of situation?

 




 I think you need optimism when you're really young. He will be brought back down to earth in time. I don't think you could get through some of the early challenges in life without optimism. Also agree that he has a lot to learn. 

I think business education is good for helping you know how to manage or run a business but not necessarily give you the skills required to actually produce an output. If he really wants to do these ideas, he might need to learn a second skill.  




 Just got home from work, and don't want to think about anything! 




 A dwarf walks into a bar and he slips over a piece of shit on the floor, he walks off thinking nothing of it.

So the big man kills him.

 Best schools/universities: The quality depends a lot on the teachers. 

University advice: Go introduce yourself and don't be shy asking questions in class, or talking to your lecturers. Pay attention when they tell you what the assessments are/how they are graded, and start working on them early. Don't worry about what other people are doing. Don't fail a subject more than once.

Ways to save money: Don't buy shit you don't need. Food costs a lot - take your own food/snacks.

Getting a job: Just get whatever you can to begin with, then upgrade when you can. 

Can't comment on the other two.

 I'm not great at diagrams, but here's my shot at it: [http://imgur.com/INMR5.gif](http://imgur.com/INMR5.gif) 




 Check whether she usually wears gold or silver colored necklaces. Usually people have a preference for one or the other. I'm not sure what things cost there but I'm guessing 9ct Gold or white gold should be good.

If she likes stones, you can pick a stone in a particular color you think she'll like (sometimes jewellery stores arrange their pendants by the color). Otherwise you can go for something with multiple coloured stones or just a nice simple design with no stones or clear stones. You could also look at lockets if you think she'd like that.

Don't get plated jewellery. I think that stuff is a waste of money because it just wears out and then looks crap. 




 Yeah I don't know if it was because of me (my parents never made an official complaint because they thought it would make it harder for me at school) but the teacher left the school a year later. 




 At a school camp I fell into a ditch playing a game and broke my arm. I couldn't sleep because of the pain, and went to tell the teacher that I thought I'd sprained it. She told me to take a drink of water and go back to bed. I cried myself to sleep.

Then the next day a friend had a bandage so I put it on. The teacher told me to take it off because it was dirty. 

I didn't participate in archery or abseiling which is unusual for me because I love those two things, but she kept treating me like I was overreacting.

I got an x-ray 2 days later and it showed a fracture of the wrist. I got a cast and returned to school. The teacher gave me the dirtiest looks and hated me since then. 




 Haha I didn't notice that!

 Yeah that's pretty selfish lol. I mean she could even use it first and then let you use it, and if she really didn't want to use it after that, then she could throw it out and get a new one since a toothbrush is like $2. I hope she at least let you have some mouthwash. 




 Don't worry she might not like you but I love hair and bananas!!

 Their sheep string internet days are meant to be [nearly over!](http://www.digitaltasmania.org/news/14/58)

Although, they said something about Tasmanians being the first to get a [medical smartcard too back in 2004](http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/security/soa/Tasmania-to-get-first-taste-of-Medicare-smartcard/0,130061744,139154706,00.htm) lol. 

Recently I saw a news story about the fast Tassie internet. They were interviewing locals to see how excited they were about their improved connection speeds. There was about 2 people out on the streets in this tiny town, and they ended up interviewing an old couple who probably didn't even own a computer. 




 I'm worried that he was so specific. Is it okay for the dogs to eat a whole citizen, as long as they don't just take bits and pieces? They're not allowed to waste their food when dogs in Africa are starving? 




 I find the argument that a data mining system (and I'm specifically talking about TIA which no longer exists) produces false positives kind of poor, because correct me if I'm wrong, but false positives come up all the time in investigations. For example during a murder investigation, you would have several suspects most of which are likely to be false positives.

I think the real problem is the fact that you can arrest someone on suspicion of a terrorist attack without proving their guilt/intent like you would normally do in a murder/intent to murder scenario. 

In terms of data mining also, although it's impossible, I think it's a broad decision by US citizens - if you know that known terrorists have engaged in a particular pattern of behaviour, and that other terrorists are likely to also engage in that behaviour, is it okay with you if anyone engaging in that pattern of behavior is scrutinized? Keep in mind the majority of suspects are also likely not to be terrorists. I can't answer that question for you, but for me, if the laws around the system protected me from being falsely accused, and the information was only used for the purpose of identify potential terrorists, then I think I may be okay with it. To be clear, I'm not saying that these conditions hold true. 

The second argument that it's an invasion of privacy/risk of abuse due to free access to personal records is reasonable enough. But can't the FBI/CIA/NSA get this information if they choose to anyway? (I'm seriously asking - because I don't know). It sounds like this system just makes it easier for them through the data warehouse (the article actually doesn't say how they use data mining for this system). 

I can completely understand why people don't trust the government with their information, since some of the new terrorist laws don't seem to protect their rights and are open to abuse. Just like a terrorist shouldn't be able to take away your life, the government shouldn't be able to take away a suspect's livelihood based on a hunch either. I think it's up to law enforcement to recognise that statistical likelihood isn't proof. 

It seems to me that the problem isn't really the system and the access to information. But it's the fact that there is a large amount of room for abuse by law enforcement because of the laws relating to suspected terrorists.

 I started thinking... how could you not notice...

But then I remembered my cat is really fluffy too, and we didn't notice she was pregnant until about 4 weeks before she gave birth to a litter of 4 kittens!! My mum was getting a little worried about my cat's weight and my sister felt her belly and could feel the kittens moving around inside!   




 I'm in Australia. Most gay men I know talk like normal people. I don't think most people would even know they were gay. 

Of my good gay friends, only one of the three is outwardly and obviously gay. He does act a bit like a girl so I think his behaviour is more of a giveaway than the way he talks. 

There would be some people here who talk in a certain way but I am guessing that is their way of expressing themselves, and it might seem 'put on' but maybe it is just their way of letting their personality and thoughts shine through. 




 I reckon you could encourage them to go for another one, but if they really want it then just go with it and be there to support them. My dad never came to any of my games, and while I don't care now when I was a younger I took that as a sign of disinterest/lack of caring about what I do (since sport was so important to me). 




 I'd agree with this. I did a *lot* of sports when I was young, and sport can help you in all areas of life - socially, physically, mentally. You learn how to make friends, how to keep healthy and fit, and how to cope when you're under pressure, how to deal with losing, how good it feels when you do win, and how to juggle sports with school and other activities.  




 I'm not sure if this is the same with most pregnant girls, but my sister at least went into a 'nesting' phase to make the house ready for the baby. If there's anything you can do to improve your house then I think that could help.

Also just give her lots of hugs - I've heard a hug has to be 7 seconds or longer for you to get that good/happy feeling out of it.

 Yeah definitely. My blinds were shining bright red when I got up, but now it is more of a grey and just looks a bit like fog. 




 I keep seeing that in all the photos in the newspaper.  My guess is they don't realise it's dust. When I woke up I thought it was red because of a fire, and then I looked outside it kinda looked like weird fog.  




 I'm pretty sick too with the flu - I've been at home all this week. I've had a lot of trouble sleeping the past couple of nights because of my coughing. This morning, I went outside for just a few seconds to take a look after I noticed the red sky, and came inside and was coughing up a lung. 

I can smell the dust inside but I didn't think it was that bad... Staying home today though.

 There's a few different kinds of late for me. 

First, there's the I'm late because I don't care - this usually involves being at work on time. It's true, it's a direct reflection on the fact that I dislike my job. I do wake up and set out to be on time but just feel lethargic and take forever to get out of the house because I know what lies ahead is another crap day at work. 

Second, I'm late because I have taken on too many things. I did have a job once that required me to be at work by 7am and I worked every day til 7pm. I used to always be rushing and driving way too fast, and found it too stressful. This was more that I didn't get to bed early the night before because I had too much on my schedule. I was working full time and studying part time and just had trouble staying on top of my assignments, sleep and work. 

Third, I'm late because I've been held up. Usually I'll be heading out the door and something important comes up at the last minute. It's not intentional but I have to deal with it at the time. Sometimes it's only 5 minutes, other times its longer, but I really try to ignore things whenever I can. 

Fourth, I'm late because I'm disorganised. I really do plan a time to get to things, but sometimes I just suck. Once I was away from my place on holidays, and forgot to turn on the hot water when I got back, and I stank like cat piss, so had to turn on the hot water so I could have a lukewarm shower to get to an event. Other times I lose my car keys or wallet, because I can also be a messy person. I really hate the fact that I'm me sometimes.

Fifth, I'm late because I'm me. Sometimes I just don't feel like I want to rush. It's stressful rushing, and I will probably just feel like crap if I rush. I won't be late for you if you are waiting in an uncomfortable spot for me though. I may be late if you are with other people and you're not waiting by yourself. I am often late if you are waiting in the comfort of your own home, and I'm pretty sure watching the tv for a few more minutes won't kill you.

There's probably other reasons for other circumstances but I can't think of them right now.

Just wanted to also add, it's not personal or intentional. If I didn't care then I wouldn't plan to see/meet you, and I wouldn't bother continuing a friendship. I realise that most people feel that it is inconsiderate and so more often these days I make a conscious effort to be on time, but what's a few more minutes anyway...

 




 For the other experiment, 21 people doesn't seem to be a big enough sample size once you divide them into 3 activity groups. Interesting results with the mice though...

 Some heels are more difficult to walk in. If you're having trouble, steer clear of tiny heeled stilettos, cause you'll probably just look silly trying to walk. 
If you can find something you like with a bigger heel surface area that touches the ground you'll have more stability and hopefully be more comfortable. If you don't mind wedges these can be great.
Another tip is if you're having trouble walking is try not to go for anything too pointy, cause that makes it harder to balance too. 




 Don't show off too much. Like everyone else said, keep to one feature. Otherwise it just looks tarty. Also don't wear anything too tight, being able to see where your underwear is pulling folds in your skin is not a good look. 

Also skirts should be at or below where your thigh starts to curve inwards is a good rule. 

Be comfortable and confident. You won't look classy and hot if you're uncomfortable with what you're wearing and/or can't walk properly, or if you keep trying to cover yourself. 

 




 There's always something to improve in any house, so I'd just pick something and then learn the different ways of doing it. Repeat as many times as you like. Often the best way to learn about something is to fix something broken. I learnt a lot about toilet cisterns because mine wouldn't stop dripping.  




 I am too busy to look after myself, and when I'm not too busy I make myself busy cause I don't want to think about my problems, but then I do and I get overwhelmed, because I don't look after myself and I get run down. Right now I have a broken shoulder and tonsilitis.

I am actually happy today though. I'd rather be injured and sick than have to go to work :) Plus I get to sleep a lot and eat jelly! 




 What's the occasion? How much do you want to spend?

For a view of the harbour - in customs house - [Cafe Sydney](http://www.cafesydney.com). More expensive and you have to book but great food and awesome view for an occasion (make sure you get the balcony).

For cheaper places, I really like Newtown for Thai (Thai Riffic for a nice seating place or Doytao Thai for cheaper food).

Tony Romas near King Street Wharf is awesome for Ribs. Kinda like american food.

My favourite pizza/italian place is [Made in Italy](http://www.madeinitaly.com.au). I've never eaten at Pyrmont but I have at Wynyard. Wynyard is a takeaway place but the pizza was excellent.

 I'm just wondering if anyone has any comments on using XML for data transfer of small data sets between organisations? My experience so far has been good for this purpose and I haven't noticed any problems. The data comes from HP and Oracle systems and we load it into SQL Server.

Also typed XML hasn't gotten much of a mention here. I thought the validation of a data type was a good thing. Does anyone have any comments on typed XML? 




 The emphasis on sport in Canada sounds similar to in Australia. It's not really like the US. We do have sports teams and maybe some students get sports scholarships (not really sure), but it definitely isn't as big of a deal as I've seen when visiting the US. The point made by Anand999 about getting people to fund the university through sports doesn't really apply here.

 I tried this at my work too, but only had my crappy phone to take a photo with. You could see heaps more than without the tape, as in make out objects, but it was pretty blurry.

That is looking out of a meeting room into the photocopier room! The photo is of tape on the frosted side - I could see both into and out of the room. 

Tried putting tape on both sides of the glass (frosted and non-frosted) - this made no a difference to the level of distortion compared to when it was only on the frosted side.

Tried putting tape on the non-frosted side and that didn't do anything - I couldn't see in or out!

 I actually find this interesting cause I have also found that (in my limited experience) that most of the discrimination towards me has come from other women.  




 Yeah my first job while I was still studying was as first level support on an IT helpdesk, and clients would ring up and assume that I was the receptionist and when I explained I wasn't and I was there to help them, sometimes they would still ask to speak to 'one of the boys'. I'd have to tell them that they were busy and ask again how I could help them. The guys were more experienced than me but 95-99% of client requests I was able to fix myself. 




 Being punched in the throat sucks, but I don't know that I'd like being punched in the boobs/chest either. Are they meant to punch you there? 




 Yeah that's tough. I had a friend who was in a similar situation as you. Some of the older female teachers were quite unfriendly. What level of teaching will you be doing? 




 I am a female in IT. I chose this field because I enjoy it, and it turns out I am good at it. I am not concerned about the gender bias because I feel my qualifications and experience speak for themselves, and so far that has been the case (the only time I have been discriminated against it has not affected my career progress). However, I'm relatively inexperienced and I would love to know other people's experiences in similar environments. 




 I will read, and then if I am feeling energetic still, I will write a list of all the things I have to do the next day, and the thought of that sometimes makes me mentally exhausted and I nod off. Plus if you're like me and think about all your problems, planning out the next day gives you something else to think about besides the problems. I also find that coming on the computer usually makes me stay up longer, so using it right before bed is often not a good idea for me if I'm trying to sleep.  




 Yes! I hate it when people do that on travelators and moving walkways too. Those things take so goddamn long. There's a shopping center near me and they have one on every level. Drives me crazy going there. It's 5 floors but if I know I'm going to the top level I take the carpark stairs instead.  




 I would probably call a pest controller. Then you can try to seal up/remove/clear clutter from any places where they are likely to hide. That is pretty hard when they hide in garden beds though I guess, but hopefully they won't go in your house. 




 Well that is bad timing. Just don't do what this guy did and leave his trousers on the floor between gardening sessions: http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,23002709-5013016,00.html

 I was in a hotel in NYC a while back using the net in the narrow hallway cause the hotel signal didn't reach my room. This random creepy guy came past and asked me if I wanted to join the "party" in his room (with one other guy). I didn't use the net in the hallway anymore after that.   




 We recently had our headlamps replaced in our Toyota 4WD with some crappy ones when they broke. I don't think they were a genuine part, or they were 2nd hand. We drive about a 6-8hr drive (each way) at least 2 times a year in winter to go down south on highways and so we have to drive part of the way at night usually (cause we are slow getting away). The high beam on the old headlamps was really bad - I nearly hit a few dead kangaroos because of this. We got them replaced again with brand new ones after some scary driving experiences and it was HEAPS better - I could see at least 10 times as far. Didn't need HID lights, and I don't know why anyone really would need them. Definitely recommend replacing with the regular lights first before trying annoying HID lights. 




 I thought that the sound of thunder was the result of giants bowling in the sky on top of the clouds. 




 Is the $3 for a one way fare? Our tickets just went up today too. I used to pay AU$9.60 or sometihng like that for a return ticket to work on the train from my parents (approx 25km), but now it's AU$10 (USD$8.96/CAD$9.41) return. 

Bus isn't much better. When I'm at my city place (approx 5km from work), it costs me AU$2.60 each way on the bus.

I feel so ripped off.  




 We have trains here (Sydney). Then after 1am or something like that, they have nightride buses for most of the major train lines. Do you have anything like that once the subway stops or do you get stranded in the city/downtown?
 




 I think the gang-rape thing happened once or twice, and it hit newspapers pretty hard. I don't remember it being like a common trend. Most of those guys got decent prison sentences for the really bad rape, but some of them got away pretty lightly. 

The beach thing that happened was really disappointing. I definitely think the media fulled that incident, and I think most of the locals disapproved but there are idiots everywhere and sometimes it only takes a few. I definitely think there was a problem there long before this happened, and I think there still is. I honestly don't know what the solution is. Most of the guys are just stupid teenagers/young adults and are showing off to their friends in the most intolerable ways possible.
 




 I live in Sydney too. 

I agree about the people being rude. It's amazing how lonely you can feel with so many people around. I live and work in the city, but it is a bit stressful sometimes and I miss the open space that I have at my parents in the suburbs. Even then it's not as nice out there as it used to be, since the bush is now all gone and new housing developments went up when I was a kid. I remember when we used to go to the shopping centre everyone knew each other and we couldn't go through without mum having a million conversations... I used to think grocery shopping took forever... but now I realise we had it good. It's not like that as much anymore. 

Sure there are crowds at big events, but then again you don't have to go if you don't like that sort of thing. There are quite a few jerks around that just don't care about anyone else's experience, so you have to learn a great deal of tolerance and not let it get to you, otherwise you can never enjoy yourself. That said, sometimes it's hard to ignore. I went out to dinner one night (kind of late - 11pm), and saw 3 people throw up in the street while we were walking to the restaurant (in the space of one block). I was kind of glad we were too late to get food from for the restaurant. If you are with a group of friends and can ignore it, the atmosphere can be great (as long as you know the best spot to go). 

With the immigration, I agree there's a problem there in terms of people actively not wanting to be part of Australian society. Obviously I am glad some people have cultural identity, and can feel like they belong somewhere, but so often I feel like some have no respect for any other race or culture aside from their own, and often do try to intimidate you so they can force some sort of feeble excuse for respect from you. It's not like that everywhere in Sydney, and I think you can have a completely different experience and quality of life if you live in a nicer suburb as you suggested. I think that's like a lot of large cities as well, and because I haven't lived anywhere very long term I don't know enough to say that other places are any better. I'd like to think they would be though.

I used to go surfing a bit when I was younger and nowadays I don't like it so much. I used to go to Cronulla (where the riots happened a few years back) quite regularly. I had some problems myself long before that incident. I don't like city beaches much anymore. Especially after finding 3 syringes in the sand on separate occasions. That all said I will still go surfing and for most of the time (not hot ones cause those are the days that attract the idiots), it is a nice place. Advice tho: wear thongs   don't build sandcastles far away from the water's edge cause the rubbish tractors don't clear the edges of the beach very well.  

I used to love Sydney because I thought it had everything - beautiful harbour, beautiful beaches, convenient local area shopping centers, good restaurants, good nightlife, multiculturalism, etc. - but as I get older and see more of Sydney I think sometimes I feel that the things I dislike about it are outweighing the benefits as well. 

I have really mixed feelings about this place, and so often I do feel like I hate it. I definitely want to get out and experience other places as well. 

 




 My biggest fear is making a mess of my life, and screwing it up so bad I will lose everyone and everything that matters, and will eventually die alone with my own self pity and regret. 




 Shakespeare had a lot of themes in his plays, like greed, guilt, temptation, love, hate, revenge, forgiveness, violence, jealousy, etc. Maybe if you can pick a theme that interests you it might be a starting point for some ideas. (Oh, and I'm not saying to do a shakespeare style play or anything like that... just to get some ideas).

Otherwise what would interest your audience? Or you? What's something you've learned in life, or a interesting event that has happened? Anything interesting you've learned from someone else?  




 We were out watching fireworks a few years back and after they end the city goes crazy with drunks everywhere. I saw this girl and guy fighting, after which the guy punches her in the face. Probably cause she is a bit drunk she falls straight from her feet onto her head on the curb, with no arm out or anything. I hear this loud cracking noise as her head hits the curb, and the guy walks off, leaving her with her friend. The girl was probably okay because I heard her screaming and crying after she fell. I saw some police nearby who are stopping people from going on the bridge. I walked up to the first one and explained what happened a few meters away and asked if he could call an ambulance. He explained he was too busy watching the bridge. I walked over to the other cop working with him who was clearly the more senior cop and he called an ambulance. Not blaming the cop they were probably overwhelmed but that was a weird thing to see. 




 I think this time she should get all the cash. Maybe next time half :P 




 Explosive Diarrhea 




 I have this (Lite White):
http://www.dairyfarmers.com.au/df/ourproductsandrecipes/milk/dairyfarmersbrlitewhite

I used to hate skim milk but I am lactose intolerant so I get sick drinking full cream milk now. But I can drink this and it tastes good. 

I should get a job advertising this milk. 




 When I was a kid, my sister and I thought it was a great idea to eat hot two minute noodles (including the boiling water) on the trampoline. It was decided I would get up there first, she'd pass me the bowl (which I held on my lap), and then she'd get up afterwards, and we could enjoy noodles and trampolining concurrently.

I burnt my whole right upper leg and spent a few weeks sitting down and having this white cooling cream applied to the burns.  




 The OP annoyed the Twatty guy, who got up in anger and asked the rhetorical question "Do you know who my father is?" as if implying he is a man of great influence or importance, and someone not to be messed with. 

By interpreting the question non-rhetorically you could assume the person really doesn't know who their father is. The OP uses this to offend the Twatty guy by responding with "No. Have you tried asking your mother?" and implying that the mother either slept around or was no longer involved with the father of the Twatty guy.

I'm not great with explanations but hopefully that clears it up. 




 You're welcome! Happy New Year! 




 Looks like you're there! :P 




 Most of my debt is from FEE-HELP/HECS. 




 The only big accident I've had was reversing into my sister's car from the garage cause the outside light was broken and my car is a bit chunky at the back and I didn't look properly. 

Then after this, instead of getting out to check the damage, I drove forward again to separate the cars and pulled out some pipe full of oil that my tow bar had got stuck under. The car was spurting oil all over the driveway. Oh god I'm stupid. 




 Read the news, learn about other ways of life, meet non-US born people and learn some of the other countries' history.

I think learning history will make you appreciate other cultures more, and the things they have done in the past and present.

Also I liked doing charity volunteering a little while ago just on a few occasions, but for the few days I did it, the whole time I was thinking about how little people in these other places had and how much capacity we have to give.  




 Thanks. That's both disgusting and informative. 

Wouldn't wearing socks mean your feet don't dry properly though and you would make the bacteria growth worse? I mean even if I dry my feet with a towel I like to let them air a little bit before putting on socks or shoes. 




 My cousin is like this. He wouldn't eat anything besides meat and rice. My dad used to always ask him if he was constipated. 




 Same with me. I couldn't have any type of cheese unless it was melted on toast or pizza. Then I was introduced slowly to all different types of cheese and I realised that there are a billion types of cheese besides tasty cheese and those cheese sticks which I still think are gross! 

I still don't like all cheese but sometimes cheese just makes a sandwich or a meal! :) 




 Did you get an invite? I have a friend who's been on reddit for 2 months but won't be able to join cause apparently it's too short :(

It sucks cause he's the one who introduced me to reddit, he just didn't sign up for ages! 




 I sent you something small to say thanks! You started something awesome on reddit! :) 




 They have a minimum length of membership too. :( 




 I usually find a comment that says the same thing I would say and upvote it - otherwise you would have 1000 comments that are exactly the same, and that's kind of boring to read. 




 This is awesome. Thank you! Merry Christmas :) 




 I just found this. Thanks! 




 State: New South Wales 




 Cronulla. They upgraded the STP back in 1998 - haven't had any more ear infections since luckily. It used to be the dirtiest beach water in Sydney before that. 

One of my friends mum's also used to surf and now has permanent ear problems from getting ear infections, so I'm glad nothing permanent has happened to me.  




 SMH:
[http://www.smh.com.au/national/skydiver-dead-after-13th-jump-20091128-jxz5.html](http://www.smh.com.au/national/skydiver-dead-after-13th-jump-20091128-jxz5.html)

I think a couple of people die every year out there. I would freak out at that particular place cause they get dropped out right near the highway. I've seen some guys get pretty close to the traffic. 




 Yeah I used to get quite a few ear infections before they upgraded the sewage treatment plant.  




 I've swum there! I'm still more scared of [box jellyfish](http://www.barrierreefaustralia.com/the-great-barrier-reef/jellyfish.htm) than great whites, because with box jellyfish:
 

 You have virtually no chance of surviving the venomous sting, unless treated immediately. The pain is so excruciating and overwhelming that you would most likely go into shock and drown before reaching the shore. 









 I think some of it is to do with attitude towards a problem. 

The bigger the learning curve the more fear you have I.e. the bigger the perceived 'hardness'.

Sometimes learning something new can be really hard, because you might not have all the necessary background knowledge or know the terminology, and so at first you don't take it in. If you persist with it long enough and get past this point, the result can be really rewarding. 

I sometimes think maybe people have found something hard, began working on it but not persisted long enough to get the reward. So the next time they see a problem, they have an even bigger mental barrier because they didn't feel the satisfaction from last time. If this is a problem, at least for me I found the best thing to do is break it down into parts and then each time you understand a part you will feel a bit better - trying to understand a huge problem in one go can be really demotivating. 




 I went out with a guy that smoked and I didn't let him do it around me. I didn't break up with him, but I still didn't like it.

I don't consider objecting to someone else smoking as being controlling - more that you care about that person and don't want them to get addicted, waste money or damage their health. In reality, I could never stop him from smoking - he could just do it behind my back - but I did tell him how I felt about it and in the end he made his own decision to quit. 




 * Like this magnet on metal we joining together,
So make sure you're there when we make it forever.

* You might remember this date in your head,
But to be safe here's a magnet with the date we will wed.

* We'd love you to be attending our wedding, 
So here's a magnet so you don't go forgetting.

* Put this magnet somewhere you'll remember,
The date we'll make our vows together!

* This invitation has a magnetic field,
To make sure you're there when we seal the deal! 




 Don't you get cockroaches or insects? I live in a unit - if I left dishes out the cockroaches would come from all the other units and infest my place.  




 I don't expect everyone to smile back or that they are necessarily depressed cause they don't smile back, but I like it when they do.  




 It's for the buses. You buy ten trips in advance on Sydney Buses, and put it into the green ticket reader box when you get on a bus and it reads the magnetic strip and prints the trip on the back (bus number and time). They've been around for a while but you didn't have to use them before.
See the [Transport Infoline Website](http://www.131500.com.au/faresandpasses/sydneybuses_travelten.asp). Looks like [this](http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/object3/1528/118/n91760107804_3407.jpg) - non-concession adult has white instead of yellow background. 




 Everyone poops! If you didn't paint her walls with your poop I don't see any problem. Besides that, I guess it's her fault if her walls are so thin she can hear.
 
I can think of a few things you can do though:

A) You can try turning on the tv or radio beforehand if possible. Then just let it rip. Flush it and act like nothing happened. Avoid going near the bathroom for a while.

B) Get her to go to the toilet first and then act subtly disgusted and pretend like it sounded/smelt horrible. Then she'll be so worried about how horrible her poo was she won't even care if yours sounds/smells bad. 

C) Show her how awesome the poo you just did was. 




 Friendliness. Where I live people can be pretty unfriendly, and I hardly see people smile... it's kind of sad. I try to smile at people (whenever it's not weird) and I really like it when people smile back. :)  




 It's kind of hard to notice things when you live here cause it happens so slowly when you're here. Here's a few things I can think of off the top of my head:

* The Harbour Bridge and some other places are now cashless. You need one of those e-tags to cross it now. I hate toll roads. 

* Buses around the city require you to have a travel 10 to get on/off buses during peak periods (I think it's 7am-7pm but I can't remember), so you can't pay cash to travel. I think this is probably a good thing but most people who travel regularly get Travel 10s anyway cause they're cheaper. 

* There was some stuff going on with Bikie Gangs which is still happening. They [bludgeoned some guy to death at the domestic terminal](http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/03/30/2530292.htm). 

* The international airport (departure) was getting upgraded and had barely any food in the food court there. It sucks to hang around at before a flight. [Due to finish 2010](http://www.sydneyairport.com.au/sacl/International-Terminal---Expansion-and-Upgrade.html).

* If you're already in Australia this won't make any difference but here anyway - 
[Utility costs have gone up](http://www.switzer.com.au/latest-news/news-stories/record-lift-in-utility-charges-proves-inflation-bogy/): 
Utility charges rose by a record (37 years) 10.2 per cent in the September quarter. Utility charges rose by 13.4 per cent over the year  the biggest increase in 26 years.

* Pitt Street mall is going through an upgrade. Not a very pretty sight at the moment (not that it really was before).

* RTA penalties for speeding have changed a few times now. P platers have zero alcohol limit now, and there are some new anti-hoon laws. 

* More and more school zones have flashing lights now when it is 40km/h

* God damn birds! I used to open my balcony window in the mornings, but the miner birds are trying to nest, and a pair flew into my unit (I'm on the 4th floor), as did a pigeon. Pigeons at least are pretty predictable and so that one just kept flying at the window trying to get out. I caught it with a towel and let it out. Then a few days later some miner birds flew in and were scared shitless of me, so shitless, they shat all over my unit. I had bird poop everywhere. This, along with the time a turkey tried to steal my lunch, now mean I only like some birds. 
 




 I hate cyclists mainly because of their outfits. How streamlined do they really need to be? I want to hold my food down. 




 Thanks for this article. I heard so many different opinions and didn't really understand what was going on. It makes more sense now.  




 From the Telegraph: [link](http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/grant-edward-brown-refused-bail-after-being-charged-with-unprovoked-attack-on-circular-quay-to-manly-ferry/story-e6freuy9-1225798655514)

**Grant Edward Brown refused bail after being charged with unprovoked attack on Circular Quay to Manly ferry**

*November 17, 2009 3:31PM*


A PERSONAL trainer accused of striking a 70-year-old man in the head in a bout of unprovoked violence on a Manly ferry has been refused bail for the protection of the community.

Grant Edward Brown, 31, was charged with recklessly wounding after the incident on the Queenscliff ferry shortly after it left Circular Quay at 6pm yesterday.

Police allege Brown, visiting from Tasmania, struck John Edward Lane once to the face, causing him to fall heavily and his head hit the ground.

Documents tendered to Central Local Court this afternoon have revealed Brown was allegedly talking loudly and aggressively on a telephone shortly before the incident.

To the unknown person on the phone, Brown allegedly said: If someone on this ferry gets their head punched in, it will be on you.

A short time later, he was allegedly acting aggressively, kicking walls and bins before a companion of Mr Lanes then alleged approached him and told him to calm down.

He refused, threatening to bash your head in.

When Mr Lane then interjected urging him to relax as well, he was told: Step away, I swear Im going to punch your f***ing head in.

He then allegedly struck Mr Lane with a closed fist, causing the victim to fall to the ground and strike his head on the deck.

Witnesses have told police of seeing a large amount of blood and then hearing the accused man become hysterical: Someone help him, someone help him.

Magistrate Allan Moore refused the Tasmanian bail, saying he was not satisfied that the community would be safe if he was released to bail.

The case will be re-mentioned on Friday.
 




 Sure they have good facilities but how come it still looks so grey and work-like :( 




 I'm not sure if you mean modern day or older times, but for people who really travelled long distances, look up the older explorers from before the 19th century. 

You can start with this [list of explorers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_explorers) on Wikipedia. 




 Do you live under a bridge? 




 This is good but more relevant for essays and reports I think. 




 Those are pretty good. I like the [single fork](http://www.moolf.com/images/stories/Interesting/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe-9.jpg), [can lid](http://www.moolf.com/images/stories/Interesting/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe-14.jpg) and the [bee](http://www.moolf.com/images/stories/Interesting/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe-33.jpg).  




 Yeah that's the difference. Ours get a decent wage so we don't have to tip. 

I also only recently learned you have to tip in Canada too. I thought they had the same system as Australia. 
 




 Does it vary from place to place or is it the same all over the US?
 




  Try to die in a month when the demand for funeral services is low.  Perhaps the summer or a temperate spring.  Your loved ones may get a good deal that way.

Okay I'll do my best. 




 Some of the first shots at night are a bit too dark to really see anything, or from different angles. The later ones are good. It's interesting to see most things haven't changed that much though. 




 Did it taste like Fanta?  




 Can someone explain to me how tipping works?

I gathered this:

Most places: 15%

Small towns: 10%

NYC: 20%

And then is it 5% either side of that if you liked or didn't like the service?
 




 My uncle went on the Queen Elizabeth II cruise ship and it was all you can eat all the time. He said there were some americans that had the following meals (each with a full buffet style serving):

* Breakfast

* Morning Tea

* Brunch

* Lunch

* Afternoon Tea

* Dinner (Entres included)

* Dessert

* Supper

When they docked they didn't have enough time to unload all the human waste - there were trucks lining up to take away the sewerage, so the ship left with still plenty of gunk on board.

He is not young (75+) and he said they were the fattest people he'd seen in his life. 




 Yeah :( 

It took me ages to notice too cause I always stare out the window. I only noticed once we went into the tunnels and I saw his reflection in the window.  




 I get the train and the bus, and I don't like public transport because:

* It's expensive

* It's slow

* If the buses fills up they don't stop to let passengers on. So you can't rely on it to get you somewhere on time. The next bus might not be for another 20 minutes.

* Has sick people spreading their illnesses

* It's uncomfortable and crowded - sometimes I can't get a seat and have to stand up, and sometimes I get squished by someone, I also do my groceries and have to carry them on my lap because someone decided to sit next to me with all my groceries instead of one of the other free chairs.

* It's dirty - people always leave their rubbish on the train, especially the later ones after peak hour.

* Bad experiences - a guy once jerked off next to me on the train.


I still catch public transport only because

* It's still slightly cheaper than driving

* The train can be faster than driving in peak hour

I sometimes stay near work and just walk to work, but it is 4km over fairly hilly terrain and can be a little tiring after a long work day, and not that safe. 




 The rule only applies to diagraphs ([link](http://alt-usage-english.org/I_before_E.html)). 




 Or nutella and banana! 




 Fair enough, I guess I found it hard to know what to buy. I half expected that multi grain bread would be just savoury type bread with grains in it, but it was heaps sweet. We don't have any bread that is sweet in the supermarket. Maybe if I went with an American they could have shown me what to buy.  




 I just went to a regular supermarket.  




 Don't worry about that! Just go for it! Have a little faith in yourself. The more obstacles you overcome the more confidence you'll gain, and things will hopefully become easier for you the more experience and knowledge you get. 




 I have always had pretty clear skin, but acne never bothered me on anyone else.

My ex had a lot of acne. When he got older it just went away naturally. He got a face peel done and it looked like he'd never had acne in the first place.  




 oink oink 




 I think what's gross is how pretty much all American food has a high concentration of sugar. For example, bread, cheese, breakfast cereals. The cheese from a regular supermarket there actually tastes like McDonalds cheese, and the bread is like lolly bread. Where do Americans go to buy savoury things, or things with no sugar?  




 I love avocados! 




 I think the US has the largest meal sizes for McDonalds. It's bad enough in the small sizes but the big sizes are just sickening (yet somehow still tasty). 

Their small meal size is equivalent to our medium, and their medium is our large. I'm not sure if a US-sized large McDonalds meal even exists here. 




 Does anyone actually finish their plate there? I've been to the US a couple of times now and I never finished a meal. They were like family sized servings. 




 I don't think your host family is representative of the rest of Australia. We eat pumpkin plenty. But we just don't normally make it into a pie. 




 Sorry, I have no idea. I'm not in that area. I'd need the name of the article to find it. Can you remember the author or journal name? Maybe try a search there. If you can find an link online that's even better. 




 Did you have to pee when you woke up? 




 Bleach is the way to go. Just make sure the room is well ventilated.

Also [DON'T mix bleach and ammonia](http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/classic/A795611). It produces toxic gases. Ammonia is contained in some household cleaners ([link](http://www.npi.gov.au/database/substance-info/profiles/pubs/ammonia.pdf)).

  




 This is all John West's fault. We don't have to have the best!! All tuna is excellent. 




 Take lunch breaks. For my first job I didn't. You need that - even 15 minutes - to just have a break and calm/de-stress yourself.

 Good Irish Yodel Farts? 




 Go in for the kiss and when she closes her eyes to wait for it, slap on some wax and let it rip! She'll thank you later. 




 Bad timing 




 A table was standing next to two stacked chairs. A gnome wearing a pointy hat was learning how to dance. He took three steps right and knocked the chairs off their neat stack. 




 Also good if you're paying for part of a meal shared with friends. Then you can just round up the amount to the nearest whole note you have. 





























 I was looking for something else and I just found a story about a real life Lassie (except not a collie rough):

 :) I really really want one. I live in a small apartment but hopefully I can move out soon into a house and get one. We also had a cat we got at the same time and they were best friends. My cat used to curl up in the dog's fur and sleep. I have a better photo somewhere - I can't find it at the moment - but I love this one of them playing together: http://i.imgur.com/EG6J8.jpg.
...though my cat doesn't really look too happy about this game hehe. 




 It was 12 years ago now and thinking about him made me shed a tear. He was ours from when I was a toddler and he was a puppy. Collies are such loving and loyal dogs. I went through some difficult years too and somehow he always made me feel so much better and less alone. I always felt like he knew how I was feeling and just wanted to make everything ok. You're lucky to have him. I wish dogs lived longer.  




 My dog looked almost the same. I miss him so much. He was my best friend for so long. He used to let me cry on him and hug him when I was sad. 




 It might be 40 degrees on occasion in January but usually it's not that hot - check out the weather charts. You'll be here 8 months too so will get cooler in Winter to something like what it is now.

I live near Annandale and $200 is cheap. Start looking now (just to get an idea) on www.domain.com.au for rental places. You can use the ipad app to search around UNSW if you want to. It's pretty good. 




 I got the flu and had similar symptoms. My muscles were really achey and my skin hurt to touch. I was really exhausted but couldn't get comfortable or sleep properly, waking up several times in the night. I was a bit restless. I think I also got a cold while I had the flu, and got really phlegmy. I got a really bad cough and it wouldn't go away. After two weeks of this, and occasionally coughing so hard I threw up a few times, I got some antibiotics. They helped a bit but it didn't just disappear. I got sick in around June and feel about 95% of my healthy self. Cough is still slightly lingering though. I think I just need more sleep. 









 When you do find your own place you will probably need a car to go buy stuff for it. There are a couple of carshare companies (e.g. goget) running in Sydney around the city areas, so this is handy. You can use them to pick up furniture from Ikea at Tempe or Rhodes if that is your thing. It's also handy if you want to get out of the city for the weekend. I have a friend who moved here from Sweden and he is using them as he only needs a car occasionally and he said it is quite good. 









 I went there in April this year. I hadn't been since I was a kid. I copied some photos for you here: http://imgur.com/a/vOeL5.

The turquoise lake is just outside the entrance Jenolan caves and is a really short round trip walk (takes about 15 minutes if you walk slow). 

Just a quick couple of notes. You need a whole day down there, and you should do a cave tour. Inside the caves it is cold so take a warm jacket and good walking shoes. The road is one way down the bottom where they allow inbound traffic only for about an hour or so of the day to allow buses to get down there. 

Oh and go early - especially on long weekends - tickets to some of the more popular tours book out early so you will have to wait around for your tour if that happens. I think you can buy them online (not sure?) which is probably the best idea if available. 




 I think it is great that you are having a positive influence on your daughters life. I don't think religion is as bad as many people make it out to be, although often people stop challenging the system of beliefs put forward by their faith, and that is the most worrying. 

I agree with BlackdogLao that teaching philosophy also is a good idea. When I studied it at uni, everyone had their own input, from all different religious and non-religious backgrounds. Nobody was wrong, but nobody was right, because most philosophical issues are not that clear cut. For example, questions like "You are on a beach and there are 2 people drowning. You can only save one. One is a young person about 21 with their whole life ahead of them. One is your grandfather who may only have a few years left to live. Who should you save?". Some systems of belief teach you that you should save the person with more years to live, but of course most people will want to save their grandfather. 

I am glad you have her interests at heart and it seems you are trying to provide her with a good education. When she gets older she can make her own mind up.  




 You know you can get a door wedge for that? 




 I think entitlement is one of the things that can really tear siblings apart when their parents get old. 

I would prefer my parents teach me how to manage the money that I have/make, than just give me things which I did not earn. That said, a helping hand is good on occasions for the right things.  




 When I was really young we stayed at a motel where they put dishwashing liquid into a glass next to the coffee and tea. I thought it was a welcome refreshment and I drank it. I wish I became a human bubble gun, but I just felt really sick. 




 Not worth it for a lifetime of ridicule. 




 That's spectacular. Makes me want to go there.

 Hobbits would have been good. I wish I saw a show about Hobbits. 




 It looks like Sylvania Waters from the heli shot. 




 Being from the Shire I watched this show only to see what it was. I thought it might be good for a laugh but it wasn't entertaining in the slightest - none of the characters intrigued me, and there was no life story which I wanted to follow. I really don't care what happens to them. I wanted to stab myself in the eyes with a ballpoint pen. I could never put myself through another episode.  




 I'm from Australia. I didn't know it was called bell pepper in a lot of other places until today. :) 









 hehehe cute cat :) He/she has getting in the box down pat, just not the getting out part :P  




 I am currently suffering in really cold air conditioning and searched for topics about air con :P 




 It depends what climate you live in. I went to North Queensland with 95% humidity and 35degC heat, and went on a snorkelling tour where I got heatstroke. And since the water was 26degC it wasn't even cooling at all. I had to go hang out in the shopping center because it was the only place I could get cool in the aircon. 

But being back in Sydney I could easily go without air conditioning. And I actually I find it to be too cold most of the time, especially since every part of the office seems to get different amounts of cold. I also find it circulates all the sicknesses throughout the office and that tends to be worse when it's cold air than hot air.

In the end especially in shared spaces, I would rather have neither. I would miss heating a little bit, and I would miss air con a little bit, but only at the mid-winter and mid-summer days of the year. The rest of the time I'm fine, and since everyone has different preferences for hot/cold it's hard to make everyone happy. At least if nature sets the temperature we save on energy costs/waste. 




 I'm in Shanghai. My flight was actually due out tomorrow (Sat 7th Aug) night but it looks like it will most likely be delayed. I have never been through a Cyclone/Typhoon/Hurricane. I'm in a 12 storey apartment building. I know the basics, like fill the bathtubs with water, get drinking water, non-refrigerated types of food, batteries, torch and radio. 

I'm not sure if I should go to the airport or not - I plan to try to clarify closer to the flight time, but I want to ring in the morning because they will probably be flooded with calls tomorrow afternoon.

I'm expecting lots of rain, power outages and closed shops. 

Is there anything else I should do to prepare/be aware of?  




 I would be interested in the answer to this. More the un-homelessing part.

 Depends if you want to go on a weekday or weekend and what time, and I don't know your price range but I just thought of a couple of places I've been off the top of my head you could look up in the cbd:

* Max Brenners near Wynyard station
* GPO cafe (not sure of the name) - There's 2 inside
* La Guillotine behind Town Hall (actually a restaurant)
* Lime Cafe
* Boy Charlton Poolside Cafe (http://www.poolsidecafe.com.au/cafe/home/) - good on a nice day

 I did this a lot after I got a new fridge. I kept misjudging how far out the door came and my toes would get jammed under the door between the door and floor as I opened it. I think if it got the big toe it would've stopped the door from opening, so I'd have to be in the perfect little toe stubbing position for the fridge to cause any damage... and it happened a lot.  




 I don't know much about bullying or what to do about it but this site seems to have some good advice:

 I wish I had a maths teacher like you. I also wish I was a better maths student in High School. I used to play up a bit cause I didn't understand some of the concepts so to entertain myself I did other things in class. I should have just asked for help.

The gap from High School maths to Uni maths was huge for me. It wasn't actually that I couldn't do it, but that I didn't know what I missed in High School that I needed to know to learn what I was learning at uni (if that makes sense). I got my friends to tell me and I was fine. And after getting past that hurdle I actually really enjoyed Integral Calculus at uni. Second year maths was much more fun that first year maths. I now do a lot of applied maths and I love applied maths even more. 




 Yum 




 Wow great explanation. 




 I'd like to understand why you prefer Australia to be a UK colony?  




 Unless he is the Queen and he holds the highest rank. Then it works.  




 The UK National Anthem "God save the Queen" seems somewhat similar to the US Pledge of Allegiance in its intent.

Australia still has "God save the Queen" as it's Royal Anthem (which I actually only just found out cause nobody here uses it really, I think it's just reserved for royal visits which happen once in a blue moon). Though it was replaced as the National Anthem in 1984. I'm not sure I like the one we have at the moment either. I wish Australia didn't have someone else's Queen. We have for the most part nothing to do with the UK. Unfortunately the referendum in 1999 shows a majority (around 60% of Australia) still want the monarchy. Doesn't help that the white Australia Policy was only abolished in 1973 and official Anti-Discrimination laws only came into place in 1975, so many of the older generation have British roots. I think we just have to wait for those who like the monarchy to pass on. 

Some people want to move forward, but a lot of people like to have a firm hold on the past. 




 That's awesome. I have a genuine respect for EeePCs. Especially how good value for money they are. It did everything I expected and more, and the build quality was excellent.

As long as you back up the data then even if you break it after being a bit rough (which I generally am with things), you can get a new one for cheap. Not that it will break that easily though...

I'd recommend checking out the new EeePC's too.  




 Prouds is okay. Better on sale. 




 What did you do to it? 

Do you put it into sleep/hibernate while you move it around? Cause if not that's not too good for most hdds. 

I have an Asus EeePC 1000H. I literally dropped it down the stairs (in sleep mode) and it's still working 2 years after the incident. 

If you're really rough maybe you should consider a Toughbook or at least get a laptop with a ssd. 

 




 It's his brother from another mother! 




 Thanks :) Sucks a few little sections are missing in a few key spots in the video, but I have a better understanding now. 




 Also dowels are a key ingredient for making meth. 




 This is pretty cool, though I wish you could have the option of continuing to display the images after changing the text. 




 He did say really fast train, though the train in his picture is not very aerodynamic. And also it's powered by steam... possibly magic steam. 




 That sucks. Are electricity prices up for you too? I get a quarterly bill and my electricity cost is double what it was for the same quarter last year. I think I've used a bit more electricity but I don't think I've used double.  




 I like pictures with movement and personality! Kinda reminds me of a [galah](http://www.mariannedepierres.com/wp-content/uploads/galah.jpg) but not pink. 




 The first argument brought up at least 5 times in this article point to women only being after money. Sure, there may be some women like that but there are also plenty that are not. 

The second main argument is that women want to crush their husbands hopes and dreams. Seriously? Firstly it's not going to be deliberate in most cases - you wouldn't marry someone with the intention of making them unhappy. Secondly, we all have decisions to make and being in a relationship means considering their wife and kids. Just like for a wife, being in that relationship means considering their husband and kids. If you aren't willing to make those compromises then yes, you shouldn't be in a relationship regardless of whether you are a man or a woman. However there is so much to gain from a loving relationship, so you have to decide what's more important to you.

The third thing I take issue with is that the poster implies that he shouldn't need to pay child support. Maybe sometimes the amounts are unfair, and if that is the case I see the point, but why shouldn't both parents be equally involved in the upbringing of their kids? 

If you really have this hatred for marriage then maybe it is best you don't marry. I wouldn't want to be in a relationship with someone that resented me. 




 I was wondering how you would remove these things, and thought this was relevant:

http://www.cyber-nook.com/water/Solutions.html

Maybe if you combine a certain types of filters with boiling it would be fine (or maybe you can just use a filter - not too sure). 

As that site says, depends where you live and what type of contaminants are in your water.  




 Maybe if she stands on a chair it would work. 




 I was wondering though, if you were in Johannesburg would you be safe carrying that type of equipment around? Would people still take that risk? I feel like you could just get mugged at any time there. 




 I liked the video. 




 He looks like he just ate a whole business of flies! So full! 




 The CBD is okay but a bit more expensive not only in terms of rent, but groceries, bars/drinks. Of course it is probably more convenient if that is where you are going to be working. 

In Glebe you don't have to get the tram, and personally I wouldn't unless you need to be in the city in a hurry and work along one of the tram stops (because it's expensive and it doesn't go right down into the more central parts of the city like Town Hall/Wynyard). The buses are a bit slow   busy during peak hour though I will admit - especially if you are catching the ones that go up Glebe Point Road. I think if you work in the city from Glebe, walking or biking is probably the best option (  cheapest). You can walk straight through Pyrmont and be in the city in around 30-40 mins (approx 3-4km walking). The bus is fine for most other times (rainy/cold/dark days) and taxis are usually $20 if you have a night out and miss the last bus. 

Some of the other areas suggested are good too though, but it depends on what you're after exactly. 




 Not to say it doesn't happen - but I've never heard of anyone getting typing strain (that I know). Is there anyone here who has?

I find my problem is not that I can't type fast enough but that I can type faster than I can think... stupid brain! 




 I go in the shower and blow my nose into my hands and then wash it off. I find the hot steamy water loosens it up so it comes out freely.  




 Tilt your head to the right and look at it. 




 It can! Apparently!

 Me too! My mum used to be a typist on a typewriter for the railways. Does your mum press the buttons real hard and deliberately? I saw another lady on a public computer in the shops once and she typed like my mum and I think she might have been a typist too!  




 Yeah it's always hard because even if they don't intend to hurt you they sometimes do because, well, they're people. And it's often people you are close to as well that hurt you the most because they're the ones whose words and actions you care about. :( *Hugs* 

The result won't always be the same though. It sounds like it turned out badly this time, but it won't always be that way. You actually sound like a really strong person in that you are clearly trying hard and you have overcome a lot of things to get to the point you're at. It might be good to lower your expectations a little, take things a little slower, and of course give yourself a break if you need it, but don't give up on what you want. You will get there. 




 Your comment reminded me of [this](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=depressions-evolutionary) article.  




 Did something happen today? 

It sounds like you're trying really hard to make your life better - don't give up. It's a difficult thing to do but you can do it. 




 I like the ones that are slapped on haphazardly. Goes with their parking style. 




 Yeah I'd go for lazy as well. He probably should have put in a little bit of effort thinking up a better excuse though. 




 Lol yeah, on the way to the zoo I saw some rednecks and thought we were already there. 




 It was for a conference. It was a pretty strange place to go for my first trip there but I didn't mind it! The zoo there is pretty good for a little place in the middle of nowhere. 




 I met another Australian on a plane once while I was there who did it. He said his experience involved a bunch of kids whose parents have too much money, neglect them and want to send them away for the summer. He was saying he didn't really like it that much. But I'm sure there are people who experience it differently. 




 I'd like to see an American do this on a world map. 




 That's true about that. I used to think I'd like the technology there, cause when I was in primary school I had a friend who went there and she told me all about how everything was automatic. But when I got there none of that really impressed me, but I was incredibly impressed with the Grand Canyon. I was also impressed with Niagara Falls, tho I would have been more impressed if I could feel my extremities. 




 I didn't know it was about the politicians! Actually I didn't even know it was called the windy city until I was coming down for landing in the plane and it was really turbulent. That's when the guy next to me told me about it being the windy city. Felt like it made sense at the time.  




 My first destination in the US was Omaha!  




 Thanks! That is awesome. I didn't know about old versions of magazines on Google Books.

Also look at page 168. Made me laugh.  




 I managed to dig up some information that shows people are trying to do something to help those who have been attacked:
http://www.newser.com/story/35103/pakistani-salon-hires-fire-acid-attack-victims.html
 Pakistani women disfigured by acid and fire attacks have found a second lifeas beauticians, the AP reports. The head of a well-known Pakistani salon chain discovered 5 years ago how commonly women are maimed by crazed or spurned lovers. With the aid of an Italian surgical nonprofit, she has helped many heal and put them to work.

Yet victims outnumber the jobs: 33 Pakistani women were singed by acid attacks and another 45 set on fire last year.


(On a side note, it's good they can work, but wouldn't working in a beauty salon be pretty depressing for them?)
 

And to prevent future attacks in Pakistan:
http://www.ethicsinaction.asia/archive/2010-ethics-in-action/vol.-4-no.-1-february-2010/acid-attacks-a-serious-concern-in-pakistan
 On 26 January 2010, a bill regarding acid violencewhich would specifically target acid related crimes by providing graver punishments for the attackers and by regulating the sale and purchase of acidwill be submitted to the National Assembly of Pakistan. But this only marks the beginning of a long legislative process and it will require some time before the law is successfully adopted and effectively enforced. It will also require a strong political will, which until now, has proven inadequate, if not nonexistent. Indeed, in most of those cases, the judicial institutions have not taken stern sanctions against the perpetrators, which have often been able to walk away in total impunity. Nor has adequate compensation and support been granted to the victims.


And there are new proposed laws in some other countries like Cambodia:
http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2010021632077/National-news/acid-attacks-could-earn-life-in-prison.html
 AUTHORITIES will explore legislating stiff new punishments for perpetrators of acid crimes as part of measures aimed at quelling an apparent jump in reported incidents of the violent attacks, officials said Monday.

The proposal, issued earlier this month after a string of acid attacks, is among options being evaluated by a new government committee charged with decreasing acid attacks by controlling its use.
 
 Ouk Kimlek, secretary of state at the Ministry of Interior and deputy director of the committee, said authorities will discuss parts of a draft 20-point law during a meeting Thursday, including life sentences for those convicted in the most severe attacks.

In drafting the law, the important point that I noted is punishment on people who use acid against someone to make them become handicapped, damage their beauty, or kill, Ouk Kimlek said. They will be sentenced to jail for their whole lives. If the victim is just lightly injured, then there will be a sentence of five or more years in jail.


I guess there is a long way to go still though, and even with current laws there are so many other obstacles to getting someone convicted for their crimes, and even more difficult to stop them from happening in the first place. But I am glad to see people are trying to do something.


 




 There is one outside Broadway shopping center just down from Oportos (on Parramatta Road side towards the city) that I go to that is reasonable (I think like $30 for a womens haircut - not sure how much for a guys but I have seen men there whenever I'm there getting their hair cut too). If you're looking for it you will notice it's got mostly asian women staff. Or you can try Just Cuts in Broadway shopping center - that one is not too bad.

I went to some others in the shops and they were okay (I think $60) but one of them did a head massage, and personally I don't like it because it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable. 




 That is quite a walk. I have been taking my lunch and walking to work and I actually feel a sense of achievement by not spending anything unnecessary, but it does sometimes make me a bit tired. 




 So many women must feel like they have no options without being allowed to have an education. And those in the article who had the courage to make their own choices are more than severely punished for doing so. I wonder what sort of life they will live after an acid attack when an education is not allowed. What sort of job they will get to support themselves. I also didn't realise the number of women this was inflicted upon. I had heard of it before but thought it was rare. Very sad. 




 I think I am the same like that. I like 'testing' out ideas, but actually implementing them and going into that sort of detail doesn't really interest me either.

I like art too and I've always found it easy to come up with good ideas, but my technique sucks. In high school I came up with this idea and I went about painting it. One of my friends who is reknowned for copying other people's ideas did it as well. Only she painted it way better than me, and I will be the first to admit that. My idea was there but my skills aren't up to scratch. It might just be a matter of practice and finding time to do it. I went to Tasmania a couple of years ago and went for a bushwalk and noticed heaps of guys in the bush painting. It looked really enjoyable and relaxing, and I thought maybe one day I will do that.  




 What makes you tick, where do you want to be, what makes you happy at work, leisure or at other times?

At work I like to discover new things or create something new and see what I find. I like improving things. 

My home time is much the same. For example, when I had time I liked gardening cause I could be creative and pick what I wanted to do with the space and then make it happen and the results looked nice. I like creating new things too and trying new things, though I don't always finish what I start if I find something better to do.

My leisure time ideally involves being around trees or water or getting involved in nature-based activities like surfing or snowboarding, and I love that it's always different and I find it really relaxing. Oh I guess I like sports generally that involve some kind of challenge, not like jogging straight but a team sport is good. 




 I actually socialise a lot with different groups of people, but if I make too many plans I can feel myself screaming inside wanting to have my own time to be alone doing things that I enjoy. It's not that I don't like people. I just also like my freedom, and when I am around people I have to be considerate of them, and can't just always do whatever I want. 




 I like constructive criticism but encouragement would easily work better on me. That said, I think that's the same for most people. 




 Generally I have poor focus but once I am interested in something I have excellent focus (particularly at the last minute).

I found my lack of focus a problem in lectures at uni until I started trying to think of questions to ask for everything. I'd try to answer them in my head or look them up and if I couldn't find the answer I'd ask the lecturer. It helped keep my mind a bit more engaged. This applies to everything now. I don't have too many problems focusing. 




 I'm an analyst programmer too! But only for the last 2 years. Before that I did research. I preferred the amount of control I had over my work before compared to what I have now. 

I can't accept things for the way they are and go about my daily business, I have to always be improving things and making things better. I like researching about something, learning about new things, and putting my own ideas into things and testing them. I am hoping I've picked the right career but I can't think of anything else I could be doing right now anyway.
 









 I do sometimes, and then I lick it! 




 A) I agree. I don't mind pressing the flush button as long as I don't have to press the tap or door handles when exiting the bathroom. I appreciate a sink with a foot pedal like in Italy, or a sensor. 

C) We don't have many of those self-flushing toilets in Australia, but I didn't like them when I was in the US because I kept trying to do a poo and while I am a novice at self flushing toilets, the sensor kept thinking I wasn't there and flushing while I was pooing, splashing my bum which was gross. I didn't like that :( Is there a way to stop them from flushing against your will? 




 I am a fully grown adult and I want that book now. 




 I guess the intended meaning of the idiom is that 'it's not fair to judge apples and oranges by the same criteria', rather than it being impossible. Therefore I think that the idiom 'you can't compare apples and oranges' to be a bit vague and misleading, because you *can* compare them, on a variety of properties such as price, taste and color for example, even though, as you pointed out, it may not be fair to do so. 

Nevertheless, we do it all the time with everything. We have to in order to differentiate between things and make decisions. 

Ref: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apples_and_oranges

On a related note, I think that when you make a statement about your taste in art you can acceptably say 'I prefer this artist over the other artist' but you cannot definitively say that 'This artist is better than the other artist' because you are in a way suggesting that everyone feels the same way. Whether an artwork is 'better' to you really depends on how that artist has satisfied your taste preferences, which may not be the same as someone elses. So to be specific you would have to say 'According to my criteria for preference of art, this artist is better than the other artist'... or something like that anyway... 




 Why can't I compare apples and oranges? 




 Eat healthy food and try to get enough sleep. I was repeatedly sick for ages and didn't know how much difference a good diet and enough rest could make until I did it. Difference is huge.  




 I don't think I could stand just working for the future. I want to enjoy my life along the way. 









 I have been feeling this way too recently. Sometimes I find it really hard, and for a while I make progress but then there's moments where I feel like I just got reeled back to where I started. You just have to have faith that things will get better, even if you can't see that sometimes.

For now, it might not feel so great but just give yourself time, don't worry about how long it's taking, just let up on yourself a bit. This is how I have been trying to cope.

Firstly, stop worrying about the distant future so much. Concentrate on today, and making every day count. Think - what can you do today that will make you feel better? What is a positive step you can make to make the next week/month more bearable? (just to be clear I don't mean drugs or alcohol)

Next, I don't know if this works for everyone but I always give myself some time to grieve, say like 5-15 minutes or sometimes longer, whatever it takes to feel like enough. The, after I have sulked I force myself to move on and do something else. No use sulking for hours. You have to let it out but you also have to realise sometimes you're just going overboard. 

Third, don't look at other people and compare yourself. Everyone leads a different life. A lot of my friends got married quite young and I am still not. I don't see myself as a lesser person, I just chose to spend a lot more time at university and so I'm just not at that stage yet. I don't really care what they do, my life isn't about what they do, it's about me. It's up to you if you want to hang out with them but if it's making you feel worse maybe you can set yourself a time limit for seeing them so you can cope with it better. 

Finally, think about what you want in life. Start with short term goals. Things that will make you feel a bit better today, tomorrow, this week. Then when you feel like you can cope day to day, think about the rest of the month, then the next year. See how you go with that. 

As for the girl, every time you think about her force yourself to think of something else that you like instead. She has obviously moved on and you need to as well. It's not going to help you to think about it all the time.

Everything takes time, but if you spend so much time sulking and feeling crap it will be hard for you to make progress and for things to feel/get better. These things might not make you feel better straight away but keep trying and hopefully every day things will get just a little bit easier.

 




 :( Hug? 
























 Any suggestions?   




 How old is everyone in this thread? You think now is bad? There was a time things were much much worse with our rail system... it's actually pretty good now in comparison.  




 Also I heard someone say once that the employees who are happiest are the ones who know they are learning skills and could get another job... and so they are less likely to leave their current job.  




 What did you do before and what do you do now? I have also been considering a career change. 




 They're making some interesting Big Macs. 




 My bus is always packed and it would be completely unreasonable to expect someone to get off at a particular door. You always go to the one that is closest. 

There are no real rules on buses except I think most people try to be nice to each other. It's bad enough we have to cram into a tube with 50-70 other people. We are all probably not that happy about it.  

Really the worst thing for me is when someone really stinks badly and there is nowhere else for me to move to. It's probably the only thing that will make me get off a bus and wait for the next one.  




 Yeah I've also noticed there are a lot of devs that have done a masters degree here and got a job after that.  




 Try applydirect.com.au too - I no longer apply to recruiters. For me it is a waste of time.  




 Our company is in a niche area and we hire heaps of people from overseas. Actually as an Australian I am in the minority here. If you're not in a niche then I agree it is probably difficult. A lot of people I know from the UK have already been employed by companies like pwc and then it was an internal transfer within their company to Australia. 




 One interview I went to the guy asked for my current pay and then said "oh, I thought it would be less than that" and I was on like $12 an hour. 




 Ah. Maybe my great aunt was just really weird then lol 




 If it helps, my mum's aunt was very traditional British and wanted my mum to return to England to marry her cousin. My great aunt didn't understand why that was wrong either. But at the end of the day my mum made her own decision (not incest obviously!). 

It must be frustrating but I suppose the best you can do is talk to your parents and ask them not to stereotype and  guide your daughter to help her make her own mind up about what she likes or doesn't like. 




 Me and my sister played with mud and foil tins. No we weren't poor. We just liked it. :) I feel as though kids toys are overly complicated these days. Maybe it's good to have a mix. 




 I can understand why grandparents might do that though. They grew up in a very different world. Not saying they should just that they don't see how it's insane. 




 Mine were like that too. I had each side done while awake. The first side went very well. Second side I got dry socket. Has to be among the worst pain I have experienced in my life. I drugged myself up and tried to sleep through it for a few days. 




 Did they have to shoot it? Would it be possible to just cut its horns? 




 I loooove their cakes. My favourite is the blackforest cake. David Jones at Elizabeth St also has a really good one!  




 What is your favorite way to pay tax? 




 If you need to take something with you like lunch and it's stored in the fridge, put your keys on top of it and you won't forget to take it.  




 Set aside some time by yourself with nothing planned. You can just do whatever you feel like doing at the time and live life in the present. Making plans sometimes means doing stuff you don't feel like doing just because you planned it.  




 Stretch when you first wake up in the morning. I don't mean just wave your arms about and yawn, I mean really try to stretch all the major muscles. You will feel a lot better the rest of the day. 




 Before you leave work each day write a list of things you need to do the next day. This lets you leave work at work and stop wasting time when you get to work in the morning. 




 A beautiful scenic shot taken on one of my trips with my loved ones in it. The scenery because I would miss the vast open spaces and it would remind me of a trip that I enjoyed and give me hope for more. And loved ones because it would remind me I have people worth living for and it would remind me that I'm a person who other people care about.  




 I think our service is a bit shitty though generally unless it's a top class restaurant. Even then sometimes it's hit and miss. Although I prefer not having to pay tips I think having to earn it would mean service would be better. 




 You should have the nicest stuff first. It tastes even nicer when you're properly hungry. 




 Hehe I hadn't seen this. This was great. :) 




 My mum told me when I was younger flossing was bad for your gums and I believed her. I just had $4000 worth of dental work with another $6000 needed. Floss dammit!! 




 That is a stupid rule anyway. If I care about someone I will tell them things they might not find nice but need to hear. Timing is important. It's like someone got the timing wrong once, then this rule was made up. 




 It's great you two are motivating each other. My partner and I are doing the same... though we're not ready for obstacle courses yet. And you and your partner look great. The hard work has really paid off :) 




 I feel like this too. We really had the best of both worlds. I was always on the computer but when I wasn't I was out with friends or riding my bike or at the beach. 




 I used to like going to the library and using paper, pens and books. There was a study area when I went to uni in the early 2000s which just consisted of desks with space for your books. They replaced it and now there are just computers everywhere. I used to like that the library was a place to kind of focus without the distractions that you have on a computer or laptop. 




 Tell that to the humans. 




 I'll be honest, and I am ashamed of it now - I was initially not a fan of the cycling lanes in Sydney's CBD. When they were first being built people weren't using them and I felt they didn't really go anywhere. While some of that was true in construction, it was incredibly ignorant and short-sighted. There has been such a great acceptance and uptake of those bike lanes, I wonder how I could have ever had that opinion now. 

I questioned why I felt this way and I decided to give cycling in the city a go (albeit on a weekend because I am scared of being run down by crazy cars). It was great. I don't enjoy riding on the roads but with the cycling lanes it feels a lot safer and I really could enjoy it a lot. I even started riding to work. 

I think people don't like cyclists mostly because they haven't done it, and they are ignorant and selfish. I'll admit that is exactly what I was at the time, and it was wrong. 

I have seen both bad cyclists and bad drivers, but I feel that the attitudes in Sydney at least towards the bike paths and cyclists are slowly changing. I think with more good bike paths that will help as more people start trying them out and taking it up. 

There is one thing I still have a gripe with and that is those lay-down bikes with the little flag (I think they're called Recumbent Bikes). I saw a guy nearly get run over by a truck riding one of those down through the city centre on the non-bike lanes. They're impossible for cars to see, and he's almost asking for whatever fate happens to him.   




 Wash your feet in warm water. I always feel better all over if my feet feel nice and clean. 




 I saw this on the plane and there weren't any subtitles. :(

 Where does milk come from?

He was 19. I thought he was joking and then he explained seriously he thought it was made in a factory. 

We thought we'd better not tell him where eggs come from. 




 There are ways to get cheaper tickets tho. You can get $10 Hoyts tickets through Optus. And I think Telstra does Greater Union tickets for about the same.

 That makes sense but then I was thinking about 2 core processors or 6 core. They're not square either. I think you're onto something though. It could be about how common circuitry can be shared between cores. 

I was thinking the base is square so the fan can sit on top neatly. And fans have to be round. 




 Could it be related to the temperature? It is one of the less obvious reasons for sleeping issues. [Source]( http://www.sleepfoundation.org/article/how-sleep-works/the-sleep-environment). 




 My guess is that it's the way information is stored and processed. 

Binary encoding for data representation is made of bits. A bit is an on/off state which can be used to perform calculations. If you use a larger number of bits for example you can start representing numbers. For example 0101 in binary is 0x2^(3) + 1x2^(2) + 0x2^(1) + 1x2^(0) which gives you the number 5. 

Most of the time processors are built for even number 8, 16, 32, 64 bit length calculations. I think this is because the length of a byte is 8. Why is it 8 bits? It was just what was popular at the time.

Source: [here]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte)

So my guess is that it grew from those origins and they stuck with the even number theme. 




 Two main reasons:
1. High Sugar 
2. High Caffeine and/or Other Stimulants


When you eat sugar, your body tries to regulate itself. It does this by causing the pancreas (an organ in your body that makes digestive enzymes to break down your food) to produce a hormone called insulin which helps your body absorb the sugar and turn it into energy or else store it for later use. When you have a lot of sugar, the pancreas tries to produce more insulin to cope. But doing this often can damage the pancreas and over time it can no longer function properly and can't produce enough insulin. Poor insulin creation or absorbtion is a condition called diabetes. If left untreated, all this extra sugar floating around in your blood causes your blood vessels to harden and this can lead to a bunch of nasty conditions like kidney failure, heart attacks, blindness, nerve damage, etc. 

Source: [here](http://www.webmd.com/diabetes/how-sugar-affects-diabetes?page=2)
and for more information on the 2 types of diabetes see [here](http://www.nobelprize.org/educational/medicine/insulin/diabetes-insulin.html)


Sugar is also terrible for your teeth, and its presence causes the acidity in your mouth to increase as you break down the sugar. When the acidity level in your mouth increases, it eats away at the enamel of your teeth, causing tooth decay. 

Source: [here](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/health/the-mouths-guard.html?_r=0)


Not to mention if you are having a lot of sugar all the time you are likely to be eating more than your daily required intake of Calories/kilojoules and become overweight, which can lead to a number of other health issues. 


Caffeine can actually be good in small doses, as it stimulates your central nervous system and causes your heart rate to increase. It is also a diuretic (makes you need to go to the bathroom). A high heart rate can be useful when you need increased mental alertness but it can be bad if you are trying to sleep. It can also have other side effects such as headaches and vomiting if in really high doses. Large amounts of caffeine can also reduce calcium absorbtion and can increase your chance of developing osteoporosis (thin bones). 

If caffeine is not present they use other stimulants like guarana to have the same effect. 

Also when these stimulants are combined with alcohol they can mask how drunk you are, so you are likely to drink more than you might otherwise.

 Maybe it depends on what you're doing at those times. The hormone Melatonin is released at night causing you to feel sleepy, but it is affected by the amount of light. Maybe if you are in front of a light source, it is disrupting what you body expects to be its daily pattern or circadian rhythm.  




 Here is another one - I tried using lightroom also on the modified photo to add in some vignetting so the edges are darker: http://imgur.com/BdY29kZ 




 It's tough because there is so much noise in the photo I blurred it out a bit to make it less noticeable. I have tried sharpening it again but it just adds the graininess back in and it didn't look so great. See here: http://imgur.com/5c1dO9w

I just tried increasing the contrast - this might be a little bit better - it doesn't look as blurry: http://imgur.com/jrQ0XNQ

Maybe someone else on reddit can help? 




 How do you get rid of the bumps like that? I have a couple of photos of my own that I want to do that for. 




 How's this? http://imgur.com/9OMpZki 




 Are the grey clouds meant to be there or was there a spill on the photo? 




 I think that is the same here in Australia. I love Pepsi Max but I can't drink it because it makes me need to pee really badly. No other cola does that to me. I chose it at first because it was cheaper than Coke but now I'm onto caffeine free Pepsi Light. 




 Yeah it's probably a last resort option though. Turia Pitt was competing in a Marathon and she was trapped by a grass fire so she ran back through the flames. She survived though.

 Your minimum wage is $7.25? Is that federal? Ours is a little higher but then our cost of living is pretty high too, especially in Sydney. 
http://www.fairwork.gov.au/pay/national-minimum-wage/Pages/default.aspx 




 I'm not sure if it's directly related, but we often don't have the best service in Australia though. I read somewhere that it's due to changes in formal waitstaff training offerings, but having tips as an incentive must help too. 




 I wanted to save it. I mean that thing has got to be like 1000 years old. But when it started charging at us we had to put it down. :( I am sad but relieved at the same time. 


Edit: I'm sorry for the nightmares! They're actually pretty cool spiders (they kill other pesky insects), and they aren't that poisonous but I just don't like them in my bedroom anymore.

Last time I had one almost as big as this in my bedroom I let him be for 3 days. He didn't move at all so I thought it was fine. But on day 4 I came in the door and he actually charged towards me. I don't think he wanted to be friends anymore... 




 He was sitting right above my bed - actually had to get up on the bed to get him. As soon as we went in the door with the container to trap him he reared up ready for attack. I thought he might run and hide behind the picture, but as we got closer he climbed up onto the tiger picture with both front legs up ready for a fight. By the way, for reference the picture is 32cm (12.5") wide. So he must have been about 8-10cm wide including legs. One of the biggest huntsman I've ever seen.  









 [This guy](http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/askville/4725073_55886428_mywrite/2100734030047620693wapafafs.jpg) 




 I try not to worry about what everyone else is doing. As long as you are doing what you want to do, and if you want these other things, then as long as you are making an effort to go get them, then hopefully things will fall into place when the time is right for you. 




 I had a collie rough growing up and I swear he understood every word when I would talk to him about all my troubles. He would come right up and nudge me and I'd hug him, and I would never feel alone as long as he was there.  




 Cool. I found it in the SAS Survival Guide (little pocket book which is great to carry around): http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/295358.SAS_Survival_Guide 




 According to my survival book, you can obtain it from some plants such as the roots of hickory trees in North America or of the nipa palm in southeastern Asia. Boil the roots until all the water evaporates and black salt crystals are left.

If no direct salt sources are available then you can get it second hand through animal blood. 




 The Cronulla riots happened over 7 years ago now. I wish we could all move on from it.  




 How did you go with this? Is it still leaking? 




 It's bizarre isn't it? I know of plenty of organisations and people that still use faxes and it pretty much always surprises me.  




 We have had a lot of these in my mum's backyard lately. They have been feeding on caterpillars and getting really fat while breeding (I keep finding lots of egg sacs near the spiders I find). I kill them when I see them but they mostly just try to run and hide in crevices. I always feel bad killing spiders because they are sorting out much worse insects in my backyard like flies. Still, they make me feel uncomfortable.

I actually left a huntsman in my bedroom for a few days because I know they're pretty harmless but one day I walked into my room and it reared up and started running towards me. That was the end of our relationship. 




 I just use white vinegar and it works really well, it's cheap and safe for the environment. Also it doesn't scrape off any layers of paint that I am aware of. 




 TIL about lava soap. We have something similar - orange scrub: http://www.septone.com.au/detail.asp?item_cat= item_number=31 page_num=2 
Smells like oranges too. 




 Well, the best water level is water. :) Gotta make sure those hedges are trimmed to perfection! When the water level goes down, it's the first thing people will notice. 




 Good thing they had their headlights on or they wouldn't have been able to see where they were going!!

 Someone needs to make a book of best-of reddit posts for deperate redditors for when there are internet outages. I'd do it but I'm busy reading reddit at the moment.  




 There's been more information on the Townsville Bulletin website and some updates are [here](http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2013/01/28/374359_news.html). The emergency services numbers have been on ABC 24 all day, but without details of where/why etc.  




 I went to a restaurant (Mad Pizza yum) yesterday and we ordered wood fired pizzas and pasta. The air con in that place wasn't working too well. We sat in there wiping off our sweat with napkins. I kept looking in the kitchen. Really felt bad for that poor guy in there with the pizza oven. But the food was good :) 




 It was in the Shire not Western Sydney and it was a long time ago. Probably in the 90's. Maybe 20 years ago now. 

There are really only two hot years I remember out of probably many - the one when my goldfish died, and the one when a whole lot of my neighbours lost their houses and were sitting in our street with their cars full of whatever they could grab as they had to abandon their homes.

Anyway - Sucks to be in Western Sydney right now!!  




 I was only a little kid and it was almost an extra room of the house with walls on 3 sides, and normally when it's not that hot the fish is fine... just not on that day. I realised about half way through the day and went to get him to bring him inside but it was too late :(  




 I wonder if jogging on a day like today would even begin to give you an idea of how hot a firefighter gets when they're fighting a bushfire. 

I mean there are firefighters out there right now - so I suppose it must feel a thousand times hotter in their suits, with the heat from an actual fire on top of the heat that is hotter than the city. Not to mention more life threatening. They deserve a lot of respect. 

* Edit - wanted to include a pic of firefighters fighting fires in Western Sydney (Penrith) today:
http://images.smh.com.au/2013/01/18/3963493/DA-BDO-20130118160305578810-600x400.jpg

 No but it stopped! But soon there will be thunder and lightning and more rain... If you trust bom. 




 The hottest day I remember in Sydney before this was 44C. There might have been hotter days before or after that but I remember because it was the day I forgot about my goldfish outside on the patio and the water boiled. Rip fishy. :-(  




 I had so many people tell me that and now ten years on, I can tell you that at least for me high school was the worst years of my life and I am so damn grateful those years are over. If you're in highschool don't believe it. It might be true for some people, but it's not a blanket rule. My life is so much better now. 









 Thanks. I've done a little bit more. I don't know how much more time I would be willing to spend on it as there is a lot of work involved but perhaps someone else would like to give it a go. Here's the results of what I've done:

I can't really fix the boy's face as it would require redrawing it as there is so much missing, so I've left the tear over it. Maybe with another picture someone can help you out.

I'm also kind of new at this so I don't really know how to get rid of the green without losing too much photo quality. I did my best.

Good luck! 




 I did a bit of work on their faces but I need to go to sleep now: http://imgur.com/CIfkd
I'll see what I can do tomorrow.

Btw, the boy second from the left is going to be a little bit difficult to reconstruct because of how much of his face is missing. Do you have any other photos of him? 




 Do you have a higher resolution scan? That would be really helpful. There is quite a lot of damage to the photo. 




 haha this one made me laugh. :) 




 No problem :) Glad I could help!  




 http://i.imgur.com/gSxGv.jpg - I think this came out pretty well.

For those who are doing something on it still, this was my first attempt: http://i.imgur.com/xkY9N.jpg
I tried to reduce the white flare on the left a bit so the photo is more even. 
Then it wasn't quite even on the right, so I've used j00jy's version and created a multiply layer to even out the flare on both sides and got the above.

By the way, I'm really sorry to hear about your cousin :(  









 Yeah I like the Australian Reptile Park better cause it's less crowded and some of the animals like kangaroos and emus roam freely, and they have nicer enclosures than both the zoo and the city one, but the downside is that it's also far if you're a tourist. I really like the Galapagos tortoise, the croc enclosure and the Tassie devils there. I guess koala park or featherdale could be another option, but not sure as I haven't been there since I was a little kid. Taronga zoo is ok for Australian animals too. The koala enclosure is good as you can walk up and view them from a high platform, and they have a few small crocs. I don't remember anything about being able to hold them though. Apparently [govt regulations don't allow it anymore](http://taronga.org.au/animalencounter) . They do have a walk around section now you mention it which was pretty good. 
 




 I agree with everything you said! My ring is not 3 months salary but is so amazing. He designed it and picked the stones himself at a family jeweller. To me it is perfect. I have the most beautiful engagement ring. I've since seen ones with bigger price tags and would never trade. You know what really makes it extra beautiful is not the ring itself but what it represents and more importantly who it comes with :) That's what I think of whenever I see it... not the price tag.  




 - Taronga Zoo
- Sydney Harbour/The Rocks
- You should probably go to at least one beach (Bondi is the most touristy, Manly is where all the expats live, Coogee is another city beach option). Manly has an arts   crafts market on Sunday (http://www.ourmanly.com.au/Travel/manly-markets.aspx).
- Sydney is known for markets, depending on how much you like markets there are just so many... [This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_markets_in_Sydney) is not a bad list but the best for tourists (near the city) are probably Paddy's Markets near Central Station, The Rocks market, Manly Arts   Crafts and Paddington Markets. Don't get all market-ed out though. They are not all places to get a bargain - some, like the Rocks and Paddington Markets can be expensive.
- Harbour Bridge climb is an option (costs $$ but I hear it's good), or if you prefer you can just walk across it for free.
- Visit some kind of national park and go walking - There are some good ones around the city, but if you want the real bush then you need to go to a bigger one and you need a car to get there - for example The Royal National Park or Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park. If you're really keen then you could also go to the Blue Mountains. There's some WW2 gunner stations at Mosman which are interesting to walk around, and have a great view. Again though, not easy to get to without a car.
- Go to some sort of wildlife park - especially if you're not from Australia. One that is easy to get to is the Reptile Park in the city next to Sydney Aquarium. They have crocs and other Australian animals there.
- While you're there you may as well go to the acquarium. It's not bad, they have penguins and stuff.
- You could do a harbour lunch cruise - try get a deal (like on ouffer or something) and it should cost you about $50 for lunch on a cruise boat.

There's probably more things I could suggest, but that's all I have off the top off my head right now. 




 I agree with the others about the salary being decent.

Off topic slightly, but related to income... Check out this page about LAFHA (Living Away From Home Allowance) - it could be useful:
http://www.lafha.com.au/Employees.aspx

There's been some changes in this year's budget in relation to it, due to people abusing the system, but I think (depending on the sort of visa you get) you can still get it. I know most people at my company have LAFHA payments, as we have a lot of staff coming from overseas due to our skills shortage. Check out the bottom of that page for more details. There's probably some more stuff on expat forums as well you could search for. 




 My cat had pretty long fur and had really bad fleas once and was running around biting random objects and jumping around like she was on fire. I had to give her a bath to get rid of some fleas and then we put her on flea medicine after that. Probably should have done that in the first place.

 My husband started going for evening walks with me. He is a good listener so just listens to me while we walk. The fresh air does me good and although I don't feel 100% it just calms me a little. It kinda makes each day just a little bit more bearable.  




 Yeah I know, just wanted to try it out to see how it was. 




 Whenever I lift up things in the garden it's always redbacks. 




 I used myGov for the first time this year. It's faster to fill out but having done my tax with e-tax for as long as I can remember it feels like I'm missing out on possible tax deductions... 

I also really missed all the useful help buttons and the depreciation calculator.  




 Thanks for sharing this. I hadn't read it before. My family has been unlucky and had lots of cancer deaths in the last 2 generations from bowel, cervical, lung and leukaemia. One aunt on each side has had breast cancer and both survived when none of the others have, so I do wish there was more funding for some of the other areas. 




 Thundamentals rocked it. They did do their brother cover! They also got a verse in Cosby Sweater along with K21 who has an amazing stage presence. Apparently the first time they've done that together on this tour. I filmed it from my phone tho its not as good as being there obviously - http://youtu.be/I-AjnIapqCY 




 I was actually at the hospital earlier this week getting a scan and the nurse was injecting a cannula into my vein to deliver the contrasting agent. 

As I'm clenching my fist waiting for a needle she turns back to me and looks at my arm and says very thoughtfully "Ahhh it's good to be young and have nice healthy veins..." and then jabs me with the needle.

My response was "uhh yeah, I guess so... I've never considered that before..."  




 I saw Hilltop Hoods last night along with K21 and Thundamentals! It was awesome. I've never been to a hip hop gig before. Love Australian music.

 I didn't know this before but oreodory fish are a bad choice of fish to eat. They are not managed well from a fisheries point of view. 

http://www.forestandbird.org.nz/what-we-do/publications/the-best-fish-guide-/fish-species-/oreos/deepwater-dory

Oh and E is bad.

"Description:Oreos are deepwater fish that are long-lived (up to 150 years) and slow growing, making them highly vulnerable to fishing pressure and overfishing. There are three commercial species in New Zealand, but they are all managed as one quota management species. They are predominantly found in deep waters off the east and south of the South Island and off the Chatham Islands. Jointly with snapper, mako shark and southern bluefin tuna, oreos have the second worst ecological ranking on the Best Fish Guide of any commercial fishery in New Zealand.

Ecological concerns:Management of the three oreo species as one, a declining stock trend, uncertainty over stock boundaries, lack of stock assessments in some areas, unknown sustainability of catch limits and lack of a management plan. Attempts to improve research in the oreo fishery have been hampered by the seafood industry challenging and preventing the Ministry of Fisheries from commissioning research surveys. 

Also of great concern is the destructive impact of deep sea trawling on seamount habitats and high levels of non target fish bycatch. There is also a bycatch of marine mammals and seabirds. 

Economic value:Key markets are the USA, Australia, Germany and Switzerland, with smooth oreo being the main market species. Exports were worth $7.47 million in 2008.

 There was a well written back story on ebola including the efforts from Samaritans Purse in our paper today: http://m.smh.com.au/technology/sci-tech/how-the-world-let-ebola-spread-20141007-10rh8r.touch.touch.html 




 To the people going to West Africa to help. Thank you. The truth is that so many of us are cowards - too scared for our own lives to risk them in helping others. You are the best and bravest of us. You are probably scared just like the rest of us, worrying about the moment you might make a small mistake that would be the difference between life and death, but you go anyway. You go because you believe that without you, someone might suffer and die alone. Without you, there might be no one else to care for someone who else who was unlucky enough to catch the disease. While the media continues to discuss avoidance, you know they are a person just like us - a mother, a father, a sister, a brother, a daughter or son. Instead of running away you run to those who need you most in the world. You are someone's true hero.  




 Great photos. 

One question though - how come two people didn't lift the mattress to wherever they are taking it rather than dragging it across the ground? Wouldn't that [spread any bodily fluids on the mattress](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/)?  




 I believe UNICEF are doing a range of things which include education within communities, supply of hygene products, medical supplies, medical training, protective equipment, vehicles and assisting with burial. They are also helping kids who've lost both parents to ebola and have been abandoned by their extended families to be cared for. They are training medical and support staff. 

They are a large organisation with more resources than some of the others so may not get as much specific attention, but they are doing their bit. For the record I have no preference for a particular organisation - they all need our support. I'm just hoping to provide more information here.


Some examples from http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/health/brief/world-bank-group-ebola-fact-sheet :

* World Bank Group funds have already financed a first shipment of 100 tons of essential health and hygiene supplies (worth $1.6 million), which were procured and delivered by UNICEF to Liberia on Aug. 26. Among the items in the shipment were hundreds of sets of personal protective equipment, latex gloves, thermometers, syringes, and other medical supplies to restock depleted stores at many of the countrys health facilities.

* On Sept. 5, UNICEF procured and delivered 48 tons of materials and essential drugs for Ebola treatment centers (antibiotics and other essential medicines, cannula, coveralls to protect health workers, 7,440 pairs of latex gloves, and body bags) to Sierra Leone (worth $850,000), also financed by the World Bank Group. On Sept. 17, also with World Bank Group financing, UNICEF airlifted a second delivery to Sierra Leone (worth $1.7 million), of 100 tons of drugs and equipment, including personal protective equipment, antibiotics, intravenous fluids, and chlorine.

* On Sept. 9, UNICEF procured and delivered 28 new, all-terrain vehicles to the Guinea Ministry of Health (worth $880,000). These vehicles will provide much-needed ground logistics support to treatment, supervision, contact monitoring, and burial teams working in Guinea. A second lot of vehicles will include ambulances for patient transfers and motorbikes for contact monitoring in remote, hard-to-reach villages.  

More examples from http://www.unicef.org/media/media_75900.html :

Examples of such effort by UNICEF and its partners include:

* With support from the World Bank, Japan and USAID, airlifting 544 metric tonnes of supplies to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, with almost 50 flights since early August. These supplies include protective equipment, hygiene items and essential medicines.

* Supporting the Government of Sierra Leone in conducting a three-day public awareness campaign, 19-21 September, by helping train volunteers and providing accurate information on Ebola.

* Installing water and sanitation facilities in Ebola treatment units in the three countries.

* Training community health volunteers, teachers and others and help spread life-saving information on Ebola.

* Working to avert non-Ebola disease outbreaks and provide basic services to women and children.

* Providing psychosocial support to children affected by Ebola.

Another example from http://www.unicef.org/media/media_76239.html : 

* 10 October 2014  A cargo plane with nearly 100 metric tons of essential medical supplies left Amsterdam today en route to Sierra Leone as part of UNICEFs continuing response to the Ebola outbreak ravaging parts of West Africa. Similar flights are planned for Liberia and Guinea, part of a 1 million donation from the European Commissions Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department (ECHO). Todays shipment includes protective equipment such as masks, gloves, aprons, coveralls, body bags, goggles, face shields as well as medicine and hygiene supplies to be distributed to households and health centers. This supply has been funded by donors, such as the World Bank and the UK Department for International Development (DFID). 
To date, UNICEF has flown in more than 912 metric tons of supplies to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, in what is now the largest airlift operation of Ebola supplies.

You could also look into Red Cross who are front line too:
http://www.redcross.org/news/article/Red-Cross-Opens-New-Clinic-to-Fight-Ebola-in-Sierra-Leone
I'm not sure where to go to donate to Ebola from the US site, but the Australian site has a direct donation page to the Ebola outbreak appeal:
http://www.redcross.org.au/ebola-outbreak-2014-appeal.aspx


And another is Samaritans Purse whose staff were among the first to contract Ebola, so they are front line too:
http://www.samaritanspurse.org/
You can read more about their work here:
http://www.samaritanspurse.org/article/hope-takes-flight-across-the-atlantic/
I volunteer for them every now and then when I have time. 

 




 I didn't see this but I gave money to Unicef earlier. They're a large organisation and I think they have more resources. They put a similar perceantage of your donation into field work (Not sure what it is where you are but in Australia it's 78% of the money you donate goes to field work, while doctors without borders puts about 4% more ie. 82% of the money to field work).

 Nice one. A smile is something most of us take for granted. You look so much happier now :D  




 Lol yeah. The piece of prawn was the same size as him!

 If you frame the ratings in the context of a terrorist warning system it kind of makes sense. http://www.fire.tas.gov.au/Show?pageId=colFireDangerRatings

Catastrophic = leave early

Extreme = leave early

Severe = prepare to leave early

Very high = prepare to leave

High = prepare 

Low-Medium = continue as usual
 




 If I had a piece of rubbish after leaving the office I would have to wait until I got home around 1.5 hours later to dispose of it. No bins at my city stop, 1 hour train ride, no bins at destination stop, 10 min wait for the bus, 15 min ride home, 5 min walk from bus stop. Yeah, so I'm going to leave it at the station. Because at least cleaners will usually come along and pick it up there as opposed to throwing it on the street. I suppose that makes me irresponsible but it's the truth and why my station was always littered with people's rubbish.  




 It doesn't mean people hate you though. It's hard to find people that you can connect with. It also takes a lot of time and effort to build up friendships. 

Aside from friends, do you think you could change anything to make things better for yourself?  




 You would love the big pineapple! http://lettiemusic.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/the-big-pineapple-near-nambour-queensland.jpg 




 Yeah true, but I was really referring to this particular incident, where they were driving dangerously and probably didn't mean to harm the person in the car but did as a result of their dangerous driving.  




 Well I think you only get charged with manslaughter if you actually kill someone accidentally. Otherwise you get charged with endangering someone's life.  




 If you are in Australia there is an organisation called "R U OK?". It's been around for a few years. 

They did some advertising a couple of years ago but I haven't heard anything in a while. They were trying to have a regular "R U OK? Day". 

I think it's a great idea to remind people to be there for each other.

Is there anything like that in the US and UK? 


Our next R U OK day is 11 Sept, but it's just a yearly awareness reminder to look out for other people and we should be doing that all the time. 




 I don't know if it is true for you but for me sometimes it is just my thought process and how I view the world. What someone might see in one way I see in a completely different way. 

I was told to try to capture when I am sad, unhappy, angry and so on, and try to identify the triggers. In doing that I can understand what my thought process is and potentially redirect it more positively. I am still struggling with this and need help to see the flaws in my thought process. Most of the time I am really hard on myself. I guess this is going to take time. 




 No problems at all. I hope that if I can pass on some things that have taken me years to learn about myself, maybe it will give you a different perspective and/or make it easier for you to learn about yourself. 

It took a while for me to get out of the mindset of being isolated. I am not saying to follow my path but explaining where I came from and how things changed. If I could have changed things earlier I would have had a better life sooner. 

I've always been a bit different to other people and when I was in high school and university that was really to my detriment. I was very lonely for a very long time and also very depressed. But the hurt that I suffered made me strive for a better life so that I could be independent financially and have more control over my own life. That was my #1 priority. I struggled and worked really hard to do that. I wasn't successful at first, in fact, the opposite, so I worked even harder. Years later, I got there and got the independence I wanted. You'd think by then, being successful, I would be happy right? But by this point I'd gotten into a habit of striving for perfection, and I was not at all happy with myself. I was always thinking I wasn't good enough and putting myself down in my head. Then one day it dawned on me, and I can't tell you when exactly, but it occurred to me that it's okay not to be perfect, and to remind myself that nobody is, and in accepting that I wasn't perfect and that it was okay, I could stop hating myself. And that is when I let other people in, once I could be okay with myself and not always judge myself in a negative way. It was hard at first and people did let me down occasionally but I suppose in the end I learnt my own self-worth and it made me more resilient. I am still closed off a little bit and don't let people in so easily and freely as other people but I feel comfortable at this level of disclosure. :)

What I hope you can take away from all of my lessons is that you are a worthy person. People always say "nobody's perfect" but it's become a cliche and it's almost a throwaway comment as it doesn't really matter about everyone else, 'cause we're talking about you. You're not perfect, and that's completely okay. You are a valuable person who matters. You can live your life in a way that means something to you. You do need to be careful with your trust but not completely abandon giving trust to people. How do you know who you can trust? You said you had a friend who asked about you? Well think about what's in it for him? It seems to me like probably not much, except that he cares about you and wants to make sure you're okay. If you ask yourself what's in it for the other person it can ease your mind a little bit that they don't have an ulterior motive. If you're not sure, then proceed with caution, until you have time to learn more about them. 

I know that was long winded but I hope it helps. 
 




 It could be. When people hurt you it's hard to trust anyone. Opening up is about trust because you're letting someone get to know you and you always feel there is a chance they won't like you and the rejection can hurt. Really though I think it takes a lot for someone to honestly dislike someone. The people who did that to you are mean but they're not the majority of people. I think there are more people like that in school and I'm not sure if they even really know how much they hurt others.

I think the point I'm trying to get to is trust comes in degrees. There are some people who you should be able to trust enough to talk to. From what you said it sounds like you already know who that is. Some people you need to be more wary of. I think it's important to differentiate between those people. It's hard to trust people but it's also hard to live life alone.
 
I was also hurt but in a different way and I think all the same things as you sometimes. I have changed though from isolating myself and can open up more now but I am much more selective who I trust these days. I like having people to share my life with but it's all about having the right people. I'm not compatible with everyone.  




 Sounds like a lot of stuff has been happening. Maybe it's the uncertainty and changes that are causing you to feel unsettled? 

Being around other people is different to feeling like you have companions. Sometimes I have walked through the city and seen hundreds of people but felt completely and utterly alone. I start to think it's sad and then I realise that I don't want to know them all because I like my anonymity. But then I'm alone and I want someone to be with me but not just anyone...

Whoever this person is online they don't sound good for you. Sometimes people who want something from you are the easiest to talk to but not the best. I don't know how, but try to find someone else to talk to. There are people around who will listen and not try to manipulate you while doing so.    




 What happened? :( 




 In terms of what impression you give you can't really know without asking. Even then it's a bit murky. I think you just have to reflect yourself. Think of ways other people act that you like e.g. giving compliments (if you like that) and try to do the same, and of ways people act that you don't like e.g. being too direct (again, if you don't like that) and try to avoid that. It's not really black and white - for example, most of the time I like people being fairly straightforward but the timing is important. Giving me very direct critical feedback when I'm under a lot of pressure and asking for help is possibly not the best idea. 

If you think people are intimidated to talk to you maybe it is just your manner. Do you think perhaps you could be coming across as arrogant? Or maybe just not open to continuing conversation. It's pretty hard to talk to someone who doesn't add details to the conversation or respond with questions. One thing some people do is talk about themselves but forget to talk to others or take any interest in the other person's responses. 

I'm not sure why you think you might come across as a jerk? Did someone say something to you?

Maybe you're just going through an introverted cycle. I go from being extroverted and really gaining energy from social interactions to an introvert who really loses energy from being around other people. It goes in cycles and really depends what else is going on in my life. Could this be the case with you? 




 It's good you got to talk to her. 

Maybe you need to process the depressive thoughts you have before they pop up out of the blue. I know for me if I ignore them then I actually start getting really vivid and horrible nightmares. Some have been so bad I have woken up crying or throwing up. So I have to write stuff out and try to process it while I am conscious or else the emotions come out when I don't want them to. The weird thing is sometimes I don't even feel like anything is wrong while I'm awake but I'm sure I'm stressed or anxious and I'm just suppressing it.

I mean you might have a different result than me, but maybe it could help? 




 Yeah :( I have heard other people on here mention community or church groups if you need someone to lend an ear? Sometimes it just helps for someone to listen to you so you can talk about it and process all the thoughts and feelings you are going through.  




 That sounds exhausting for him.  

If the pain is temporary I suppose just remind him that it'll be over soon. It's not a way to live but I really hope the specialists and doctors he is seeing can provide a way forward for him that isn't so debilitating. 

I don't really know what else you can say or do, except to be there. I think it means a lot to have someone there supporting him so he doesn't feel alone. 
 




 You can talk to me? 

Can you apologise to her for saying whatever you said? It sounds to me like you're genuinely sorry about it.

Was there some event that made you feel depressed or was it just sort of out of the blue? For me it's usually both :( 




 You've been through a lot and suffered a lot of hurt so I'm not surprised you are feeling low. From what you have said it sounded like you were in a toxic relationship and it's good that you have walked away from that. Nobody deserves to be treated like that. 

And also, there is no way you deserved to be raped. It's crazy that people would say that to you! They're outright wrong. 

You need to give yourself some time to process everything you've just been through. I hope you realise that however bad you feel, you deserve to live a life where you don't have to feel alone and where each day doesn't feel like a struggle. You said you moved in with your mom, can you stay there a while until you feel more stable and can start to pick the pieces up again? 




 It is terribly sad when someone dies, and knowing that the world will continue without them feels like a horrifying prospect. Some people I have lost I wonder why the world didn't just end right then, and just not bother to continue existing. 

But then I remember other people in my life, and although I am terribly stricken and sad that I have lost someone who is so important to me, I remember the other people I love and who have shown love for me and I hold onto that, and I try to be a kinder and better person for them.  




 Sites like  www.freelancer.com or www.elance.com. I think there are a few others but I can't remember their names.

There's also other things like www.airtasker.com or www.taskrabbit.com where you can do little jobs for people. 
 




 What about looking at some of the jobs on some of the online freelancing websites? They don't pay very much but then it's something you can add to your resume and it might help to show you have some initiative?  




 Wow that sucks. They sound completely unprofessional. :( 

I had a really bad one when I was younger, who gave me horrible advice. It's good you recognised this early and can walk away. 

Is there anywhere else you can go instead? Like not a different doctor, but a different facility altogether?  




 Nope. It sounds like you have been busy with other things so I don't see why that would be a problem. My first job was when I was 21 and it was at Kmart.  




 One thing that has taken me ages to accept is that it's okay to not be perfect, or even far from it. Before I was always frustrated with myself and I always felt like I would never be good enough. I don't know why, but knowing that gives me a level of confidence. 

When people reject me in interviews, I try not to take it personally, although it always is a bit. But what I try to do is to see an interview as a performance, and if I do that then it's something that I can work on, rather than it being a rejection of me as a person. If I can't find a good reason for the rejection then I blame them and convince myself that they're a company I don't want to work for anyway. :D
 




 Yeah I wish people would do that more often too. Do you have any friends or family that might know of jobs? The job I have now is because a friend recommended me.  




 The first full-time job I got took ages to get. I had an undergraduate degree but didn't have good grades. I started applying for receptionist roles because there weren't any positions in my field. When I started getting rejected from those it was really hard to take. I felt like I'd wasted years of my life and achieved nothing. But I kept trying anyway even though it felt hopeless and eventually someone gave me a chance. I think it took 6 months to get that first job. I think the first job is always the hardest because not many people are willing to take a chance. I'm so grateful to the person that gave me my first full-time job. It's not just you, it's a difficult first step. 

Oh and tips for getting a job - mainly just keep trying. Also I don't know if you have already but try to get a character reference to support your application - seeing as you have no prior non-military experience that will help. Maybe after you've been turned down by someone, try asking for feedback. Not many people are willing to give it but if they do it may help you. I don't think not having used a cash register is a good reason - maybe there was some other reason? I'm not saying to probe for it but if you reflect on the interview do you think it could it have been something else? 




 What about reading a book? Or listening to music? Or going for a jog? Watching a movie? Playing video games? Drawing? I'm not sure. Just something, anything really, to get your mind off it. Is there anything you used to enjoy doing? Maybe you could take a course or something and learn something new, and meet new people?

I guess none of us ever really learn with love. I think we all want to have someone in our lives and we can't help but keep taking those risks and even though we know it might hurt like hell, we hope that it works out - sometimes it doesn't, but then maybe you only need it to work out once.  




 I had the same thing the other day. I wanted to call but I didn't want to block up the line from people who really needed it. 

I think you just need a friend to talk to. It sounds like you have the tools to do it but need someone to lend their ear so you can reason it all out. 

If you want to chat I'm all ears. 




 It's hard looking at other people's lives and comparing yours. The thing is nobody will ever have a life just like someone else's. How do you know if someone else is going to be happy? Why aren't all those people with lots of money and a loving family happy? What about those people that seem to have it all? A lot of stuff happens that other people don't always see. 

In terms of catching up, I honestly think people are busy/lazy/preoccupied, and until they have really gotten to know you, they mightn't go out of their way to catch up. Even friends that do know each other don't catch up as they should sometimes. I know I do it sometimes, and it doesn't mean I don't care, just that I'm not perfect and I kinda suck at doing things in a timely way. It might be up to you a bit. 

One of the hardest thing for me was moving jobs and realising when I moved that all those people I thought were my friends seemed to have no interest in keeping in contact with me once I left, which felt really weird seeing as I'd seen them every day for 3 years. I even spent lunch hours talking to one girl about all her problems. The first 6-12 months after I left and joined the new company I was so lonely. I didn't have anyone to talk to and I didn't know why people didn't try to contact me, even an email, anything. I'd joined a consulting company and everyone was out on clients and too busy to talk to me, so I was basically by myself. I am on projects by myself often and I often eat alone. After a year I finally made a couple of friends though, we still aren't that close, but that's ok. I think that is going to take a long time. 

But I did contact my old work friends, and not all of them, but some of them made the time to see me. It just took me to take the initiative. After doing that a couple of times now they do ask me out sometimes. 

Would you consider trying to see the other friends again?  




 :( That is really tough. You took a risk with your heart and it hurts. If I could hug you through the internet I would. 

I suppose the best advice I can give you is to try to do things to keep your mind off of it. Sure you're going to think about it sometimes but if you're busy then hopefully not as much.  




 I think most people want to be in a relationship and be close to someone, and of course rejection hurts. If you feel hurt by that then feeling dislike towards someone else is entirely natural. 

It can be hard to find someone who is compatible with you in life. From looking at friends I have, it seems to be entirely random. It's not that one person is better than the other, it's just that things happened in their life that led them to meet this other person who also felt the same way. 

I don't think there is a secret formula to finding that person. I know a lot of people who are older and single and entirely unhappy about it, and also entirely undeserving - they're nice people - and it's not like they wanted that, just how their life turned out. What I'm trying to say I suppose is that to some extent it is out of your control, and I know this is hard to take, but you might have to figure out how to be happy with yourself and on your own before you find that other person that can make you feel complete.  




 Hey I think amp3rsand gave some good advice. 

It's going to take time to get through the grief and you don't want to have extra stress hanging over you. What's a "good" job worth if it's not good for you. 

I also think travelling could be a great idea once you have sorted out the legal stuff. Travelling made me feel free, when before that I had felt so trapped. If that's what you want to do, go for it.  




 Sorry, I should have read that from what you said. 

Well, for me, I just tried lots of different things. Some I liked, some I didn't like. I think pick one thing that is with other people, and one thing you do alone to begin with. Sometimes I like being around other people, and sometimes I really just want to be alone, so it's good having different types of things to choose from.

Some things I have done on my own are:
* I wanted to learn how to crochet, so I just bought myself a crochet needle and some wool and learnt from youtube.
* I wanted to learn how to make my hair less boring, so I got a straightening iron and learnt how to curl it on youtube. 
* I wanted to learn how to write a phone app, so I tried that out, and that's fun. It's good to see something on your phone when you get to that point. It's also something that's a bit more involved so keeps me entertained for longer and stops me from thinking too much. 
* I also really like writing, so sometimes I write stories, fiction and non-fiction. I also like writing blogs about stuff I know about and people are actually pretty grateful when you help them out with stuff. Some of my most successful blog posts have been about really simple things.

Some things I do with others are:
* I started volunteering with a friend. I don't like sitting around in cafes that much so it's good to keep yourself busy while being able to talk to your friend/s.
* I play field hockey, and it's good but it's only half a year. Still, I enjoy it. I'm no olympian, it's purely social but it's great like that. 
* Next week I'm going rock climbing with a friend. I haven't been for a very long time but I figured why not try it. I don't really think I'll like it but I'm going to go anyway and see. Sometimes I change my mind.

I guess when you find the thing you like you can invest more energy in it. I think that sort of happens naturally. And then because you invest energy in it you get better at it and it becomes your thing. 




 Hey, I'm glad you shared your story.  I read the whole thing and really feel for you.

Why did you and your girlfriend split up? 

Is there anyone else you would consider to be close in your life right now? 




 There's nothing wrong with feeling better and telling other people about it. :)  




 Beautiful. Reminds me of the waterfalls at Treble Cone a bit, but more magnificent. :)  




 Is there anything you enjoy doing right now? 




 I don't think happy is the right word, but yeah, better for having talked about things.  




 Have you tried the Google Translate app? Apparently you can take a photograph and it will translate the text in the photograph for you. I haven't really tried it but you sound like a good tester! :) There is another one called Photo Translate. 

It sucks that the expat community wasn't nice to you. I heard sometimes it's better to help you integrate into a community to try to make friends with locals anyway. Is there any chance of that? Are there any korean people you could hang with? 




 For some people, depression comes and goes, and for others it is a lifelong battle. The latter is true for me. It never really went away, and it took me so long to realise that it might not. When I realised that after about 15 years I was horrified at first. But resigning to that fact meant that I had to deal with it, as much as I didn't want to. Having depression doesn't necessarily mean that there aren't moments and things that are worth living for, even if the world is dark and you can't see that right now. I hope you do get to see that. 

One other thing I want to say is that while drugs and therapists are there to help, I do sometimes think that ultimately it is down to you to figure out what it is that helps you get by and what it is that makes life bearable for you. It might not be a short battle but it sounds like you have caring family and friends and resources available to help you in whatever way they can. I know you resent that you can't make that choice, and I did too, but those people care about you and they're just trying to help.  




 Glad I could be there to listen. 




 Oh I can see a tinge of blue in the light. That's going to look great. :) 




 Good luck. I hope it goes well.  




 Yay. What color did you make it? I always wanted blue streaks.  




 I'd give you money for lunch. I would never be too tired to make sure a friend could eat. :( 




 First, congratulations on finishing one of your goals. You don't have to feel overwhelming joy about it. You can recognise it for what it is though - an achievement. You've done well. 

Happiness is separate I think. It isn't about summing up success and subtracting the failures. I remember finishing something that was important to me and not really being that happy about it just feeling like.. ok great... what now? And then feeling a bit lost cause I had no idea, I'd never thought that far ahead before. I only had a plan up until that moment. You know what that means though? Now you can try doing other things and see what excites you. And it doesn't have to be achievements or stuff other people value, just stuff that you value.  




 Can you do your own cooking? Sometimes it's hard to find exactly what you want if you're eating out often.  




 Maybe you can find a hobby that lets you meet other singles like yourself. And I don't mean necessarily for the purposes of finding a girlfriend. I mean people who enjoy being single who you can hang with.  




 How about some adjective that doesn't describe that it was good/bad. That's what I generally do with questions related to asking how my day was. Like saying it was busy or quiet. This doesn't work that well if people want to ask more questions about it. Generally just saying "good" is the easiest way to have no follow up questions.  




 By the way, sorry about the slow replies. My reddit connection kept dropping in and out for some reason. :( 




 Yeah I agree that person is a dick. 

You don't need to be entitled or have specific problems to be depressed, you can just feel crappy. Also, who says your problems don't matter? Let it out if you want to... 




 I think you do need to talk about it not just bottle it up. 

Sometimes it is hard talking to friends though because then you are letting them into a very personal part of who you are and it takes a lot of trust in another person to do that.  But I also think that's what friends are for. Maybe you just need to find that person who is non-judgmental and who you can trust.

Another option is maybe talking to a psychologist or counselor? Then it's private between you and them. 




 It does sound like you are doing the best you can. And you're helping. You have taken on a lot of responsibility in taking care of your two little sisters. It does sound like he doesn't appreciate it but that's not to say it shouldn't be appreciated. 

I can't say why he is yelling at you but it sounds like it might be more to do with him than it is to do with you. 

It's hard to not care when you're faced directly with the situation. You sound like you just want it to be better and it isn't happening. 

Is this a once off thing or has this been going on for a while? Could you talk to your mum about his behavior and how it is making you feel? 




 I don't think you're just being emotional and overdramatic. Your feelings are real. 

What makes you feel like you're a failure? Is part of that because you feel like your parents don't value what you have to say?  




 You can talk to me. What's on your mind?  




 I used to sleep in my car sometimes. The worst thing was the seat belt plugs. This is a great idea.  




 I switched to Pepsi Max and it made me pee urgently so now I'm back to coke zero or diet coke with no caffeine. I should really stop :( 




 I did this for a short time and the doc said that binge eating like that can be a thyroid condition. If you are doing this a lot you should check out if you have hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. A blood test can tell you. 




 I ate maccas everyday for 6 months cause I was working full time and studying and didn't have time for a lunch break. It was so convenient to drive through and eat at traffic lights. I got pretty sick :(

Recently I hadn't had maccas in months and then I got it the other day and sat next to a really stinky homeless guy. Now I associate maccas with smelly people and I don't crave it. KFC is so much better :) Luckily it's not convenient for me. 




 Drinking coke zero. I know it's stupid and it should be easy to stop but it's everywhere. It started out as a way to have a break from the office for 5-10 mins and now it is a fully ingrained habit. It's not even supposed to be addictive. It's just delicious.  




 I did this. It's so painful. You gotta just keep trying to let go. Think of the months or years you are wasting on someone who is not reciprocating. If you keep enjoying life and doing the things you want to do you will hopefully meet someone more worthy.  




 There are some guys who hand out leftover bread at Central Station near the tram stop around 7pm. Does anyone know what charity these guys are? 




 
Edit: Didn't read that properly 




 What? 60km? As long as you're in Australia I'll post you them if you want them that badly lol. 

I also want them that badly but it is more like 1km away for me. :) 




 On second read they only store partial credit card details. Some companies do this for fraud detection.  E.g. last 4 digits and expiry which is enough to identify you but not to use your card. 




 I think they are allowed to store your credit card details if they are PCI compliant: http://www.cio.com.au/article/400300/what_pci_compliance_/

Although my understanding is that they can't store your CVV.

They probably just did it for your convenience, but maybe that was a bad decision. 

I think the biggest problem is that this is so long ago... and they didn't tell anyone :/ 




 Ah thanks for that. I remember now. I think your advice is pretty good. I am 31 and time does fly when you're older but it's not necessarily a bad thing. I think the main thing is being busy due to spending a lot of time in full time work. My advice would be to always make time for yourself and for the things that are important to you, and especially to organize some down time for yourself. Always being busy makes it feel like it's going quickly... but it doesn't have to be that way. When you're younger you can try lots of things and have lots of time for random stuff. When you're working full time you need to be a bit more selective. One thing that changes is when you have a job you have more freedom over what you do with your time and the money you earn. I try to live a life of experiences.  




 The original post was deleted and now I can't remember what this was about :/ 




 If you are fortunate enough to have a good life, give a little. Help a friend or family member out or volunteer. Thinking of others in need and not always about yourself gives your life some perspective. 




 Don't worry if you're not perfect. It's okay. You're perfect as you are with all your imperfections. Don't spend your life trying to live up to someone else's expectations. Live the life that you want.

And if your family isn't happy, well that sucks, but you're not alone. And people do care about you.  
























 I put it in my diary at a particular time, and treat it like a doctor's appointment. Once I'm there it's all good, I just get on with it. I don't think about whether I like it or not, I just go. I usually find it a good break from the stress of work, and I try to give myself a mental break from thinking about work, so it turns into a more positive experience. 




 How was it? 




 I don't quite get cover letters. I have a feeling most employers skip straight to the resume. But you don't want to be that person that looks like they didn't care enough to write one. 

I feel like it's like putting those edible flowers on desserts. I don't know if you've ever had a dessert with edible flowers, but they  don't taste like anything! At least the pansies I've had don't. So pointless, just decoration. 

Then again, maybe it's to show you can string coherent sentences together in English.  




 Haha... thanks :)  




 Thanks! :)  




 In Manly, I like 4Pines but I don't know if they're really a brunch place. They do have a view of the water behind the ferry stop. The food was surprisingly really nice, and the beer was also top notch.

A lot of people have told me Garfish is good but I've never been there. I'm not sure I'd classify it as a brunch place but it might be good for lunch.

Besides that I'm sorry I don't know cafes/restaurants in that area all that well. 




 When I went to kiama we went to the markets. There was one on Saturday   on Sunday! They are actually pretty good - different from the markets in Sydney because they are larger stalls and they have different stuff - not just stuff imported from China. I recommend the Kiama Seaside Markets if you are there. 

http://www.kiama.com.au/see-and-do/markets

Aside from that all we did was go to the beach. It was pretty relaxing. 




 I love running!!! Except I got a stress fracture in my foot from running too much only on weekends for sport and not enough during the week (so didn't build enough muscle strength). Then after 5 months of waiting, I thought it was better and ran and it was the best... run... ever... until a day later when it hurt like hell and the doctor told me I'd fractured it again. I can run again now but having a bad foot put a lot of pressure on my other foot and I got a heel spur on the other one. So now I can't run without being in pain. I tried taking a lot of neurofen but after un-recommended prolonged use it really does mess with your stomach, so I can't have it at all anymore. 

So in summary, I used to love running. Now I can't love it because it hurts too much. But I still go, only I can only run properly on grass. And when I do I feel so free!!!

Nowadays I usually ride my bike. But if my feet aren't too painful I can run every second or third day and then ice my heel afterwards.

The other problem is I usually only like running at night, by myself, with headphones in, in the park - the perfect target for criminals. 

To be honest I think I exaggerated how much I like running... I think I just miss it because I can't do it whenever i want. But I really did only like the healthy feeling afterwards, where your whole body feels energised. I like running to music though because I can try to keep the beat. I also like sprinting... I get a kick out of it.  




 ~~Jamberoo is a little bit of a drive from Kiama~~ (oh correction - it's only 15 minutes... well, it seemed like a way away!) I drove past it last time but we didn't want to leave Kiama so gave it a miss. Is it worth it? I've always wanted to go there, mainly for the waterskiing. But then sometimes I think maybe I should just hire a speedboat and take myself on a river. 




 That's ... not well thought out! 




 Oh yeah, there is that lol. I just figured you wouldn't go visit that before heading out on a long drive, but you could if you wanted to! 




 Oh. Sorry. Basic comprehension is not my strong point. 




 As long as you follow it up with "cause I'll do all your shit for you!" Then that'll be sweet  




 Are you in Sydney? Depends how far you want to go. I'm in the inner west so usually hang around Glebe or Newtown. If you want more of a seaside thing you could try Bills In Bondi but actually there's a lot of great places at Bondi. I prefer sitting at the cafe down on the waterfront so you can watch the waves and surfers. I also like Bronte but there's only like 2-3 cafes. Another thing I'd think about doing is Yum Cha. There was a discount voucher on Groupon for Emperors Garden in Chinatown. http://m.groupon.com.au/deals/sydney/emperor-s-garden-seafood-restaurant-1-1/719919595 I eat there regularly and I like it. In the city if you like simple food you could try Jamie Olivers cafe but it's a little on the pricey side. 




 I'd second going the whole way in a trip. I also don't think you'll have 1.5 hours in stops because there's not that much to see on the way. If you have a second driver you can do a couple of toilet stops and have a single longer stop for lunch or dinner. 




 True unless they lose an eye. Gotta watch out for eye loss.  




 Yeah I also find this article a bit empty. I would think a discussion about the pay gap by both occupation and years of experience would be more insightful.  




 I've had plenty of guys offer to shake hands with me in formal situations. It's not weird to me at all.  




 I've driven in Vegas and around there. It was great. I'd recommend it actually. The roads are fast as they're in the desert. Worth renting a nice car for it and bringing some good music. I loved it. Also, take water with you and pay for the insurance. 

I'm heading to San Francisco tomorrow but we looked into cars. If you plan on staying in the city centre keep in mind parking is really really expensive. Actually could cost more than the car rental. I feel like it's not worth it.

Also if you drive in LA get a good GPS with lane guidance. The highways there have six lanes and exits on the right and left. So you can potentially enter traffic from the right, cross 3-6 lanes, exit on the left, then merge with traffic on your turn. That was my first experience and quite scary. Driving in the US after that was easy. I only experienced that in LA though.  

But yeah generally the roads in the US are pretty good to drive on. 

You should just make yourself familiar with the 4 way stop. First time I got to an intersection like that I was pretty confused... even though I'd read about them first. 




 Also I learnt that outside Sydney servos aren't open all night. Lucky I was hungry for a late night pie or else I would've run out of fuel. Apparently other people have told me that everyone knows that... seems everyone else except for me knows that. 




 By the way, thanks for the chat. My sleeping patterns are all out of whack. The daylight savings time change isn't helping either! 




 Oh that is good to know about Copper Mountain. I heard the name on TV while here but that's all I know about it. 

Yeah the beer here is pretty nice actually. I didn't know Colorado was into craft brewing but it's pretty sweet to try the stuff here. Unfortunately I didn't try too much. The bus back from Aspen to Snowmass is deadly to weak stomachs as one poor sod on the bus and all the rest of us found out. What I had was wonderful though.

We put our house buying plans on hold for this trip. The property prices in Sydney have spiralled out of control so we sort of gave up for the time being. When I get back I think moving out of my tiny unit into something more liveable might have to be my next goal. :)

So happy to hear I'm not alone in my goals. Except opposite countries... you know what I mean... 




 Oh by the way. In my (completely biased) opinion, our coffee is also usually better. It's the only other food thing I really miss.  




 Sounds nice. I just wanted to go snowboarding over here before I got too old to enjoy it. It was a dream I've had since I was in high school. I planned to go to Canada on a working holiday years ago but broke my shoulder and my plans along with it. I would love to come back in summer. The whole Rocky mountains is amazing. However I may be out of travel money and leave for a while after this trip (no regrets though). :)

If you haven't been to Australia you might find it more affordable now the AUD has dropped against the USD. We timed our trip quite poorly lol. 




 That's pretty cool. I think that's the main problem when people try Vegemite. They don't know how to eat it and use way too much. Glad you liked it! :) 

I do like Colorado. It's actually a lot like New Zealand's South Island but with better snow and more trees and wildlife. NZ has nice lakes though that you can see from the ski fields. I love nature so it's good for me. :)  




 I did it too and I also felt this way when answering some of the questions. They would lead off previous questions but I didn't feel like the following question was relevant anymore after my previous answer. Crafting surveys is actually pretty hard.  




 I think I stopped playing games as much when I started working full time. In high school and uni I'd spend hours each week. But now my free time is very limited. So it's more a changing lifestyle thing, rather than being because I gained access to a smart phone.  




 Haha. That is a very Australian meal! I've never heard of an American eating Vegemite. How did you get into that? Have you been to Australia? 

I am in Snowmass on a short visit. Leaving tomorrow to our last stop before heading home. We saved for years to come to the US and Canada and followed the storms here. It's very pretty   the snow has been amazing. The only thing I've found is that I really feel like I don't fit in at  all. But then I think the people here are also not your typical Americans/people. I have never seen so many private jets in one place. I also don't think many of the people here are actually from Colorado. I reckon we should have spent a day or something in Denver but we only went through the airport. 




 I'm an Australian actually in Colorado. I don't know why but I miss Australia quite a lot here. Maybe you should move to Australia. Sounds like you would fit in well.  




 I am a female who works in IT. After many years of gaining experience I feel I have much more equality, and I am generally well respected now. I do feel on par with my colleagues.

But I truly believe this might not have happened had I not worked for a federal government department with intake quotas. Their policy is not to employ 50% of each gender, but for a graduate year to employ the same proportion of graduates by gender. So if in 2015, 20% of grads were female, they'd aim to hire 20% of their intake as females.

It's a little simpler for graduates though. It's even harder for companies to find women with experience further along in their careers also because many are also not given the same career advancement opportunities once initially employed. 

I'm glad to say that was not the case for me though, and I owe quite a lot to equal opportunity and gender equality programs, along with a lot of hard work on my part in overcoming these issues.  




 I've claimed using the CBA credit card with Zurich too. They sent a letter after I sent in the claim to ask for more details (it was a theft) but once I replied by email, they paid my claim. I always use it now. Just be sure to see what you need when claiming. I had to spend a day at a police station to get a police report about the theft... which was a little tricky with the language barrier. 

Just need to read the PDS cause you have to book with the CC, but they've changed it now from a percentage to a minimum dollar amount. I think it's $1000 now and your partner should also be covered. Not hard to spend that when travelling from Australia.  




 I know I'm just some random person on the Internet but please don't give up. People do shitty things because they're imperfect, not because you do or don't deserve it. I know what it's like to care about someone and get shat on. It's terrible, gut wrenching and soul destroying. But you're still important and I hope you will give the world another chance. I hope you will get through tonight, then tomorrow, then the next night. And I hope sometime you will see that your life is worth it.  




 I haven't heard of that podcast before. What is it about? 

It's really tough making friends and meeting people. Most people are up for a quick conversation but then go onto continue their daily lives. I guess you just have to go through meeting a lot of people before you meet one that you click with. It gets sort of tiring though I've found and unless people are kind of forced to be around me, like if they work with me, then it just doesn't really seem to take off. 

8 months is a little while. Do you still keep in touch with your old friends? They sound fun :) 




 Sounds like an interesting job. I do consulting so am often at clients by myself. The worst is traveling alone and eating alone. I usually turn on the TV just to hear other people talking. I think it's worse at night. 

How long have you been there for? My stints are usually only a week at a time so not too long. 




 Hi. Sucks being alone sometimes doesn't it :( What are you doing there? Did you travel for work? 




 Seems like going out in Sydney and enjoying life is banned these days.  




 I'll keep an eye out at Snowmass. I hope you get it back!  




 I'm in Montreal today and there were a lot of delays from here and long queues waiting at central station. Not sure if it's related. 




 I would have thought a zebra would have been a better choice for a bar code animal talking about vegetarians.  




 I guess it must be easier to clean. I see them all the time nowadays.  I'm not really a fan though. The water does drain toward the wall but I find it doesn't really stay contained. I also like shaking my hands in the bowl of the sink and it's hard when the sink has no sides.  




 It's all the people who don't like Hersheys coming together. i.e. non-Americans. We don't rub it in your face in person that your chocolate sucks though, we see how happy you are not knowing any better. People on the internet are just more honest. :) 




 Yeah Cadburys is actually pretty cheap. I think we can get 350g for like $3 here in Australia on sale. Maybe normal price is $5-7 ( http://shop.coles.com.au/online/mobile/national/cadbury-milk-chocolate-block-dairy-milk ). Also the regular plain milk chocolate is now fair trade so even better.  




 It's like chocolate but with less creaminess and also a bit more cardboard and chalk flavouring. Also it's harder and less melty. Kind of like stale chocolate that expired a year ago.  




 That's what I thought too. Otherwise Christians would still be required to slaughter lambs to save themselves instead of praying to Jesus who replaced the lambs. 

Sometimes I wonder if maybe he just didn't like seeing lambs killed and let himself get killed through a really elaborate story so less lambs had to be slaughtered for redemption. Maybe Jesus was just a simple vegetarian. 




 I went to one of the Lawsons estate auctions of someone's stuff in Bellevue Hill. Didn't buy anything just wanted to see cause I've never been. 

There was a maid... Like she had her own bedroom next to the kitchen and wore the little black and white outfit. A maid!!! Like from TV! !

I also discovered those auctions are good for furniture because people go for the art and don't care about the furniture so it's cheap.  




 So what you're saying is that it's both adorable AND practical! :) 




 I love how they are colour coded! 




 I am one of those people that overanalyses my day to day life and I always feel like this. Sometimes it helps if I lay in bed and think about where I am right now and analyse just the present. It gives me a short reprieve from everything outside of my room and I am just in this moment right now. Maybe you can try it.

Like right now I am typing on an iPad on my bed and the air conditioning is on which I am glad for because i hate feeling sweaty when I'm about to sleep. I'm a little tired and have a headache but I'm glad the day is over. I'm not going to think about tomorrow... Just the next 5 minutes and I'm focused on this message and thinking about how when I sleep my mind will shut down for just a few hours and me and it will have our daily short but very necessary holiday away from each other. 




 Hugs. We care. I know we are just strangers but I wish somehow we could take away the suffering.

Do you think you can get another job? Maybe something to help you pay the bills?  




 Hypothetically what would you like your life to look like? 




 I know the feeling of not being able to get out of bed. It's tormenting because I know if I don't make an effort things will only get worse but all I can manage right now is the bare minimum.

If you take the job and it doesn't work out can you quit? Maybe you could just try it out and see how it goes. Maybe it isn't as bad as you imagine? Is your friend working there?  




 Go to Target, get a set with a fitted sheet, a flat sheet and pillowcases. 1000 thread count is best so don't bother feeling it just get it. (Eg. 
http://www.target.com.au/p/1-thread-count-cotton-sheet-set-white/181097_white )

The Target stuff is good quality but if you want something nicer you can get Vue sheets at Myer that are a bit nicer and don't have the premium of being Sheridan. (Eg. http://m.myer.com.au/shop/mobile/mystore/au-vue-tranquil-300tc-sb-sheet-set-d-19653 ) Though if you want Sheridan stuff and have a car I recommend driving to the Sheridan outlet over near Arncliffe unless that is too far. It's last season stock but still great quality and a fair bit cheaper. With these brands I go for 200- 400 TC. (Eg. http://www.sheridanfactoryoutlet.com.au/sheets/sheridan-300-thread-count-caffery-sheet-set.html ) The honest truth is if you see no difference between thread counts get the cheaper one cause it's probably just wasted money if you don't mind. 

Get a mattress protector. Not the waterproof ones cause they don't breathe. Just a regular one. Tontine are good but most are fine.

Get a blanket, doona or fleece. If doona you need a cover. Anything is fine as long as the size of the doona and the cover matches your mattress. In winter the best and most expensive is goose down but it will be very hot in summer. I have different toppings for summer and winter. 

Get a pillow. This part I suck at. Everyone likes different pillows. Get a pillow protector. Nothing fancy. The $5 ones from kmart will do. It will make your pillow last longer ie. Not go yellow as fast. 

Also don't buy white. Your sheets will look dirty fast.

And don't wash fitted sheets with hot water. It destroys the elastic.

Oh and everything above should be cotton apart from the blanket, doona, fleece or throw (ie. The warm layer). Though a cotton throw can be good in summer as it has the weight without being too warm.

Also don't buy European pillows or pillowcases or decorative cushions. Useless.  




 I moved out about 22 or 23. It really became necessary when I was studying and working in the city. The 3 hour return commute from my parents wasn't working for me anymore.  




 Here in Australia I have never used up my sick leave allowance... ever... my boss even let me use it when I got my wisdom teeth pulled which I'm not sure is strictly sick leave as it's planned. It would be against the law here to force someone to come to work when they are sick and have a doctor's certificate proving it. Workers here are entitled to 10 days per year when full-time. 




 [Identical](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/ed/c1/b0/edc1b0e2431d14eddc848353475d93eb.jpg) 




 China hates Japan because of what they did in the war. I don't see why they would bother attacking Australia. They can mostly already get what they need from us. 




 So wouldn't that put Australia on par in terms of progressive-ness? Is there something else as well?  




 It's like everyone's forgotten that China and Australia fought together at one point. 

Not saying we should side again but why do we have to side with anyone.

Japanese leaders weren't completely removed from ruling after the war like they were in Germany. See http://www.crf-usa.org/election-central/bringing-democracy-to-japan.html
The current government descends from that... I think China still feels that was not right but had little say in it at the time and will not accept Japan's many apologies while they feel that the same organization that commited what were horrific war crimes against them, are still in power. To understand why China hates Japan look at the massacres and war crimes they committed.

China is growing to a position of power but they have so many internal problems at the moment without involving other countries. They have the power to bully Japan on the side but probably no interest in taking it too far right now.  




 Sounds like you have a warranty on the battery so yeah this makes the most sense. But do you know someone who can take it out and put it back in for you? Cause obviously sounds like you can't drive the car there to get someone to do it. It's actually pretty simple but if you're not good with cars you might want someone else to do it. 




 There is a Kmart Tyre and Auto on Booth Street or one at Broadway near the fruit shop. Or I find Glebe Auto Repairs on Bridge Rd cheaper. If you call them they may have some suggestions for getting your car there or visiting you.  




 I'm curious to know why Australia is considered less progressive? Not arguing either way... but I would like to understand the perception.  




 I spent 6.5 years at Sydney Uni so ask me anything. But I'm Australian so don't know what it's like as an American. Though my supervisor was from the US so always told me about it. 

1) assuming you're coming as an undergraduate: not that many Aussies live on campus. Most commute at least for their first year. Otherwise it should be pretty similar to the US.

2) This is unlikely to be a problem. Sydney Uni is fairly diverse. 

3) Depends what you're after and what experience if any you have. If you have an RSA you can try bar work. If you have done some prior study you can do tutoring. You can do babysitting.  The Uni has a casual and part time job portal: http://sydney.edu.au/careers/finding_jobs/casual.shtml
You might need to be enrolled to log in.  




 Reminded me of this guy: http://m.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/queensland-man-bitten-by-deadly-snake-grabs-a-beer-20140310-34iik.html 




 I'm not a parent so I feel rather ignorant. I have a relative whose kid only eats chips and nuggets and it seems rather unhealthy but they have a hard time getting them to eat other foods. I have heard other parents say the same thing about bananas or fruits. Why are kids so selective?  




 Exciting! Have a good trip! 




 I like New Zealand but I wouldn't consider it a place to go for job opportunities.  




 I'm not sure why this was getting downvoted. We are lucky to be in Australia. I always wanted to leave but now having seen a lot more of the world I can't imagine leaving permanently by choice.  




 Have pity on us who live next to dogs like that the rest of the year. Just kill me...

Oh and you report problem dogs to council.  




 It was a bit windy today in Sydney! I thought about going out but we ended up just walking about a block. I feel super lazy. Tomorrow I will go for a run! 




 I think I'm bored, but I don't have the energy to do anything. Maybe I should go back to sleep. 




 I love Christmas ham.  




 I have a muslim Jordanian friend and he said the prejudice is way worse there than in Australia. I would have never guessed from my short trip there... 




 Bundeena to Marley is shortish. Marley Beach is nice. 




 I suppose it depends on the kind of fashion you're into. Myer and DJs are good for footwear and work clothes. Myer is also ok for casual. If you want gym stuff then Rebel in either mid city or King St. If you want other casual clothes it depends on your tastes. The chain stores have the best sales usually. 




 You cant skip New Years Eve in Sydney. I tried it a couple of years and it was fine until the party in the city started on TV and then I wanted to be there in the thick of it even though I know all too well how the night is going to end. 
(Also dont watch the ABC coverage. Itll ruin New Years Eve forever for you.)

Usually the night starts off great. The anticipation of a great night ahead is building. Depending on what Im doing Ill get dressed up - heels, dress, hair, etc. or in a low key year  casual clothes. Im pretty excited about going out into the city. I try to drink heaps of water through the day to make sure Im fully hydrated and pack the fridge with some Gatorade for later. Im still feeling clean.  

Then you might have a drink or two before heading into the CBD. Here youre on the bus or train with everyone else still fairly sober and well-behaved. Everyones kind of in a good mood and it feels fun, since its the end of an old year and you can say goodbye to your loser 2014 self and say hello to your new and improved 2015 self who at this point hasnt had a chance to screw everything up yet. Youre a clean slate, and the crispness of the air conditioning in the train and bus just affirms to you that this year will be different to all the others - youre going to be a new person now.

As you arrive in the CBD and get off the bus or train, you make your way to your 9pm fireworks location and possibly your location for the rest of the night. Sometimes its Darling Harbour, sometimes its Circular Quay somewhere, sometimes its a harbour side vantage point or a private party of a friend of a friend of who the hell knows? Wherever it is, you probably have to stay on your side of the bridge or else plan to stay out until much later than you would ever have planned But right now you just need the best spot possible. The rest is a problem for later.  

If youre lucky enough to have found a harbourside party, great! Youre probably in the best position to enjoy New Years. You just need to take your own drinks and youre set. Just wander down to the nearest lookout and then meander back to the house between the 9 and 12. All you have to do is drink, dance and try to avoid getting into any fights.  

If you havent found a party which is most years then you probably will sit around getting slowly more intoxicated while reminiscing the last year, discussing any resolutions youre making and waiting for the 9pm fireworks to light up. If you didn't sneak any alcohol past the checkpoint.... sigh. Prepare yourself - it's going to feel pretty drawn out. The same boat with snake lights will go left and right in front of you, but its still kind of nice looking out over the harbour with those lights (as long as its not raining and you don't sit under a tree where bats will shit on you). Try not to get sunburnt too, that kind of puts a damper on things to come. 

When the fireworks go off at 9pm youre probably feeling like  OMG Fireworks!!! Ive waited for HOURS and they are the best EVER!! I love Sydney! Yay! By now youre getting a bit tipsy, all the children are running around on the grass with their glow sticks and whirry glow sticks. After that some families head home, others stick it out.

Then you start the long haul wait for the midnight fireworks. How this goes depends a lot on your location and company but generally if youre in a grassed area it involves drinking whatever you sneaked past the checkpoint, eating snacks, talking crap and waiting If youre comfortable and have enough to drink this goes fairly quickly, if youre not its slooow. 

Then, at last, the final few minutes to midnight. You can hear the whole city getting excited. This is the part where if you stayed home youd start regretting it. Everyone is excited to see in the new year, people are starting to bustle for a good spot to see the fireworks. Then the countdown on the harbour bridge starts, you can see the numbers light up and everyone stands up at once. The whole city screams out the countdown to midnight and there is this amazing sense of awe along with the collective sound of a few of those roll-out party pipes as the first midnight fireworks bless the sky and make the loudest thunder and clap and crackle, and light the sky with the full rainbow of colours. If youre near the foreshore sometimes theres music but sometimes the sound of the fireworks is too loud to hear it. The sound vibrates inside of you and you can feel the new year start. Whatever the theme is lights up on the bridge, people do their new years kisses, the party horns sound and you can hear everyone ooo and ahh at the fireworks. The fireworks seem to never end. There are fireworks left right and centre and you can see them and its amazing. However you felt about it earlier in the night, the wait was worth it.

When it finally ends everyone yells out to random strangers Happy New Year! as people start to make their way from wherever they are to wherever theyre going. Usually theres some aggressive teenage boys who push and shove and elbow their way through the crowd, like somehow its really going to make a difference, but everyone is in too good a mood/not sober enough to pay too much attention. Most people start to wander off and then you see the huge piles of crap left all over the ground and the poor grass being completely destroyed. 

As you leave the space between people gets a little larger. If you decided to go home from Circular Quay via George Street youll have to contend with everyone else. Its like the harbour was a giant stadium with no orderly exit strategy, just a million people who all want to exit at once. Most people are pretty well behaved, but some start pouring out of bars drunk and disorderly and getting into fights. Thankfully theres not the copious amounts of broken glass all over the road there used to be but it can still get pretty gnarly. Its been a while since I walked down the Rocks, but I think itd still be similar. 

Ive never caught the train at Circular Quay  it just never works out and I cant even tell how long the wait is because theres just too many people  so usually we start our trek up George Street with everyone else. People at first are fairly orderly, then as more time passes more of the dregs start making their way up with the girls falling over in their less than practical footwear, guys vomiting and urinating and youve got the best seats in the house to the worst show on earth. You probably want to zig-zag up the road and pay close attention to where you place your feet at this point.  

Its been a while since Ive gotten the train back from the city - now we generally walk a few kms to get home and if we're lucky we'll nab a taxi. By the time I get home Im either completely sober or feeling pretty ill, though generally I feel really dirty but also dont care all that much because I'm so tired. Ill collapse into bed thinking next year maybe Ill just stay at home mainly because getting home was so damn hard. But as I fall asleep Ill think of the smell, sound and colours of the fireworks and dream about doing it all over again. :)

Another option is to watch the fireworks from a park or location further out of the city. This can be a lot more relaxing, the alcohol rules aren't as strict and there's less idiots around. When you're not keen for the hassle of the CBD, this is usually the best way to enjoy NY's. Just as long as you have a way to get home, preferably walking. The upside of this is you just got to chill out and get home easy, and you will be able to wake up the next morning and still enjoy New Year's Day. 




 If you want to drink most of the public vantage points around the city areas are alcohol free zones. http://www.sydneynewyearseve.com/vantage-points/  Probably best to try to find an alcohol on sale site on the harbour. 

If you have some money to spend maybe you can go to Luna Park - I haven't been so can't tell you if it's good. There's different price tiers though, so I guess depends what you're after. http://www.moshtix.com.au/v2/event/harbour-party-nye-2014/73390

 




 Are you looking for something in particular or just keen for a browse? It's mayhem in the city, so I'd probably plan to visit stores in location order to minimise the time fighting the crowd.  




 I wish they were still here with us... :( 




 There's some shops in Chinatown that sell weird singlets/shirts. They probably have a VB one. 




 It was a really amazing and beautiful gesture to have so many flowers out there and so many people going to pay their respects. And a great idea to turn them into something and save all the notes.

I went there the day before they were removed though, and some of the older bunches were actually starting to smell pretty bad. I think it was good timing to pack them up. If a storm did come through as forecast and destroy the flowers more it wouldn't have been a good scene to wake up to. 




 If it's raining:

- Chinese/Asian places are usually open e.g. Chinatown, Cabramatta
- Some other cafes/restaurants should be open e.g. Lowenbrau
- Cinemas
- [Sydney Acquarium](http://www.sydneyaquarium.com.au/visitor-info/opening-hours/)
- Ferry Ride (if it's not too windy - but it looks like there'll be thunderstorms tomorrow)

Merry Christmas :) Hope you find something fun to do.

Edit: Didn't read the title properly! 




 I've found that most people I've spoken to don't know the difference between a virus and a bacteria. It seems that it's just not something people learn in high school.  




 No problem at all! I'm glad you heard my words and that I could brighten your day. :)  




 I wish I could hug you. You were desperate and you felt like there was no way out. Guilt is a difficult thing to overcome, especially when you feel like it really was your fault. But despite what people say, it is possible to change. You can still hate what you did, but you don't have to hate yourself. You're human, and everyone makes mistakes. You're not the first person to have hurt other people and you won't be the last. 

I'm not saying to forget what you did, obviously it is something that is deeply bothering you. In fact if we just forget we don't really learn from the past. I'm saying to separate the act from the person you are. You can be a different person now and perform different actions. 

Also mistakes are a part of life. We all make mistakes. Some mistakes feel impossible to let go of. There are things that I deeply regret and if I had a chance I would go back and change it in an instant. But I can't. So the way forward for me is to try not to let it happen again. It may, but at least I will have done my best to try. 




 What will you be doing in Japan? Maybe the change would be good. 

It's difficult when you're unsure of what you want. What are your options? Maybe write down all the things you've thought of doing and the pros and cons of each one and then once you've had a thorough think through, try talking with a friend (probably not your SO or her mum though as it might complicate things). Maybe that will help. It might at least help you clarify what it is about each of the things that you're attracted to and identify what's missing right now in your life.

If you don't have other friends to talk to you can talk to me about it if you want too. I'm all ears :) 




 Life can be worth living and it's hard to see that sometimes. It definitely doesn't and probably won't feel like that all the time, but hopefully there are parts that make it worth it. If you're not feeling good about not having a job... then the only answer to that is to get a job, even if it's not your dream job. 

Right now you're stuck in a cycle. You feel crap so you have no motivation to do anything, and the lack of motivation is making you feel crap. To get out of the cycle you need to start small. Pick something you want to work on, and work on that. 

People are giving you pressures because they care about you. But you don't have to listen to any of them, it's entirely up to you. But don't change things for anyone else, change things for yourself - to make you happier and your life better. You can do it, I believe you can!  




 Sounds like a pretty difficult situation you're in. Can I ask you a question though - what do you want? I hear you say a lot about what you don't want, which is helpful, but what would you like things to be like?

You sound like an amazing caring and loving person, but it sort of also sounds like you've put everyone else before yourself.  




 You've surprised me because I've been feeling the exact same way. 

I was really fit before but I had a stress fracture about 2 years ago and I've put on about 10kg. I waited a long time for it to recover (I think it was 6 months), but I couldn't rest it because my job requires me to move around a lot and carry my laptop around (which is not a lot of fun while wearing a moon boot). Anyway, I decided I needed to run, so I went for a jog one day and it was awesome... I missed it so much... then the next day my foot is in a heap of pain. Turns out I fractured it again. This time I had to wait a year for it to heal. 

A lot of other stuff happened in my life. I got married and I was much bigger than I would have liked. Don't get me wrong I'm so happy to be married but it was a very stressful lead up to the wedding. On my wedding day I nearly had coldsores but luckily somehow they went down. I have been in some very stressful situations at my work and it has really made it hard for me to feel positive. I am just so busy I don't have time to think about it most of the time, but if I did I know I wouldn't be happy.

There are a lot of things I don't like about my life. It got pretty bad and I was ready to let go of everything. At 3am I was sitting down preparing myself and a police car drove up next to my car and asked me if everything was ok. I burst into tears and he asked what I was doing and if I wanted to talk about it and I said no I just needed some alone time. He said if I needed anything I knew who to call. That simple act was enough to get me through. 

This past year a few people close to me have passed away - one to suicide - and going to the funeral sealed in my mind that I would go through any amount of pain to save my family or friends from that suffering. It has been really tough. This forum has been a place that I have been able to come and talk to people about things and it has made it more bearable. I really truly encourage you to do the same, and if there is anything you need to talk about or just vent then just PM me anytime.

Sometimes life is really tough but you will get through it. 

In terms of motivation, after the 4th death of a close friend this year I just couldn't do anything. I stopped doing the dishes, the house was a mess... things just sort of started to fall apart. I went to the psychologist and she asked what was bothering me the most and I told her it was the house. She told me to just pick one thing each day - like say, doing the dishes and do it. Each day has been a struggle but I am slowly getting better. Maybe you can try to do the same? 




 Do you want it to change?

I guess at the end of the day only you really know yourself. We're all kind of trapped inside ourselves to some extent and it's hard for others to see what we're feeling or thinking. 

But it doesn't mean people can't know you to some extent. I'm pretty private but I do let the important people in my life in. 




 How long have you been feeling this way? Is there something you're particularly unhappy about or just generally feeling flat? 

How you feel is how you feel, you don't need to feel guilty for those feelings. Almsot everyone has times when they wish for things to be different.

To me it sounds like you need to keep putting one foot in front of the other and trying to do things that lift you and make you feel like you're taking active steps towards something. Maybe it's something little like going for walks each day or sticking to a schedule, or maybe they're bigger things like changing jobs. Is there something that is most bothering you right now? Maybe that is a good place to start. What do you think? 




 I was trying to reply to a lot of posts but then my own day to day life   problems get in the way. It's not that I don't want to reply, just that sometimes I am too drained myself to do so. But I would reply to everyone if I could!  




 I lol'ed at ass o'clock :) 




 Do you think she left you purely because being a parent was too stressful? I feel like there is probably more to this story than that. 




 My favorite bags are Coach and Mimco. Mimco bags I only get on sale because they're on sale all the time. Oroton has some nice ones. I also saw some pretty nice ones in Marcs. Myer is worth checking out too. If I want something cheaper then I also look at Nine West although I don't think they're leather.  




 Oh... really... so I just learnt that "spelt" wasn't used in the US much. I wouldn't have even thought about it. 
























 If I need help I much prefer Mitre 10. The one near me actually hired an ex-plumber in the plumbing section. Also once I needed a gift for my dad for fathers day and got a suggestion - it was the only gift I've ever given dad that I think he's actually wanted, despite all my best efforts. 




 eBay if you can. It's cheaper and they're often better than store costumes. But you need time for the delivery... that's the only problem.  




 One option might be to find a Butcher that can order it for you. 

I have usually found a good variety of meats at Peters Meats in Broadway. You could try giving them a call and asking them if they can order it in for you.

You could also try asking this Scottish place (in Maroubra btw,  not in the Hills) if they sell it or know where to get it:

 In Australia eggs are often located on non refrigerated shelves at supermarkets but when I get home I always put them in the fridge.

Australia sits somewhere between US and European standards. We wash our eggs but they sometimes are and sometimes aren't sold from the fridge in the supermarket. Most people I know do put them in the fridge once home though like I do. 

[See here](http://www.businessinsider.com.au/should-you-refrigerate-eggs-in-australia-2014-7) 

The processing process in Australia is shown on page 6 [here](https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t source=web rct=j q=Australia%20egg%20washed ei=dLQeVdHEFMHe8AXGtYCIDA url=http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/code/primaryproduction/egg/documents/Eggs_healthandsafety.pdf ved=0CB8QFjAB usg=AFQjCNFfMLYdgk38K3YFJ71kHs7D8kRqNA )
 




 If you're a good looking lady you almost always get to choose. 




 That's obviously going to vary as countries raise and lower interest rates.  




 I'm a resident overseas and have accounts overseas already. I'm not too worried. I'll spread my eggs around in different baskets to hedge my bets. 




 Sounds good to me. Thanks! :)  




 I wonder if you can get your wages deposited into an overseas account. Anyone know? 




 I just Googled it and found this photo of baby Emus on the beach!:
https://malpassadventures.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/dsc_0058.jpg

Will sign! I want to see beach Emus one day.  




 I catch buses and don't use the opal card. If you do use the opal card just make sure you tap off when you get off.  




 A lot of native flowers are usually pretty expensive. I'd go to the market and make my own bouquet. You have to wake up early though but they are also really fresh. 

If you want a good floral arrangement from a good florist you usually have to order them in advance. 

I know a few good places but none in or near those particular areas unfortunately. There used to be a florist at the international airport arrivals terminal but I think it is gone now. 

Pearsons florist at Broadway used to be good but they are renovating their store at the moment. I think they have quite a few stores around Sydney. Just be warned,  they're pretty expensive but they do very nice bouquets. 




 I've had my kmart one for a couple of years. It still works fine including the pedal, though doesn't look as good as it used to. Still does the job though. I don't value the bin enough to spend a lot of money on it. 




 I fed these guys once and ended up with my balcony covered in bird poo. That was the last time. 




 Tafe at Ultimo is pretty good and cheaper than the unis. Good if you want to go after work.  




 I think there are quite a few kids at jenolan caves though. I went in school holidays and they sell the tours out for hours in advance so I'd recommend if you go get the tickets first and walk around the pretty lake while you wait for your cave tour. 




 I haven't seen any in Sydney... wild. Even if they were it'd be hard to spot them. They're not exactly noisy! I was on Magnetic Island and it was hot so stopped to put sun cream on for like ten minutes. Just as I was going to leave I heard a small rustling noise. Directly above me was a small koala. Must have been a juvenile. It woke up for about 30 seconds and moved to a different fork in the tree then went back to sleep. 

I'd say your best bet near Sydney is a wildlife park or zoo.  




 :( I am worried for my teeth too. I wish I was a shark and could regrow them. 




 But... where *are* the pedals?  




 If you ask a friend or acquaintance I'm sure they'd help you out. I'd let my deprived friends use my Internet! 

If you have no friends you can try cafes but they'll be noisy. I personally wouldn't want to do an interview in one.  But if you must... Well Connected Cafe in Glebe has free wifi. It's not 24 hrs but it's got longish hours. 

There are also Internet/gaming cafes like city hunter. You could give them a call and ask if you can use Skype but they would have headsets for gaming. Sorry been ages since I've been there. Not sure if it's noisy there but you could check it out anyway.

I reckon buying 4G would be the way to go as well. 




 If you're lucky you can see them in the city. 

For the longest time I thought someone was using a clothes dryer at night... and it always puzzled me why at that hour they would do their laundry. It turns out it was a tawny frogmouth. They make a weird continuous hoot. After hearing this sound for over 5 years I finally saw them a couple of months ago. I saw 3 in the space of about two weeks. So cool. They hang by the creek. 

Although tawny frogmouths aren't technically owls, they're nightjars so I suppose I haven't really seen an owl.

But yeah if you want to see them, you'll have to listen carefully. When you're close they are very quiet and difficult to spot unless they fly in front of you. But it happens! At least you will know from listening if they are in your area. 




 Maybe having the ticket is your chance to make friends with someone who will go with you. 

Or you could go by yourself. I do lots of stuff by myself. It's not as bad as it seems. The animals don't mind :) 




 That's the weirdest part of the whole thing. Especially late at night. Who cares? 

Anyway if it makes the OP feel any better, I live in the city. Road abuse is a normal thing for me and has no effect on me anymore. Just lock your doors, wind up the windows and turn up the music.  




 Redfern. But only if you get off and on the right carriages.  




 I've been looking for 2 years. Whatever the price guide is we usually add $200-300k and it ends up closer to what it will actually go for. It helps reduce our disappointment a bit at auction. But it's still crap. Every time we figure out what the price should be it defies our expectations the next month. It's horribly disheartening and makes me lose faith. 




 I'd leave Sydney if there were decent jobs elsewhere. How do we get businesses to move to other cities? Surely people would be interested in living somewhere with affordable housing closer to work.  




 Thanks! :)  




 OP has obviously already done it. Why would I do it again? 




 How do you make it show the locations? 




 Where is this map from? I need some suburbs further south! 




 Can you do Australian Fauna now and Carnivores later? That would be cool to do both.

Food poisoning sucks. Has the vomiting stopped? I paid a lot for a fancy hotel overseas once and spent the night on towels on the bathroom floor vomiting all night. I had to get a foreign doctor to give me a needle to stop it. But only after almost 24 hours. :/ He said any longer and I'd be in hospital.  




 I just realized how old I am. I used to use one of these at work.  




 I had a pet dwarf rabbit when I was a kid and the cat got it and killed it. I smacked the cat to try to make it drop it but I couldn't make it drop it without hurting the cat, and I didn't want to break it's jaw. The dog was barking, it was chaos, but the cat just hung tight until it was dead. Worst pet combo ever. Now, I wouldn't ever keep a cat with an animal that could be it's prey. We got mice for pets once, that drove the cat insane. The cat would refuse to eat anything else until it got the mice. One day I came home and the cat had knocked the cage over and broken it. Weird thing is that cat was so gentle with humans - no scratching or biting or anything, just cute and cuddly. 




 I got an air purifier the other day and I farted near it. Poor thing went into hyper drive. :(  




 Oh yeah whoops. I didn't notice the time :) 




 Aren't people who are cruel to animals often sociopaths? If so then they may be more likely to have a record.  




 During the gun buyback after guns were outlawed there were quite a few individuals who exploited the fact that people willingly handed over their guns. They often had someone file down the numbers and then redistribute them to criminals for a price. If you Google it you will find quite a few news stories about those who were caught. Many of the illegal guns in Australia are still in circulation due to criminals like this who profited greatly at the cost of others. 

For example:
http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/record-jail-term-for-gun-plot/2007/02/21/1171733835420.html?page=fullpage 




 Damn you! I was on a diet! 




 Some of these things are totally do-able! What is stopping you all? 




 But soup is humid. I went the other day when it was hot and I was sweating like a pig.  




 When I was in the US I learned they have BB guns and paintball for sale at some of the sports stores. Guess that's how they can host events like the one you mentioned. It's much more regulated here. 




 I thought this must be what happens when you get foxtel.  




 ... and MrAwkwardCrotch's knowledge of lubes. 




 Where do his man parts go? Are they usually that... compactable? 




 It must have been terrifying. I'm glad you made it out of there.  




 Have you fought fires there? Do the trees fall down when there's fires too? 




 Wow, that's pretty nice! How have I lived in Sydney my whole life and not been there?  




 That's a great photo!  




 I see what you mean. I agree with you. It doesn't make sense as an objective question. I think most people get that and answer it subjectively - at least that's what I did. Also I like hearing other people's opinions so I can expand my horizons and knowledge of other nice places.  




 Actually I would prefer if Australia was a Republic and that particular point has nothing to do with my choices.  




 Can other people not from the US/Canada who haven't lived in these two countries for any period of time tell the difference between these accents? Sometimes I feel like I can when I am there, but then I get all confused, especially when there are so many different American accents. 




 "America has contributed nothing positive to society or the world."

I don't believe this at all, but I do think it would piss most Americans off. 




 What sort of person would you describe if you were to try to explain what "most" Americans are like? I've always found this hard because America has quite a lot of diversity.   




 There are plenty of other things that need the world's attention, those are the things we are often trying to escape by considering living in countries that have less things that need the world's attention. 

So on a global level we should care about other things, but on a personal level we want the best we can get, so this is entirely relevant to us as individuals.  




 I haven't been there so I can't really put it on my top list as I don't know a lot about it. I like natural features, so it has to have that to be on the best country list. Do you know if they have anything like that?

I loved the Republic of Ireland but feel that it's too economically unstable to live for a full lifetime. Also I have never been to a country that has so little racial diversity as Ireland, and I would miss it.  




 I would say Canada, Australia, New Zealand. I can't choose one.

Edit: Clearly this is subjective.  




 I had this same thing happen to me! I was running late for an appointment with a specialist and I told the guy and he yelled insults at me about being a selfish bitch. Honestly though, it's water off a duck's back. I do my bit.  




 I didn't know that but I always have donated directly. I tell them up front that I only donate online so they don't hassle me. I'm not giving some stranger on the street my credit card details... 




 I'm pretty sure my cat would have pulled this off in less than 30 seconds. 




 I drink Gatorade when I'm doing sport, but if you just want to rehydrate without the sugars, you can have electrolyte rehydration tables. Not sure what they're called in the US but in Australia they're called Hydralyte and Gastrolyte. They are good if you are dehydrated and need to encourage your body to absorb the water without all the extra sugars that are in some of the sports drinks like Gatorade and Powerade.

Energy drinks are not used for the purposes of rehydration, and they taste terrible. I don't know how anyone can stand the sweetness.  




 I'm really glad I read this thread for this comment. I didn't know they were bad. We were using them in the bathroom to rid it of the poo smells (our bathroom doesn't have windows or a fan), but now I will be careful what I burn! 




 I think we do know this is unhealthy, we just have difficulty doing much about it. :(

Edit: Commercial solarium use was banned in every state except Western Australia and Northern Territory on Jan 1st, 2015. ([more detail in my other comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2zqim0/what_are_the_cigarettes_of_today_what_does/cplztv0)) 




 I love how you saved something that might otherwise have ended up in the trash. It looks lovely too. I can see this is a proud part of your kitchen. 




 Yeah, sometimes I kind of cringe when he's handling the animals. Not because he's going to hurt them, more that I think he'll get hurt because he's shaking them around probably aggravating them. I'm surprised he's not bitten more often. Shows you that most Australian animals (goannas and crocs excluded) although potential deadly are usually pretty non-confrontational.  




 Don't worry he never hurts any of them.

He mostly picks up snakes. E.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at0efMXfCnc 




 Aw poor little things. But they are so cute so they have that going for them.  




 That's interesting - why is there an exception for axolotl's? 

 




 Yeah, it is. :( Stupid cars!  




 'cause they're super cool? :)

My favourite Australian lizard aside from the blue tongue is the frill-neck lizard. When I was in primary school I saw my first real one in the playground and it was the coolest thing ever! It was scared so it frilled up and had a stand off with about twenty 7 year olds all staring in awe. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frill-necked_lizard
 




 Sort of - like, not really rare, but definitely uncommon. You need a reptile license to own any type of snake or reptile in New South Wales (and I think maybe that's the case for all of Australia but I'm not 100% sure). You can't really just walk into a normal pet store and buy them, but I suppose some people do keep them.
http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/wildlifelicences/ReptileKeepersLicence.htm

I used to have a blue tongue lizard living in the backyard so never really thought about owning one. One day I came home and it was sitting in the gutter under our front door and I screamed thinking it was a snake, but it was just having a rest. :) 




 You might like this video then... First guy to get the iPhone 6 in Perth:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA135pd7oD0 




 I don't know if you've heard of him - David Ireland, Wildlife Man - but he always loves to pick animals up that don't want to be picked up and while he's talking he flails them about in the air.  

He did this with a Shingleback and it was so angry at him. When he put it down it didn't really try to run away it just looked at him like it was evaluating it's options on how exactly it was going to take his life. I tried to find the video on youtube but I can't find it. :( 




 I think it's a [Shingleback Lizard](http://australianmuseum.net.au/shingleback-lizard) from Australia! 

There is a little doco here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPZiAiUYS8o

The main feature is that the tail looks like a head - to confuse predators. 




 Ah I knew it was missing something! I have rectified this tragic mistake! 




 Maybe he saw the wallet and couldn't believe his luck. As he walked home he pondered what he could do with it. He could take a well-earned holiday. He could upgrade his worn out car that forced him onto public transport to a nice new car. He could pay off a bit of the mortgage. When he got home he realised that there were a mountain of bills piled up on the table and so he quickly went about using the money to pay them all off. 

The moment he was finished he sighed a big sigh of relief. But as the night went on he couldn't stop thinking about the person who lost the money. Who were they? Why did they need that much cash? At first he dismissed the idea with thoughts that they were probably drug dealers and so by keeping the money he was actually helping to keep drugs off the street. For a day or two he tried to convince himself that that was the case. After the second day the thought popped into his head that maybe this was money that had been saved up by an elderly person and this was their retirement fund. What if children had visited him from two different countries and provided urgently needed help? Imagine, being 80 years old and the money to sustain you was in that envelope. For days he wrestled with the idea until he came to the conclusion that he would never know. This is what really chewed him up inside. What if his act of keeping the money was now causing someone else's deprivation? His conscience couldn't bear it. 

He realised that there was only one solution and that was to give the money back. But he'd already spent almost $8000 of it. He felt so selfish. He didn't want to go to the police with the remaining money only to be found out if they did locate the original owner that he'd taken a cut for himself. He considered lying and saying that's all he found in the envelope, but he didn't want to risk it. So he decided he would save up the money and return it to the police. He calculated he could do this in about 2 months.

Two months went by and he was making good progress, but his dog got sick so he had to take him to the vet, which cost him another good chunk of the money. 

Finally after several months he had earnt all the money back and put it in the envelope and turned it into the police. He was relieved. His conscience was clear, and he could resume his life before finding the wad of cash. 

As he walked home he noticed a brand new looking lottery ticket blowing in the wind. If I win it's fate he thought! Karma for my good deeds! He got home and as all the numbers were being announced he slowly began to realise he had won! $23,000 exactly. :)

* Edit: 

And then out of nowhere a heavy knock at the door... Without thinking he opened the door and there before him was Nessy the lochness monster. She explained that she was lost and was trying to get home to Scotland, and she needed treefiddy to make a phonecall. The man retrieved the money at which point Nessy started crying, explaining that it was such a lonely place in Scotland. The man's heart went out to the creature - he himself only had a pet dog whose health had recently taken a turn for the worse. He asked Nessy if she wanted to come to stay with him, as he had a large backyard pool, though he apologised that the water was no longer a clear blue, rather a murky brown, as you see he had no friends to share it with and let it go. Nessy squealed with delight! A brown murky pool was just perfect! They agreed, and the two mystical creatures lived out their days in the quiet suburbs of Sydney. 




 That's good. Those guys are like sharks. When I was younger there was a tow truck driver pouring oil on the road to cause accidents and of course he'd be the first on the scene. So since then I have never trusted them.

 I don't know :( I've never been cool enough to take up smoking. I was in Aspen, Colorado and the e-cigs are everywhere - mostly older people. Apparently it's the thing to do there.  




 This makes the most sense. I think they are more likely to pick up e-cigs. They look much cooler. 




 You're amazing :) 




 Thanks for the gold! :) I have never had gold before. I feel so special!  




 Maybe it is also just trying to enjoy a nice evening! 

I just looked it up and apparently slugs are attracted to wine!:

 Unlike Virgin, they go all the way... which way exactly though, they aren't too sure about. 




 They're building one of the biggest in Queensland! Hopefully the government can just keep their shit together for long enough to see the benefits.

 I loved my cat too... she was the best. I miss her so much. 

Some people suck, but there are a lot of good people too. But the terrible things people do overwhelms me sometimes. When that happens, I just think about building my own little island in the world and sometimes I travel to other places and interact with people, but then I try to come back to my own island where I try to create the world that I want to live in, and that includes making the world better for other people. I don't think island is the right word, but I really mean my section of the world, where I can mould it to be how I want it. I like that I can possibly make a difference in my little part of the world. Like a little oasis. 
 




 I think it's good seeing someone about it. Sometimes I get stuck in circles like being sucked down a whirlpool and it is like a hand reaching down and pulling me out of it. I hope you find it helpful too. I don't think I will ever be 'cured' but I hope to live a full life anyway. 

I don't need to be happy all the time, sadness is a part of life, but I don't want to be miserable all the time. 

How do I connect with Eeyore? I wouldn't mind. I should sleep too. :) 

Btw, it means a lot that you took the time to reply. Thanks. It's my birthday today and now I don't feel alone. :) 




 Hey, this is precision driving! It's hard to get a car into a small parking space like that. 




 It looks like Hobart has been relocated to Flinders Island. 




 That particular Kirin one is pretty yummy! I had half of one today too at lunch with my sushi.  

Mango Raspberry sounds good too. I am going to get that now next time I'm at the shop. 




 I also like the Kirin Cider - the one with "Ume" (Japanese Plum) delights my tastebuds! 




 I'm so glad there is a gym underneath my office. The punching bags there have saved me from imploding.  




 Working full-time is definitely an adjustment. You're going to have to realise you might have to reduce time with friends, e.g. to the weekends. Unless they are work friends or people that work close to your work, in which case you can try to catch up with them for lunch or after work. At my last job, I used to go jogging with friends at lunch, or play sport. We also used to go out drinking most fridays. At my current job I am too busy for that, so it just means a little less socialising. Luckily most of my friends also work full-time so they are in the same boat and get it.  

Some jobs are better than others at having a better work-life balance. It's hard when you're starting out though because you sometimes do have to do longer hours and prove yourself. When you get a chance you can try to find somewhere with a better balance. Once you have experience you will have more bargaining power so that will help.  




 I also studied my last year of uni and worked full time. Things will get easier once you finish the year. Just try to stay on top of things and communicate with your boss if things are getting too much. I tried to power through it but I got really stressed and ended up on sick leave. Remember to try to eat healthy if you can and get enough sleep! It will help, trust me, I learnt the hard way. 




 A year or so ago I told my friend who is a psychologist about how I see someone, and I said that it's good cause I have someone to talk to. I explained I don't talk to my friends about it cause I don't want to burden them with it. She said plainly that she thinks that sometimes you should talk to your friends about things. It was the first time anyone had said that to me and it was one of the nicest things anyone has ever said to me. 

It's just so hard because I had it bad in highschool and always talked about suicide. My best friend from highschool also suffered from depression and last year she committed suicide, and I feel so responsible for talking about it all the time, and I feel like I didn't help and only made it worse for her. 

I still can't talk to friends openly about it. Sometimes I feel so alone.  
























 That is exactly why [Cronulla is no longer as good as when I was growing up](http://www.beachandbay.com.au/realestateblog/greenhills-beach-new-land-released-september-17/). 

Developers made a large donation to the state government, despite Sutherland Shire council strongly opposing it, in the end they had no say. $$$ 




 Do you prepare you clothes and belongings the night before? 




 When I didn't live in the city it was up by 6-6:30am to drive to the station and get the train between 7-7:30 and arrive in the city around 9am.
Now I live in the city I get up around 7:30 to get to work by 9am on the bus. 
But at the moment I wake up whenever I damn well feel like it because I'm on leave :) 




 Oh that's sad. I've had some good times here, especially when they've had some pretty awesome and unexpected free live music. 




 lol. Sounds delicious. I thought it would be okay because it's mostly older people in there... or does that make it not okay.  




 I guess it depends what type of person you and your friends are. Are you into outdoor stuff? Do you want to go drinking? Do you have other shared interests?

Anyway here's some ideas:

* [Paintball](http://ultimatepaintball.com.au/)

* [White Water Rafting in Penrith](http://www.penrithwhitewater.com.au/pages/whitewater-rafting.asp)

* [Skyzone Trampoline Dodgeball](http://www.skyzone.com.au/)
* Go to a bar with [board games](http://www.au.timeout.com/sydney/bars/features/9737/top-five-bars-with-board-games). I know it might sound lame but board games can be fun! Just don't play ones where people get knocked out completely and have to sit around and wait for the game to be over.

* [Go Karting](http://www.kartatak.com.au/)

* [Surfing Lessons](http://manlysurfschool.com/)

* Book a room in a venue and hang out there for the night - beers + drinks sorted. I think there are a few places that will let you book rooms.

* [Murder Mystery Party](http://www.murdermysteryfun.com.au/) - You can also do this one yourself.

* [Luna Park Party](http://www.lunaparksydney.com/parties-groups)

 




 Lol. The older I get the more fun this sounds. :)  




 Thanks! After reading about all the pubs I've been to I feel like I must be a bit of a drunk. :) 




 I'd recommend [Lord Nelson's](http://www.lordnelsonbrewery.com/) in the city for a bit of historic Sydney charm.

Just down the road from that is the [Argyle Hotel](http://www.theargylerocks.com/) which actually appears on the $20 note - as it used to be called the [Argyle Stores](http://urbaneventsvenues.com.au/articles/2014/7/24/from-convicts-and-liquor-stores-to-dance-floors-a-history-of-the-argyle) which was a warehouse for ships a while back. It can get [busy on Friday nights](http://www.barsandnightclubs.com.au/assets/images/content/club/sydney//The%20Argyle%20Hotel%20-%20The%20Rocks/The%20Argyle%20Hotel%20-%20The%20Rocks%20-%20Sydney%20-%20Photo02.jpg) so head over before 6pm if you can.

There is another pub on one of the steep hills in the Rocks but more towards Wynyard, [Harts Pub](http://hartspub.com/hartspub/Welcome). It's quite old inside so has a bit of an old Sydney feel, but don't try walking down that hill when you're drunk.

A little bit further towards the bridge, is the [Australian Heritage Hotel](http://www.australianheritagehotel.com/). They do good pizzas here. This is your stereotypical Australian pub. It's a bit of a tourist attraction, but who cares, I like it anyway.

Another nearby key kind of place in the Rocks is [Push Bar](http://www.pushbar.com.au/). It's been renamed a couple of times so I get confused, but I like sitting around in here with 3-4 friends and some beers and/or cocktails.

If you're looking for views, head to [Opera Bar](http://operabar.com.au/) in Circular Quay. The [views from this bar](http://www.boudist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Opera-Bar-and-Kitchen__credit-Daniel_Boud-048.jpg) include the Harbour, Harbour Bridge and Opera House. It's only good when it's raining if you get a seat inside. 

There's a couple of little bars around but harder to find. Two of my favourites are [The Baxter Inn](http://www.au.timeout.com/sydney/bars/venues/4904/baxter-inn) which is a whiskey bar, and [Palmer   Co](http://merivale.com.au/palmerandco) which is a 20's themed prohibition style bar. For both of these you need to get in early especially on Fridays, where they get busy any time from about 4pm onwards. There are a couple more small bars listed [here](http://www.urbanchicguides.com/top-10-sydney-small-bars/#.VThGhCGf4Q8) that I haven't tried yet, but I love the small bars. Keep in mind the drinks can be pricey at some of these places though, so if you specifically want to get drunk maybe head outside the city.  

Also because you specifically mentioned brews, I've got a couple of suggestions:
Lord Nelson is a brewery so go there.
There is also [Sydney Brewery](http://sydneybrewery.com/). It used to be called ["the Mac"](http://www.yelp.com.au/biz/the-macquarie-hotel-sydney) and I also heard somewhere it was called [the Scwartz](http://barzine.com.au/the-mac-surry-hills.html), but in any case, the rebranding has done them well. Their beers are not bad at all. 

*Edit: The Mac hotel/brewery is now Harpoon Harry's   apparently not as good anymore (see comments below this).*

If you're out at Manly, hit up [4 pines](http://4pinesbeer.com.au/). It's just across the road from the ferry. Beer is nice and food isn't bad either! You can get the ferry out there from Circular Quay (I think it's wharves 3 and 6 - there is a fast one and slower one). 

If you're more into Wine, check out [Wine Odyssey](http://www.wineodyssey.com.au/) in the Rocks. It's a bit touristy but the service is pretty nice. 

If you want to see stuff from high up, I have two suggestions. First is [Blu Bar at Shangri-La Hotel](http://www.shangri-la.com/sydney/shangrila/dining/bars-lounges/blu-bar-on-36/). Second is [O Bar](http://www.obardining.com.au/) located in Australia Square, which is poorly named because it's actually a cylindrical building near Wynyard. Keep in mind both these places are more expensive. Cocktails at Blu bar are around $20. Generally we just have one or two and enjoy the view. Or buy a bottle of wine and share it. 

If you're looking for something lower key, there are other places outside of the city. Within walking distance (via "the Domain" - a park) you can get to [Woolloomooloo Bay Hotel](http://www.woolloomooloobayhotel.com.au/). It has water views - good for a pub lunch and a beer. 

In Newtown there are a few hotels. I don't mind something simple, so [Coopers](http://coopershotel.com.au/) suits me and has a nice upstairs area. The [Bank Hotel](http://bankhotel.com.au/) used to be pretty popular but I haven't been there in ages so have no idea now. There is the [Marly Bar](http://marlboroughhotel.com.au/) which is a long standing Newtown Hotel. It may not the fanciest place ever but it's consistent. If you go here you can grab a bite to eat upstairs at [Miss Peaches](http://www.misspeaches.com.au/) which does Southern US soul food... though if you're from Canada you probably get better versions of it over there.

Hope that helps! I've tried all the bars I've mentioned so if you have any questions let us know. :)

 




 Rain itself isn't so bad. Rain + wind is not as fun.  




 I'd never even heard of a roast before this post. 




 Ah right, yeah I'm talking about city usage e.g. around uni. If I'm on rocks or snow then I've got a completely different set of criteria, and own a different set of clothes. 

The jacket I have is great for regular rainy weather, easy bushwalks, going out on boats (wind   sun protection), sitting on the beach/coastal walks in bad weather, walking around the city, etc. Nothing really intensive like climbing or going in the snow. It has no warmth protection other than being windproof, and to me is suitable for Sydney weather. 




 I've found Kathmandu okay, but really overpriced. There is no way I would pay full price for any of their stuff. The quality is just dependent on what you get. Those pocket-it rain jackets are cheap things. My favourite by far is the FILA jacket with the lining, but I got mine on sale for $50 - and a similar sort of jacket to mine is about $90 according to [the FILA site](http://www.fila.com.au/index.wsp/fila?page=ViewProduct StyleCode=ASJ10080 Cate=MENS grp=TOPS) but mine has pockets - I prefer it with the pockets. 




 Let it be water off a ducks back. You're doing things many people could never dream of. 




 I think it shouldn't necessarily have been "question" in that sentence. The examples given were more like statements e.g. "you'll change your mind". Maybe they should have said "It's not your place to make presumptions about me." Or "It's not your place to second guess me".  




 I caught the light rail after midnight on nys. It was packed though. Barely standing room.  




 Oh yeah I never noticed the start of a freeway sign. I feel silly now.  




 I've stayed at the Swissotel before. Parking is in a nearby secure parking garage and is $45 a day with in/out priviledges. You get one exit after checking out.  http://www.swissotel.com/hotels/sydney/explore-hotel/guest-services/ 

I've checked out a couple of others but they're all around the same price, often more.

Would he consider parking his car at the long-term parking at airport if he doesn't need it for the duration of his trip? Sounds like no from what you've said? 

Otherwise maybe a stayz place with a carspace would work. I stayed in one in Perth specifically for the car space.  

If you stay somewhere near a station, e.g. http://www.stayz.com.au/accommodation/nsw/sydney/mascot/79611 then he can walk to the station   jump on there to the city, which is a short train trip. I think it's about $15 extra per night to use the car space and you need to book it. 




 Ok, so this is the End Freeway sign I mean: http://www.ozroads.com.au/NSW/Freeways/GoreHillFreeway/Map/end%20freeway.JPG
http://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/images/roads/safety-rules/roadrules/motorway-start-stop-signs.jpg

I think it's a barrier but my SO thinks it's a bridge.

I always thought it was a barrier because it's the end of the freeway, but he was saying that the feet are on either side because it's a bridge, and those types of overpasses are over freeways. Plus there are no more bridges, so maybe there are intersections with traffic lights coming up. That makes sense too! So now I don't know what it is. What do you think? 




 




 I hate it when anybody throws a verbal jab via a conversation with someone else. If you have an issue with someone, discuss it with them like an adult.  




 Good luck! 

Yes I have a shorter pair and longer pair. I don't really recommend getting longer ones - they're not that practical - the short ones are good tho :) 




 Honestly if it's in my direct path, I just pick it up and put it in the bin myself. I don't really care about getting my hands dirty. If it's really gross I have a pack of wet ones in my bag. 

I was standing at a bus stop and there was a newspaper from the local grocers flapping around all over the pavement. It was driving me nuts because it was about to blow everywhere. I just picked all the pieces up and put it in the bin, while the other 10+ people just stood there and let me do it. Maybe I'm a crazy old woman now or something but argh. I have nothing else to do but wait for the bus.  




 I got a FILA rain jacket for $50 at some place in Newcastle - one with the meshy lining is good so it doesn't get all sticky. I also have a Kathmandu one that I got on sale with the meshy stuff.

Kathmandu have pocket-it ones too if you want something really lightweight you can carry around. You can view them [here](http://www.kathmandu.com.au/mens/jackets/rainwear.html#!p=2 offset=1948) - just search for pocket-it.

I reckon the meshy lining is worth it though - makes it much less sticky. 

You can also get them from Big W but with this weather they'll probably all be sold out in your size. Best time to buy a rain jacket is not when it's raining unfortunately. 

If you're going to be doing a lot of walking in the rain get some rain pants too that you can wear over your regular pants. [Example](http://www.kathmandu.com.au/mens/trousers/full-length/pocket-it-rain-trousers-v2-black-6.html)

Another place that is pretty good is Uniqlo. They're more budget end but they have nice stuff.
e.g. [Shorter jacket](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/product/men-light-pocketable-hooded-jacket-139257.html#53)
or you can get a [longer one](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/product/men-waterproof-pocketable-coat-139291.html#69)

For gumboots I reckon [Wellies](https://www.wellies.com.au/) is great - I've bought some through there before and they're pretty nice. 




 I think this is really important. Being able to know who you are on your own first means that you don't rely on another person for your life to be complete. Your life can be complete as an individual. I think it comes from the knowledge that you can enjoy life on your own - and I don't know if many people get to experience that, or if they are too worried about finding an SO to live in the moment. I have fond memories of some of the times I travelled alone and it has stuck with me. I'm not saying that I don't like being around people, or having people in my life, just that I know that my happiness is not dependent on the relationship, the relationship is just a beautiful addition.  




 :( I never could. Maybe you just have to learn to live with it. Accept it and move on and after a bit of time the sadness will be more distant.  




 Wounds heal but scars remain. 




 I've done some through Vistaprint. They were pretty good.  




 :( Maybe you need a break from the searching for a while? Focus on some stuff that you really want to do with your life?  




 I'm average but I sometimes just don't care. I've got too much going on in my head to give a crap about what I look like on the outside. 




 You have beautiful hair 




 My sister tells me not to buy her kids gifts. She said she doesn't want them to grow up expecting stuff. She always tells me that just me being there is enough. So glad I don't have family like the one who wrote the letter. 




 Find something they don't really give a toss about and don't want to do... like say, being a blood spatter expert or a mortician who specializes in embalming. When they say they have no interest in that, explain to them that it's just a phase and they will change their minds when they're older. Or... this works well for an embalmer... tell them they just haven't met the right person yet. If they don't get the picture throw in some visual imagery of draining blood and replacing them with embalming fluid to remove the rigomortis. Then explain how when people die they are sometimes purple and a good mortician should know how to apply makeup. If it's not setting in yet describe the smell of rotting flesh and the gases output by bacteria that takes over your body after you die.

Sometimes you just know what you don't want. 




 The only problem is that question just fuels them to explain more about how they can't sleep because it's uncomfortable. 

Best to just remove their feed from yours or unfriend them. They're annoying while pregnant with twins... it's only going to get worse. 




 My dad was the only person to give me a good response to saying I didn't want kids. 

He said... "It's up to you if you want to have kids or don't want to. There are pros and cons to both. If I didn't have kids I could have done other things that I didn't do because I had them. " 

He did add at the end "But if you do want them, it's best to do it before 35." But that's the doctor in him talking. 

Anyway, I don't know but that was one of the best conversations we've ever had. It just felt like a weight had been lifted from me. 




 Maybe he's just tired and that's how he sleeps. 




 I didn't know about this. Sounds pretty good. The data isn't unlimited, but it's heaps.

"This plan includes unlimited standard talk, text, MMS and voicemail plus 500MB of data within Australia at a cost of $2 a day." 




 I wouldn't rely on it. I'd probably just get a SIM. 




 ALDI https://www.aldimobile.com.au/ 

One prepaid plan has 3GB for 30 days for $30
https://www.aldimobile.com.au/plans/datapacks
I think it's 3G not 4G but still cheap, and on Telstra which has the best coverage.

When I was in the US I just got a data pack and used Skype to make calls.
 




 My boss asked me to let him know when we're planning to have kids. Umm... even if I was planning them, which I'm not, I'm not going to let you know!!

(On phone) "Hi boss. Just letting you know we're about to copulate. Any day now. "

Yeah uhh no. 




 I've had mixed results depending on who it is. My school counsellor wasn't very good and gave me some terrible advice.

I see a psychologist now who is really good, and understands most of what I need from the sessions. The first session should be kind of a getting to know you thing. You can talk about anything that is bothering you - no matter how minor it might seem. I don't know what it's like for everyone else but for me it is about gaining a better understanding of myself and as a result learning better coping skills. I have had periods where I felt I could do it alone but then I crumble over time, so I keep going back. When things are better I go less frequently, and when they're bad I go often.  




 What type of counselling is it? Are you going to a psychologist or something else? 




 Thanks! :)  




 I guess you just have to choose something and go for it. Is there anything you really want for your life? 




 I'm in my 30s from Australia. 




 I just finished paying off my debt last year. Yay! Except I'm old now. 




 I wish someone would tell this to people in Sydney where the median house price is above AUD$1m (over US$780k). :( 




 Well if you need to talk... I'm here. I have no experience with family separation but I can be a good listener. My parents separated when I was young too.

I also found this booklet about coping with going through a separation (including when you have kids). Maybe it will help you to think about a few key things. 
http://www.humanservices.gov.au/customer/publications/cs1144
 




 I am like you, my brain just won't stop. I have a lot of trouble sleeping, and it makes my depression even worse. Sometimes I keep myself busy only to have nightmares because all those repressed feelings are coming out when I sleep.

What makes you think you're a failure? 

I have found going through this process works for me a little. Maybe you can try it and see how you go? I usually like to write it out because it gets it out of my head and onto paper. 

1. Notice you're feeling uncomfortable emotions. 

2. Identify all the emotions you're feeling - angry, sad, frustrated, annoyed, etc. 

3. Once you've done that try to rationalise them - why do I feel this way? Did I do something or did someone else do something to make me feel like this? 

4. Figure out - is your feeling/reaction helpful? If No - then you need to let it go e.g. by forgiving yourself. If Yes - work out what action you can take and when. Then until you can take that action, leave it aside and don't think about it anymore, until the time you take the action.

 




 I see. I hope you can get through it. Another option could be to change schools. Is that something that may be possible for you? Maybe now you've lost weight people won't have that image of you. Can you talk to your parents about it and see if they have any ideas for how to deal with it?  




 Well I used to know someone in school who used to have good comebacks. So when someone would call him fat he'd yell at them and say "At least you can fix fat, you can't fix ugly!". Maybe you can make jokes about them back and see if they ease up. If it doesn't help, then maybe you could try talking to a school teacher or counsellor for advice on how to deal with it. They might be able to sit down and have a simple chat with you and your friends and talk about it between you and what is acceptable behaviour, because I can tell you that is not how a friend should be treating you. 




 There are a lot of people standing around outside business services like it is recess. No wonder the trains were always late.  




 First, congrats on losing 40 pounds. That's amazing! I am trying to lose a bit of weight too and it's so hard so I can appreciate the effort that must have gone into that. That is an incredible achievement right there! If you have a healthy BMI then that's even better. :) 

It sucks that people are picking on you. Please try not to let them bring you down. Either they are saying mean things unintentionally without realising how much it is hurting you or they have an ugly personality and are really trying to bring other people down to make themselves feel better. If you think people are doing it unintentionally, you can ask them not to, perhaps they don't realise what they're saying. If people are doing it intentionally then ignore them, and remind yourself of your achievements already, because it is no small feat to lose weight. It takes an incredible amount of self control and determination.  

Can I ask how old you are? Are you in highschool? People in highschool pretty much suck. I had one person come into my highschool and give a talk about how highschool matters so much and how you'll reflect on it being the best days of your life. I can tell you they were WRONG about my life. Sure, maybe for them it was the highlight, but for me there was so much more beyond school, and for me at least it was a lot better.  




 I think the first step is acknowledgement and acceptance of what's happened. Yes, it is utterly shit that this situation happened. It sucks that when you needed to and chose to confide in someone in confidence they broke your trust and your life got screwed over. You were just looking for a shoulder to lean on and instead you lost a future you had envisaged for yourself, and now you're going down what you feel like is a lesser path. Ok yeah, that sucks. I won't sugarcoat it because that's a pretty raw deal you got. But part of accepting it is realising that it's in the past, and the future doesn't have to be the same. You can change the future - you have that power! And it can be a different path and still good.

So the next step is to decide what you're going to do now. Ok, so you picked community college. What are you studying? Do you like it? Do you want to continue? If not then what other options are available to you? Do you see any of them as things you'd like to do? Sometimes I find it helpful to think about problems as if I was an outsider and it was a friend in the same situation as me - what advice might you give them? At this point maybe all the choices you want to be available to you aren't, but that's okay, if it's something you want then there should be other ways to get there.

You might not feel like doing all this, I get it, but you're in a bit of a slump and you are the only one who can climb out of it. Sure you can lean on others for support - maybe if you don't feel like you can trust the mental health system, instead try anonymous support phone lines or chat rooms for support. Start by setting yourself small goals to begin with and try to take each day at a time, focusing on making each day count. You might still have bumps in the road but each day you do something positive is a step in the right direction. 

Don't give up. You can still have a good life, it's just that now you're travelling a slightly different path than the one you previously had in mind...  




 :'( I'm sorry to hear that. I'm glad that you got through to talk to someone though, and that they were able to help. Hopefully now you have somewhere to call next time too. 




 Thanks! This is really interesting. Do you know how many public holidays each of these places gets a year? That's also paid work in Australia - Are public holidays paid to full-time staff in most other countries? 




 Did you get through to anyone?  




 I know this message is late but I am going to write it anyway, in the hope that you do read it. 

Please reach out to someone, anyone, and talk it through with someone, even reddit if that's all there is. I don't know what your situation is but I hope you can get through this and if you do I hope you read this and consider that strangers on the internet care enough to write a plea to you and beg for you to reconsider. You must be in a lot of pain, but know that you don't have to be alone.  




 Try not to be too hard on yourself. Interviews are not particularly good at judging someone's aptitude, so in terms of an entrance requirement they kind of suck. 

Is there something else you could consider studying? I've been rejected from a course I wanted to do and I did something else instead. It turned out to be a better choice for me, maybe there is something else for you?

If you are sure you want to do floristry and horticulture maybe you could try getting some experience in a florist, so when you apply you have some experience in it. Then if you were to apply in January next year they should look on that favourably and you will also have improved yourself. Usually there is more than one road that leads to the same destination. 

What do you think? 




 Can I ask what problem it is that you're trying to discuss? Perhaps it would help in finding a suitable person to talk to? If you don't feel comfortable saying so, then it's okay. 




 Oh man, I can't believe how hard it is for you to get through to someone. :( 

Perhaps you could try the suicide hotline again? It sounds like the person you spoke to wasn't very good, but there might be others that work there that are. 

Is it an option for you to go see a doctor? They might be able to refer you to a counsellor or something. If you are able to get through tonight then I suggest this. 

If you're really struggling to find someone to talk to perhaps a church minister would also be an option. Personally I'm not religious but if you just need someone to lend an ear perhaps it might help. Again it depends who you talk to, but they may be able to spare some time with you and really listen to you. Some churches offer counselling services that charge a small fee based on a sliding scale depending on income. 

Just trying to throw some options out there. I hope you can find someone.

Please don't give up though.    




 Which siuicide hotline did you call? Was it this one? http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/ 

You could try some of the numbers here, though I can't tell you which are any good - sorry: http://psychcentral.com/lib/telephone-hotlines-and-help-lines/000173  




 I should have mentioned that there is a grieving process, and you will go through it. I think it's important to know that no one way of grieving is the right way, and you will have your own way of dealing with it. The way I have gotten through it is to do my best to be a better person. She was studying to be a psychiatrist. She was beautiful and smart and caring. I can't replace her but I do try my best to be a better person. 

I also had a friend last year who passed away suddenly one weekend. He was 32 and he had an undiagnosed heart condition. He was so happy with his life and he was out celebrating the birthday of his beautiful girlfriend the night before. I had spoken to him on the friday and he was showing me all the arrangements he had made - he had gone to so much effort to make her happy. In stark contrast to my school friend he wanted so much to live. He had a beautiful life laid out for him and he only needed a chance to live it.

I took a few months off to figure out what it is that I want from life. I make more time for the people I care about, I make more time for myself, I won't let work take over my life again, I will do the things that I have always said I would do but got too busy to do before. I will try my best to help those in need. I also realised that I would never take my own life because I couldn't stand the suffering that it would cause.

To be honest there is nothing that can take the pain away from losing a dear friend. But over time you will find a way to cope, and if you can, you will find a way to make your life matter. I wish you the best of luck, and never feel like you are alone. If you ever need someone to talk to who knows what it's like... I'm here for you. 




 My best friend from high school committed suicide last August. The last time we talked she was moving cities and I said I would try to catch up with her and never did. I thought it was only 6 months but when I looked back at my facebook messages it was over a year and a half. 

I was really upset. We went through everything in highschool together, and to know that she felt so alone and felt like she had nowhere to go for help killed me inside. I was on holiday when I found out and I just couldn't stop thinking about it. I wasn't balling my eyes out or anything until the funeral. I didn't even take tissues because I didn't know how I was going to react but as soon as I saw her coffin, and pictured her lifeless body in there it just broke something in me. I bawled my eyes out. She didn't deserve this, and her family and friends didn't deserve it. I was mostly angry at myself for being too busy with work and not putting in the time to go see her.

I don't know what to say to console you, I suppose I just want to tell you that I know something like what you're going through. It still upsets me. She left a note but her family chose not to share it. I don't know how she did it and in some ways it doesn't matter - it's done. There is a pain inside me that will never go away, and I wish so much that I could go back in time and save her. I wish so much that she was still here.

 What country are you in? I only know Australian support numbers :( 




 A brain injury is no small thing, and thank goodness your mum cares about you enough to ensure you got the right diagnosis and treatment. I have had a series of sports injuries including a recent concussion, and it's nothing to mess about with. I lost my vision too for a short time and then fell asleep for a few hours straight after. Mine wasn't as serious as yours but it's been weeks now and I'm still feeling the effects of it. 

I'm so sorry to hear about your girlfriend. Maybe she still cares about you, and it sounds like she was hurt because to her it might have seemed like you were emotionally cheating. I can hear that's not true, because you still care for her, but she must be having a very hard time seeing that. Maybe when you feel up to it you can try talking to her and explaining this again to her - when it's less fresh. It might not be too late. However I can speak from experience that distance relationships are very difficult and trust is so important, so if trust can't be built, then it might be a very difficult relationship to maintain. 

You sound like you're still young, and yes, things haven't gone well for you. But you sound like you have the resilience to keep going and working on improving things. Perhaps the best thing is to focus on your recovery first and foremost. 

Also just a tip from someone who has been riddled with injuries - try not to binge eat too much junk food. I did that when I was injured and really depressed and it's really hard hard work to get rid of. Focus on your health - good eating habits will also help you sleep better and will aid your recovery.   




 :( You sound exhausted. Have you considered consulting a financial advisor who can help you with your finances? It sounds like you're really trying to make the situation better but perhaps you don't have all the tools you need to get out of it. Perhaps if you can't spare the time and/or money you can try asking on reddit for a free place to call to get assistance? I don't know the right sub for this, but maybe try /r/personalfinance . Sometimes it might just be a matter of getting an outsider to take a look and see what other options might be available to you. 

 




 Was there some criticism in particular that you had difficulty taking on? Was it constructive or was it just plain hurtful? Do you think it could be in your interpretation of their statement or do you think that's how the message was intended? 




 First question is - do you think you will like speech therapy? And what other options do you have? The best way to go about this is to think about all the options available and weigh up the pros and cons. Then you might have a clearer picture about whether you're making the best choice from a few available choices.

In terms of student debts, you have to think about if the investment is worth it? What else could you do with the time and money? If programming is an option you're considering, is that something you would enjoy doing? 

While education is an investment and I generally feel it is worthwhile, if you aren't improving your outcomes then you really need to think about what your options are. It sounds like you're clever enough to be in the position to have choices, which is good, but it sounds like it is agonising not knowing which path to choose.

Don't worry about what society expects, think about what you want from your life. Some people would be fine in carrying the student debt because they are passionate about what they want out of life and know that's what they want to do and the study will enable that. There is no right or wrong. It's really a personal choice, and so you need to try to think rationally about what it is that you personally want from your life.   




 Also can everyone please occasionally check that both headlights are working? I nearly drove straight into a one headlight car thinking it was a motorbike.  




 How did everything go for you? 




 I thought I was the only one concerned about the big knife. Is there some reason to carry a knife around there? Is there a birthday cake cutting or something?  




 It's not that I don't understand this and I accept it. I don't hate the guys who are looking for a date or anything like that. I was just opening up a perspective that perhaps a lot of engineers and IT guys may not have thought about.

Also I guess I'm saying that if you're willing to be a friend to someone without trying to get them to go on a date with you straight up, then you might have more luck. I ended up with a couple of guys that way (just to be clear, not at the same time!). 




 This is a great idea. They should sell them at the change room from bungee jumps in discreet vending machines. 




 If you're interested in buying an apartment request a Section 109 certificate. (http://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/ftw/Tenants_and_home_owners/Buying_property/Buying_into_a_strata_scheme.page )
Main thing to pay attention to is any financial issues or special by-laws.

You can have a small sense of community if you get involved in the executive committee which helps run the building - but I warn you - it is a lot of work. It's nice to be a part of running the building though an awful lot goes into it that you don't realise unless you're on an EC and it can suck the fun out of it. It's also frustrating living in a building with a lot of tenants moving in and out who don't give a crap about the building and leave their rubbish every time they move out. For me it has been an eye-opening experience.

Given the choice I'd choose a house every time. It's not that much fun hearing your neighbours have sex in the bedroom above you at 1am - loud enough to actually wake you from your sleep. It's also not fun when they decide to have a large party in a tiny apartment on a weeknight cause they're uni students and you have to work the next day. Also smoke drifting in from your pot smoking neighbours, or people who own dogs that bark constantly, or when the upstairs neighbours install floorboards so now you can hear everything they're doing... etc. etc. 

Honestly I try not to get too friendly with neighbours. We live too close together to be friends. I can hear all their conversations from my neighbouring unit. I hear when the ones upstairs pee in their toilet. I can hear the tv shows the neighbours on the other side watch. Ever heard that phrase good fences make good neighbours? Well we don't have fences. I say hello and if we bump into each other in the foyer then we might discuss the latest building news, but that's about it. 

On the plus side, it's cheaper.  




 You can wear non ads on your shirts too. Like inanimate objects like I dunno a tree, the moon, etc. Just to make it interesting... for decoration... like a Christmas tree. 




 ... a trip to the Maldives where I went scuba diving for the first time, saw whale sharks (I didn't even know about them before I went!), saw reef sharks, saw stingrays feeding out of a Maldivian man's hands, saw a whole bunch of cool fish I'd never seen before when we went snorkelling with a marine biologist, went stand up paddleboarding, went swimming, saw a giant sting ray swim casually below our villa, stayed in luxury and saw the other islands too, but in the end had the best time of my life. I also met an older couple there who were a lot like us but 50 years down the track with no kids and seemed totally happy and that was the best wedding gift anyone could have given me and my husband - to see it was possible first hand. And to see a bunch of beautiful coral atolls was amazing. I'd learnt about them in school and never imagined I'd actually get to go there!

Since then we've met a lot of happy couples without kids on our travels overseas and after that I have no doubt that whatever happens I will live an interesting rich life full of experiences whatever they may be.  




 What about brothers/sisters? 'cause if I ever did this to one of our pets, I could easily be expecting a bruising from my siblings. Not that I ever did this, because I love animals. I did a rubber band slingshot into my brother and he made a better one than mine and slingshotted me back, so I got a bruise for a week like a paintball spot. I never tried to slingshoot him again.  




 Thing is I think he's trying to be nice. And I do want a slightly lower workload because I don't want to work 18 hour days and weekends anymore. I want to be able to work more sane hours like other people in my company do. They just won't put those people on the out-there projects like I get because they have a family... argh. I guess I just didn't need it to be framed that way to me. 




 The other thing is I don't even want kids but my boss is telling me he wants to lower my workload you know... just in case... because I'm around that age. Wtf? I told him outright I had no plans to. I feel sidelined. (Btw I'm female) 

Kids are hurting my career and I don't even want to have any! 




 This is messed up. Why oh why? Whatever happened to leaving things to the imagination? One day those kids will see those photos on Facebook of their parents and them naked for the whole world to see. I think I would die inside from internal cringing.  




 It's a weird idea because from what I've seen and experienced is that men with kids go home much earlier than men without. I am more surprised by this statistic than by women with children earning less than cf women, because this just seems so counter intuitive to me. 




 What about people who post photos with their baby while they and their baby are naked and then they get their husband naked too so they can show me how bare they can get. I don't need to see that. Just like you don't need to see me naked on your Facebook feed. 




 This makes me feel as if the person who wrote this quote has never done anything worthwhile in their life.  




 This sounds weird but could it be that men want kids to keep their mothers happy? As a wife I used to get a lot of pressure (which of course was unseen by my husband) to have kids from my mother in law. I can see how that could affect some men.  




 I'm so sorry to hear this, and I don't know what to say. It hurts to feel like you were on the same track and then things suddenly changed, and you got hurt. Just know that just as you can have a fulfilling life without kids, you can also have a fulfilling life without him. And you're not just an incubator, you have so much more to offer. Don't forget that! Hugs.   




 I left a lot of friends behind because of this type of thing. I hope you do find friends who will better understand you. You're growing apart because of life changes. It sucks they can only see their perspective. I won't say the attitude will change but I do hope you find friends who don't diminish your life experiences because they somehow think theirs are more significant. 




 I don't understand why men would get promotions from having kids. Is it perception that men that have kids are more successful or something, leading to a promotion?  Like in the way that taller men get promoted/hired more readily?  




 Not sure... maybe it's having kids? Maybe you're already half way there so may as well see it through? Maybe you have more control over your life and circumstances by then and feel less inability to change the things you don't like? Maybe if you were going to do it you already would have? Maybe other life threatening illnesses just happen more.. suicide rate may be the same. 




 It's probably because he feels like he isn't good at helping him. I remember when my parents split my mum would talk about it with me and for a while I let her let it out but after a year it got a bit much for me because she was crying all the time and I couldn't help her. I asked her if she could talk to someone like a counselor or something because I could see I wasn't helping and it was also upsetting me a lot. I wasn't trying to be mean and I wanted to help but I was too close to be impartial. She did find someone to talk to and she gradually improved over a few months. Maybe he just didn't know how to help or didn't have the skills to.  




 Do you mean total power loss or just performance reduction?  




 Wow you actually have NBN! I thought it was a myth!  




 I have an idea for improving the show. I'd like to see commenters from /r/diy explaining how each of the renovators have screwed up. Or I could just go read that sub instead I guess... 




 You know how when you're in high school you have a certain group of friends, and you think you're pretty close, but then when you leave school it changes, and you may still talk to your high school friends but you make new friends, ones you have more in common with. Those friends understand you and what you're going through at that time, usually because circumstances have changed. Your high school friends might have a different vocation, and not understand you as much anymore. They're still nice people and all but you just don't connect like you used to. Then when you get a job you make a new set of friends, 'work friends', who understand how things are at work, and you share your experiences and lean on and trust each other for support.

I think even romantic relationships can be like that. There are people who you need at different points in your life. Some people think they will find 'the one' who they will spend the rest of their lives with and sometimes that is the case. But often people need different people at different stages of life, and that is okay. Also one person often can't fulfill all your needs. Sometimes you need friends to fill the gaps. 

I think the next steps for you are to first see if your discontent can be resolved, and if it can't then I'm sorry to say that you will need to work out a way to move forward without her. 

Starting with the first step though I think you should talk to her. Tell her how you feel and ask her how she feels about the situation.  Ask her for ideas and discuss ways things could be better. Consider making a plan together to improve things and then you are both aware of the steps forward.

If you really already resent her then I think that you need to stop thinking as if breaking up with her would be hurting her, because staying with her hurts both of you, and even though it's hard it is often the best thing to do in that situation. 
 




 You're probably better off just buying a new one. There's a Reece at Taren Point. See if they're open tomorrow and go get one. Then you just need an electrician to connect it. The pipes are the simple part. 

  
























 I don't know why but when I saw this happen I distinctly remember not caring either way. I think I am now apathetic to people's transport woes. 

But now I've had a chance to think about it, I suppose I think they're stupid trying to take on a bus - I mean what if the driver doesn't see them? Why is their time frame more important than people on the bus? 

On the other hand, why are bus drivers assholes sometimes and why do they go out of their way not to pick up passengers? Why are buses so damn unreliable and instead of just working to a schedule, why do 3 buses come at once? Why is it when I submitted complaint forms about the buses all coming at once they tell me that it's because of traffic, but how could they all arrive at once in traffic? Wouldn't they have to have still left the same time to be at the same point in the traffic to arrive at the exact same time? 

I don't even know where to direct my frustration anymore, I'm so frustrated with the whole bus system and all the passengers have gone crazy including me!!!  




 I thought this was from /r/gaming because it was too perfect! 




 I'm glad to hear you had a good time! :) 

I'm not too sure about weekdays as I don't often go out mid-week. I suppose if we were going out we'd go somewhere that was convenient (for a few after-work drinks), has food, or somewhere that was scenic/special (for a special occasion). 

For you I'd check out the scenic/special stuff. If it's nice weather try out Opera Bar. Palmer   Co is busy most days it's open, so you could definitely try that out - it's down a little alley in a basement near the Establishment Hotel so you'll need to search it out. There is also [Tank Stream Bar](http://merivale.com.au/tankstreambar) nearby that which has a small bar feel in a back alley, which I like. Tank Stream Bar is probably nothing too special but I like it. 

There is another place which is pretty popular for food (southern American feel) but damn it's hard to find unless you have a guide taking you there. It sits on the top of an office building, so when you enter it's like you're going into some offices. It's called [The Rook](http://therook.com.au/).

The bankers I have worked with are often pretty good drinkers, so anywhere around Martin Place. We sometimes go to [Eden Bar](http://edenbarandrestaurant.com.au/) but I imagine that'll get empty pretty quickly as people wind up their after works drinks.

Also Newtown will have some students there mid-week because they don't have to wake up in the morning ;) So check out some of the places I've mentioned there.

I have to head out now but I'll have a think about some more locations.

For the football if you're going to the game then the only places where those fans will be is near Parramatta. There are a few food places in Church Street in Parramatta (depending on which team you're going for), but to be honest I never go out there so I may not be the best person to ask. I also think you'll find most football fans will head home straight after the game, and only a small handful will stay out.  




 I am the same... I think it's good to have a diverse set of skills. My hope is that it means you can adapt quicker to changes in your industry and you get to be continually learning and improving. My problem early on was getting a job in some of the roles which needed dedicated experience in one thing. But I've personally found more job satisfaction in learning new and different things all the time, and if anything I am more in demand now than I would have been otherwise, due to my wide range of experience.

Good luck with your decision! Go with your gut. I've found mine to be leading me in the right direction most of the time. :) 




 I actually asked for a pay increase in the interview once before I'd even gotten the job. I'm not sure if I'd ever do it again but sometimes I wonder if it helped being confident enough to ask.

I said "I wanted to ask if you have room to move on the salary?" 

I got the job and a higher salary. It helps that it actually was very low... but it was risky! I didn't have another option if I didn't get that job... but I had a pretty good vibe from the interviewer.  




 I've noticed some companies I've applied for can have a lot of job openings. It makes me wonder if there is a high turnover or if they are rapidly expanding for a particular piece of work. 

The former bothers me because it might not be a good place to work if turnover is high. 

The latter concerns me but only if they are hiring for a short term role and the position is a permanent full time role... because I'll wonder if they can keep me on once the project finishes. It's not a deal breaker as I might be OK with another job after the project is over but I'd prefer to go in with eyes open than not to know. Also if a new project has just started and they're rushing to hire and/or trouble getting enough qualified staff, that tells me I might be in for some long hours. Again I might be OK with that, but I have never met an interviewer who has been up front about working until 11pm every night and on weekends, so I try to suss it out. Better to go in with eyes open!

Also I find questions about how I'd fit into the organization useful. It gets them to visualize me there for starters. Second it gives me an idea of the career development opportunities and advancement options.

I also try to get them to describe their culture. This tells me about the type of people who work there. And who my colleagues are is one of the most important factors as to whether I will enjoy my job.  




 Just to clarify I'm not saying it's not possible to get opportunities and build skills in stable jobs... it was that way with mine though. It was difficult to be "given a chance" as the culture was a very risk averse old school government culture. I went as far as I could through sheer determination and then realized I'd reached their limit of what they could offer me for my career development.  




 Not sure if this will make you feel better but I left a very stable reasonably well paid job for something less stable. I did it to get more opportunities and experience. I don't regret it at all. Having the ability and the skills has provided me with more "stability" by being in demand by the market than any "safe" job would have. 

I have friends that are in those safe jobs with few options to move to another company as their skills and experiences are fewer than peers who took the chance and built their skills faster. For me it meant working harder but I think in the long run it has paid off. 




 This is pretty accurate.

There is more variation in Sydney than in say for example Cairns where they just have wet and dry. I prefer it though because in Sydney in summer when you get a really hot day usually it's rare to have a lot in a row. They will often be followed by thunderstorms or sometimes continue but rarely for more than say 5 days.

The other thing is that in Sydney 'rainy' is affected heavily by the ENSO cycle. So if it's an El Nino then little rain and of there's a La Nina then lots of rain. When it's not clearly one of either... you can get anything.  




 The basics of how their own body works. I know lots of people know this but lots don't. 

A basic understanding of the immune system. For example knowing how antibiotics and vaccines work. 

Also, knowing about personal hygiene and how simple hand washing, not spitting, etc. can prevent the spread of diseases and germs.

Edit: elaborated. 




 Oh wow. I was told if they sting you around the neck it's possible to suffocate... is that true? Lucky you made it! 




 I drive past [King's Costumes](http://www.kingscostumes.com.au/) sometimes - looks alright. 




 Ferry to Manly   walk around the beach there. There is a [market there on the weekend](http://www.manlymarketplace.com.au/).

If it's raining, the [Powerhouse museum](http://maas.museum/powerhouse-museum/). It's being relocated at some point out of the city so see it while you can.

Also some others have mentioned the art galleries if it's raining, but I also like the [Australian Museum](http://australianmuseum.net.au/).

If you want to see Australian animals and don't want to leave the city try [Wildlife Sydney](http://www.wildlifesydney.com.au/) next to the [Sydney Aquarium](http://www.sydneyaquarium.com.au/) in Darling Harbour.
 




 Rhodes Phoenix gets packed. Make sure you get there by 11am otherwise there is usually quite a long wait :( 




 Aw yeah, I'd be flattered if someone thought I was their best friend! 




 I think she'd just appreciate the effort. :) I'm not much of a cook either but my mum likes it anyway... at least she says she does.  




 What about organizing something at your house with your family? Everyone make a special dish and bring it along. Dress up in some nice clothes, and get her to as well so she feels special and treat her to a massage or hairdo while you set it all up with a pretty table cloth and a bunch of flowers on the table. Be sure to make some nice desserts.  




 Sorry to hear about your cat :( My cat died years ago but I still miss her sooo much. There will never be another cat like her, but I am glad I got to have her in my life.  




 Didnt she swim away from the nearest land mass? The pic shows it. Maybe the currents carried her... Some of the currents out there are really strong. Either way I think she was incredibly lucky. 




 If you are going to take a pomeranian on a boat, you can get it a life jacket to counter the weight of the hair! It probably saved the life of [this fuzzball](http://www.globalanimal.org/2012/06/08/dog-overboard-canine-safety-on-boats/) 




 I would say this is part of the reason why maths is hard but not the full answer.

It's true, I wasn't that interested in maths in high school or uni because it wasn't applied. For the most part it was pretty dry. I only really liked Matrix Applications because I already understood why it was useful for me, but other subjects like Differential Calculus I had a really hard time relating to. It wasn't until I was trying to solve a few different problems a few years later that I gained an interest. 

One reason I say that I don't think lack of an interesting problem is the whole answer, is that I think the foundations are important (like someone said in another post). For example, I was trying to figure out how far galaxies are from the Earth. This is a terribly complex problem because things in space move around, and if you also imagine the things we are seeing are light years away, they are also an image from the past. Anyway it involves some complex mathematics and physics, which was quite interesting. However it was still hard for me because I don't have a physics background to understand some of the concepts that the math for this problem was built on, and so the learning curve was huge for me.

I also think there is a level of patience required. If you don't get past that initial learning curve (which may be unpleasant), then you never get to feel the sense of achievement having conquered it, and the next time you face a difficult problem, you might not be so keen to persevere, and especially if this has happened a few times, you probably have lost confidence in your ability to do it. Hence the 'hard' comes from lack of motivation... the task is more arduous now that you don't want to do it. 




 My celebrant would non-legally marry you. She told me it just wouldn't be "official" without the paperwork - so the date would be different - no big deal really. You can have the ceremony but the paperwork would come later. It shouldn't be a problem. Try talking to a celebrant about it. They should know.  




 I like the Royal Botanical Gardens [eg1](https://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/image/0013/102316/Image-2-EL-600.jpg), [eg2](https://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/image/0010/102304/Photo-Gallery-4-RG-600.jpg), [eg3](https://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/image/0007/112768/Herb_Gdn_Pavilion_05.jpg), [eg4](https://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/image/0019/112771/Herb_Gdn_Pavilion_21.jpg), tho there are permits specifically for weddings and professional photography. If you don't have a permit you may get kicked out. 

If you look at the wedding pack guides on this page you will see the pricing down on about the 3rd page.

For under 10 people you can book a lawn for $275 on weekdays and $330 on weekends (before June 2014, so prices have probably changed - but will be around that price). 

You also need to apply to take photographs in the QVB. You need to make a donation. I can't remember the fee exactly. I don't think it was much - maybe $50 or something like that. Anyway you can apply [here](https://www.qvb.com.au/about-qvb/wedding-photography) and there is a number on that page too you can call to discuss with them.


Another place which is nice is the [Chinese Gardens](http://www.easyweddings.com.au/locations/chinese-garden-of-friendship/) in Darling Harbour, but there is a lot of construction happening over that way at the moment :(

You could also do a wedding over near Manly way (north side of the harbour). There are council fees for beach weddings. There's a list of places [here](http://www.manly.nsw.gov.au/community-services/weddings/) and the fees are listed at the bottom of the page.  




 Celebrants aren't too hard to find if you're not picky. Easiest way to meet some is to go to a [Wedding Expo](http://www.easyweddings.com.au/expos/#/new-south-wales), but if you don't have time to do that you can just search online or try going through the ones on [EasyWeddings](http://www.easyweddings.com.au/MarriageCelebrant/Sydney/) or on the [Marriage Celebrants of Australia Website](http://www.marriagecelebrants.org.au/). 

Photographers vary in price and quality. Be careful of their offerings - there are a lot of dodgy photographers out there. We used [Xtraordinary](http://www.xtraordinarysydney.com.au/) and they were great - honest and up-front with their pricing - no dodgy stuff. Not top of the line artsy style photos but good wedding photos that I love and will be able to keep forever. 




 We got married in 2013 and our celebrant cost $598. 




 This is either some weird kind of problem solving, or he has a strange fetish.  




 The price guide was $1m. The RP data report valued the house at mid $900s.

I should really expect this by now, but sometimes we look at similar houses in the same suburb or street even and the price guide is actually quite close (within 10%), but this time we just got outbid. 




 That sounds great! Maybe you could PM me some contact info - I would love to see how much it's valued at. We have some interesting things in there! I never get to show them to anyone because I don't think many people are that interested, so it would be fun to show someone else. :) 

I am kind of interested in finding coins in the 'Southern Sky' series at the moment - they're colourful domed coins. I think the only coin available through the RA Mint now is the 2014 Orion coin, but there were two previous coins I would love to get my hands on - one is Pavo (2013) which I have found for $200 and the other one is the Southern Cross. Got any ideas where I could source it for a decent price? I've seen it online for $800, but I question whether I am that avid a collector... :/
 




 Oh! I'm going to check that out! Thanks! 




 Ohhh, I have a big coin collection, but I don't know if it's worth that much. What coins do you think are worth collecting? I know a lot of them are produced in 10,000 batches, but you can get some gold ones that are only 1,500 batch size. Do they increase in value more? Are there are lot of people who collect and trade coins? I only really collect them, I don't trade them. I just like looking at them. My parents started the collection so we have a lot of old pre-decimal coins, and I think we even have some paper value documents - though I only heard about those from my mum the other day and have yet to check them out.  




 Sure! That's a great idea! I would call my frog "coffee" and confuse everyone by explaining how I found coffee in the creek. 

Cups are very versatile vessels though! You can use them for all sorts of things... storing your spare water, as a coin holder, for collecting hail in a hailstorm, in case of motion sickness, for holding a candle, for protecting your hands from sparklers, to listen to conversations on the other side of walls, for keeping spare cup sized cupcakes, for entertaining children by using it as a nose, etc. etc.  




 They own their debt.  




 Yeah! He was honest!  




 Yeah this real estate agent saved me some money. The property has been taken down now and the auction cancelled. So I'm actually pretty thankful. He could have led me on to hedge his bets and I would have wasted my time and money getting it checked out only to find out very soon after that I never had a chance.

The people I really dislike are auctioneers. I saw one son trying to buy a place for his mum in Annandale and he'd hit his limit and she was trying to convince him to keep going. He said he couldn't to his mum several times, but the auctioneer wouldn't leave him   his mum alone, trying to convince them to up their bid. The auctioneer was saying things like "You'll have to face your mum later!" and trying to convince the mum to convince her son, saying it's a "once in a lifetime opportunity" etc. etc.  The poor guy had to yell out "No mum! I don't have that much money!" in front of a huge audience of about 100 people. It was a small townhouse/unit that went for over $1.2m. 

I know it's their job and all but their tactics suck. 




 In the inner city, we have generally found it to be between 30% over the price guide. I'm talking about a year ago when $1m houses were going for $1.3m - a bit more than $50-100K, we were budgeting for at least $200K over the price guide.

However, in the Sydney suburbs it can vary greatly. Sometimes they go for right near the price guide, so it's a bit hit and miss, and depends on who is interested. I've found them generally go for 0-20% over the price guide.  




 There are some agents who arrange the building   pest inspection and you only pay the $40 or whatever it was if you end up being a registered bidder at the auction. I like that approach, though it is subject to abuse. 




 You know how some shirts have that handkerchief pocket at the front? Well if you get a little plastic cup then you can put it in your pocket and carry it around wherever you go! It's the best invention ever, amiright? :D 




 How about this one which has "Australian Citizenship" written on it
http://www.perthmint.com.au/catalogue/2014-australian-citizenship-1-dollar-coin-in-card.aspx
It's more affordable too :) 




 Actually one birthday I did something like this for my husband. I bought a range of between 12 and 24 craft beers (can't remember the exact number) from NSW. Maybe OP could do a selection of one or two from each state?  




 XXXX isn't that bad! It may not be a 1664 but it's on tap and it goes down nicely in the hot rainy weather.  




 Haha I love this. I am right there... almost at "reject your belief in property as a concept". 

We were looking to bid on a property at auction this coming weekend - not that close to the CBD but that's what we can afford. The price guide was within our budget. So I rang the agent. Apparently someone has put in a pre-auction offer for $200,000 more than the guide, when the price guide was already 10% higher than similar properties in the area sold this month. A very similar property **just sold** for below the guided price.

He told me not to waste my money on the pest inspection unless I could put in a bid higher than that. At least I didn't waste my money, but dammit! It's soul crushing. 




 There are a list of fees for NSW Ambulances [here](http://www.ambulance.nsw.gov.au/Accounts--Fees/Frequently-Asked-Questions.html).

 Is that available for NSW?  




 I don't know but while I was looking it up I learnt that otters can hold their breath for 8 minutes and hippos can't actually swim or float due to their density. 




 A cup!

I know this question wasn't for me but I had to. Sorry. I'll go back to sleep now.  




 Haha. 

I was working on a big data project... or trying... and I was generating a base file that was 3GB and it took 12 hours from home to upload. If I went to the office it took 20 mins. Downloading it on the other end in SF took 8 minutes. I had to generate this file and upload it a couple of times during development. I feel like I am living in Internet poverty having had to drive to the office in the early hours of the morning to upload a file.  




 Yeah that makes sense. Plus parkland to make it a nice place to live. I don't think Green Square has much parkland at all. 




 Leichhardt used to be renowned for their slow development approvals. Then the NSW government stepped in and took approval rights away from them and [approved this]( http://m.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/inner-west/controversial-leichhardt-development-given-green-light-despite-community-outcry/story-fngr8h4f-1226847080770). 

I agree with keeping some heritage buildings though. Would you really want to just rip it all up? There are cases when they've done this in the UK and it has culturally ruined areas that were vibrant and turned them into places where people don't want to live.  




 Flatulence is pretty important! If you couldn't let it out you'd get an almighty belly ache, and could possibly explode! (I don't really know this but it sounds plausible right? ) 




 Well they redevelop what they can. What about the old children's hospital in Camperdown where [Trio](http://www.triosydney.com.au/trio/default.asp?cID=2) is and the current developments at [Harold Park]( http://haroldparkbymirvac.com/)? Sydney Uni did a big [student accommodation development]( http://www.sydneyuv.com.au/) near Newtown about 10 years ago too. And around a lot of the inner west there have been factories redeveloped into units, tho not high rises. [Central Park]( http://www.centralparksydney.com/) across from UTS is a new one too and I think there are still buildings going up. I don't know if you remember but Broadway used to be mostly squatters living in falling down terrace shops and that's all been redone to high rises - don't know the building names. I know it's not really inner west but Pyrmont has the highest density population in Sydney.

I don't think the city areas aren't taking whatever they can hold. The one place I do think is taking more than its fair share of high rise buildings is probably Mascot and Green Square. I mean... have you seen it lately? It's jam packed with residential high rises now. If you went there ten years ago and back now you wouldn't recognize it. 




 The fried tofu there is really yummy, and I'm not even a vegetarian and would never think of tofu as something yummy. 




 I like this place too. Yum :) 




 Thanks! I didn't know about the phasing out and eligibility.  




 That makes sense. I have found public hospitals to be quite good also, so not bagging them at all. 

My experience was slightly different because my scans were considered to be 'probably' not urgent, so I rolled the dice. I had short term vision loss, so I was told I should get an MRI of my brain. I had a choice to go private and have the appointment in approx. 3 weeks or go to the public system and have the appointment in approx. 2 months. The doctor said it's unlikely it's serious, but we needed to do the scan in case it was a tumour, so I decided to wait. Total cost for me was $0 too. Turned out pretty good - and my brain is fine (for now!). Had it been some kind of brain tumour though, I may have regretted my decision. 

I was also told by the GP who referred me to the Neurologist, that the medicare cover for the brain MRI would have been lower from the GP compared to if the neurologist referred me, even after paying the neurologist appointment fee. 

[Reading this](http://www.nps.org.au/medical-tests/medical-imaging/for-individuals/types-of-imaging/mri-magnetic-resonance-imaging/for-individuals/costs-and-reimbursements) - it sounds like if I went to the private hospital I would have had to pay the full amount myself. And there is some other option I didn't know about - going to a public hospital as a private patient - which I've never done.  




 Ah I checked and you're right. It doesn't cover all specialists. I was thinking of the time I went to the podiatrist, and some of it was paid for with my extras cover. 

I remember that I later went to the foot surgeon though, and had to fork out the whole $180 with no rebate. 

I'll fix it! Thanks. 




 My personal experience is that this has been the case when going to specialists under my health insurer. 

Edit: Yep, made a mistake. Fixed in original post. 




 Ah I didn't know that! I should get my dental work done then! 




 Good luck! Don't worry - tech interviews suck for everyone! 




 I love doing this. I don't mind a pre-packed box of roast beef and potatoes for $4 or whatever it is! 




 Aw thanks! :) So much reddit love. 




 Apparently some of the City Supermarket stores have Canadian   American sweets - [this review](http://www.yelp.com.au/biz/city-supermarket-sydney?hrid=1jHrKkjPztckhlR5rTzFrg) mentions Canada Dry.


You can also get it online from USAFoods (in Melbourne).
 




 There's a few aspects to this. But let me break it down into a few parts. I'll talk about hospital cover first.


**Tax - Medicare Levy Surcharge** (relates to hospital cover)

If you earn over a certain income ($88K in FY2013-2014) and you don't have private health insurance (hospital cover), you need to pay the Medicare Levy Surcharge - this can be between 1-1.5% of your income. For me this would actually work out to be more than paying for private health insurance (hospital cover only). See the [ATO Website](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Medicare-levy/Medicare-levy-surcharge/). Or see [this](http://www.privatehealth.gov.au/healthinsurance/incentivessurcharges/mls.htm) - also a good page on the medicare levy.


**Lifetime Health Cover Loading** (relates to hospital cover)

If you don't get private health insurance before you turn 30, and you want to get it at a later stage, then you'll pay a surcharge for your insurance (it starts at 2% and is added to each year you don't get it). This can be up to 70% more than what other people pay depending on how long you leave it for. There's some good information [here](http://www.privatehealth.gov.au/healthinsurance/incentivessurcharges/lifetimehealthcover.htm) about it. 


**Value** (in regards to hospital cover)

In terms of hospital cover, what's included depends on the insurer - you should look at each of the offerings. They each offer different brackets - you can get basic, medium, pregnancy, etc. cover depending on the insurance company.

The main benefit is the reduced waiting periods and some of the extra benefits that you can get while being in hospital such as a private room and being able to choose your own doctor.

If I had a baby for example, I might want a private room (in public hospitals they usually put you in a room with other women   their babies who've just given birth - my sister was in a room with 4 women and it was noisy so hard to sleep). I'm a light sleeper so this would be important to me. I might also want a particular doctor to be present during the birth. In public hospitals they often make heavy use of midwives. That is okay for a non complicated birth but if you run into trouble, you might want your own gynecologist there who has been treating you for the duration of your pregnancy. 

Generally I treat hospital insurance as useful for a "just in case" scenario. For example let's say you injure your knee, and you need a replacement knee. In a public hospital you might have to serve a waiting period and you may not get a choice of which doctor performs the surgery. Another example is if you accidentally got pregnant. There is a waiting period for pregnancies meaning that you can't take out private health insurance *after* you get pregnant - well I mean you can, but you have to serve a waiting period until you can claim on it. It's like having a car crash and trying to get insurance after the car crash to cover it - generally not possible. So if you don't have it prior you would probably have to go through the public hospital system.


**Extras**

Edit: I made some mistakes here. I've corrected it. Sorry for the confusion!

~~Extras cover includes things like regular visits to specialists. The operation the specialist performs might be covered under private *hospital* health insurance but generally I've found visits to the specialist are not unless you have extras cover - and then there is a gap. So if you pay $100 for a service, maybe $60 is paid to you from the private health insurer, so you have to foot the remaining $40 yourself.~~

Extras cover includes things like regular visits to the dentist, optometrist, physio, chiro, etc. One example of something you might use in your 25-30 year range might be [wisdom teeth removal](http://www.phio.org.au/facts-and-advice/dental-and-oral-surgery.aspx). I had mine removed in the chair so I just paid at the counter and got a percentage of that back from my health insurer using my extras cover. There are limits as to what you can claim, so for example on a service that is $100 you would maybe get $60 back from your extras cover, and then pay the $40 yourself. This is the 'gap' payment. You can often do this up to another limit, say $500 in a single year for dental. However if you get your wisdom teeth removed under a general anaesthetic then you may be covered under your private hospital cover (e.g. see under 'Major Dental' on the [nib page](http://www.nib.com.au/health-insurance/compare-hospital)). 

If you are likely to use physiotherapists, remedial massage, general dental, optical etc. then it might be worth it for you. You have to do the sums for your situation. 

However I had extras cover for quite a few years and I didn't find extras cover to be worth it. It has ended up costing me more for the premium than what I claim on it. There is a gap with most ~~specialists~~ covered services - so I'd rather just pay the full cost myself. Maybe later in life when I need to go to ~~specialists~~ these service providers more I will get it again, but right now I don't benefit from it. 

Another example why I think it's not worth it right now is I recently got some dental work done. A small percentage of the cost of fillings was covered. But I had to get in-lays which are similar to crowns. They are very expensive. In some way they are cosmetic but my filling was falling out due to the lack of original tooth structure so it was the best option for me. This was not covered by my extras cover from my health insurer and I paid thousands of dollars for it out of my own pocket. This is really what convinced me that extras cover wasn't worth it.


**Medical Expenses Tax Rebates**

This is not an reason for/against private health insurance. Just a tax-time tip if you have a few large health bills.

If you do end up spending a significant amount on medical expenses then you might be able to claim tax offsets - i.e. pay less tax (provided you keep the receipts). 
See [here](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Income-and-deductions/Offsets-you-can-claim/Medical-expenses/).
If you earn under $88K then you can claim 20% of expenses where they are over $2,162.
If you earn over $88K then you can claim 10% of expenses where they are over $5,100.

The types of medical expenses covered are listed out [here](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Tax-Return/2013/Supplementary-tax-return/Tax-offset-questions-T4-T11/T6---Total-net-medical-expenses/). 

Medical expenses include payments: 

* to dentists, orthodontists or registered dental mechanics

* to opticians or optometrists, including for the cost of prescription spectacles or contact lenses

* to a carer who looks after a person who is blind or permanently confined to a bed or wheelchair

* for therapeutic treatment under the direction of a doctor

* for medical aids prescribed by a doctor

* for artificial limbs or eyes and hearing aids

* for maintaining a properly trained dog for guiding or assisting people with a disability (but not for social therapy)

* for laser eye surgery, and

* for treatment under an in-vitro fertilisation program.

*See comments below - this is being phased out.*



Edit: I also know it is possible to get a Chronic Disease Management Plan if you are seriously unwell, and there are also Mental Health Care plans for psychiatric care. This enables related services to be covered (to a limit) under medicare.  




 No probs! I hope you have a great time here. :) 




 I've heard this same thing too. To me they smell like talcum powder.  




 I know people that do this and aren't even a little embarassed about it. Like when people bring their babies into the office and the girl I'm talking about runs over and wants to sniff it. 

She says the baby smell makes you feel happy. I held the baby, the smell does nothing for me. Maybe I don't have the baby smell receptors.  




 Who the hell tricks someone into having kids?!?!?! Do they even care about their partner and what their life goals are? Clearly if the husband wanted kids, then a conversation would have happened and an agreement occurred, but if she had to go about it this way then it sounds like he didn't want them at all. :/ 




 I love blue heelers :) She's a lucky dog to have a caring owner like you. 




 I used to practice my conversational (small talk) skills with taxi drivers. I only live a short distance from my work so I'd try to work out what would be most likely to make them happy by the end of the trip. Taxi driving can be such a lonely job. 

For different people different topics worked. I usually tried to talk to them about what they do outside of taxi driving. Asking lots of questions, and asking how they got into it. etc. I couldn't relate well with everyone but it was great practice at small talk. 

I got to a point where I've gotten free taxi rides (they just chose not to charge me even after I insisted paying!) and a couple of times when I got out of the cab they thanked me for talking. 

At first I wasn't good at it but I got better over time. You can do this with anyone you talk to each day. Think of people who wouldn't mind having a conversation. Even newsagents don't mind if it's not a busy time of day. It's easy with taxis because they are trapped in the car with me ... muahahaha.  :)


As for being a good friend, well a friendship is a mutually beneficial thing. You give a little, they give a little and it's a mutual care for each other that makes it work. It doesn't always have to be balanced, but the knowledge that it's not a one sided affair matters. And being able to make time for them is important too. There's no point in having 100 friends who you can see each of one week in the year (which is the way it is when you are working). Having a couple of friends who you can invest time into being around and caring about is more fulfilling. You need to remember things about them that matter to them. For example, remember their birthday if that's important to them, or remember they told you about a vacation they were taking. You can ask about it, and be interested in their answer. An open and caring ear is often more valuable to people than many people realise. 




 Good on you for taking the time to improve yourself! There are so many things outside of work/study that can make your life better, and it's great that you have been able to spend the time working on it. 

I also need to learn to cook more food. I'm renovating the kitchen at the moment so when I get a new stove (my current stove is really crap - from the 60's), I am going to get a pressure cooker and try to prepare a few meals in advance so I'm not cooking every night like I am now.  




 Thanks. I really appreciate the encouragement. It means a lot to me. It was a huge decision to take the time off - one I wasn't sure about at first - but now nearing the end, I don't regret it one iota. :)  




 Thanks. I really appreciate your comment. It took me a while to give myself permission to take leave. At first I felt so guilty about taking unpaid leave, but I knew I needed the break. Quite a lot of people were supportive but a few others were quite critical of my decision.  

I think it's all too easy to focus a lot on getting good results from our activities at work, but a lot of the personal improvements in our skills and in our own lives come from investments into other activities outside of work. If your work takes over that other part of your life then it's only fair the other part of your life should get to take over for a while too. :) 




 I use it only as an online resume really.  




 Sure, send it through.  




 I never understood bagels until I recently had some really nice ones over in the states. They are so dense and much more moist than bread rolls. I have a craving for them now thinking about it.

If you're not interested in going and buying them I was reading about how to make them yourself. It is apparently not that difficult... if you like cooking and have the time and patience that is. I would probably try to buy them first too. :)  




 Well it was rude - the cousin probably should have written "of course you don't have to give a gift, and none is expected, but if you do want to there is a list available... blah". They clearly have a lack of manners, and at 16 they are probably still learning what is socially acceptable. But you're right, the response was a bit of an over the top reaction as well.

That said, I understand the response in a way because I know how often it can be hard as an outsider where you are able to have very little influence on the person compared to their immediate relatives who provide them with all the wrong role models and allow or even encourage bad habits and choices. You can grow frustrated with them and maybe even reduce your emotional investment. It would be frustrating if you'd tried to help and provide non-financial assistance and that fell on deaf ears and led to the situation, but now since they are pregnant at 16 they suddenly want your help (via your wallet). 

 




 I've heard colleagues at work say similar things - "Having a daughter/son changed my priorities in life". Basically they're telling me they don't give as much of a crap about work anymore because there's more important things (i.e. their child) in their life now. I mean that's great, and I agree that you should care about your kid, but like do you really want to be telling everyone at work that now work doesn't matter to you as much? To me it is still a pretty big part of my life, seeing as I work a minimum of 40 hours a week. So I feel almost like that statement is unintentionally diminishing my values.  




 I am actually doing exactly that right now. 

The first 2 weeks I spent recovering from the stress of my job   four major life events. At my job I was working in a high-stress role and the hours were generally 7 days a week, 12-18 hour days for about 4 months. So I was constantly stressed. Four people close to me in life passed away within the space of a couple of months. I got high blood pressure and I also ended up very very sick with a high fever for about 5 days. But... after two weeks into my leave my blood pressure dropped to high but within normal blood pressure range (still too high for my age though).

The next 6 weeks I spent travelling with my husband. It had always been my dream to go snowboarding in Canada - for about 16 years. One of the people who passed away was a close friend of mine at work - he was very young and healthy - so it was very unexpected. I decided I needed to do the things I had always wanted to do, and refused to put it off anymore. So we did it. It's something my husband wanted to do too so that was perfect. After I got back my blood pressure was within normal range (and healthy again yay!).

I've been back 2 months, and I have spent a lot of that time planning out the next steps. When I was working the long hours I never had a moment to myself to really think about what I wanted and to plan it out, I was just in survival mode only. I put everything else but work on hold, which meant everything else suffered. So now having spent some time processing everything, I have a plan. It took a lot of self reflection and investigation into opportunities but I have finally arrived. Before I was taking one day at a time and was following whatever path I was on, rather than deciding my own goals. Now I have a few goals in mind that I want to achieve. Some of those include technical certifications, looking at other job opportunities, buying a house, possibly considering moving overseas to work if the house thing falls through, prioritising my relationship and my health, learning about different investment options, deciding on our future. A lot of those I have started, but this is just the beggining, and it's something I plan to continue doing when I return to work.

I have one more month before going back to work. It's been an expensive exercise in taking the leave and travelling, but to me it has definitely been worthwhile and I consider it a personal investment. Now that I have goals I can take actions to help achieve them. I'm not too fussed if things don't turn out as planned, but without goals I feel as though it is too easy to stagnate and not improve your situation.   




 I have had problems with my nerves before presentations. I just build up a crazy amount of nervous energy. The same thing used to happen to me right before interviews for jobs I cared a lot about.

So things have improved drastically over the years.

A few years ago I used to get so nervous I would physically shake. So it took me a while but I worked out something to help me overcome it. One day before an interview I was so nervous that I felt like I needed to run, so I did about 5-10 minutes of intervals (sprinting). I know it's a bit unconventional but it worked for me. I think nerves are an outward expression of a fight or flight response, so if you can exert some of the nervous energy out of your body, then it could help. I felt like sprinting increased my heart rate, so then my heart could calm down and it had flow on effects over my body and mind. When I went to the interview, I didn't shake and I could control my body which made me feel more confident. I haven't heard of anyone else doing this but for me it works absolutely brilliantly. 

When doing presentations these days I only get nervous if I have to stand up at a podium. I'm fine sitting down and presenting to a boardroom, but standing at a podium sets me off. I think it's because if I'm sitting then I see people as my peers, but if I'm standing at a podium it's like I'm trying to be better than people and I'm really not comfortable with that. I find in this situation the best thing I can do is spend a lot of time preparing, and not the night before, in advance. If I can go to the venue before hand and stand up the front this helps too - because then it's not such a huge shock to my system when I am first stand up there. Recording and playing back my voice can help sometimes, but actually sometimes it just puts me off. If I can present my presentation there then that's even better - I've got less new things to focus on. So basically I try to eliminate as many new variables as possible so it's not as big a surprise to my senses. 

I also don't use slides with a lot of words. I use enough words to jog my memory but I try to present in a conversational tone. I try to talk to people as if they are my equals, even when I'm talking to students. I gave a lecture at university recently and the only difference between me and the students is different experiences, so if I think about them as my peers I find it a lot easier.

I hope that helps. I know people deal with things differently but the biggest change for me was the sprinting. If you can find some way to rid yourself of some of your nervous energy I think it helps. 




 For me the key has been to to actively forgive myself. 

For me I find it useful to talk to myself in my head as if I'm talking to a stranger. 

For example, let's say I had an awkward conversation today and I didn't respond to the other person properly and I got a weird look and also stunted the conversation. I might go home and think about how stupid I am not to be able to converse properly and make a fool out of myself. 

Then I say as if talking to myself "Ok yeah that wasn't the best response. But it's okay. In the grand scheme of their day it is probably really minor and they probably aren't even thinking about it anymore. I forgive you (talking to yourself) for making that mistake. It's okay, you're human and everyone has silly moments."

Even just saying to yourself "I forgive you" encompasses a lot. It's first about acknowledging the error, but accepting that it's happened and can't be undone. And second it's about absolving you of the guilt of the error, and removing the burden of self punishment.  

Of course if it's something major this probably isn't relevant. But I'm talking about those every day things that I beat myself up about. 




 I'm in IT and I'd be happy to look at your CV. Shoot it over.  




 Have you thought about getting a casual job? Maybe it would be good to get out of the house a bit. 




 I guess I should spend time making myself more presentable. I don't know exactly when I stopped caring as much, but I only do what needs to be done and don't take pride in my appearance anymore. 

I also need to do things other people said - eat healthier, exercise more, go to bed at reasonable hours (oh yeah it's 1am... go me!), learn things outside of work, have motivation to do these things... 




 I dunno... I mean it's Parramatta Park - it gets pretty dark in there. And Parramatta.

 The thing I'm looking forward to is walking down George Street and it actually being a pleasant place to be, rather than having to get off the main street as quickly as possible and yelling to talk to your friends, because you have to compete with the bus noise. 

I get the bus most days and would be okay to get light rail (I used to get the light rail sometimes), except I hope they don't put those shitty old carriages on the new light rail. They really suck, and give me motion sickness. The old carriages are so much better.
 




 We have a lot of expats at my work and they all send most of their stuff by shipping. I guess they have a lot of stuff. Usually they do it in advance before leaving here. I think you can get insurance too. 

There is some good advice on this Whirlpool thread:
http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/archive/2292660 




 I can read stuff for you and record it. I reckon you should also get an Australian to listen to a recording of yourself doing an Australian accent, and give you feedback on any particular words that sound odd. 




 Try looking for screen printing shops. They should be able to print on t-shirts and hoodies.

 I think it's not often that really big storms hit the city center. It's the first time since I've been living in the city since 2007 that I've had a really bad storm here. We had hail once but this time trees and powerlines fell down around here. 




 My parents own a house on the riverfront down there in Picnic Point. The last one we really remember was 1986. But our house is built to flood standards so it doesn't affect us that much plus we're further downstream than Milperra.

 Cooked fish eyeballs. When I was a kid I'd swallow them whole to annoy/freak out my sisters and cause a stir. They don't actually taste like anything, so it's ok. Been a long time since I've eaten one though. Not that keen nowadays.  




 Ohhh, yes, that's just cruel and unusual punishment otherwise. My tummy is rumbling thinking about all those things.  




 Why is that evil? Maybe they are really old and not as fresh now so require toasting, I mean Easter was a while ago. Or are you more just jealous of not having some for yourself? 




 And the air is cleaner! 
























 I had this problem too and then I went traveling. Jetlag cured my inability to sleep in! 




 For pastries I really like [Fujipan]( http://www.fujitop.com.au/shop/fujipan) on Goulburn St. For cakes there is a great shop near the King St side of MLC Centre. You can get them on the day from the window or order ahead like I would usually do.  Best cakes ever. 




 I agree. We tried our best to have a no kids rule at our wedding but in practicality it didnt work. We had guests flying from interstate and it's hard for them to find a sitter locally. So I hired a few babysitters who entertained them in the bridal room away from the guests. My guests were happy and my husband and I were happy. A small price to pay for my sanity. Ideally I would have preferred no kids though.  




 Constructive comment. Thanks. 

There is also an [NCSS]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Computer_Science_School) workshop/class/competition/fun week in Sydney for kids to learn how to code.  




 Isn't the definition of a boom is that it is a few years of high prices followed by an over supply and saturation of the market and then a natural reduction of the number of suppliers following on from that. i.e. a bust. [Link](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boom-and-bust-cycle.asp)

The difference is that the mining boom Australia experienced went on for much longer than many other booms, and that Australian politicians didn't capitalize on it by taxing the mining giants enough. 

Which brings me to: Should we really be having a budget deficit now and having to make cut backs? We just had one of the longest booms in history... 




 Yeah fair enough. I hope just being somewhere different is helping you. I get depression and anxiety and find being away from my stressors helps a little.  




 For crimes less than two years there is an alternate intensive correction order which means you serve your time outside the prison under strict rules. For many people this is a better approach. I guess it depends how severe your crime was and whether it's your first offence. It's not always clear cut.

I think one of the problems with prison is they don't really focus on rehabilitation just punishment. There is no psychological support apart from assessment and drug prescriptions in prison for example. I think this among other things contributes to statistics like this.  




 Ah I didn't know that. I wasn't thinking of birds in particular but that was probably the context in which I heard that.  




 Actually I wanted to tell you that I have tried to save a large bird and I think it survived. It was a big Ibis and they're not the prettiest birds but it was on the road with what looked like a broken wing. All the cars were just driving around it and nobody cared. I was sure if I didn't get it someone would run over and kill it. I put on the hazard lights, got a fabric shopping bag I had in the car and took it to the wildlife vets. I think it survived.

I guess it just comes down to making a call. I wouldn't not try to help an animal if I thought I could but if you don't know what you're doing depending on the animal I guess it's also possible to harm them. Sometimes it might be better to call someone who knows what they're doing. We have WIRES in Australia. There might be something similar in other places.  




 Yeah I was pretty upset that day. They are beautiful little creatures.  




 Well the thing is I don't know. I know some animals will reject their young if you touch them. I have also heard it's also generally bad to touch fish because you have oil on their scales and you can damage them. I also once handled a little Australian ring tailed possum after I tried to save it from a cat and I covered it with a towel and put it in a box. It physically was fine, with no cuts or anything but then it bit me and a couple of seconds later it died. I was told later that they have weak hearts and sometimes they can die like that. 

Anyway I'm no veterinarian so I can't give a good answer but I think some animals have a higher tolerance for human interaction than others.  




 You're not ugly in the slightest. When I was 16 I went out with a guy who looked like you.  




 I'm sorry for all the heartache you have had to bear. Hugs. I hope you can find the strength to rebuild your life and make it one that you can enjoy living.  




 I'm in Sydney. How is life here treating you?  




 Maybe Kansas 




 I think it depends on what kind of animal it is 




 I am also this lazy. I used to work in a building next to a food shop. I would eat regularly and plentifully. We moved to a different building that was about 70 metres away from the food store. I was too lazy to walk to the store so would only get food when I was extremely hungry. I lost about 5kg in 6 months. The problem is my next job had a cafeteria on the top floor.  




 I don't know if it will work but if you're desperate I suppose it's worth a try.

You could also try to approach recruiters to help you find a job.

You might also want to see if you can get employment by contacting employers directly.

Also I suggest trying out [applydirect.com.au](http://www.applydirect.com.au) 




 Bowers will get them if you're near Marrickville. Sydney City council will come out Wednesday if you fill out the online form and let them know by Tuesday. 




 Yep. Got buzzed the other day and knew it was the postie. Ran to the intercom within 10 seconds. No reply. They had already left. Found the little receipt in the mail. Had to wait until following day before I could get the parcel from the post office.

 I have trouble completing the survey because the office girls send our packages, and I don't know how many they send or what it costs :( Sorry!

 NIDA also have shorter courses that are worth looking into. 




 That is the hardest part - getting your deposit/stamp duty together. 

There will be younger people who will get payrises faster than inflation, some will even get rises faster than house price rises, but saving for the deposit is the killer.

I worked out for every $10,000 that house prices go up I'd need to save approximately $2,500 toward my 20% deposit and stamp duty costs. If they're going up that much each week then it's just not possible for younger people, even if they are amongst the highest earners.  




 That show seems pretty interesting! I might have to watch it all the way through.

Is it just me or does the infrastructure look pretty similar to how it is today? Has Sydney been progressing more slowly or is it just less visible?

I mean I know there are probably a lot of new things like the harbour tunnel, a lot of the motorways, a couple of bridges outside the CBD, but the city itself to me looks very familiar. I definitely noticed the shops, cars and trains have changed, and the people look less 80's, but not a lot else. Maybe I am missing something! 




 First whoever you owe money to, give them a call and ask for an extension. A lot of places will do this for you if you ring in advance of the due date and ask. 

Rather than looking at payday loans, why don't you look at Personal Loans from Banks? 

Some examples:

* https://www.commbank.com.au/personal/personal-loans.html

* http://www.nab.com.au/personal/campaigns/loans/personal-loans/fy15q2car/index?own_cid=15009-2

* http://www.finder.com.au/personal-loans

Their interest rates should be better.

Also as others have mentioned payday loan companies are the worst. I would avoid them like the plague.

Another option might be a credit card with an interest free period. If you already have a credit card you can do balance transfers that attract 0% interest too. e.g. https://www.hsbc.com.au/1/2/personal/credit-cards/hsbc-credit-card


I don't want to be responsible for fuelling your poor money management, so get that shit under control and don't rely on these types of loans ever again after this ok !!!  




 I love growing flowers and when I do we get a tonne of bees! I can't tell you how excited I get when I see bees but whenever I see them it is one of the best days of my life. :) 




 Aw yeah I went with a friend who got a great spot with someone who was really into science! They showed her heaps of cool stuff.

I ended up in a lab with a few women who told me that science was a terrible career and that I shouldn't pursue it unless I want to be poor. They had me clean vials for a whole week. It felt like I should have been on minimum wage. Lucky I like science in spite of that!

 Aw that's shit. I like the old trams. The new ones suck. 




 Yes! My husband is on a work trip to NYC and this is the venue where they had the cocktail reception... so weird!

And I have a few concerns with this aside from the obvious lack of partitions.

* No room for larger bums
* Reflective panelling in front of the toilet
* Walking past people doing their business to the sink
* Only two toilet rolls... and not in easy to reach spots
* Lack of female sanitary bins - sorry but a regular bin doesn't cut it. :/ 
* The toilet roll closest in the picture is positioned right above the flushing button - bad design! 
* Lack of smell barriers or scents

Apparently the whole place is new but designed in 007 "Goldfinger" style decor.  









 I sent you a PM with the details.

Also I forgot to mention that there are some institutions that don't use Mortgage Brokers. For example HSBC, which actually offered a pretty competitive rate. I also checked out CUA (Credit Union Australia) which had a competitive rate (I think mortgage brokers do use these guys but thought I would mention it anyway). Though there are discounts to take into account with the major banks, so you can't always just work off the advertised rate and you need to find out about each one. 




 Yeah, sorry to say Saturdays have got to be the worst. There is congestion everywhere around there. I cut across from Camperdown to St Peters through the back - via Sydenham, Marrickville   Stanmore. Not much you can do if you're actually heading to Broadway though - and avoid Glebe Point Road - Saturday markets   pedestrian crossings make it a very slow place to drive. 




 Ah right. Maybe advice wasn't the right word then. But they do usually provide a recommendation - whether they should/shouldn't is another thing.

Like I said though, you need to do your own evaluations - and I'd still do that even if they are licensed. 




 Well they provide options and make recommendations for a particular loan for you. Why else would you go through them? 




 Does Newtown have a maccas now? Or did you mean the St Peters one on Princes Hwy? Or the Stanmore one on Parra Rd? 

Mid-saturday traffic around there is the worst. Leave early or stay clear (and use back roads)!  




 People used to say this to me at uni, and I know this is hard to hear, but I'm trying to be helpful... While P's get degrees they don't always get a job. Do your best. You might end up with P's and that's okay if you tried your hardest, but if you can do better, do better dammit. 




 Reading what you've been through, the things you've overcome are amazing. I would say that shows your resilience and is something that I would admire in a job candidate, rather than be concerned. Though I know not everyone will see it my way.

Like others have said, you don't need to tell people about what happened prior to your degree. They're not allowed to ask you your age in job interviews (due to discrimination reasons), so for all they know, you went through from school to uni. I don't list my high school on my resume. There is no need for that. You went to uni so you obviously finished school. If anyone does ask later just tell them you took a break, or you travelled, or looked after a sick relative, or anything you like really. Nobody needs to know if you don't want them to.  

I remember one guy in highschool coming to our school and telling everyone that people will ask you for your ATAR (or UAI as I knew it), for the rest of your life. That's bullshit. If you have a higher education, nobody cares about your school/ATAR ever again. It's getting now to the point employers don't even care about my university education, just my experience.  




 Yay congrats!  




 Ah didn't realise you were on a bike!  




 It's possible that you hate how they're so good... 




 Go to bed!  




 Looks pretty interesting - let us know how it goes! I would have gone but I only just found out about it and have stuff on tomorrow   weds. 




 I guess at least they told you right? I usually assume if I don't get a response within a week or so that they're not interested. 




 I've been there and done that. It is nerve racking. Don't let anyone make you feel like it's too little. Stick to your guns. If there is anything the mortgage crises have shown us is that banks lend more than they should and significantly underestimate most people's living expenses. Do your sums and stick to your guns.

If you need to try out other mortgage brokers go for it. You can also apply directly with banks. One of the ways I've found mortgage brokers more helpful thank banks is because they educate you, and they also should provide you with advice to narrow down your choices (because there are a lot). That being said, never take someone's advice at face value - I always go and evaluate the options myself. Another thing is that Mortgage Brokers get different commissions (% of loan value) from different lenders, so you should ask them outright what they get, so you can understand if they have any motivation for recommending one over the other. 

If you want to try a different broker, I have a pretty good one I would recommend if you want. I tried going through Mortgage Choice too but I didn't feel comfortable with them. Banks were good but only if you know exactly what you're after.

Check out Cannex: http://www.canstar.com.au/home-loans/ They have some tools there that are helpful for evaluating loans. Also check out mozo: e.g. CBA: http://mozo.com.au/rate-and-review/commonwealth-bank/home-loan-reviews for more reviews.

One of the things that you might not realise is that Banks offer a discount if you have the 20% deposit and if you have a higher loan amount and for different brackets they offer different discounts (i.e. the larger the loan the bigger the interest rate discount). If you don't have a high loan amount, then you might consider shopping around for other deals, for example through Credit Unions/Building Societies. A good mortgage broker should be able to help you with this though, so don't worry too much. 




 Carry a raincoat or umbrella for emergencies. 

My worst going home wet experience was when I was in Canada and it snowed for a bit, but then poured down raining while I was up at the top of the mountain. I thought my jacket was waterproof but turns out it is a bit old and lost it's waterproofness. I ended up buying a new t-shirt and wearing a garbage bag before putting all my freezing wet clothing back on over the top and riding the gondola down for about 30 mins before I could reach the hotel and have a warm shower. My whole body was bright red from being so cold and wet. It was brutal. 

I guess that shows sometimes you can't prepare, but if you can, do! 




 Invest in some ugg boots. They are like walking on warm clouds. I love them. They make winter way more bearable. 




 Does anyone know any good massage places in Sydney? I normally just go and get a voucher through groupon but I need to find something quickly.  




 15 minutes... that's not enough where I live! 30 mins to an hour! 




 They don't really know what the problem is but if you think about it logically there are some things which might not be helping.

Avoid products that are harmful to bees. Ever use ant-rid? Don't do that - it says it hurts bees on the packaging. You can put a bit of honey in a container and the ants will get stuck in it. Ever spray insecticide? Use natural products instead. There are lots of them, for example tomato leaves! 

Consider buying organic veggies. This means that farmers don't use pesticides heavily. Even your clothes can be produced with pesticides (e.g. cotton), so consider wearing clothes from more sustainable sources. 

It all sounds a bit much, so you might not be able to do all that, but consider just doing what you can. But if it means that in future we will still have fruits and vegetables because bees are still around to pollenate them, then I think it's worth it.  




 It also bothers me when the bathroom that restaurant staff use doesn't have soap. Yuck. 




 I think some people hold up future boyfriends/girlfriends to incredibly high standards.

You can't expect your partner to be 'perfect'. Nobody is. You're not perfect. Sometimes you're annoying too. The only thing is that you should be able to live with their flaws, just as they need have to accept they will live with yours. Don't envisage a happy ever after. It doesn't work that way. Relationships involve effort, compassion, understanding and kindness.

And if you're a stay at home parent, have a life of your own, don't just revolve your life around your partner and kids. Consider getting a part-time job, or furthering your education. You never know what life will throw at you and you should be able to support yourself if your partner dies, gets ill, etc. Don't take your ability to stay home for granted... a lot of people get screwed over later in life by not preparing for all possible futures. 




 Just a note because I've looked into it. Having a stand at those markets is very expensive. They also have strict stand requirements. 




 My car costs me a little more than this. One of the reasons is because I have a thing for good quality tires.  And I seem to have little maintenance issues that pop up like need for new brake pads, suspension (I live near a lot of speedhumps grr), engine mounts, new battery, etc. that goes beyond your standard service. I think it's because my car is getting old.  Just set aside $500 a year for emergency repairs like this stuff.  




 I know we shouldn't have to but since it's going this way... learn about encryption for your private data.  




 No problem. Good luck. If you can't find somewhere try air bnb. I have a friend who rents out his extra rooms in Surry hills too. He gets quite a few people who need an interim place while they search for a rental property so airbnb could be an option for you too. 




 Life really throws some curveballs. I haven't been in your situation and I wouldn't pretend to know what it feels like. I'm really sorry for what you're going through... it sounds tough.

I have had some pretty terrible times. To be honest I didn't cope well at all. Sometimes I wonder how I ever made it out the other side. I guess it comes down to this... that each state is temporary. If I can just make it through A, then I'll think about B, and if I can get through B then I'll think about C. If I can focus on only worrying about one thing at a time, then I can make my problems more manageable. I am a bit of a problem solver, so I have plans, back-up plans and backups for the backup plans. I don't easily give up... but it really can sting when you have tried a lot of different options and are reaching the end of your tether. Sometimes then you need support, or to think about things a little differently. Hopefully you will get through it - sometimes it takes a long time, a lot longer than you might think - but eventually that state will be over and a new one will arrive.

Very few things in life turn out exactly the way you plan, so if life doesn't go to plan then I try to remind myself of that fact. I definitely didn't plan the life I have right now, but it's not better or worse than my plan... just different. 

If you ever need someone to talk to give us a buzz. I hope you can find the strength inside yourself to keep fighting. 




 Nobody has said that exact thing to me, but they've said other things which annoyed me.

Someone told me when I was about 14 before I was even fully aware of my depression myself that I should go on medication. I don't know why but this really irritated me... the fact that I remember this incident nearly 20 years later shows how much.

I just felt like how could they possibly know what I'm going through? I hadn't even talked to anyone about it. I barely knew her. I was just acting a certain way I guess and she noticed. So it was like someone had found my secret. I never reached or asked for help. As a teenager, I was a silent sufferer and nobody could get through to me because I shut everyone out. 

At the end of the day I look back and realise that it was probably their way of trying to help, and while I disliked them for years after that, it was mostly unjustified. 

I don't find a lot to be comforting but I suppose these days a caring, non-judgemental, open minded listener would do it. I don't often need advice or comforting statements, just a friend. And if I want advice or comforting statements then I'll ask for them.  




 I've learnt that the level of pain I can cope with is much greater than I ever imagined I would be able to cope with.

I've also learnt compassion. People make mistakes. I make mistakes. I don't condone people's mistakes but I can accept them as that... mistakes. And I don't judge a whole person based on one or two actions. I also believe people do have the ability to change, and everyone is different in how they cope. 

However I am also very skeptical of people in general because I have been lied to a lot and taken advantage of, so now I don't trust people easily... mainly to protect myself. 




 I used to work at a Federal Government agency and quite a few people moved from interstate (all over the country) to work in Sydney.

They all used a rental property service. This was paid for by the government agency. If you can get your work or your partner's work to pay for it that would be ideal, but if not I think the service is worth the money. 

I'm sure there are a few around but just do a Google search for it.

I'd highly recommend it. 




 That's what gets me. When they grow up their whole life will have been documented online... and have had no say in it.

 [Never smile at a crocodile]( http://youtu.be/ZGkdcpTY1QI) 




 I think Australia does a decent job in general (especially when you look at [Vancouver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness_in_Vancouver) or [San Fran](http://www.sfchronicle.com/archive/item/A-decade-of-homelessness-Thousands-in-S-F-30431.php) - though in SF's case it's not really their fault but more that there is no National welfare program, and they attracted homeless people there because they were one of the only places in the US who tried to help!) but there is room to do more. It is easy to fall through the cracks, and once you've fallen in, it can be so very hard to crawl back out. Sometimes people get put in emergency housing and then have no long-term follow-on accommodation and only a small percentage find a job that would allow them to support themselves. 

My opinion is that in Sydney it comes down to a few things:

* [Abuse Victims](https://www.dss.gov.au/our-responsibilities/housing-support/publications-articles/homelessness-general/homelessness-a-new-approach) - people who leave abusive relationships and homes but have nowhere to go such as children. Apparently [one in 5 people](https://www.dss.gov.au/our-responsibilities/housing-support/publications-articles/homelessness-general/homelessness-a-new-approach) seek emergency accommodation as a result of abuse. A quote from the linked article: 

The largest single cause of homelessness however is domestic violence. More than one in five people seeking emergency accommodation are escaping domestic violence. Most victims bring children with them which means they share in the disruption and trauma of being displaced from their home.

* The need for a reasonably well paying job (because Sydney is an expensive place to live, and a lot of homeless people have lower levels of education)

Of course there are more reasons, but these I think are some of the main ones.

I also think some people who are vulnerable of becoming homeless aren't aware of the [services](http://www.humanservices.gov.au/customer/subjects/accommodation-renting-and-homelessness) available to them by the government, and also by the [council](http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/community/community-support/homelessness), especially as a lot of them have [lower education levels](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4102.0Main+Features20March+Quarter+2012). Also, when you've reached a low sometimes you're not thinking straight enough to be able to ask for help, and sometimes the help you need isn't available.

There is also [discrimination that occurs based on social status](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/DeakinLawRw/2002/15.html), e.g. once you're homeless or on welfare, making it very difficult to find a job, housing or support. 

If you want to do something about it then you could consider volunteering, every bit helps. 




 I love Peace Lily's. I got mine at Kmart. Just keep them out of direct sunlight because their leaves burn. I think I've seen Mother-in-law's tongue at Kmart too.

I personally don't like English Ivy and quite a few people don't, so [it's hard to find places that sell it](http://www.ourhouseplants.com/plants/ivy). There are [other suggestions here](http://www.growmeinstead.com.au/plant/english-ivy-sa.aspx), though Jasmine is much the same except with a strong scent. I mainly don't like it because it climbs up between gaps in the brickwork and the windows and when the stem thickens it can do a lot of damage. If it's in a pot away from too much sunlight or water though it's fine. I couldn't tell you where you can get it - we had one that took over half the yard of one of my parent's rental properties and it pulled down the gutter, so we had to kill it. 

You should be able to get Red-edged dracaena and Chrysanthemum's at Flower Power in Taren Point. Chrysanthemum's are really pretty but they have a really strong scent and produce a lot of pollen which means a lot of people have [allergies](http://www.dermnetnz.org/dermatitis/plants/chrys.html) to them (respiratory and skin). I'm not sure if I would have them indoors but if it's just you and you don't have allergies to it, then it might be fine.  




 I found the cat and enquired. Apparently it is in country Victoria. Maybe you can let /r/Melbourne or /r/Australia know about the adoption agency. It is so sad to see a life just discarded like that, and I do hope she finds a new home where she is really valued and loved. 




 Did you see where abouts in QLD she is? I may know someone who might be interested!  




 Did you ever have a golliwog doll? I did. Once upon a time it wasn't considered racist, except the original author failed to trademark the character, and poor Golly was exploited. :(

[This article](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1136016/How-golliwog-went-innocent-childrens-hero-symbol-bitter-controversy.html) explains the rise and fall of Golliwog. 




 I was on the phone once when a spider like this crawled down my arm. I was surprised, then the spider was surprised at my surprise, the person on the phone was confused, but neither me or the spider were hurt by the incident. It didn't even try to bite me. I think there was just general fear all round. 




 Did you guys read the [Old Shops of Sydney](http://www.smh.com.au/interactive/2014/OldShops/) page? My mum drives out of her way to go to that butcher in Como. She loves it. She's known the family since she was a kid - it's been a profession passed down through generations. Give a couple of the shops on the list a visit! You won't be disappointed. 




 Amazon. They do different lengths too if you're not the average height.  




 I'd suggest staying somewhere near Town Hall train station. It's a very central station. Mantra hotels has some decent serviced apartments there which are great. If you want more of a Darling Harbour view try the Ibis or Novotel which should be a bit cheaper. Circular Quay is great but more expensive. 




 I'd suggest that locking up in the day is okay but not at night. Can you lock it indoors somewhere? If you're going to a restaurant maybe see if they'll let you lock it out the back of their restaurant. 




 I'm pretty sure it's not that sporty but my first car was a Nissan Pulsar. Very cheap to run as it was mass produced. In it's time it actually won some NRMA cheapest car to run award. I'm sure there are other suggestions from other people, but I think it was a great first car. 




 I agree that less commuting is the way to go. Wouldn't it be great if we'd have some kind of high speed internet that would make not commuting into the city a viable option for some people? I can't even find the date when it will be rolled out to many places I looked into buying.

Last year, I was working with a company in the US and still couldn't work at home because my internet is too crap, so I head into the city office where they have a better connection. :/ 

As someone in a tech role I should be able to work from home around 70% of the time, but until home internet speeds are better I will be forced into the office.  




 How big are the fuel tanks on these buses? Does it have to refuel after the single trip? 




 Lol. I don't mind. They're usually more uncomfortable than me anyway. :) 




 What if they're too fat for one seat and require two? :D 




 Hello NSW!  




 Who are these people who destroy bees! I wanted to put ant rid down because we had so many ants but I discovered that ant rid is also bad for bees so I decided to leave them all bee. Now we all live in harmony and I have pretty flowers. 




 Walking is great. I have also skateboarded to work a few times. Commuting done right can actually be fun! :) 




 Have you tried the new trams? The seats at the ends are impossible to sit in straight and I'm not even tall. I'd rather stand any day.  




 Yup: http://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/307wx0/guy_is_shooting_heroin_right_in_front_of_me_on/ 




 I wouldn't call what I wrote whining. It's my guess at why 3 buses might have come at once.  




 Catching the bus in the seat next to a homeless person who literally smells like shit.

Still not as bad as San Fran right? People shooting up on the bus? 




 I've thought about this intently but I live very close to the bus depot which doesn't help to explain this! My guess is they deliberately do it so they can leapfrog each other and only have to stop at every 2nd stop.

Just to explain further, by the time the bus is at my stop all 3 of the buses are usually empty.   




 Canberra was nice when I was there a couple of weeks ago. So pretty! So many maple trees :) 




 I can't tell you about what the grade should be but I'd recommend just applying and seeing if they accept you, even if you're not sure if they will. I transferred degrees and I didn't think they'd let me but they did! It's worth a shot anyway.
