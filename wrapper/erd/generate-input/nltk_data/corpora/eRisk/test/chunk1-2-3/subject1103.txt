 Don't tell me you're  16 year old, because if you were then I'd  get angry. A day old infant isn't depressed. You probably fell from grace around 7 years old. So if you are 16, you had angst for about 9 years. It will go away if you change your attitude about life - irony. Good luck.  




 Did the guy walking cause the accident? How come the other people aren't walking in the intersection and he is? Doesn't make sense.  




 That's the sad part OP. We have to suffer to the point of insanity, then one of two things happens: 1. You break and will never be the same. 2. You break and realize you need to become apathetic and figure out the sodomoty of life and play the game, take no prisoners.  




 If OP mentioned SpongeBob and the "son" has to ask why there is semi-naked people in public.  10th grade.  




 Koons? 




 loved the kid's  apathetic reactions. "I like hockey, and I don't know why", "I'm so happy right now I don't know why". Poor kids, growing with the social outcasts with the beta dad. 




 Green moose? I'm not the intended audience.  




 Makes way more sense if you watch from the beginning. I feel like that part was left out on purpose to not make him look like a huge dick. Clearly he knew exactly where he was going. 




 Why? 




 I'm not a fan of this message. Too many people work too much and dont spend time with family or kids or doing something they enjoy that's not work. What is the point of having all that money if I don't have time to spend it or enjoy time with my loved ones? 




 Mischievous Kiss in Tokyo. You'll thank me later. 




 Hey OP. This doesn't sound legal to me.  Is there some kind of legal  council? Try ombuds.  




 Don't be. Everything may not be okay, but you still got love. 




 You're the devil. : p  




  Did you know only 1% of the world is college educated? People don't want to think, if they think they will think about all the things they have to think about doing.  All they want to do is watch something to feel good about themselves, and so they give them what they want. I stopped watching TV in 2012, because once I realized my IQ went up, so did my standards. The laugh tracks infuriates me with such  passion, I get mad. I can no longer be near such a vicinity.  




 How ironic if it was the board game: Life. 




 Names Jorge.  19/m/US. I like asains and traveling. sometimes I read, I love music (understatement) and I enjoy learning languages.  




 There was this movie. All I remember  is people in a cage and a small human girl approaches  the cage and sees a little boy, the girl runs to tell her father and he comes back with a scanner and scans the boy. He's a robot, too.  




 What was step one again? I'm confused.  




 People don't fall asleep in less than half an hour?  




 I totally  agree with you, no one comes from the blank slate credit competent. However, I don't  agree on the "fuck ups" one enough can fuck your life up. E.x. 50 credit that you can't pay off.  And the traveling, it's  for the "miles" Again neophyte trying to figure shit out one 1% at a time.  




 You left everything  vauge. I'm just going to reply with a vauge answer. What ever your problem is, isn't the end of the wrold. No problem is. Cancer? Surivable. Frostbite?  Surivable.  Not being able to make friends? **NOT SURIVABLE** as humans we're  social creatures, buy an animal or get a job and hire escorts until you get confidence start meeting people who love you not for you but for who  you are. Best of luck, OP! 




 Maybe it was a perky female attendant that day? Men have fallen for worse.  




 As long as you're still willing to fight, you haven't lost yet. Failure is when you admit it. Keep working OP, I know it won't be easy, but you got to do it for your daughter.  




 Depends where you are in life. For me, I'm just starting. I use my credit to get free $$$. Welcome to America where they pay you to spend money. I got $40 in 1% rewards just buy using a credit card. I always pay in full. Post-college I'm getting a traveling card, and fly more often and get "miles" 

**tl;dr Credit is only for people who can handle it wisely**  




 Why are you here if you already know? 




 How about a barista? 




 When I was 18 I got my first credit card. No job until I was 19. My credit score is better, why? because I started 7 months ago. Time is ticking you only have about 340 months to really enjoy life. Don't wait until month 200 to get one
 Just don't get into debt. Have fun! 




 Nice headphones! I want to get the HiFiMan HE-400, but after I upgrade my car speakers ($400-1k) Same here! I'm going to apply for subway tomorrow. Good luck on your job search.  




 Hello,

My name is Jorge. I am a university student in CA. I'm going to travel to Japan this summer. I enjoy the culture and want to learn everything there is about Japan. I don't expect you to teach me anything, I'm already studying the language. I want to send gifts and receive gifts ( small items, but it's the thought that counts) I just want to make more Japanese friends. I plan on working in Japan after I graduate so I want to start now. You can either email me or snail mail me. my email is drummergeorge@aol.com   




 Take them to to the people who are starving. Offer them 10 potatoes for every head they bring to me.  




 Nice, nice. I play League. I used to have a gaming adiction, but it's mostly extinct now. Which headphones do you use?  I get out next month :( I work as a tutor as of now, btw. You like your job?  




 Vist /r/SuicideWatch if anything goes atrwy. I can answer your question, OP. I live life for romance. Everything I do in life is for the sake of love. To me happiness is being healthy and seeing a beautiful asain girl, I approach her flirt with her, let her know I want to bang the shit out of her and hopefully  not get rejected. I will always do things for love. e.x Work - love - better production 
 School - love - great time, fun memories. Home - love - cook, Clean house
 I'm just in love with life. Oh as an aspiring psychologost, I highly  recommend you find love- whether platonic or promiscuous, you need love as an individual  in order to feel like living. If you're really desperate try an escort services and after the first experience  you'll fathom. Best of luck! (also worst come to shove, please be an organ donor)  




 This is the most easiest problem to fix. All you need is to learn to how socialize and boom. Read 48 laws of power, How to make and influence friends, and 7 high habits of successful  people. By the time you finish these books, I'd  say you wouldn't  be suicidal  by July 20th. Have fun, PM if anything confuses you.  




 Nope. I used to but not anymore. What are your interests anyways? Bang any girls yet? Future goals? Best memory last week? How is the weather in your State? Been to anything cool  over there?  




 Yeah,  my closest ones from 3rd grade. Out of all of us,  I  only went to university, one went to college and the other two didn't. They have no ambition, stay at home all day. I started seeing the gap several weeks ago, but I was in denial. I realized it yesterday  when I invited them to a party at my school, I drank a little but my friends were total losers. They didn't  want to do anything.  I wanted to approach women and I did- got rejected, twice- but they didn't want to do shit besides go home. Killed my buzz. Also, it was a built up from that, always telling me about "my debt" that I'm stupid for doing  all these awesome things. I work as a tutor as of now, I go to the gym, just cardio but am going to start lifting soon. I'm an audiophile, I spend 300+ on headphones, currently saving 1k to upgrade my car speakers. Love electronic/ambient music. I don't watch TV, I abhor the laugh track, makes me furious. The TV producer tells me I'm so stupid I don't know when to laugh, what a moron. Other interests? hmmm.. I love romance a lot. I dedicated my whole life to it( platonic or promiscuous ) I love helping people, that's why I'm going into therapy.  I volunteer at a orphanage to "save the children".As far as talking to people at school, I got rejected  four times last week, so now I'm here. See, i go for the 8s and 9s, those babys are hard to crack. I got a few after me, but I know my worth. Trying to bounce back though . I do meet people at my school, but I think reddit will just falciiate  my social circle ten fold. 




 You want to be Reddit friends? My name is Jorge, I'm the same age as you. I'm in CA though. What's up.  




 I'm a heterosexual male attending a Cal State. I just realized yesterday that my friends were losers. And am looking for other friendships as of now. 

My interests: Learning Japanese (Going to Japan this summer) I know  a little french and fluent in Spanish and English. I love to read, travel and buy stuff online. I'm an audiophile; plan to practice therapy in 2017. 



**tl;dr** **Looking for people who are great socializers.** 




 You deserved  it \s 




 So you're suicidal because a girl won't talk to you? Damn, you won't live to 20.  




 I break my phones w/o a case. I can never buy this phone, I just buy a external battery case phone. 10,000mAh keeps me happy.  




  But I don't want to be manipulative or anything

You're associating manipulation from a negative cognition. But did you know a positive connotation is referred to as: persuasion? People use each other all the time, for good or bad. Relationships are exactly that. Men get the sex, woman get the security form it. It's a give and take. (This might not make sense, depends on your level of apprehension) 

Honestly, I don't think you would be able to handle it. You need to be angry or uncomfortable. Then you have passion to change. I got a [picture](http://i.imgur.com/PrXxF5k.jpg) for you OP. I can go on and on about the subject, but I just want to plant the seed and hopefully one day you'll transpire from it. Good luck! 
 




 I came up a with an analogy for you OP. Consider woman dogs. When you're little they all look strange and interesting. You want to touch them. When you have the courage to do so, some will be pleased with your touch and one day one will bite you. Now it may be an ER visit type or just a small bandage. You've been bitten OP. And you're in psychological pain. But that's the worst one. There is plenty of material on the internet to spot dogs (woman) and how to get them to wag their tail in your presence, but it's hard to find what works for you.  




 This used to happen to me. You just learn not to invest that much into it at first, since it's unpredictable. Hopefully, you'll learn from the mistake of being too attached real quick. Unrequited love is horrible. Hope you feel better, OP. 




 I went through something similar to what you went through OP, not as drastic but just as traumatic. When I was 17 I got hit by a car. I broke my neck-C-7- If it was one bone down-C-6- I would have been a quadriplegic. My mom wanted to go to court to sue the driver. But I couldn't. I told her if she did I wanted nothing to do with it. It was a moment of time where I didn't want to relive. I had my neck broken for fucks sake. I had to wear a neck brace for 3 months. Can you imagine being in high school for that duration? My friends were awesome about it, making fun of me- I liked it, it made it less threatening- but I still got looks and empathy from people. I just wanted it all to go away. I still keep the torn helmet from the crash to remind myself that life goes on. I'm not sure how old you are, but no one can force you to do anything, in the US-long as you're not incriminated. You can tell your therapist to eat shit, you're not talking. Sure, maybe the cops will be involved but so what? Plea the 5th. You don't have to say shit, if you don't want to. But don't repress that memory or else it will manifest from within. I was at peace with the accident, and so should you. Let it go, there is nothing you can do about it now. Just accept it happened and move on with your life. You're not going in that direction why look there? Keep moving forward. Good luck.  
























 How much for the books?  




 I think you meant to post this on /r/UnmadeBeds 




 Isn't entropy the best? :) Everyone should die ;)  




 MURICA! 




 comments  




 As a college student, I am successful in my studies and refer  to myself often. Every time a quarter ends, I scan all my notes/papers/projects. I then store then in two places. Online and hard drive. I delete the hard copy, and enjoy a clutter, but organized academic folders.  




 Where do you work? I want free stuff 2 




 People get this sitmiga that education is affordable. It is, if you can afford it. Since you are not a candidate for any government assistance, you should invest into to look into third parties who will give you a loan with interest. Depends what UC, but tuition at UCR is 14k a year. If you tend to graduate in 4 years, you would owe. 56k in just tuition, not including the textbooks, parking passes, misconlanious purchases. If you're poor, it's better to stick to a CC, I've seen people who were in the same situation as you only to fail the 2nd year and owe 30k in money they aren't investable anymore.  




 How much $ do you make a year?  




 Here is a smile for you young adults entering the big scary world. Titties control a man, boom that's some wisdom you learn when you're 19.

 Why is he wearing a shirt?  




 I've been studying and experimenting  on this topic for a few months now. Thanks to your suffering and cried for attention I'm reaching the end. Since you helped me, I'll  tell you something. **YOU'RE MISSING LOVE**. You don't lose yourself if you want to die, voluntarily. You need love to fill your life. From reading your capricious text, I concluded to this analysis. Make yourself look/feel good and be promiscuous or just love yourself. No bulshit. I'm a year older than you and I got my life together- give or take. I've  never been where you are unlike the miliqtoast of commentators who  have. Don't listen to the people that spiral in the circle we call: depression.  




 CA Please.

 Seems like you lack discipline. I'm currently facing the same issue and that's after some insight. Assuming you're psychologically stable and all, of course. Just need to make it a habit that's all.

 Birds are our future  




 The one with the guy telling us he had a concussion due to a football accident and tells us a story how he lived a life until he was 40 had wife, kids, successful job, until one day, he saw a lamp in his house but it wasn't a lamb. It was bent, in a way it would appear to defy all common laws. He stared at it for weeks. His wife was concerned about him, he just stared at it. Until he realized it was fake, the lamp didn't exist. He woke up shortly after in the hospital bed. He had severe depression and couldn't cope anymore. He had lived 40+ years with a woman he loved, and a child he had, he said he sometimes sees the kid in his phericpheral.  




 Can you leave the shit face hole you live in? Honestly if you don't I can realistically see you killing yourself. If not, then I don't know.  




 Depends on your learning style. Personally, I do well in a group. I like to study in a group and loudly too, with music. 




 Play League of Legends, browse Ebay and Amazon, go on Facebook for mindless hours, and reddit.  




 There is a promotion right now on the Misfit Facebook, code is SHINEON25. You get 25% off, which is $74.99 Better to use this if you're buying it, unlike me where I did one of those 20$ off two days ago.. 




 I'm buying one today, I'll add everyone? :)

 You have to have history. I'm 19 and I have two credit cards. I got decided for  a Sale Malie, due to my short credit. I always pay in full, no CC debt, but if you want the best, you have to be the best. (Which means having previous good history)

 FUCK ME.  




 Somebody has to do it. It depends on personality and morals really. I can never be a laborer, I'm not willing to fatigue my body for a living, instead I want to heal people mentally and physically. Same for jobs that face violence every day, e.x  police, military excursions. It just depends on the person. Not saying neither of any jobs is bad or great. It's just what you want to do with your life.  




 I respectfully disagree with you, ask any person studying for endless hours in college and they will tell you other wise. It's a sacrifice trying to remember pointless material you'll only use twice- on the midterm and final. People want a certain job. No one wants to work, but that's not how the world works.  




 To be fair, no one wants to do anything of those, except the bottom one. No one wants to pick trash up, but people do.  




 In my experience nothing but time can heal this type of wound. Not everyone can or will recover. Only through therapy I can honestly say he will be better with an external source. Other than that, he might become an addict of some sort to relieve the pain. Sorry for your loss.  




 This sounds like a mid life crisis. Life isn't meant to be taken seriously.  




 Why is he playing on the wide walk? Inconsiderate  as hole
 




 I totally agree with you, OP. That's why I'm flying to Japan in 3 weeks. Fuck bills, fuck you. Let's fuck some kawaii japanese girls, desune. 




 I made it through the whole thing without laughing. The secret is soul crushing depression. 




 You lack critical analysis to really understand. I feel sorry for you, can now easily manipulate you.

 You have to read, *a lot*.  




 Did you see craigslist? Snajjajob? Don't give up, OP!  




 1) You pay the payment on the credit card website. Look at the credit's websites for a "Make payment" button and enter a bank account, whom you will be making the payment from.

2) As far as I know, it's best to use the card each month, so it will be "active" and will show a history of credit. Of course pay in full each month. 

Personal advice: Discover Student is the way to go, I got it when I turned 18. 




 Try using Cricket as your phone provider. It is GSM network (ANnT towers) I pay $35 a month for everything unlimited, including 4gLTE internet, (2.5gs, after it throttles to 4g) (also don't use their cheapy ass, welfare phones) (buy an unlocked phone for GSM and use cricket service) I have a Note 4, and paying the shittest price ever.  




 social media is a terrible habit if you don't use it as a tool to be productive in life e.x right way to use it: message your friends. See group posts about academics or follow major events that give coupons. e.x of bad way to use it. Be on social media for 5+ hours a day doing stupid shit. If you are the latter, then idk what you can do.

Now my fetish is Japanese women, and I'm saving money or coaxing a good friend of mine to make a recording of all the vocabulary, short diagrams, or just formulas
 And beat off to it while listening to it. Ever since I done this my GPA increased dramatically. also ask me about American History from 100BC to Rosevelt, I know pretty much everything.

 You may see college as a financial hole and time but it's worth it. You learn so much. You become more prone to stupid shit non educated people would fall into. Unless you're already have an alternative to enrich your life, then by all means work from online. But it's best to have a back up plan? ex. I'm going for therapist (Love this job) but I'm always taking the TESLO/CBEST so I can teach if needed. But if your plans don't require pursuing education then it's not for everyone.  




 Sounds like a gwaker case to me. Join a click or support group,  sports is a real good one. And let this become your life. Considering you already failed courses, speak to your counselor and see if summer school is  avaliable.

 I'm 19, and I still live with my family, albeit I did dorm for 2 quarters. If you like it, you'll get it. Is my motto. Depends on your interpersonal likes. For me, I tried waiting for the Note 5- I had a Note 2, but it broke- I bought a temp. phone (lumia630) fucking phone sucked! I missed my note 2, so I bought a Note 4, new for $520. Regrets. My life is more better with this companion, as I use it EVERY HOUR. ( except sleep) Cheers!  




 Oh, sorry I forgot to mention it's only 90% calibrated. I have the same problem about the 5%, but it's no big deal. I just charge it for a 30 minutes, and it'll be at 50% for a few hours. Easy fix.  




 I didn't really scrutinize the battery to accurately say, but from conjecture. I did this. Did not charge the battery full when it first arrived- I didn't have time. The future is now- battery was 50% right off the bat. Then I let it drain from that day on, by itself. Once it drained I let it charge over night to 100% (while off) then I turned it on, following that I did the same thing again. By the 4-6th day the battery was give or take calibrated. Although, it's not 100%, more like 90%. My phone stays on 1% for about 2-4 hours, which sucks because the screen turns lowest brightness and I can't use the camera, damn you Sansumg for being so conservative...  




 Twice. Don't stress about it too much though. A watched boiling bot never boils ;p  




 Drain that baby down to 0% Let it turn off, by itself. then charge it until it says, "100%". Did that with my 10,000mah one. 




 There is a product that will make your life more blissful. [Zero Lemon Case](http://www.amazon.com/Warranty-Zerolemon-10000mah-Extended-Protection/dp/B00Q7C6FTA) Will make your life ridiculously easy. I charge my phone every 2 days. I use it heavily, as I am always on Pandora or just using it for school/work. Buy this and you'll never scream at your mom again.  




 Depends what you like. If you suffer like me financially I'd go with the Note 4. Make scarifies in life for the things in it. E.x I don't eat at all outside, and mostly hang out with friends doing free shit, allowing me to Study Abroad in Japan for a few weeks. On the phones, usually the newer one is nicer, and better.  




 Is there any news on the release date?  




 I never buy phones from people. They could have fixed the phone with the shittest replacement parts. Looks new, but everything has been replaced with the lowest quality aspects, but this is a highly pesstemistic view. Cheers! 




 1) is definitely a nice one. But these are mostly written for stupid people, ergo, "self-help" As they cannot help themselves. But in an other life, You should take time to read A Prayer For Owen Meany, that book will Fuck You Up. Cheers! . 




 If your life sucks like mine and bought an ATnT phone, just instal icon apps on your phone, so it will look idiocentric. I just added a red sticker to the back, so if my phone is in the dark, I always put is face flat on the floor, so I see a big Ole Dot. Cheers!   




 Looks like there is 243 vacancies in the medical field. I'm going to try to snatch one.

 Thank you for your input. I haven't visited the campus yet, but I saw the website online and it has amazing features. Is there a lot of student involvement on campus? E.x clubs, third party merchants, solicitors, or just frequently updated bulletins?  At CSUSB, there is only about 4-11 active clubs on campus, compared to the "300+" they have registered. Thank you again for reading and your time!

 Bo-woo. Stop complaining.

 It's inconceivable to think I was having these problems and now I'm not. It's funny, because that's how life is. First you're a kid crying; hitting your head on the pole, then one day you're the adult wondering why you put the pole there. Haha, enjoy these ephemeral problems.  




 When you hear/read/look/touch/see something you usually don't bat an eye twice or turn your head or say, "what?" hoping to hear it again, nor wish to see it once more. When you see it, you will know.

 You're my favorite YA Author. My question is this, "Why do you think people should read in general?" Basic question, but I'm curious as to what an expert such as yourself would say.  




 What do you read, self-help books? Because that's pathetic. We can start a book club if you'd like :)  




 M'lady. 




 Read mine next.  I need mula.

 People don't  read? I read a lot. Hmm... are you an educated  individual?  I don't play video games or watch  tv. Call me crazy, but I read. Read a chapter before I came across this page, actually. **YOU'RE** *JUST EITHER LAZY OR STUPID*

edit: see /r/books, people do read- 5 mill subs- it's just you and your shitty-ass habits. I'm glad you don't read, so I can manipulate you one day, since you fail to realize the readings. What you don't know doesn't hurt you ;) Knowledge for power is my motto.

 No. I'm going to Japan in 4 days, I need all the resources I can get. This is why I don't get involved in politics, people do dumb stuff all the time, don't got any time for that.  




 Guys, I made a new subbreddit it, called /r/ModernListenToTHis this new subbbreddit is for people who care only about discovering new music, no political reddit bulshit no one has time for.  




 Overtime this topic is discussed from time to time, it's like telling a gun to stop killing people. A down vote exists for a reason, and the stupid people must be suppressed from public sphere.  




 I used to tell my friends, and they got mad at me. Now I don't tell no one and no one is mad at me. I get all the benifites though. 




 /r/theredpill  is  still up guys. All we need.  




 Get a credit card. pay it in full. that's it. 




 Homeless are uneducated and are the bottom of the food chain, there is no hope for them. Just awkwardly walk as they try to communicate with you. Although I volunteer  a lot which is a contradiction  but I need to feel good about my small dick

 I get jobs because I know languages. I'm socially adept. I can easily manipulate people to love me and my work. Learn to be manipulative, learn to coax, to flirt with people. People will always remembering the charming funny guy, never the smart anti social seal.

 Give me your paycheck, keep your pensis. 




 This is sad. Don't change who you are to appease people. Just kiss  their ass and ~manipulate~ persuade them why you're the best.

 I was in your spot last year, so let Senpai, teach you a little something, something.  First off, fuck you. okay now I got that out of the way- see, I'm experiencing  jet lag, CA - Japan yesterday. ok, no more rant. You're in a great position,  at 18 I too got a part time, and made 6k from last December, working 11 hours a week. I go to a state university so tuition  is cheap. it's obvious that you don't know what you're doing,  considering you're asking for such bland advice. Just read some books, ok?  




 Cool.

 This depends on the person's taste and amount of income defiantly and age. I myself as a undergraduate it is a necessity to use a laptop for a myriad of academic uses, also occupation. As my work requires me to travel a lot, I need a 10kMaH battery and a nice phone as I wasn't raised with a poverty mindset,  aquire wealth and fucking the little guy is what I taught myself.

 What websites? 




 No one cares about you. Who are you? 




 This is why I have chosen a career in this field, there will never be no more work, because people are just so damn stupid!  
























 I'm sorry to hear that. Please read A Prayer For Owen Meany.  




 What is yours  charger called? 




 r/ImAlmostHomeless.  




 Thank you. I remember a friend telling me that this book was the author's memoir, but I don't care for authors, just books.  




 I bought a kindle, I use I read about 3 books on it.  




 It's okay. What is important is to know what you are reading as opposed to how you are reading.  




 You came to the internet, to a community tethered by individuals with one comment interest: reading; and you come here to complain without some personal insight? No one cares if you read or not. I will forget about you in 5 seconds, and so will everyone else in a few hours. I like it when people don't read. It makes my life easier.  




 Not sure which laws apply to you, but from a US standpoint, minors cannot not legally sign contracts with organizations, you need a guardian to sign you.  




 I'm still confused about the ending. So the book proceed to tell a story of a protagonist and how her life went to shit. First she was on an internship then started dating some ashole in medical school, then she goes crazy and gets sent the asylum.But I'm not sure why Joan was there at the end, and how she killed herself. Ending is confusing, anyone wish to explain? 




 Don't do it. Unless you are going to marry her, and she has blown you at least 300 times.  




 You must out on so many books. Least you're not a fool anymore.  




 What a bohemian. 




 /r/minamilism would love this. 




 Never been to those states, but I live in CA, and in summer it's about 95-100 degrees most of the time. The difference is CA is just hot  where as Japan is humid. You feel sticky and that is what makes you feel the hottest. I've  never used an umbrella  for the sun, before either but there's a first for everything.  




 I'm in Shinjuku and it's humid. People are using umbrellas- including myself- during the day time. It's so hot. And sporadic rain sometimes too. Not stormy, just hot.  




 This is exactly why I travel. Life is just too demanding. But when I travel, I just take clothes, phone, money, passport and a book. I return ready to read for the next few months, until I need another vacation. 




 Haven't read that one yet, but I finished A Prayer For Owen Meany about 2 years ago, and I still cannot forget the ending.  




 A Prayer For Owen Meany, by John Irving. 

That books felt like a movie being played in front of me, every descriptive scene felt like I in the room, viewing from a 1 way mirror.  




 I wonder if this book will be the book I fall into.  




  Every book I read, influences my life. Whether for the good or bad.  




 Unfortunately you lack discipline, unless you have a mental stigma. There is no teaching this, as you will have to endeavor this yourself. My best advice is to travel, every new country I visit, my lust grows for reading. You just have to find your beat and follow the rhythm.  




 I never have sense of pride when reading, it's nothing to be proud of. Only when one finished the book, one senses a myriad of conflicting emotions such as mourning or blissfulness; pride never crosses my mind when reading.  




 I exchanged it two weeks ago, and I fly back to the Americas tomorrow.  




 I started reading when I was 17, but gave it up at 19 when University and work started to take my time away from me, as the internet did as well, but you know what made me read again? Not having access to the internet. As banal as that advice sounds it works. I am 19 currently studying abroad in Japan, and I have no access to the internet most of the time, but I took a book with me even though I don't have the habit, I still enjoy reading - this contradicts itself, but I take a book with me, in a case where I do actually read it. However, I find myself constantly at a coffee shop or park bench reading. It's so amazing when you don't have the internet in your ear, or worrying about Facebook. You really need to travel to get the urge in you again, that's how I see it. Or just cancel your internet to rekindle the connection, otherwise you're just going to go on the internet instead of picking up a book.  




 **:)** 




 Disgusting.  




 I hate these about 2 days ago, my stomach starting hurting, never again. 




 Also don't eat your kids, play with them.  




 Do you have a pair of other shoes? Those shoes don't match with your glares.  




 Usually when a person is mean, it's due to "projection". When an individual projects a certain attitude leads to many possible solutions; in this case, I'm using the internet as a way to vent my loneliness. I figured it out, but there is little I can do without continuing the vicious cycle. "I'm sorry" is an ideal apology, but I will do it again tomorrow, so what's the point? I'm just so lonely, I fsdafds;jkl a.fs 




 I put down my anime posters last year. It's just a life transition. It's like having a picture of barney on your wall. You used to like it, but now you can't like it anymore. You must like something more age appropriate or else people will think you're weird if you're not in the crowd; but since you are asking how to blend in- you're not ready to be a Bohemian. 




 I never had this mindset. As I am always trying new things, I never run of things to say, "why am I doing this?" As opposed to, "She's so fucking hot" and I work my ass off and try to conquer her heart. I live my life for love. I sacrifice everything for it.  




 hoarding is a psychological disorder, minamilism is a way of life. To me, minalism  is an art form, soley to please me. Minalism  and poverty aren't associated though. In my life, I have expensive shit, but little of it. I don't get myself off the shit that is worthless to me.  




 Too much water.  




 It's best not to help people who don't need it. Just smile and wave, and laugh about it later.
