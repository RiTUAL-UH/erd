 Vonnegut is gute. 




 I love the dance.  




 Harry Potter. Movies came out well lined up to actual grade levels. 




 I read the first one... that's as far as my criticism goes. 




 I liked it because it mirrored some events in my life in a way I had never seen written before. Its long as shit though. 




 Why? 









 I read 2/3 of World War Z when I stopped. It was a fun book, but at the time I was not really reading much so I told myself "Good book, glad I read it." and then i acted like i read the whole thing. 




 Interested in which other of his novels you will read, I myself just finished "Mother Night" and it was the most different of his works. I recommend you read his second best book Cats Cradle (after Sirens of Titan)  




 Started my first Hemingway novel this morning, "The Sun Also Rises". I find it amazing how similar life in 1920's Europe can be to life in modern America. Good book so far. 




 It would be great if I never end up getting very sick, but sadly I most likely  will one day. If I somehow end up reaching a very old age and I cam still stand then I guess I'll read the Dark Tower 




 I don't think anyone considers the PoA film to be bad, its actually one of the better directed ones.  




 I had read order of the phoenix about two weeks within its release and I loved it. School librarian actually set it aside for me. Then when HBP eventually came out, I got spoiled :/ the big spoiler.

didn't read it until years later about a couple months after the fifth film came out. Completely rekindled my love in the series and I read deathly hallows immediately after. I read it again, and I think its my favorite, either 6,5, or 3. 


chamber of secrets was always my least favorite.   




 I have the first four "Gunslinger" Stephen King novels waiting on my bookstand just in case I ever break my leg or get stuck in bed for a long while, I actually don't plan on reading them on my spare time. They are just those just in case books. So what book or series are you saving for the just in case? 




 I just finished "The Road" tonight at 1 am after starting at about 9pm and taking a thirty something minute break at the hundred page milestone. So about 3.5 hours for a 287 page novel. Book was amazing btw, I've had my copy for at least five years and I've attempted starting it twice, getting only to the thirtieth page or so, so I challenged myself tonight to just read the fucking book. Really glad I did, book has entered my top ten.  




 Me too. Libertarianism is an ideology I just don't understand. Civilization is something that time itself has proven to be necessarily governed.  




 I've read very little Sci fi in my life, barely Sci fi actually, just Kurt Vonnegut's work and The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, as you can see I'm more into the light stuff, but I would like branching out. I don't want something too far fetched and I don't want anything military.

any SciFi novels out there that are serious in tone but do not revolve around a military, or a space soldier? 




 ----" The Stranger" Spoilers----- 

I realized that enough time has passed since 10th grade and that I needed to re-read "The Stranger" by Albert Camus. Since I've been reading some Vonnegut lately, I was kind of shocked by how cold Meaursault is in The Stranger, I had been getting accustomed to lively characters, and hilarious narraration so the change of pace took some getting used to. 


"The Stranger" is a very short book, only 120 pages long, so I read it all in one sitting. Interestingly as I read it I kept jumping back in my mind to when I was still in 10th grade, sitting in that class as we discussed in our own little mini trial whether the murder was premeditated or if Mersault had any possible defense. 


I don't reread novels, I feel as if once is good enough, but I'm starting to realize I was wrong. Maybe rereading a book is in a way being in two places of time at once, the first time, and then the now. Or maybe I've just been reading too much Vonnegut and I'm starting to not see time as linear. 




 They're both dead 




 This is now a thing I'll do for the rest of my life. You just saved my life.  




 Lone Survivor is a recent smaller budget film by him that is good.  




 Wish I read this about 3 years ago. 




 It was a really large closet, biggest I ever seen.  




 Not exactly a robbery, more like a breaking and entering. It was a just sold home in my ex girlfriends neighborhood, and it was pretty easy to get in. We go in and look around the house, have sex in the closet, no furniture yet, and then she finds a panini maker inside the kitchen cupboard. We decide to take it. Then I raid the fridge and find four coronas, and we proceed to sit there by ourselves in a strangers new home and drink their beer all sweaty post sex. Months later she breaks up with me. We never told our friends about our little breaking and entering. Sucks that one of my favorite life memories was with someone I never want to see again. 

She kept the panini maker. 
 




 Are you out there typing up code in multiple languages, or do you seldom even use a computer at the workplace? 




 Quentin Tarantino

David Fincher

Ben Affleck 

Paul Thomas Anderson

Zach Snyder 




 Movie made me scream. Needs to be higher on the list. It's a Sam Mendes film correct? 




 You two should become friends 




 I bought the 20 anniversary edition last week. Haven't stopped listening.  




 I always accept fliers. It's so fuckin simple. Grab flyer. Walk ten feet. Read flyer. Throw flyer away.  




 Auditorium is my shit 




 I'm assuming from the thread title and all the other answers in here, that season 2 will be up on St Patricks day  




 Why you gotta say spic tho 




 Cartman. Fuck that fat kid. 


And fuck anybody that emulates his mannerisms.  




 I remember I listened to OBFCL2 first before any other Wu Tang solo project. I immediately got the first one right after this.  




 This is why Aquemini is my favorite Outkast album 




 I have a Vapor Shark and I love it. Store is constantly packed too. Any specific criticisms you hear about VS? 




 oh god 




 spitting on your onion rings 




 Its just "Say Goodbye to Hollywood". But, that's my favorite of his. 




 This movie is just sad. Was trying to watch all the of director's films, Sam Mendes, and I ended up watching this one. 

What the fuck. 
This isn't entertainment, this is isn't escapism. Only reason to watch this film is to make myself feel a little better of my own life. 

I'm sad and I fear marriage now.  




 Phone wallet keys.  

It's the ritual everytime I leave my house.  




 Is there a name for the phenomena of people forgetting how to drive? Sometimes traffic just stops.  




 Related: having to troubleshoot computer issues. I have broken a printer Office Space style before out of rage. Fuck computers 




 They're the worst.  




 Me, having plans fall through. 

If I'm looking forward to something all day, and it gets cancelled my whole day feels like a waste. I could've planned for something else.  









 Why do y'all douches always look so happy?  




 Is there a difference? I thought they usually meant the same thing 




 Hey man, if by douchiest car you mean something better than my year 2000 car... 




 Some people out there have to be at least mildly aware of their douchiness 




 Douchebags always seem like they're having a good time, so this is a question to all douchebags willing to admit it: What's awesome shit that happens to you because you're a douchebag? 




 Toxicity is an amazing album. Have you listened to it? 




 God that's gonna be a great game isn't it.  




 Safe House was pretty succesful film. Made $140 million domesticly. One of his largest films.  




 I love that album. My uncle had gifted me the bootleg when i was like 13.

Motivation is still my pump up song. 




 Buy something with it. Come on, you can afford it. Do something cool with the cash  




 I know, I do awesome things and Im broke. But I'm curious to see what a person with lots of funds does for fun.  









 Great book, first King novel I've ever read. That guy can fucking write.  




 They'll all find out... Soon.  




 I party occasionally, but when I do, I stay next to my friends the whole time. I don't really like meeting new people. 

That first moment when I walk into a party or place with a lot of people, I feel some anxiety, but it goes away if I'm close to my friends.  
























 And a Sci fy TV show! 




 The first E-reader I ever saw was a SONY. If they would have had their own online store like amazon theyd be king right now, 




 I read the first one and I liked it a lot. Gonna spread this series out for the next couple years. Great story. 




 Adam Sandlers a great dramatic actor. Reign over me was great too. 




 Yea I see everyone posting dudes, why not party with some hot chick?  




 That movie was way too stylized. I like Fincher more than Stone 




 Paul T Anderson: Stalker movie. All his films are about obsessive men, I would like to see him try a film with an obsessive female lead. 




 Quentin Tarantino with some space pirates and space cowboys? 
dooowwwnnnn 




 Two serial killers fall in love? 




 It's fantastic. Especially if you usually don't read. Most people don't have experience with multiple narrarators, and this book does it great
 




 I just got HBO GO. Don't think I'll watch any new tv series until I watch all of these.. 




 All my friends have tattoos. I'm the only one without one. How often do I have to hear " Bro when you gonna get some ink" . 


never. I don't care for writing on my skin.  




 Visceral? Are you a video game industry journalist? 




 As someone who was running errands all over Miami this morning, why?



Miami fucking sucks 




 Is there any system in place that forces a state to change its laws? Lets say all 49 other states make motorcycles illegal, but there's one state that allows motorcycles. Would the federal government step in and force that state to change its laws? Is there some sort of majority rule?  




 I live in Florida and we are behind the curve on many things, sometimes this state doesn't feel like America. Why cant all states be equal. 




 Would anyone on reddit know which, if any, branch is starving for recruits? 




 I have a marijuana possession misdemeanor back in 2012 that was nolle pros. I also have a couple traffic violations. I'm in college right now and have not gotten in trouble since the 2012 incident. Would any US branch grant me the necessary waiver? I really want to serve, any branch, any position.

I am 22 and in great physical and mental shape. No weed since I was busted. 
 









 While doing all this do I just block out everyone I know? I seriously don't enjoy anyone in life right now except maybe my sister and my dad. My mom is a huge factor in me wanting to leave. 


The military isnt an option because I am disqualified from enrolling because of a marijuana conviction. Right now they don't really need too many recruits so what could have easily been solved with a waiver in the past, now leads to a permanent DQ. 




 I'm tired of my friends, we don't really have the same interests anymore. I hate my mother. I'm bored of everything. I don't want to get a job, I don't ever want to have a boss again. I want to completely leave my life to start a new one. I have no money though. Are there any programs besides the military that allow me to leave home and have a purpose?

 




 Good site, very little matches in my city tho. I'll check it periodically though thank you. 




 Thank you 




 Unlikely or impossible? 




 Three years ago I made the mistake of getting caught with marijuana. I have a misdemeanor charge on my record, I can expunge it. I dream of being an Air Force Loadmaster. By next April I will have an Associates degree. What are my chances of getting a waiver? Does the Air Force need Loadmasters right now?  




 Because I have a misdemeanor drug charge the US military is not an option for me, but I really want to enlist into something and serve somehow. I was looking at the PeaceCorps, and I've read that getting in is a little hard. I'm currently working on getting my degree, so Ill have that requirement met, but one thing i have little to none is Volunteer service. How do I start? Does any one here volunteer? 




 Do you do the same psychedelics or do you experiment with different kinds? For a while, about a year ago, I would try anything I could get my hands on, and I dont recommend that. 




 There's no dependency, but its very hard to say no to drugs or alcohol when I'm bored. 




 Anyone gone fully sober after having experienced drugs and alcohol? Was it hard? Was it worth it? 




 FAVORITE: Open roads at some times, very peaceful driving.
Least favorite: Every thing is far, so walking is never an option. 




 If you already live an active lifestyle it would be beneficial to your activities to attain more strength. Being out there and being and feeling stronger is very fun. 




 At my old job people a brave soul made it known to everyone that they smoked weed, and then since everybody fucking smoked weed anyways, people started meeting up to get high. I already have a group of friends i do that with, so I only smoked with the  coworkers a handful of times. All those people ended up becoming like best buddies. 




 Working out is the best thing for the body. Unless science advances exponentially in the coming years, you're going to be stuck inside your body for the rest of your life. Might as well make it the best body possible. Join a gym or workout at home its all up to you. I started just doing body weight exercise, just to have some strength, and eventually I wanted more strength and joined a gym. Amazing decision that has left me feeling and looking great. 




 I am single right now and it doesnt bother me at all. I was in a relationship for 13 months after having been single for a longtime, and that relationship taught me a lot of things. Lesson one: date someone better than yourself. I dated a girl that had all the same issues in life i had and then some. We constantly were having issues because neither of us had our shit together. Just fucking kids being kids. I plan on being single until i have my shit together. ETA for having my shit together, at least 10 months.  




 Oh wow, thank you! 




 Thank you that's exactly what I was looking for. Best subreddit for that type of trading? 




 Not exactly day trading, but buying some and selling within a week or two, is there a name for that? 




 I guess its called a film producer, but I want to be the guy that reads scripts and decides what gets made, and how large of a budget the film needs.  




 I'm going to another city next weekend, don't want to spend money until I'm there. 




 I'm anti-people, not anti-person. I would be able to feel well in a crowded room only if I got one on one time with every single person there. But when its not one on one, the persons become people. 




 Cookies and cream of course! Just hearing the words ice and cream makes me think of cold pieces of Oreo. 




 Thank you so much for this reply. I really do want to get my degree. 




 Man of Steel had the best action sequences ever in a superhero film.  




 I was for three weeks, until last week when my small set of funds became  $100. I haven't been looking for work because I really want to focus on school, but my parents are making it difficult on me to just focus on school. I already set my school schedule for fall and I'm not really going to have much free time for a job. But my parents keep asking me about my job situation. Ahhh, I'm going to attempt to get a student loan in the fall for some funds. To answer your question, right now at this moment I am happy. But when I leave this moment and place myself  in my near future I get slightly depressed, I fear that I might have to drop a class or two and het a job. 


Not one semester of college have I gone through where I could focus just on school. 




 Homestead FL. The most "southern" town in south fl. What do I like to do here? Drive north. 




 I was thinking about being a server, I did food industry for a year so I thought I had kind of graduated from that, but tips are just so gratifying. Hmmm 




 I'm in college, age 21. 




 I'm going to give the short version of the story: I was a cashier at a sporting goods store for two years and it was really fun, but in the last of month of my employment, work just started becoming a chore. The store manager was getting on my nerves, and a lot of the new employees were boring. The day before I quit I put in a request to get a weekend off, two months in advance, and then I get a text from a coworker that my store manager looked at the request and then in huge letters wrote denied. Her reason was that we had inventory that week. I confronted her about this because it was bullshit. Inventory was on a Tuesday or Wednesday and I was requesting the fri-sun off. She gave me a lot of bullshit and said "well see what we can do". The whole time I tried having this conversation with her she paid me about three percent attention. The next day I accidentally, or maybe subconsciously, woke up 5 minutes into my shift. I felt relief. My mind literally had no urge to go into work. I went to the gym, ate something and then drove to the job, looked for my manager and I told her I quit.


problem is I don't have any income anymore. But at least I don't have to deal with my manager anymore. 




 Guessing the requirements are being white and rich. 




 A drama about high school football in texas/the south. Down there footballs serious business. I lasted two seasons, felt too dramatic. But the first season is worth watching. 




 Just have a Monster hunter be the protagonist for all the films. He has a zany twisted mad scientist friend who's not good with women as his best friend, this friend allows them to travel in time finding monsters.  




 I just hope the opening scene is the same from the first Uncharted game.  




 Nothing was the same, literally 




 Smiles, I would shoot myself in the face with it, and everyone else I meet. 




 Need to watch this one again. 




 Oh yes, love Collateral. 




 Wonderful film, felt like if I was in NYC. Would like to watch more like this. 




 "Barrel of the Planet of the Apes" 




 The correct nomenclature is "apes" 




 I don't agree with your predictions at all. No way is the sequel to a movie that had long legs and great word of mouth going to open less than the first. 




 Sequel to be titled "War of the Planet of the Apes" 




 For a non superhero movie with a mostly CG cast? 
























 This might be his masterpiece, but Se7en is still my favorite. Zodiac has a limited number of rewatches, Se7en I can watch whenever. 




 Ok I'm sorry 




 No wonder so many Leon medical centers have sprung up lately 




 Gonna read this. Had never heard of it. 




 I like to imagine the setting myself. Unless its incredibly important to the story, can't the reader just infer from the situation where the  characters are? 




 I read The Road this year after having attempted it a couple years ago. I loved it. I don't know if to read Blood Meridian or No Country For Old Men because Ive already seen the movie. How similair is it to the movie? 




 c-cc-c-c-c-c-c-cccombo breaker. Shits not chill at all 




 Link? 




 Yea, only drink I get when I go there. 




 The book was. Idk about the adaption. 




 No, a major plot point is that hes getting older, so I would recommend watching it at least a week after the others. Preferably three years after. 




 Fun fact, Quantum of Solace is the most expensive film ever by the  minute. It was just a really expensive epilogue to Casino Royale.
edit. wrong word 




 Cats Cradle is my favorite of his, followed by Sirens of Titan.  




 Michael Chabon "Wonder Boys" enjoying it a lot.
Ernest Hemmingway "Farewell to Arms", taking my time with this one, perfect breakfast reading. 




 He runs a Nazi memorabilia shop. 




 Manhattan Love Story is surprisingly enjoyable and clever. 




 New Girl is hilarious, at least the first two seasons. You're just hating. 









 Your kid wins at Halloween 




 Literally watching "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" right now and I'm loving it. 




 Brad Bird outweighs Lindelof though, so who cares. 




 Holy shit me too. I was 12 or 13 and I had just got a TV in my room, I channel surfed until I hit upon HBO and a movie was about to start. I said why not, and Collateral happened. It was my favorite movie for a long time. 




 You speak Arabic? Sounds like you can definitely get a good job 




 You already saw the whole joke. 




 I've been in six car accidents! Two ended up completely wrecking the car I was in.


Only four where my fault. 




 Just graduate. Senior year is young adult day care 




 I was so glad when the detailer gave me the option for AG. Forgot about tuition assistance... 




 I'm in DEP for Aerographers Mate, shipping out in 2015. Wondering what exactly goes down in the Navy when on shore duty. Everything on the internet is usually about sea duty. 




 Its the online sf86 




 I live in his home area, I hate how fucking thug and ignorant people can be down here. Career criminals are the worst, and more needs to be done in this country to help youths make better decisions. 




 High Grossers: Will Ferrell, Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson etc


Grown Ups cast: Adam Sandler, Cris Rock, Rob Schneider etc

New SNL cast: Andy Samberg, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Jason Sudeikis, Kristen Wiig etc


Appatow crew: Seth Rogen, Jason Segel, James Franco etc


Did I miss any? Who's your favorite? 




 Buy an ereader.

I have a Kindle Paperwhite and I now read 5 times more books. 




 Sirens of Titan and CatS Cradle are my favorites. Mother Night is my least favorite. 




 "Horns" by Joe Hill. I read "Heart Shaped Box" last week and enjoyed it very much so now I have to read his whole bibliography. I like that he seems to have grown up with the same pop culture I did, so I understand all the reference's he makes. Liking his style more than Kings. 




 I've seen The Mexican on TBS like 4 times in the last ten years. 




 Reddits not a waste of time though. Think of it as a free MMO community college with courses on any topic and where anyone can be teacher or student. If you reddit correctly you can learn a lot of stuff for free. 




 On a dead celebrity binge? 




 If you like Gone Girl you might as well read her two other novels, Sharp Objects and Dark Places. Both have female protagonists that seem real. 




 Do you recommend ET to someone who's never worked with electronics before?  




 Dark Places was good too 




 The Road. Its narrative and strange word choice made 17 year old me give up quick, until four years later when i gave it a second shot. Finished it in one night. Amazing novel. 




 God yes. I was utterly destroyed when an ex of mine three days after breaking up with me showed up on my feed as in a relationship. 




 Whenever a server asks me how much creme or sugar and I say none, I try to keep the coolest face I can


"look at that guy, he's a real man, not afraid of anything" 




 Black because I like tasting the coffee and not the creme.

Also, because I hope someone notices and thinks its cool.
 




 That's not what it means.
Its how high you are, not how much you smoked. 




 Expendables 4 




 They already did with Casino Royale 




 I only had a small injury on one of my fingers, but it was years ago. Vision and hearing are great too, and I am in very great physical shape.


I really cant wait until I'm swore in. I think about it all day. This wait is stressing me out.

Positive thoughts. 




 I took my asvab yesterday, all I need is my physical and a drug waiver now. So am I basically in? I hope so, I've been stressing it a lot. 




 I was thinking Batista 




 Damn gurl you normmmall.  Nam sayin 




 It was necessary to make more money, which is what the film industry is about.  




 Read Sirens of Titan, what I believe Hitchhikers to be based off of. 




 Read this book throughout a road trip. Its like the only thing I remember from the trip.  




 So you bought 4 shares? 




 WAIT WE HAVE THIS TECHNOLOGY? 




 I also want to know. I can only afford one. 




 Was Bling Ring good? I'll Netflix it if it is 




 The one with legal murder. 




 The Road and The Stranger. Not because they were great, they were, but because they're really short. 




 When a friend of mine fell for a pyramid scheme and knew it. His reasoning was that he knew he could make it to the top of the scheme if he signed other people up. 





























 This could be a television show...think of all the crazy scenarios. 




 yea, they're definitely holding on to that for a while. Reigns probably involved eventually too 




 Make sure you go to harvard.edu 




 RESEARCH. If you really want to get in and you're mostly clean you will get in. MEPS is boring but its not hard. I personally got only one job offer but many others at meps had sheets of jobs to choose from. Make sure you go there with a couple of jobs in mind. 




 If you haven't read The Stand, then make sure you do. 




 ASVAB for dummies. Helped refresh some math knowledge. 




 Fuck yes, seeing these characters out in the wild is always the best 




 Do better research dude. News of this came out almost two months ago 




 That's kinda what the movie "In Time" is about. 




 It looks like a sequel to Cody Banks.. Now way this makes any good money with an R rating.  




 Best romantic film ever 




 This was the first book I ever read on my kindle. Such a great book. It reminded me of Harry Potter for no particular reason
 




 You must live in a really nice neighborhood. I did Dominos delivery for a year in a very bad neighborhood and the manager kind of hinted that the job was too dangerous for women. We had no female drivers. 




 To Pizza Hut. Drivers either dont get the delivery fee, or only get half for gas. While on delivery they also get paid less per hour. 




 How come no one has mentioned "Veep" ?  Funniest show on television. 




 Thats why im pro choice 




 Its also immensely rewatchable 




 Haven't seen that movie in ages. What was it called?

Phone Call? 




 Me too :/ 




 Paperwhite for sure. Sister has a regular kindle and is jealous of my backlight. 




 Edge of Tomorrow 




 Me too. Glad I did. 




 Weeds overrated man, especially trying it only once. The fun part about weed is becoming part of the shitty subculture and then deciding you want to do better in life.

I say just skip to the part where you want to do better in life. Try weed out in fifteen or something years when it will be legal everywhere. 




 Shit I use toilet paper 




 Not sure if its labeled as horror, but, The Road was scary. 




 yessss. Whole trilogy is almost perfect 




 11/22/63 was my first of his and since that I've read four more. Its such a great story. 




 BN.com also has this. I'm a member there so I get free shipping on all orders (dont have prime) 




 The first four Potter books, bought them with my own money in first grade. I want one of my kids to read the same copies one day.


Funny though, at the time I would write the date I started reading into the first pages. 




 Lol for real, Bahamas, Miami, poker place, running parkour fight, etc 




 They both made good money though.  




 Quantum of Solace was the most expensive film ever minute to budget wise. It was like 100 minutes long and cost $200 million. 




 Theyre both so good, but TWBB is perfect 




 So surprisingly good. Not the film I expected 




 Paige 



Paiiiiggggeeee 




 Yea , based on a novel by the same author of Trainspotting. Plus professor X is in it 




 How do promotions work? I swear I read somewhere that being promoted adds a year to your contract, is this true? In Navy DEP at the moment btw. 




 Hunter Thompson - "Heavens Hell's Angel" 




 Living in a small city, no offense to your city, but what are you really going to miss out on?


"friends were a bit hesitant saying that I should experience more things in life before jumping into such a big commitment. " your friends are just saying that because they are going to miss you, and you'll miss them. But you'll be seeing the world 




 I saw it today just knowing it was good and nothing else. Wwooorttthh it 




 What about the graphic novels? 




 She just write a new fucking book. Come on harry is in the Wizard FBI!!! There are dozens of stories to be told. DOZENS! 




 I go to AG a school next year. Hows the job? 




 Headhunters was so surprising. American adpation is in production  




 One of Finchers best. Master at adaptation. 




 I hate that the only movie I've ever seen in a non domestic theater was GI Joe in Nicaragua 




 Watching Broad City right now and I miss this. I miss smoking with friends and getting into shit. Sadly the United States military isn't fond of drug usage so its the sober life for me for at least the next four years.


Enjoy it while you can guys. 




 Yea... People say it down in Florida  




 Southern Reach was amazing. Dont think I have any questions besides, why was Southern Reach so amazing? 




 Like under $30 million domestic 




 This movie is gonna bomb hard 




 My first Vonnegut and still my favorite. I recommend Sorens of Titan second  




 Just finished reading this today actually, after three whole weeks. Idk about four films, but three could work.
Spoilers

Fist movie ends at finding Abigail

Second movie ends with hatching the spy plan

Third movie ends with Harold dead and the four men on the mission

Fourth finishes it off.

Guess it could work 




 I dont know if anyone here has ever been stuck in a waiting room for three plus hours, but this year, about two months ago, a situation arose in which i knew id be stuck on a chair in a brightly lit room with many strangers. i brouhgt Cats Cradle and finished it before days end. It was great. That again is "Cat's Cradle" by Kurt Vonnegut. 




 What happened in El Salvador? When from 60 something to forty something 




 Did no one give you the memo? People like to dislike things others like. Even if they liked it originally. They miss liking it when it was special to have experienced it, but when more people start experiencing it, their experience feels less important somehow. 




 Yea and hobbits dont exist 




 Hidden gem, I think I cried because of happiness  




 Harry Potter wins because most everyone in the world goes to school at least once. Very little people walk to volcanoes. Harry Potter is just more relatable. 




 A one man handicap match against the entire WWE roster? 




 I can already smell the $40 million dollar opening and $98 million final domestic total. 




 The Road: The hype is right with this one. McCarthys magnificent use of strange words almost discouraged me but i ended up reading it through one whole night.

Night Film: For fans of film and mystery this is a must read. it is long for its genre, but its great. 

The Sun Also Rises: First Hemingway I ever read and he might already be my favorite author. If you want to travel to early twentieth century south west Europe read this, 
























 I want to build up leg strength so I feel the stress of running less on the knee joints. 









 yea we all did, it's on the internet 




 Wealth worship 




 Yea for real 




 Kill Bill, any scene. 

Constantine, when a perfect circle song plays in that club.

 




 That weird sphere of water was amazing. 




 The Stranger by Albert Camus 




 Mysteries of Pittsburgh by Michael Chabon. Made him famous. 




 Thank you, Wolf Hall sounds like what I want. 




 Any books told through the eyes of a right hand man? It could be about crime, kingdoms, politics, anything.  




 People aren't as interested in dinosaurs anymore. I'm with you on that. JW wont pass $300 million in America. $800 worldwide total. 




 Nah. T shirt selling is the laziest form of entrepreneurship.
American Apparel is the one making money here 




 Not unless you live in a Nielsen home!

Unknown to many, but ratings are actually based on sample sizes, basically a small amount of Americans supposedly representing the larger population have boxes in their home that document viewing habits. If you don't have this box, or report by telephone, nothing you watch at home counts. 




 Booooooo 




 I'm watching Armageddon right now and its just really long montage so far. First came the "Destruction montage" then the "exposition montage" the "recruiting montage" and now the "training montage".


I'm going to turn my tv off  




 I would 




 AC was a job I was hoping to get. Air traffic in the civilian world is something that is never going to stop, so jobs always available. 




 Superbowl half time show when Katy sang 'Fireworks' everybody I was with just started quoting 'The Interview' it was kinda annoying 




 Definitely. Song only exist because of that movie basically 




 Neverwhwre by Neil Gaiman. Best book he has written. London underground, fantasy elements. 




 It doesn't. Back in 1999 did you have Netflix? Or any on demand service? The industry is different now. 




 Fuck inflation in regards to box office. All effect it has is negated by the fact that there were less movies and less ways to watch movies back in the day. Saying that Gone With The Wind would have grossed $1 billion in today's dollars is wrong because it only broke records back in the day cause it played for years and it was one of very few movies available to watch. 




 I'm watching Horns right now, the Joe Hill novel adaption, and the Pixies "Where is my mind" just came on. It completely took me out of the movie because of how well it ended Fight Club.


What songs should never be used again? 




 Honestly I finished it today and would like some of my time back. The first 400 pages were great but the last third was a chore. 




 I love immersing myself into the mad men world at least once a year. Seen every season at least three times. Show gets better everytime.  




 Go for it dude. I realized three years after graduating high school that I wanted to do it, so I did. Now I'm just waiting to ship out. I wish i would have straight after high school though. 




 Yup. Escapism is beautiful because it doesn't matter who you are when you read something, you can be a rich man or a poor man but the book is the book. All it needs is to be read. 




 If anything why not just go for a non clearance requiring job?  




 Wouldnt the college loan be the largest issue? 




 That's so fucking cool that I expect Hollywood to copy this video in a movie soon. 




 What type of job would you like, and what type of base would you like? 




 This one isn't by Justin Lin, its by James Wan the Saw director. 




 You know in the movies when the bad guy plays games with the good guy? (Die Hard With a Vengeance, Skyfall, Dark Knight) any good books like this? 




 I've looked into that and what I've read shows that the program is mostly for nukes, I'm not going in as nuke. 




 I'm going to be starting up my active duty enlisted contract in three months. I have an associates degree currently and was wondering if after I serve my four years I can use my G.I Bill to do two more years of college, get my Bachelors, and then apply for OCS?


I'm going Navy enlisted, but I'd go officer in any branch. I'm 22 years old, so i'd be 26 at seperation, and 28 at bachelors graduation.

 The books doubled in page count after PoA.  




 They change the title in other regions? 




 And Harry Potter of course. Fantastic series. 




 Shit, can you even stomach the plane ride to Great Lakes? 




 Daddy I want a pony!! 




 Both of those are my favorites. 




 Can you explain this concept to me as if I was a five year old? 




 Shit, come to think of it, never have read a Compton book. 




 Currently taking a meteorology class and I realize that its a very interestingnsubject . Any fiction out there that deals with weather? Maybe hard conditions, or the stir of meteorologists? Thank you. 




 I dont know and i dont care. The Sun also Rises was the best book I read last year. Farewell to arms was tragically great as well 




 Because he saved soldiers from his side 




 I second your suggestion.
Might still be on sale at bn.com for $2.99 




 Nope, R rated Cody Banks looking film with an unknown actor as the protag.  Definite bomb. Dredd numbers for sure. 




 A prophet 









 Part of the reason? Its most of the reason. Most effective ad campaign I've ever seen. The trailer itself felt like a short film. 




 That's weird

I graduated at 18 and in summer months and they never said anything about it. 




 So when it bombs they're gonna blame the rating instead of the everything else. 




 I hate fantasy epics or "true" epics, like LOTR, Mummy films, Seventh Son, Troy, Hercules, Kingdom of Heaven.


When most of the people that die are random soldiers its hard to care. 




 "well if you insist Fox" 




 No one ever told me about how intensely absurd the minds inner monologue is during psychedelics.


I felt as if my thoughts weren't my own, and its really hard to describe past that. 




 Fuck YES!

I love when entertainment makes me feel. 









 It wouldn't be a reality show, it would be a scripted workplace comedy, like The Office or Parks and Rec. 




 I'd be willing to receive one of those copies 
























 At least you don't fly to places to fire people.


Watch Up in the Air 




 I enlisted into the Navy just for this reason. Haven't left yet tho, but I hope they didn't lie about the traveling. 




 I probably wont though right:/ what are we like 12 million square miles of area? I'm happy with just seeing a new place at least once a year.

Favorite place I've visited so far was Puerto Rico. I really want to visit the Pacific Northwest and Spain. So, where have you guys gone/where do you want to go?

Is anyone not really into it? I have a couple friends who think that their hometown is perfectly large enough to be explored during their whole lifetime. I dont really understand this type of thinking tho. 




 You have a ron Swanson username lol, way more over the top. I thought Titus was the right amount of "character" for how the show felt . 




 Why don't you wait to see of his job works out before doing anything? 




 Second time we did it she wasn't on her period and it was definitely better, but honestly the first time didn't feel gross for me. All I could think of was how I was getting laid.  




 She had her period and I didn't care, waited 19 years, didn't want to wait any more. It was a good time, probably didn't blow her mind, but it was good for both of us.

Overall the relationship was a huge waste of time though. 




 Lol saw this episode today 




 It will also make you feel hungry  




 He has a book coming out and the kinlde edition of thunderstruck has been on sale for only $1.99 last couple weeks. Also, isn't the NYT lost mostly bullshit? 




 Former pizza guy, glad you Re getting tipped well. The worst is when a wealthy person doesn't tip. Just doesn't make sense. 




 Not fantasy at all, but Stoner by John Williams is about a farm boy who goes to university and falls in love with academia. Its set in the early 1900's in the American south/mid west. 


Shit, when you say English. Do you mean England English? If so, forget what I posted. 




 Flash Boys by Michael Lewis, about a recent wall street trend.


Devil in the white city by Erik Larson, amazing book about the 1893 Chicago world fair, its construction and the serial killer living in the city at the same time. I just finished it a week ago and I find myself thinking about the time in which the story takes place a whole lot.


The Looming Tower by Lawrence Wright, not too heavy on narrative, sometimes it feels like an info dump, but a very well written and extremely well researched book on Al qaeda and the cia/fbi on the road to 9/11.  




 On episode six and this show is hilarious. I thought the trailer was horrible, but the show is so much better than expected. Its a mix of 30 Rock and Arrested Development. 




 Did aspergers exist before the internet? 




 Its a comedy show 




 Tell those girls you know what you just posted, trust me 




 I'm half way through Storm Front and not really enjoying it. Thank you for saving me some time. 




 Most Vonnegut 




 I've read three of his novels and enjoyed them all, but Michael Chabons "Adventures of Kavalier and Clay" seems very intimidating to me. Its about 600 pages and it won a Pulitzer. I feel like I'm going to judge it harder than I did his other books. What if my expectations are too high? What if Chabons style doesn't work past the 400 page novel? 




 Most important book series ever. Strong in popularity when for the first time ever books had to compete with the internet and video games. An entire generation of readers would have been lost if it weren't for harry potter.


Harry Potter 1, made me want to read Harry Potter 2, that led to 3, and eventually until 7. When I finished the series I said, what now? Now, all the other books. Any book. I just need more stories. Thank you Rowling! 




 The Sun Also Rises. Its more about the beautiful people in 1920's Europe though. Ots also a masterpiece. 




 Yes yes to The Stand and 11/22/63. The Stand specifically has a lot of character growth 




 That's not your fault though. Dont get pushed into something you don't want.  




 Wonder Boys by Michael Chabon. A pot head college professor gets to know a student,  and a lot of other stuff happens. 




 I read AG riddles first book from that trilogy and I skimmed the last 200 hundred pages (the whole second half). Honestly, I dont think it was a well written book, and this one you're reading isn't probably that great either. Just read a summary online of what happens at the end and move on to a better book 




 I have the same fears for myself. I dread that first week more than the whole commitment. 




 Tina Fey Bossypants

Adam Copeland "on Edge" (wrestling autobiography) 




 Besides the ratings system being a total joke, there are other ways to watch. 




 Lol is that a question mark 




 I saw the movie and it made me sad. Does the book add anything? 




 Lucky, I still have over 80 left 




 Really need to watch this one 




 How did you think those would be succesful 




 No you need a recruiter to make you appointments and prescreen you. 




 I'm reading Persepolis right now. Deals more with Islamic revolution than straight Cold War. 




 Great Lakes. I was lazy. But I ended typing it up anyways lol


Thanks for the ama! 




 How often do you get people completely backing out of shipping? Young 18 year olds suck at knowing what they want in life so I would be surprised if you said not many. 




 That $7,500 figure is that the cost of getting them to GL?  




 Haha, not really. Just a socially awkward depper 




 That makes sense. I'm socially awkward so I don't really speak to anyone in the meetings lol...

 




 I ship on 5/12! 

Have you ever been to r/raisedbynarcissists?  I thought my mom was one of a kind, but then I went to that subreddit and found that a lot of parents can be like that. 




 How long till you ship?


My mom cried in anger/sadness the second I called her and told her I swore in. She's more accepting now, but that initial reaction was horrible. 




 What's the point of DEP meetings? I've gone to four already and they all felt like a waste of time. Is it just another weeding out process? 




 The Stand, but I guess I'm confusing writing style for content. 




 There has to be a book like this. Right now a commercial for some vacation hot spot came on television, sandy beaches, drinks, and plenty women. So in my head I instantly went to that place I always go to: What if I took a vacation, and something went horribly wrong?


Is there any good novel in which a vacation goes horribly wrong? Murder, disaster, tragedy anything.

Thanks 




 For the physics or the entertainment? Cause it was entertaining 




 I wasn't even mad. I just told myself mad dog was a twin 




 Oh ok, makes sense. 




 With that degree you'd be dumb to Enlist. Why don't you try officer 




 I dont know much about that job, but from your post I can tell that you want to work on air planes. Question is, where do you want to work on airplanes? Navy has aircraft carriers and multiple Naval Air Stations. Air Force has only land bases. 




 I've read that sometimes new sailors have to do watch after the PIR. Is that true? 




 How was the medical screen during p days ?


What did you do after graduation, did you visit Chicago? 




 Yes, and I had to write some quick mini essays on what happened and why it will never happen again. Also had to speak with a head of recruiting over the phone explaining everything again so that he would aproove the waivers  




 Is it a misdemeanor or a citation? 

Because I got in with misdemeanors.. 




 Did you see any DQ's? 




 I know certain rates get different medical exams, so I'm just wondering about the regular rates, not seal/nuke/aircrew.

Is it just the same as MEPS? 




 I just remembered him as Brad Pitt 




 Who the fuck is Gerry 




 I love it so much, I think people dislike the non-linear storytelling, but I think its great that it did something different than other comic book films. 




 Kingsman really surprised here. They did start putting out better commercials recently, because the first trailer was straight up Cody Banks.


 




 Thank you. I will start squatting.

 Shit, Zuckerberg barely squeezes in, he was 24 when he became a billionaire. 




 Oh, haven't been there in years. Your description was basically Souhtland mall as well tho 




 Holy shit, are you talking about Southland Mall? 




 Whenever a film gives me the option to make my own ending I go with the positive one. I like to think he won the match, found Cassidy backstage and made out with her as she cried. They then move to jersey together. 




 Why the hell wouldn't they lol 




 Do it next time you have spare time.  




 Past glory, family relationships, and love. Watch it, trust me. 




 Sadness is a great emotion tho. Give it a chance. 




 Or "The Stripper". Marissa Tomei character is basically a female Ram. 




 Never heard of it, is it good? 




 Might be a lot of young guns here who never seen it, it came out in 2008, but The Wrestler is a very good film by a very well respected director, that everyone, fan of wrestling or not, should watch.


Movies about a legend working the independent circuit in high school gyms and similar venues. Best/only good film about pro wrestling. 




 Read 11/22/63. Trust me  




 i hear the door start dividing itslef open. ahhh, the fire departments here "help!!" 




 The movie is fantastic, but not realistic 




 definitely not. maybe it defines certain sub cultures, but not the whole generation.  




 Internal monolgue: was that a Mitch Hedberg joke?

 




 holy shit i didnt notice you, sorry 




 Sure! illl take some gum. ever been stuck in an elevator before? my first time 




 i imediately stomp the syringe and wonder if you will contine your attacks 




 i wave my hands around to see if you are still there 




 i throw my grocery bags at your face and reach to your syringe carrying hand 




 shit shit. *i try and remember if you look like a weirdo* "shit, hope they find us soon. Im luke btw" 




 in my head i wouldnt believe you. id feel like youre hiding the vodka from me. id call your bluff. "what type of soup" 




 something landslide? sorry, do you have cell reception?  




 do you have the bottle with you? 




 weve only been here for two minutes, cant you hold it. 




 Oh god what the hell 




 Um, no, why? 




 ***ring*** **ring** 

I took the initiative and rang the bell for help. I look towards you and say "damn this sucks" 

What happens next? 




 I feel like such a loser some days when on the previous night I binge watched something on netflix and my first thought during my wake up is "wheres the remote" 




 Any chance you're a hoarder? If you are, set up an eBay account. Sell some shit. 




 A second book. Education is very important. 




 Are their limits to distance traveled? Like if I'm stationed in Japan, can I go on leave to mainland USA? 




 I have never heard of ScholarlyYouth Letter Q 




 **The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, by Michael Chabon**

Good book so far, only a quarter in. Reminds me of The Goldfinch a bit more than it does other Chabon novels. So happy I discover Chabon about a year ago 




 I already set up my navy fed account, would I be able to link it to a credit card and have automatic payments using the RTC payment? 




 I did say thanks first.  




 Yea, grateful that he insulted my critical thinking skills and called me a pussy. Great moderating. 




 Well done. Verrrrry well done. I like the outside black and the inside brown, if there is even of hint of pink I wont eat.  




 The Shield is one of the best tv shows ever and Training Day is one of my favorite movies ever, but I have never read a novel about dirty/crooked cops. Any recommendations?  




 Its not on Netflix, but please, please watch The Shield. Also, Mad Men is a masterpiece work, but its not for everyone. 




 Reading this thread and I must wonder if people here have never tried cookies and cream before. 




 Lashes out? lol

 Have you seen the documentaries on the training before? Shits crazy, make sure you are beyond 'in shape', im in shape, but id end up ringing the bell within the first week. 




 Contract length questions, Navy.

How do sea/shore duty rotations work? Rate I'm going in to is 36/36, so what if I have a month left at a sea command but six months left total in my contract, would I have to go to a new shore command for only five months and then separate or would i just finish out my contract at the current command?  




 Going in as AG soon as an E3, contract is for 4/4 years, my A school is only a three or four months long and there is possibility of going to C school at around the third year of service mark. My questions are: 

Do the 9 months of C school count for the 36 month shore duty tour?

If I attend the C school with only a year left in my contract how much would I need to extend?

How strict are the 36/36 sea/shore rotations? what if I'm at the 35th month of a rotation and my contract is up six months, do I get sent to a new command for the last months of my contract or do I just spend the end of my career at that last command?

I'm reading a book right now and came across this quote, felt fitting for most of us here in DEP or about to do something new: "Forget about what you are escaping from, reserve your anxiety for what you are escaping to" Michael Chabon "The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay" 




 No way these type of things aren't done on purpose 




 Are there really "Hooters" (I think that's hoe you spell it) in PA? 




 The millionaire? 




 The keys are great, imagine driving through 100 or so islands to arrive to key west and drink all you want. Mucho seafood as well. Miami sucks imo. All there's is is night clubs and beaches and the people are horrible. 




 Please tell me Antarctica is on the list 




 I forgot what wanderlust meant so I Googled it, and it is now ky favorite word. 




 I'm in the halfway point between Miami Beach and the Florida Keys, a smallish city called Homestead. Only thing to see in homestead is the ghetto and then the mansions. Odd how there can be such a wide discrepancy in wealth just yards away from each other. Back when I was a pizza guy I would routine deliver to a run down apartment building and then a large mansion in a huge plot of land within only minutes of each other.


Honestly the only thing to do in Homestead is to hop on the turnpike and travel south or north. 
























 Just finished it, and yea that was hilarious. Plus the cameos! If you're a fan of new girl, watch! 




 I saw a trailer for this a year ago plus. Completely forgot about it till now, thank you. 




 I don't know:( Ive read so many, enjoyed so many...

Maybe The Stand? It was 1200 pages long and it never felt like it. Even books half that size start getting annoying. So,yea, I guess The Stand by Stephen King. 
 




 about how I have spent my day. I started off with a lot of activity but now im tired.

School 10-12

Gym 12-1

Shower

Now baseball.


I dont even like baseball 




 Quickest one to do it too 




 Thank you, already read The Goldfinch, but I didn't know Infinite Playlist was based on a book. Will read! Also, extremely loud sounds very familiar.  




 $90 million OW. $250 million domestic $780 million WW 




 It will definitely not surpass Furious 7.  




 I can see this. Maybe up to fifteen percent more.

 As a future AG, wow didn't know we could go to Germany. 




 Is PT3 good?  




 Well I'm glad the reccomendation got through.

Sometimes books are the best medium for story. Like, imagine that The Stranger was a movie. 

How would they show the things he thought?

They just wouldn't be able to.


I guess they could have him narrarate his feelings, but that's lazy. 

I guess, to understand the appeal of books, you have to read good books. Books that are special. And "The Stranger" is def special. 




 Did you end up reading the stranger? I remember being forced to read it in high school, and by the end, it didn't feel like I was forced. I loved it. Crazy that it was written so long ago 




 That guys never gonna be in a street fight 




 The Stranger by Albert Camus 




 The Stand. Post apocalypse the follows the chain of events extremely closely. 




 Not like they know her name anyways lol 




 Admitting to LSD I think is auto DQ 




 World War Z. Kinda. If you judge it as it if it wasn't based on a book then you'll enjoy it.  




 Amy Smart is so smart 




 That does make sense. The future hasn't happened so it is written yet. But what keeps fucking with me is that I already know where ill be in a month. In boot camp. So I've lived the last couple months knowing that I would be at a specific place.

Honestly, one of the reasons I signed up for the navy was for this very thing. I hated being in college. Not knowing what the future was gonna be like, but now I know that in two or three years ill be inside some navy ship doing my job. Before I signed up I had no idea. 




 I guess the future seems more appealing to me. The present is literally right now, and I'm on reddit, drinking beer and watching vobs burgers. This doesn't matter... Like, will I ever look back on this moment?  




 I need to get on that "less so". Its hard tho, right? 




 Wasting it. Idk, but I feel like everything I do is pointless because I'm leaving soon. So why do anything? Right now i met someone and it just feels pointless. Why get to know her? I'm gonna be leaving her soon, so what's the point?  




 Hmmm. Not sure if this is relevant to my post much, but I do write sometimes. Oddly enough, I write time capsule like summaries. Like, to myself. "on 4/2/15 I did this, and I was hoping too". I write these because I'm hoping ill find these amusing in ten years. 




 I cant help but constantly being in the future. Everything I do, is based on the future. Even this post. As I write it, I'm thinking of the replies and the red envelope.


When I talk to a girl, every little thing becomes a potential snowball. Hmm. She doesn't like action movies... So when we're married, how am I gonna watch new releases? 

I'm going to the navy soon, I knew about this eight months ago, and honestly, these months have passed by so quickly and I haven't accomplished anything else beyond waiting. All I do evry day is think about it. I lost eight months of my life. Just waiting.

I quit my job a year ago because I didn't want to be there my whole life.

I forget about the past because it happened already.

 Don't know if this is going to be long, but here we go.

Basically from what I've retained from secondary education, science documentaries and basic critical thinking I've come to accept evolution like this:

An animal or plant, whichever, mates with a compatible mate. Their offspring takes a little bit of each of the animals. They grow up to eventually have their own offspring. Somehow there is a mistake in the passing down of genes, and the offspring of this animal has brown fur. Peers of this animals find this unattractive and the animal doesn mate.

Generations later this mutation comes up again and this animal mates. passes down his mutation. Then that offspring moves away to a further tree by another river. Generations pass, and another mutation happens, larger feet. It gives this animal superiority, so he takes over. Suddenly generations later this tribe that moved away to this other river has brown fur and big feet, not like their black fur small feet having neighbors. The neighbors meet up at the big feet havers decide to kill the others. Now all animals of this species start carrying the brown fur and big feet genes.

I can keep typing but i guess that this is good enough, so do I understand evolution? 




 idk why downvotes, it felt like less time to me as well

 Good luck!

 I remember almost 7 years ago in ninth grade seeing on yahoo news the weekend box office results, I think it was I Am Legend that was on top, and ever since that I would check the box office every monday, eventually finding boxofficemojo and checking daily.

I dont even know why I care

 Yup. This franchise has been on an upward climb for years. It's not just the Ledger Effect. 




 xmas season box office is different, it isnt about blockbuster opening weekends, it is about amazing holds. 
domestic:

$115 million opening weekend (shattering previous record)

$80 million second weekend

$580 million final domestic gross.

International I have no idea. lets say, enough to get it to $1.7 billion WW total 




 If anything itll just mean a higher sunday 




 I agree, except the WW total, $1.68 billion 




 sometimes you do the whole thing at once, asvab, medical, swear in. But my process went: Speak to recruiter, take online pre-test, schedule real ASVAB at MEPS, take test, wait for results, then almost a month later I went in to take my medical and swear in. 




 "I am groot"

read it in any voice 




 Because the conservative party combined religious "morality" with financial "freedom". They prey on the weakminded. 




 We bout to see a dozen Riddick sequels 




 Lol, why call out Ron specifically? 




 Anyone could have played groot 




 You really must like westerns lol.

The Painter by Peter Heller was very enjoyable too. 




 Devil InThe White City is one of those books that deserves all its accolades. 




 The Road. I didn't want it to end. 




 Oh ok 




 What does your skin color have to do with anything? 









 So when I go to the gym, I look like a thug?


Thanks white people  




 Context clues man, obviously Avengers 2 is going to not be the least grossing MCU film
 




 I guess I just dont like his writing style. Read three pages of Survivor and you will understand what I mean. 




 Thats not what they said at all. You might be confusing their domestic predictions for worldwide numbers. 




 Not really young adult, but if you're looking for funny stuff about young people, read Tina Feys Bossypants. Yes she's forty years old, but the book is mostly about her youth. 




 To save everyone some time, dont read Palahnuik. Every book reads the same, all of them trying to recreate Fight Club. Just dont waste your time. 

Source, ive read Choke, Survivor and Fight Club 




 Thank you, you answered my second question perfectly 




 He said he went to seal school, he didnt say he passed 




 Civil War will be huge. Iron Man 3 numbers, maybe a little more. Depends on 2016's economy. 




 I'm from Florida and at the time hurricanes were a guaranteed yearly event, only those who lived through Andrew actually feared the storms. My question, among your classmates, family, friends, were hurricanes a thing to fear? Did the general populace actually know how distructive the things can be? 




 Nope. I say: 90 percent of the firsts gross.

Reasons: I dont think it will be good, the trailers them selves dont scream "must watch" if anything, people are watching just because they've seen the eight other marvel films.

The first one made a lot of money.

A lot.

Many things had to go right for it to go like that, and I dont see those same things happening again.

One thing that might prove me wrong, there's no competition. Mad Max ain't doing shit to Avengers, so it will have some time to gross freely.

 




 I thought that was the usual strategy when it came to things like this. 
























 Night Film by Marissa Pessl is a must read. Well, specifically if you are also a fan of cinema.  




 Yes, I knew 48 hours before pir 




 For some reason scenes from "The Painter" by Peter Heller always come to my mind. I'll be driving or something and I'll just think back on this book. I've read dozens of books after it, most were more memorable, yet I still think back on it. It's a good book, don't get me wrong but it shouldn't have stuck with me. 


How bout yall? 









 I feel that it will be an extremely lose adaption. Especially if they're going for a trilogy. 




 2040 looks right too me 




 I really wanted to be a Loadmaster :(  




 Nice link. Sister just started a PR internship, shed read this. 




 If you're in it for a high salary, military ain't the right place. Look at officers salaries, they aren't that competitive to real world STEM jobs. Plus, dont you basically need a STEM degree to get commissioned? 




 Doesn't look even close to worth it. 




 I think its an editing joke 




 Doesn't even matter. The more people that watch Chappelles stand up, the better the world will be  




 Nice post yo. 




 Its a horror film 




 Its about Sofia Vergara and Reese Witherspoon competing to see who could be the most annoying. 




 Winter Soldier is better, in my opinion at least. GotG had a really really shitty villain. Sure, the buildup was great, but the point of there union was shitty. Who was even the villain? I dont remember. 




 I cant decide between them two 




 I own this and I love it 




 Season 2 needs to happen already 




 It is too weird. I dont see it connecting with most people.  




 Thanks everyone, just gonna study at the hotel and airplane ride. 




 Im going in E3 so yea, ill just learn the orders. 




 How about ranks? Is it really necessary to memorize those before going in? I think I know the sailor creed already, DEP meeting singing put it in my mind. 




 Haven't opened my START book because I would rather just learn all of it at Great Lakes. Am I right in thinking that I can go unprepared and still succeed? I mean, I'll study on the plane I guess. Just don't want to spend my last days as a civilian studying. 




 My prediction: opening dom $35 million 

final $105 million

international i have no idea 




 Sounds like she has mental problems. Hopefully she gets help 




 Yea I was really really wrong 




 You might as well mention it. I luckily had a doctor perform a pulmonary function test on me a couple years ago that I passed perfectly, so I just had to bring that proof in, but I'm all good. 




 This is some saiyan shit. Come to the brink of death, survive, find yourself more powerful than ever before. 




 The movie cant be seen live, but the fight is better if watched live. makes sense that many took a gamble on it. 




 I loved it.  




 I cant decide between Sirens of Titan and Cats Cradle 




 There were also a lot of college graduations going on. This was an eventful weekend. I missed the fight and the clippers game just to watch Avengers. My priorities are different lol 




 I say you're correct. $135 mill opening with only 30% drop 




 That guy must be so happy he supported his wife's hobby  




 Why don't you just ask daddy to buy you some money? 




 Anectodal evidence of course, but I left my theater today at around 12:30 am and streets were empty. I hung out at my friends house for a bit and on the way home there was a lot more cars, around 2 am, so a lot of people were watching this fight. Movie was awesome btw. The reviews made me lower my expectations, and I wasn't blown away, but it was a great 2.5 hours. Better than furious 7 




 So should movies just have blank spaces in spots where brands would normally appear? Honestly how is complaining about product placement still a thing. I hold a Nokia phone in my hand and Scott toilet paper behind me. If I was in a film these would be visibly present, yet not integral to the storyline. They're just there. Dont worry about it. 




 OP listen to this. 

Also OP, do you qualify for a Top Secret clearance? 




 My predicitons are pretty close to yours. Good analysis.

Only three I would change, Minions, Ted and Inside Out. I think you overestimate Minions and Inside Out. Ted 2 I can see hitting $200. 

And yea, Mad Max is gonna crawl to $100 slower than Edge of Tomorrow.   




 I regret not going immediately after high school.

Questions: Can you afford college?

Do you care if you arent an officer?

How bad do you want to leave your current hometown?

What job would you like in the military?

What degree would you persue in college?

Do you know about the GI Bill? 




 America post cynicism  




 That novel is literary vacation. 




 The Stand by Stephen King is similar in that it deals with multiple parts of an apocalypse. 




 So about the same as the first one. Yall that were saying $300 mil were fucking crazy 




 Yea ill ask there thank you. I usually frequent those subreddits anyways. 




 If its good: Yay!


If its bad: I dont care!


Book will always be the same. A great short thrill to read  




 Honestly feel like cancelling on my friend :/ we were gonna watch Avengers 2 sat before the fight. Now I have a game 7 to watch 

what to ddooooo 




 I'd settle for just being a billionaire honestly 




 That  southern lovin 




 I wish I was him. 




 Watch WrestleMania. It was great 




 Going to Navy bootcamp in May, and I want Bernie as my future president. Last election I wasnt much involved but I feel like it will be necessary this time. I will most likely not be stationed in my home state of Florida, so I will be a mail in. Do primaries allow mail in? Am I even allowed to participate in a campaign while on active duty? 

Thank you 




 Ive read three from King, got a couple of his i still want to read. Adding it 




 Whats there to catch up on? The good guys are good and the bad guys are bad. 




 theres a new star wars?!!?!? 




 I was soooo wrong on this one. It looked like a bomb to me. Second trailers did help a lot. 




 My advice, talk to a recruiter as soon as possible. I signed my contract seven months ago and I still have a couple weeks left to ship. Its a process. 




 I've had that on my list for a while 




 That sounds interesting, title? 




 La Sombra del Viento has me in mid 20 century Spain.

Blood Meridian has me in mid 19th century Tex/Mex.

I would much rather be in Spain though.

So, where do your books have you? Space? A labyrinth?

Why's no one posting titles?  




 I say $210 million. Those presales are surprising me.
