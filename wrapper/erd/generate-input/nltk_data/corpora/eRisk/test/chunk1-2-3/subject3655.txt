 Yeah I was about to say, there's no way you've gotten to college yet. 




 Ah, I was indeed loosely misinterpreting the thread. 




 Um, what were you thinking? Every username I typed in was already taken so my friend said "Just stop, man" So...what exactly were you thinking? 




 Really? Can't that fuck up your teeth? 




 Where is 'snog' used as a word for that? Unless it means something else and I'm wildly misinterpreting this whole thread. 




 Wait...

 My wife knows none of this.

 Not only is this a repost, but its already been reposed in this post's comments twice. Repostception. 




 How much? 




 Blind people of Reddit, how the fuck are you on Reddit? 




 THAT WAS YOU??? 




 Dear lord, should have made a throwaway... 




 No...but...haven't you seen South Park? 




 Good god man, get a hold of yourself! 




 What exactly do you use this account for?

Hence the 'Dallas Diddler'? 




 That seems...excessive. 









 Lets make a thread. I'll start with '1' and the next person choses 2 and 3 and so on. We're coming for you, daddydean...

 Any reason for the chair in the locker? Nice jersey too, but in my mind the chair mystery is really stealing the show right now. 




 Either [Save Tonight] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nntd2fgMUYw) or [Away and Anywhere] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXBjn2s8ofQ). Its weird, they both calm me down and get me pumped up at the same time. No idea how to explain it.

 No, probably not. 




 There was a joke in 'The Interview' that says somthing along the lines of "Don't shake his hands, hes a Jew" I saw the joke coming and realized that the three other people me and my friend were watching it with were very Jewish. Not just a little Jewish. Anyways the joke comes along and my friend lets lose the loudest laugh of the entire movie. He claims it wouldn't have been awkward if anyone else laughed, but no one did. It was awkward as fuck. 




 I just saw you answered today, but reading this shit really isn't worth my time. To be honest I can't believe your still going down swinging about all this, you were wrong a long time ago. Are you incredibly stubborn, or do you really have nothing better to do than keep arguing online in this sad lonely life of yours? Probably both I suppose. Anyhow, its getting too tiring correcting you countless mistakes and inaccuracies, so log off and go away. You gave it a good shot, but you lost. By a lot. By the way, the log off button is on the upper right side of the screen. I know how fragile your mind is and wouldn't want you to have a brain aneurysm trying to find it.

 Not an 'official' word? Sorry Dr. Seuss, but there's no such thing as an 'official' word, there are words and there are letters put together in groups. You yourself provided an excellent example of this, 'commenter' I believe you called it. I suppose though, if you really want to use your 'unofficial' language, I can direct you to what I like to call ['The Dictionary of High School Dropouts'] (http://www.waywordradio.org/Official_Dictionary_of_Unofficial_English-Grant-Barrett-0071458042.pdf), even in there though I don't think you'll find 'commenter'.

Also, it's a good barometer to see when someone is losing an argument when they stoop to nitpicking word usage.

A barometer is a meteorology device, not an standard by which to measure debates. See what I did there? Probably not. Anyhow do you know what nitpick means? It means to be excessively concerned with or critical of inconsequential details. So are you saying that your looking up the definition of your fake word wasn't nitpicking? Are you saying the defining an already meaningless word and proving its nonexistence wasn't nitpicking? Because either you just used the word nitpicking wildly incorrectly, or you yourself nitpicked, which-by your own admission-is the sign of someone (in this case you) losing an argument. So which is it? Are you wrong *again* or are you losing the argument? Now that I think about it, I suppose it could easily be both.

As for irony, I said it because you have repeatedly said I lack intelligence, when it is clear to even the untrained eye that it is in fact you who is the real unintelligent fool.

The only thing I can say about this sentence is that it is the most grammatically fucked up thing I've seen in a long while.

It was getting embarrassing, I'm glad you saw that. I still can't believe you thought a defensive player was one of the Patriots top recivers! Truly pathetic. The good news is, you've admitted you embarrassing blunder and can move forward with a new lesson learned.

If you really want to pick back up your retarded football talk I'm more than willing, you just seemed to be falling behind. A debate is no fun when I need to keep going back to explain things to you. In fact, I didn't even read your last comment on football. I can only assume it was filled with factual and grammatical errors and inaccuracies. Not that I expected any more from you. Tell me, do people always have to dumb it down for you, or only when your talking about football and other subjects you've barely even heard of? Grammar for example. 




 So my comment is gone, not sure why, maybe it was deleted. I needed to used some truly harsh language to capture your personality and intelligence quotient, I can't help but think the mods didn't appreciate that. Or maybe they could see you were losing you battle by a landslide and decided to put you out of your misery. Either way, here's no way in hell your worth typing that out a second time (or even a first time for that matter, I guess I was just feeling nice :), your welcome). So I guess your just not getting an answer unless the mods give it back. Sorry to disappoint, I know how much you love getting proven wrong. Why else would you say such stupid things?? A tout a l'heure.

EDIT: Nah, I need to put you out of your misery myself. Its the least I can do for such an unfortunate child such as yourself-tell me, how was it to grow up without an education? I'll respond later, but I'm sure you won't like it. If you're asking for it though, fine by me. 









 Your the best! 




 Amendola was brought in to replace Welker, who had 1000 yard seasons with over 100 catches. Amendola wasn't even close to those numbers.

If you think that Bill Belichick tried to replace Wes Welker with Danny Amendola your a bigger idiot than I thought. He brought in a new receiver, period. Why wouldn't you call Donald Jones Wes Welker's replacement? Or Aaron Dobson? Or Josh Boyce? Or Michael Jenkins? Or Jake Ballard? Because they all came in when Welker left, so why is the burden supposed to lie on Danny Amendola? That's some retarded logic your're trying to argue with. Just because they came in at the same time, they must be trading off rolls? If anything, Juilian Edleman is Wes Welkers 'replacement'. Not sure why you thought Amendola was.

He has 3 good games in 2 years. I think your definition of great is a little off.

If you think he's only had three good games in two years, well your already a bigger idiot than I thought. Your a bigger idiot than the bigger idiot I thought you were before? Eh, its redundant, I'm sure you and your general lack of intelligence will prove me wrong again. As for Amendola, he hasen't played much more than three games. Obviously not three whole games, that's not the way Bill Belichick plays his players. He takes them for a reason, for example Blount's power running on third downs or Gonkowski's inside routs in the red zone. He plays them for specific plays, not all of them. The way you keep talking seems like you think every player plays every snap. If you ran an NFL team, dear god they'd be in trouble. This isn't something I should have to explain to you, literally team does this, it's a very easily comprehended part of football. Try to keep up.

That is one of the worst comparisons I have ever seen. I appreciate the try, but goddamn dude, you need to learn how to make an argument.

See, this is why your worse at making an argument than I am. You don't respond to what I said, you respond to the way I said it. Who gives a shit how I said it? My underlying thesis doesn't change, but unfortunately you missed that because you didn't like 'my comparison'. Was my point weather or not a comparison was good? No. Then why do you feel the need to waste time going off on a pointless tangent? Maybe it's because you don't have an answer, so you're changing the subject. Hope not, that would just be depressing. I hope your keeping notes, it might be good for you to know how to carry on a debate some day.

Nope, not even close. It was a counterpoint to you? saying that Brady makes all his receivers great. Rookies or not, they under performed.

Since when is 466 yards and 4 touchdowns in your first season in the NFL 'under-preforming'? And Dobson did even better, 519 yards and 4 touchdowns. Obviously its not something you'd want to see out of a third or fourth year player, but first?? That's not under-preforming, hell he could have been sitting on the bench as a back up and he wouldn't have been under-preforming as a rookie. Get your head out of your ass, these are some very solid rookie years. Go ahead, disagree with that. I didn't think your stupidity was expanding but you've surprised me before.

Are you seriously basing your entire argument that Tom Brady can make anyone look like a star, on one comment from Christain Fauria?

Ha! You made me actually laugh out loud, that's rich! Every time you say something it seems I think 'Wow, I didn't think he could prove himself any more of an idiot, but I'll be damned, I was wrong'. Of course I'm not basing an argument off of Christain fucking Fauria-do you even know who that is?? I did however use his quote as a source to support my argument. Debate 101, maybe you should take it. Jesus Christ this is exhausting trying to get through to people like you. Going back and explaining every sentence is like talking to a six year-old. Literally.


By the way, mentioning Matthew Slater was a test to see if you have any idea what your talking about. Clearly you don't. Slater plays DEFENCE. Didn't catch that.

Did I need to?

YES, YOU SHOULD FUCKING KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OFFENCE AND DEFENSE. How can you even try to carry on a debate about football when you don't know the two?? Its not a mind game at all, but rather a very simple and transparent test to see of you have any idea what your taking about or not. Turns out, your full of shit. I still can't believe that you argued against me by saying a defensive player has bad reviving yards. That's more than pathetic.

You think you are some witty commenter with all the right comments, but you haven't even come close to anything right this entire time.

Nice. No seriously good one, give yourself a pat on the back for that zinger. And it would even make sense too if 'commenter' was a word and if it was the least bit true. *You're* the one I have to keep correcting, and you don't even seem to understand half the shit your saying. It's come to the point where I've considered leaving you to your blissful yet idiotic ignorance, but I'm a charitable person, I keep returning to educate you. Push you luck though and your going to end up one very moronic 'football expert'. Even saying that sarcastically insults the real moronic football experts of the world, your much worse than that. You were right about one thing though, Matthew Slater is not a very good receiver. 




 Okay so I guess you officially give up on what this entire debate was about in the first place, I'll put one in the win column and move on to what ever asinine point you want to debate next.

Your whole argument is flawed, because its based on the point that I'm somehow defending the Patriots in this whole ball-deflation thing. I'm not. At all.

What I am defending however this the just system of due process. So until there is an official statement from the NFL announcing 'the Patriots cheated' no, I do not call that cheating. Why you ask? First of all the sources that supply this information are rarely sound. The guy that announced this whole deflation issue in the first place said that the Patriots used illegal balls and equipment. Clearly this was a very distorted image of the truth, and if is these people were relying upon, we can't take anything they say for anywhere close to certian.

Second, well...do you even know how game process works with regards to the game balls? They are delivered to the stadium where they are opened by a sealed container *by the referees* where they are marked *by the referees* to prevent someone from replacing them. Then they are filled with air *by the referees* and measured *by the referees* who's responsibility it is to take care of them until game time. The only time the footballs are under the control of one of the teams is on the field during the game. You might say 'Well ha! Got you! The Patriots probably deflated the balls just before or during the game!' but you'd be wrong. Inflating and deflating the game balls requires equipment that is simply not available on the field. Anyone seen taking 12 footballs to a machine pushed off to the side would clearly be seen, if not in person than on video. The only other way to deflate them would be to take a knife to the footballs. Probably not what happened. My point is that there is almost no chance for the teams to get a hold of the balls to somehow alter them before the game. There is a very good chance that there was an error made by someone employed by the NFL (probably a referee) that brought the footballs down two pressurized pounds.

My point was never that messing with the game balls wasn't cheating, my point was that there is a lot left unsaid and that even if the Patriots were found to be 100% guilty, it would still be a non-issue. 




 LaFell was already a good receiver? Does that make Danny Amendola a good receiver? Because last year when LaFell was 'already good' he got 627 yards. Danny Amendola, who 'isn't even doing decent' got 633 yards last year. So which is it? Was he 'already good' or was Amendola not only on par with him but arguably better? Get your facts straight and stop contradicting yourself, it's exhausting cleaning up someone your messes.

And Danny Amendola hasn't under preformed at all, in fact when he's on the field he's been doing great. Unfortunately for him though, he's gone almost completely unused. How can you say he's under-preforming when he doesn't play? That's like saying jimmy Garoppolo (Brady's backup) sucks because he only got 100 yards. The person expecting him to get more yards is the idiot in this scenario, not the other way around.

As far as the rookies go, care to name them just to be sure were all on the same page? I think we are for the most part but I wouldn't want us to be addressing completely separate people. Who says their best isn't minimal numbers though? Is your point that rookies can't suck? Just because they're drafted doesn't mean they're good by any means. Unless they're a first or early second round pick, it only means that they could potentially have potential, there is no where close to a guarantee that they are good.

But hey! Guess what! You got something right! Michael Hoomanawanui (for future reference, that's how you spell it) doesn't have good numbers. You know why I chose him? I chose him very deliberately. I chose him because my point was that Brady can turn anyone into a star. Christian Fauria said, and I quote, "These people don't know his name yet, but Tom Brady's making him look like a star out there tonight". My point was never that Hoomanawanui had thousand yard seasons, to be honest I don't even know where you got that from. Keep your eye on the ball 'corby'.

By the way, mentioning Matthew Slater was a test to see if you have any idea what your talking about. Clearly you don't. Slater plays *DEFENCE*. Didn't catch that? He has one recorded reception *EVER*. And you think I'm the one that failed, ha! You have the entire internet at your disposal, but even that wasn't enough to get your head out of your ass. But hey, nice job 'shutting me down'. Don't worry corby, you'll get em' next time.



EDIT: Sorry, I couldn't bear giving you that false hope at the end. Sorry corby, but you actually probably won't get em' next time. Maybe if you lose the suborn ignorance and your debate is against an idiotic five year-old you'll win one, but even then I'm not 100% sure. 




 I'll take your slight redirction as a full surrender. As I was saying, non-issue. But if you don't have any response to what I said before, I understand. Now you can either admit defeat, come up with a reasonable counterpoint (good luck) or try to desperately change the subject. *Again*. 




 Can you make this but with Revis in black and white? That would look dramatic as fuck, please! 




 You can creep on me if you want. Curious of what my internet preception is. 




 You meaning me? No, I didn't break any rules. Not sure why your addressing me personally.

If you mean 'the Patriots didn't break the rules' no, that's not what I'm saying at all-did you even read what I said? What I'm saying is that the entire ball deflation thing is a non-issue. Clearly regardless of what happened didn't change the outcome of the game, hell they could have been playing with Nerf footballs and it wouldn't have changed the outcome of the game, but there are many more 'issues' in the NFL that are getting ten times less attention just because the teams involved aren't headline attention grabbers.

In summary, there are many issues and non-issues in the NFL, this falls under the non-issue category. 




 Really? Again? Matthew Slater, Brandon LaFell and Michael Hoomanawanui to name a few.

To be honest I can't tell if your making my point about Danny Amendola or not. My point is Ameldola has been doing decent considering how much time hes spent actually on the field, but all in all he's not a very good receiver (which anyone who knows anything about Danny Amendola is aware of), and that Tom Brady doesn't have much to work with with regards to a receiving core...which you confirmed for me as if you were some how proving me wrong by supporting my point... Whatever.

And my point about the rookies is we can't tell if they're better under Tom Brady or not because we haven't seen them under any other circumstances. How the hell would we know if Tom Brady brings out their best if we haven't seen them with any other quarterbacks? For all we know, that *is* their best.

Do *you* know what your talking about? Because it certainly doesn't seem like it when I have to spell everything out for you. 




 Okay, you want to talk about really cheating? 'Flat out cheating'? Blow-deflated-footballs-out-of-the-water cheating?

http://phins.com/chris/column_050908.html

Is that not enough? I'll dig out more if you have another 'counter point' but the fact is that people simply don't care if the teams involved aren't winning. Period. If not, explain to me why the Patriots were the only team that got any attention for taping other teams when others were caught doing the same exact things and then some? And why are people still talking about it despite more recent scandals with even more definitive proof involving other teams? Because they aren't winning, so it must not be news. 




 Amendola is doing decent, and the two rookies are rookies. My point is he brings out the absolute best potential in his players and has the ability to make even a bad receiver look like a star. I'm not saying they're all bad receivers by any means, but he makes them look a hell of a lot better. 




 Wow, last year but same people! I would love to have that job every season... 




 The Jets got caught recording opponent's signals a year before SpyGate, did anyone care? No. The Raiders were known for over inflating footballs beyond their legal limit (as are the Packers apparently), does anyone care now? Nope. The Lions ran multiple deceptive plays where they threw to a lineman as an eligible receiver *this year*, did anyone bat an eye?? No one.

Apparently there are many "non-issues" going on, just involving poor franchises. They've all been caught but did you hear about it? Nope. Did you hear about it before there was even an ounce of proof that the Patriots did it? Absolutely.

If the NFL is willing to catch and release like that its clearly a non-issue. Just because a big team supposedly does what the little teams are doing shouldn't make it any more or less of an issue. They've all been caught, but no one cares until a winning team might be involved. If it's an issue, than the little teams should be addressed just as harshly by the NFL and the media as the big teams. If not, then it's simply a not an issue. 




 I don't know, I really like [NFL on CBS] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idNhIdw2Bpo).

EDIT #2: How did I forget [March Madness] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhC5-uIJJWQ)?!! 




 Even though Tom Brady didn't have the records the past few years, I still think hes the best. I mean most great quarterbacks have an arsenal of receivers to chose from to make their stat sheet look good, not Brady. Who does he have this year? The list starts and ends with Rob Gronkowski. Everyone else is decent to average. Despite this, Tom Brady makes them look good. Brandon LaFell? Matthew Slater? Even Julian Edelman? These guys aren't stars by any means, but under Tom Brady everyone is turned into a dangerous weapon. Even when he doesn't have a team, Tom Brady takes them to the playoffs every year. Literally, every. Singe. Year. That's why hes the best. Well, one of the reasons. 




 Thats a big *IF*. Where do these allegations come from anyways? Did a Colts fan decide Sunday night "45-7? Must be trickery! Get Roger on the phone!" The media's reception of sports scandals always reminds me of the Salem witch trials. Someone is accused of something and then with out a trial or so much as proof suddenly they're guilty. Maybe I should accuse Russel Wilson of greasing Barndon Bostick's gloves (hes the guy who dropped that onside kick), just to even the playing field. 




 You still want New England?? 47-7... If I were you I would want a win, not a risk.

 Even with the tags, I don't think you should post stuff like this unless you specify how gigantic a spoiler it is in the title or until it at least happens in the show.

 For some reason the contractor that designed my house put the door bell in the bathroom. I've had many an electrician try to fix it, but apparently the single wire going from my front door to the bathroom is absolutely vital to the structural integrity of the entire house. I wouldn't mind the door bell, its usually not that bad when your not in the bathroom. When you are though...you know how you jump out of your seat when theres a BANG! in a scary movie? Similar concept, very different end result. Its come to the point where Im scared to shit in my own home. This house has taken the most basic of human rights from me...

Ive been collecting it for a few years now, very proud of what I have so far. I have a few more Im working on finishing that are missing a few autographs. Anyone know Kirk Hammett? Ive been trying to track him down since 2008...

 Singers make songs all the time that claim they've done drugs, stolen, assaulted, etc. yet no one ever gets arrested for that. And in Anthony Keidis' (Red Hot Chili Peppers singer) autobiography he talks about a life full of illagal drug and substance abuse, yet he's probably never even been questioned by the police (well...). Hell theres videos on Youtube of Wiz Khalifa smoking weed! I'm pretty sure though that if I was caught with a recording or self-written note admiting to any type of crime that I would be arrested on the spot, so why aren't they?

EDIT: I don't necessarily want to see any of these people prosecuted, I'm just curious why they arn't.

 It almost sounds like you're talking about the [Immigrant Song] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66ChMPV0LTg)... 









 I read that line over *way* too many times. I figured this was published on a fairly respected tech blog, so it must be me who's doing something wrong. 




 This is going to get burried, but to me its by *far* [Quixoticelixer] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bCQeE2L3ISI) by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The best b-side EVER. Seriously, good can an album be to shave off a song like this? 




 I wrote both of them well after. 




  nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I hadn't planned on writing a follow up to [this] (http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2w8arl/the_window_washer/), but a few people asked what happened to me next. So here it is.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I read the message again. And again. And again I didnt want to believe what it said. Maybe I had misread it? Or misunderstood it? No, no it was much too simple to be misconstrued. He was coming after me.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I forced myself to snap out of it and ran over to the lifts console. I quickly pushed the lever up and waited as the lift lazily crawled upwards. I would have gone down if I could, but these kinds of machines only go down to the 14th floor. Going up was the only option.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I couldnt help but to cringe at the leisurely speed of the lift. One Chase Plaza is only 60 stories tall, but I still had a dozen to go. I found myself nervously glancing at the railing on the roof to see if he had made it. So far so good. 49th floor...50th floor Ten left.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I tried to get the attention of anyone working in the building, but most had already left by now. I got the attention of a janitor, but he just smiled and waved to me, oblivious to my peril. I didnt give up. Every floor I passed I pounded on the glass and yelled at the top of my lungs.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;51...52...

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I glanced back up and froze. There he was. Looking over the railing smiling down at me. I reached towards the console to stop the lift but he laughed and shook his knife like a finger saying no. Then he ran over to the turbine collecting the wire that was hauling up the lift. To my horror, he started hacking and stabbing at, breaking the wires one thread at a time. He started panting between his hysterical laughs. *This man is a monster!*

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; I had never been more scared of anyone in my entire life. Every few hacks would send a jolt through the entire lift, it started to tilt like a ship taking on water. I moved to the raised end completely helpless. I needed to get to the roof to get off of the failing lift, but doing that forced me closer toto him. I looked down in terror at the streets below. Should I jump? Should I end things on my own terms? I shuddered, and reached for the console.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;He must have seen me because he let out a scream like no noise I had ever heard before. Nooooooo! he hissed.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I looked up just in time to see him lose patience with the wires. He reached for the railing and launched himself over, hurling knife first at me. I yelled and dove towards the lowest part of the lift. He missed, but just barely. The entire structure shuddered under the impact. Before I knew it he was back on his feet and charging at me. I backed up until I could feel the cold metal railing behind me, I had no where to go. Like the woman had been in her office, I was trapped.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;In a final act of desperation I jumped into the air and slammed myself down as hard as I could onto the failing lift. The cables buckled under the pressure and nearly snapped. It sent a shockwave through the lift and sent us both off our feet. I expected it though and grabbed on. He didnt. His feet went out from under him and sent him down onto his face. The knife flew out of his hands and skidded towards me.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;There was no time to think. I grabbed the knife and ran over the man. 59...60. Yes! I jumped over the roofs railing and turned to face the man, knife in hand. For the first time he wasnt smiling at me, the expression on his face was one of shock. Then it turned to anger. He began to scramble to his feet screaming. I ran to the wire coil and looked back at him. ILL KILL YOU! he screamed. That was all the motivation I needed. I swung the knife as hard as I could at the weakened wire.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;For a second I thought I hadn't cut through it, but then I heard a series of loud popping noises and a section of the lift lurched downwards. The cable snapped and the other chords began to pop one by one. Every time the lift dropped a few more feet he laughed harder and harder until the weight was too much to bear. The remaining cables snapped and the lift fell into the open air. He laughed hysterically the whole way down...

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I was stunned. I almost couldnt move, the knife fell from my hands and followed the man to the ground. I didn't wait around for it to hit the sidewalk though, I couldnt bear to watch. I got myself together and walked back to the elevator. I got some looks for my torn up and battered uniform, but I didnt care. On my way out I asked a concierge to call the police, which she did without hesitation after she got a look at me.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I stepped out the front door and saw the lift immediately to my left. It had landed partially on top of a parked town car, but no one seemed hurt. I looked back up at where the lift had fallen from, broken cables were swaying in the breeze. A crowd was slowly gathering around the lift, and I was pushed inwards closer to it. Thats when I realized something truly alarming, I hadn't seen the man's body yet. A chill rushed through me as my eyes darted across the lift looking for something, anything. I forced myself to walk onto it. I needed to know it was over for good, I needed to know he was dead. I didn't find him though, I found the last thing I ever wanted to see: another note.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I picked it up, it was almost identical to the one he left on the window. It was beaten up and covered in drops of blood. I read it. *No* I read it again. *He couldnt have*

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Between tears and blood stains in the paper the message read:

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;You should have kept the knife

 No I got the point with the "they can't understand complex sentence structure" but it just goes way too far. 




 Um, well I would say you should probably finish reading before you comment next time. Besides though, aren't comments like these not allowed? 




 Thanks dude, that means a lot. 




 Haha I thouht that a few seconds after I wrote it but by then it seemed vital to the storyline. Not really, but that was the excuse I used to keep it in. 




 Please repot back after you ask, I think we would all like to know. 




 Oh no, an incomplete jump. It seems as if he didn't even try until he was almsot the quarters of the way there. 




 I smell a Giants fan...care to weigh in, OP? 




 Its so inorganic it makes it a little painful to read. The best way to sound smart in writing is to only use words you actually use when you speak. If you want to write using fancy words, expand your vocabulary.

vendor of fuel and complex carbohydrates.

Its called a gas station, a petrol station if your British. This is the other thing that bugged me, don't go out of your way to sound smart. It's completely condescending and it makes you look desperate. 




  nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I am the man who washes your windows. Well, I am at least if you work at One Chase Manhattan Plaza. Every day, five to five, Im outside on my lift washing windows. Window by window, floor by floor, Monday through Saturday. I know what you're probably thinking, but its not all that bad. I like to work outside, and the pay is very reasonable. And when the weather gets bad or dangerous were required to stay inside but still get paid! Score!

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I began today as I do most every other day. I walk in the front door, take the industrial elevator all the way to the roof, and prepare my lift for a days work. After I make sure everything is safe and sound I start maneuvering the metal-death-basket over the side of the building. No matter how many times I do this, it will never cease to scare the living shit out of me. There is something about stepping off the edge and putting all of your life in the hands of a machine that you can never quite get used to. And on top of that, the only tiny holding you up is four tiny chords. If even one snaps, the whole thing is going down. But I try not to think about that. Once I'm actually out there I'm usually fine.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;When the hard part is over, I drop down to the 20th floor or so and then work my way back up. The lift is slow, and a peaceful long ride is a nice way to wake up.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Under normal circumstances I would have a partner up here with me, but weve been a little understaffed lately. By lately, I mean the past four months. New workers were supposed to be hired to fill the open spots, but the building manager has yet to find anyone suitable for the job. In other words, he doesn't want to pay for any more staff members and is putting it off for as long as possible. Technically that breaks a quite a few safety violations, but I dont mind. Its kinda nice to be alone out here.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;This kind of job can be pretty interesting too. Being a window washer gives you an unavoidable glance into the lives of 100 or so corporate employees on a daily basis. Whether they want me to or not, I get a front row seat to everything happening in their offices. On multiple occasions Ive seen employees sleeping, doing drugs, fist fighting, even fucking (sometimes a few at the same time). Ive even seen more than one example of corporate fraud. Employees always think if their desks face away from the door their privacy is being protected from wandering eyes, but in reality its the window they should be worried about.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Today actually turned out to be pretty boring though. For the most part, people either werent in their offices, or were doing actual work. How mundane. As I pulled up to the 47th floor the sun was already setting and people were going home. When I least expected it though, I stumbled upon something interesting. On the 47th floor there was an older woman shouting at some poor guy who had clearly royally fucked up. Her expensive looking suit implied she was some sort of executive, while his loose fitting dress shirt and pants made him look like a green intern. It was getting pretty intense in there, I could hear the muffled curses and threats through the glass. The man just stood there though and took what was coming to him. No matter how much she yelled and shouted, he would just stare back blankly. It was almost freaky how emotionlessly he was handling the situation.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;The man eventually left the office and the woman sighed and returned to her desk. She noticed me for the first time then, and sent me a wry smile. I thought she would be happy to take some pent up anger out on an intern, but she didnt seem to enjoy the shouting any more than he liked being shouted at. What a terrible situation, truly a lose lose for everyone. I did my best to ignore her and keep washing the windows.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Suddenly there was another commotion in her office. The intern had returned, but this time he was the one yelling at his boss. She was clearly caught off guard, as evident by the shocked look on her face. *You idiot* I thought, *you were in the clear, shes going to fucking fire you now!* Suddenly he stopped talking and turned around to shut the door. He kept his back turned for a while, I could see the woman tilting her head to try to see what he was doing. He twisted his head towards her and smiled. Then he turned to reveal what it was he had been concealing. A huge metal knife.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I suddenly found myself paralyzed with fear. I had seen a lot through these windows, but nothing like this. Even though I was outside there was only two inches of glass between me and this psychopath. The sudden turn of events caught me completely off guard and left me almost too shocked to react. I cant even imagine how the poor woman inside must have felt. She screamed and jumped out of her chair in a helpless attempt to defend herself. It didnt do much. He rushed her, wildly screaming and swinging as he charged forward. He never stopped smiling.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;She had nowhere to run, he quickly caught her. A fine spray of red immediately stained almost an entire wall of her office. Then another. And another She laid sprawled out on the floor in a slowly growing pool of dark red. I was stunned and appalled. *This isnt happening, this isnt happening* I thought to myself, knowing full well that no matter how many times I said it it would never change what I was seeing just before my eyes.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;He left the woman dying on the floor. She was no longer screaming, I dont think she had the energy left. Before she stopped moving for good though she looked back towards me. Our eyes locked. I felt a sudden rush of sadness and grief pass over me, this woman was barely clinging to life and there was nothing I could do to help her. She kept watching me as she took her last breath.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;The man walked over her body to see what she was doing. He slowly bent down and traced her eye lineto me. Our eyes met. He saw me. He knows I had saw him. I panicked. I ran across the lift to my utility bag. Hands shaking, I fumbled through it. *Where is it?!* Yes! I grabbed my phone and tried to flip it open. I was rushing too quickly though, and the little phone went flying from my shaking hands and off the side of the building. FUCK! I looked back up at the office. What I saw before me made me jump backwards so hard I hit the back of the lift. He was standing in front of me, nose pressed up against the glass, grinning ear to ear. His loose clothes were torn and bloodied and his knife was still dripping wet. I was terrified, this man was a monster.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;He backed away from the glass for a moment to get something on the woman's desk. I couldnt see what he was doing, his back was to me. Like the woman had done, I tried to look around him and see what it was he was working on. He was hunched over whatever it was though, I couldnt see anything. Suddenly he spun around and slammed a piece of paper onto the inside of the window. A piece of tape kept it from falling and stuck it to the glass. Before I had a chance to examine it he shot me one last smirk and ran out of the office. I didnt hesitate, I went straight over to the paper. It was a note. I couldnt read the sloppy writing at first, but soon it came together.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Between tears and blood stains in the paper the message read:

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Youd better hope you make it to the roof before I do

 Yeah...theres a plan. 




  nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Mary loves to take selfies. Whenever I see her she insists that we take at least one. It happens so much that we have a routine. She puts her purse on her right arm, and her left arm around me. I put my right arm around her, and point at her phone with my left hand.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Shes become very particular about how we take these selflies. Everything must be perfect. Our hair must be neatly combed, we must stand up straight, her phone must be positioned at a perfect angle. If something doesn't go perfectly as according to plan, Mary gets angry. Very angry.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Mary stopped taking selfies in public. There are too many distractions in public. 'Too many things that can go wrong' she says. I don't mind though; its nice to have a break from it.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Mary is at my house right now. We were just sitting on the couch looking through our selfie hall of fame. Silly selfies, serious selfies, sad selfies, the list goes on and on. She has more selfies on her phone than I can even remember taking.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;"I'm thirsty" she says, "I'm going to get something to drink"

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I keep looking through our selfies. Swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe. Wait. What was that? Go back. What is that? You can see it in the windows reflection. Shes holding something behind me. That's odd. That isn't in our routine. I shrug and keep swiping.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, wait

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;There it is again. You can see it in the TV's reflection now. What is she holding? Does she always do this? It's a little closer to me than it was last time. I've never noticed it before. She has never mentioned it before. I should ask her about it when she comes back.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;You can see it in the mirror now. The mirror isn't like the window or the TV. It's much, much more clear. I see what it is now. I see what shes holding behind me. Its a knife. A big, sharp, metal knife. And its getting closer.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I don't think, I act. I grab her purse and rifle through it. Makeup, phone charger, book, ...my heart stops. There it is. Buried at the bottom of her purse. Chills shoot down my spine. I pick it up. The metal is ice cold. The blade is razor sharp. I can't take my eyes off it. I am petrified. I am terrified.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Shes coming back. Quick, bury the knife back in the bag. Put her purse where she left it. Don't let her see, she can never know.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Every step is louder than the last. Faster! Quietly! She can never know.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Shes almost here. 

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Pick up the phone. Stop breathing so quickly. Sit still. Dont look up. She just outside the doorway now. I can see her shadow moving closer.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Shes back.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;"Ready to take a selfie?"

 You're going to need to speak up, this nice *SHINY* trophy is making a lot of noise. 




 Whats that? Sorry I can't hear you over this nice shiny Lombardi trophy. 




 ...perfect spiral! 




 Because the Patriots have in fact struggled with defense many years. Either way, no team will win without a balanced team. Of course you need more than just a good quarterback to win games, but that doesn't make the quarterback any less awesome. 




 No, not really. LeBron is thought of as one of the greatest to ever play the game of basketball, regardless of things outside his control. Sherman isn't even necessarily the best in his position today. On top of that he's very arrogant. That being said, hes still very, very good and one of the best cornerbacks out there right now. 




 Richard Sherman (Seattle) and Darrele Revis (New England) are arguably the two best cornerbacks in the NFL. Them going head to head in the Super Bowl has been the cause of a lot of media attention. Tom Brady (New England) and Sherman also met once in the regular season. At the end of the game, after the Seahawks won, Richard Sherman approached Brady and said "You mad bro?". Hes known for being very arrogant and pretty full of himself.

Fast forward to the Super Bowl today. Sherman again openly taunted Revis after a blown play when he mocked his number '24' at the camera. Then the Patriots came back from a ten point deficit in the final quarter (something that has never been done in NFL history). They end up 4 points a head. Seattle look like they're about to score one final time with less than a minute left, which would have given them the lead and almost certainly the victory. Instead of safely running the ball though, Seattle elected to throw it and the Patriots came up with a miraculous interception that gave them possession of the ball for the last minute of the game. Theres a gif of Richard Sharman watching this play, he goes from all smiles as a Super Bowl champion, to completely devastated in about two seconds (it's pretty damn funny). This is him basically apologizing for being an ass, and Tom Brady respecting that. What I'm more surprised about though is whats happening outside of the picture. This was taken whils both teams got into a fairly large fight, they we're literally the only two players not fighting. I do not respect Richard Sherman as a competitor, but I very much respect him being the only person on his team not to fight and to try to make amends for being a general ass. That being said, I'm sure he would have gone right back to arrogant jerk mode if his team had won.

EDIT: By the way, LeBron James played basketball.

ANOTHER EDIT: Actually this wasn't the play with the big fight, nevermind, I'm sure he was very much involved in that. 




 Me too. I honestly thought "Fuck. Okay, they can't be stopped, just give them the touchdown with as much time as possible still on the clock"

 So many questions 




 This is very outdated, for one thing New York is 1st in the United States, San Fransisco is 2nd.

 My character is allergic to bees. Now which developer thought that was a good idea? 




 Oh my god yes, instead of grown ups handing out candy and  treats, kids could hand out beer and shots of vodka. Kids, alcohol, drunk adults, I can't think or a reason not to do this! 




 A 2003 Special Edition [Fender Splattercaster] (http://m.imgur.com/OO7zCTv), its beautiful! I got it for about $350 a few years back, and I think that was an awesome deal. The last big special editions Fender did before that was the [Bowling Ball series] (http://m.imgur.com/eYCoxzH) which go from anywhere between $3000-$7000 these days. Hopefully ten years from now mine will be worth the same! Not that I would ever consider parting with it. Ever.

I also have an 11.something carat piece of uncut Tanzanite. I'm not married or anything, I got it from an Aftican warlord I met while in Tanzania. We weren't close, he either had no idea how much it was worth, or he was *really* trying to impress me (which didn't work, I didn't know it was worth anything until I was back home for a few years). Fast forward 15 years and the Tanzanite mines are going dry and the price is skyrocketing. I plan on selling it 7-10 years down the road when the market is completely under supplied . Right now Tanzanite is worth about $700 a carat, but an appraiser told me that it's price could triple in a decade. Maybe I'll be able to but another Splattercaster! 




 Damnnnnnn 




 Yeah I would. 




 But why??? 




 Holy fuck. 




 No, but seriously. 




 What?

 




 Um, no results. 




 That...was very risky. 




 What? 




 Whoa... 




 I'll save time from Googleing this one and just assume that's what I think it is. 




 Well that Google was well worth it.  




 I once saw my friends sister laugh really hard and have 'milk' come out her nose after leaving the bathroom at Six Flags. We weren't drinking milk. Or anything. I wonder...

 Um, okay. Go on? 




 What it lacks in NSFWness it more than makes up for in weirdness... 




 ...what? 




 Whoa, I might consider a throwaway on that one. 




 Holy shit I just got a great idea... 




 So...you're not okay with it at all?... 




 Well, as it tuns out, there is a very NSFW comic book based around a 'superhero' called test_subject3655. From what I can gather, he has the power to stop time which he utilizes to fuck this same person over and over again. It might be rape, can you give consent if time is stopped? Can you fuck when time is stopped?... Its a little hard to tell because there are a few Asian words thrown in here and there-now that I think about it this sounds like something Japan would create. It is anime after all. 




 Um, the whole point of this is for 'secrets' that aren't really a big deal. If it's a big deal don't post it here...obviously. 




 Phew, glad that's cleared up. The way you worded that kinda made me think you were shitting your pants on the regular and that your 'wife' was a guy.

EDIT: 'Phew' 




 Thanks for clearing that up. 




 I had no idea this was a job.

 Ah, the great plight of the grey...

To press, or not to press-that is thy question:

Wether tis' nobler to supress

Thy temptation of the button,

To bear witness to other's vibrant blues and greens

Heedful I'll never be blessed with one of my own,

Or take arms against a sea of buttons,

And by opposing end them? To hold: to press;

No more; and by a press to say we end

The heartache the thousand natural shocks

That flesh is heir to,

'Tis a consummation

Devoutly to be wished.

Alas...

Once more into the fray,

Into the last good fight I'll ever know.

Press and repress on this day.

 No wonder we let that colony go

Oh boy, so many corrections needed in just one statement. First of all it was not just *one* colony, but rather thirteen. Second, -well, tell me, when Birtish peope 'give' things away, do they always lose thousands of lives in the process? Because if not, the British didnt so much *give* those thirteen colonies away, as had they them taken away. By force. By most accounts an international embarrassment. Not only that, but they failed to retake those measly thirteen colonies (now states) just a few years later. But you're English, so I'll *give* you the benefit of the doubt (see what I did there? No? Read it again, a little slower this time).

 No. Sneak peak is where you get really high up on a mountain or a peak or something so you can spot the spoilers ahead. I believe it gets its name from Tikaboo Peak (sounds a lot like *peak*aboo, right?), in Nevada, where thrill seekers and conspiracy theorists alike will occasionally scale the barren wasteland to *sneak*  a *peek* at the near by Area 51. Get it? They're *sneaking* a *peek* on a *peak*... With a name like 'stealth mountain' I would have expected you to know this. Since then, the term 'sneak peak' has evolved into a few different meanings. The most popular among them meaning 'to get an early look at something that has not yet been released to the public'.

In this instance, I scaled my very thick pile of A Song of Ice and Fire books to catch a glimpse of future spoilers. The expedition was worth it, countless wonders lie at the summit. Unfortunately, all of that hard work is going to become obsolete in about ten weeks. I feel like a librarian. I just spent the last few years of my life sorting metaphorical books (and a few literal books actually), but as soon as I'm done with my life's work the Kindle comes around and suddenly all of my hard work is purposeless ancient history. Oh look, I'm ranting.

Anyhow, that's what 'sneak peak' means.

 [My favorite part] (http://i.imgur.com/rEbTrQP.png) 




 This literally happened to me once. Me and my friend were hot boxing his car, both at at least a [7] when he checked his phone and said, "Dude! Awesome news!". Oh, how wrong he was. Apparently he had just gotten a text from a girl he was trying to hook up with. She was at an 'ice cream social' and she wanted us to come join. Now at the time this did sound like awesome news. *An ice cream social!* I thought, *I've died and went to stoner heaven!* We drove off in pursuit of the delicious ice cream that awaited us.

On the way there my friend pulled into a church parking lot. Yes, a church. I didn't say anything out loud, but in my head I questioned this. *Had he made a wrong turn? Were we turning around?* Alas, we were not. Apparently, this was where the ice cream social was being held. It was at this point that I began to get worried. I almost didn't go in, but he had already told the girl we were coming, and as a bro I couldn't send him in alone. I retrospect, I totally could have and definitely should have.

Immediately upon entering I recognized many of the people there from my school. I realized I had no idea what type of group this was, so I decided to ask the girl we came to see. "Wait, he didn't tell you?" she says, "This is my churches youth group" Fuck. Fucking fuckity fuck fuck fuck fuck. Before I had time to burst out of the front doors an old woman summoned all of us to the center of the church in some sort of religious pow wow. No no no. Must. Leave. Now. Must. Find. Friend. Too late. He's already sitting down. FUCK. I run over and grab the seat next to him, all the while begging him to rush the exit with me. Again, too late. The room was silent, the old lady was taking roll call.

"Brian"

"Here"

"Sarah"

"Here"

"Kevin"

"Here"

Shes reading from a list. Thank god. Maybe she won't even notice us. Nope. That would be too easy, wouldn't it? Instead she says, "Oh! And I see we have some first timers here! Care to introduce yourself?" *FUCK NO, EVIL RELIGION LADY!!* I was high, don't judge me.

There was a silence. A silence that lasted much, much, much too long. I looked at my friend, and he looked back at me, both preying the other would answer. And then he did something that I will not forgive him for to this day. He reached in his pocket, and pulled out his phone. Instead of answering, he flipped open his phone and started texting away. I looked up. Old Lady McGee was staring directly into my eyes. I had to speak.

"Uh, hi. My name is test_subject3655"

Someone laughs. *Fuck youuuuuuuuuuuuu.* She smiles. "And why are you here today, test_subject3655?" she asks.

What?! This is a fucking interview?? I glanced back at my friend, still texting away. Shit, I was alone on this one. *Fucking hell!!! Wait, you're in a church, don't think stuff like that.* Again, I was pretty fucking high. "Um, yeah I think I just came for the ice cream." Silence. Complete, dead, silence. Not even a comforting cricket chirping away, utter silence.

"...alright." she says, before mercifully moving on to some other topic. We sat through another half hour of this before making a break for the door. Everyone knew. EVERYONE. Even Old Lady McGee probably knew. Never, ever ever again. Ever, ever, ever.

**TL;DR: Went to an ice cream social high as fuck, turned out to be a church youth group, got interviewed by an old religious lady in front of everyone.**

 I don't understand why 'liquid cheese' is such a big thing to foreigners, its not the least bit popular here. I've seen it maybe two or three times in my entire life, I don't even know where to find it to be honest. Its not something they just sell in the grocery store. I think you would have to special order it on the internet or something. Maybe 7 11.

 /r/humblebrag 




 I actually hate Five Finger Death Punch, this is an unbiased opinion. The fact that they're a heavy metal band is almost irrelevant, they play the song as rock. And there is absolutely no screaming, the closest they get would be the harmony during the chorus I guess. But like I said before, a piano isn't an instrument that can capture the message behind this song. There are many other songs where it can, but not this one. The Doors or Styx are good examples of song writing and composition that is perfect for a piano componet. Bad Company (the song, not the band) isn't. Its simply too mild where the song is too rugged. Kind of like playing Back in Black with a ukulele. Sure you can do it, and it will probably sound pretty cool too, but it will never compare to the raw power and passion behind the orginal song.

None of this means Bad Company is a bad original song, just that it could be better.

EDIT: Not sure why you're down voting me over a petty debate... When it comes down to it its an opinion, you shouldn't despise someone just because you disagree with them. 




 25/8/361

FTFY 




 I disagree, while it might ruin the mood of the orginal tempo, it captures the essence of the song much, much better. Its a song about breaking away from societal norms and rejecting modern customs (with regard to aggression mostly). The original version dosnt capture that at all. Five Finger Death Punch's does a much better job conveying that message and in a much more powerful way. Bad Company isn't a simple easy going song, its powerful and gritty and rugged. Where Bad Company missed the mark, Five Finger Death Punch nailed it. 




 [Bad Company] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=u_VsvZmIWxY) by Five Finger Death Punch. Oddly enough, Bad Company by Bad Company is a little bit of a let down after this version.

Also the Jimi Hendrix version of [All Along the Watchtower] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TLV4_xaYynY). Devlin and Ed Sheeran did [a cool cover of that too] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iDRJwCSEcoA). A cover of a cover. Coverception.

[Fall Out Boy] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sk8Pb17pcQI) and [Alien Ant Farm] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CDl9ZMfj6aE) both did surprisingly awesome Michael Jackson covers.

 Oh boy, you caught me at a good time. So my dad has this thing that builds up a about a metric shit ton of air pressure. Its made for powering nail guns, but can be used for all sorts of things. They didn't really put a responsible limit on the machine because they didn't really put a respinsible limit on the wild number of attachments you could hook it up to. Theres one for blowing around pressurized air, one for power washing, you name it.

Anyhow, I was supposed to clean the front walk way today. My walkway is made up of a bunch of stones with no cement in between. Shit gets stuck in there and its almost impossible to get out. I was generously given the air cannon to cleanse those hard to reach cracks. It started out just fine. I pumped it up to a shit ton per square inch, and we were off. Everything was effortlessly coming out, no ammount of dirt and leaves could stand in my way! And then I got bored. I decided to crank the pressure up another half shit ton. I distinctly remember saying, "Let's see what this baby can do!" Oh, how I would regret those words.

I started aiming the little pressure gun thingy around my yard to see how far it reached. About 25 feet for those of you wondering. It was shaped kinda like a realish gun, so it was pretty fun. Suddenly someone shouted, "Hey!" *Shit!* I thought, *did someone just catch me really embarrassingly playing with fucking air?!* Accept I didn't even get those rational thoughts together. I just turned to face my accuser. Fun fact, sometimes when you're surprised your muscles tighten and tense up. This can be especially bad if you're holding anything dangerous, like, say an air cannon. Before I knew it, a shit ton and a half square inches of pressure hit my brother directly in the balls at point blank range. It very literally blew him away. I mean he had some decent hang time considering how many steps he had to go down. Unfortunately for him, he didn't even have the weeds in the cracks of the bricks to comfort his fall.

He just got back from the hospital and apparently were telling everyone he got hit by a base ball from a rouge pitching machine. Only me, him, my parents, my neighbors gardeners, the lovely doctors at Widmore Medical and my friends will know the truth. Oh, and now the internet I suppose. Shhh.

**TL;DR I hit my brother in the balls with an air gun pumped up to exactly one and a half shit tons per square inch of pressure. Recently released from hospital, no permanent injuries. If you don't count pride.**

 I actually spend a lot of time in Wisconsin, I was just in Milwaukee two weeks ago (complete coincidence, I still don't live there). One time I actually met Hulk Hogan in the Milwaukee airport, bandana and all. It was weird, we had a very normal conversation. At no point during our 13ish minute chat did he nor I acknowledge that he was a fairly famous celebrity. He just sat down next to me, asked me to pass the news paper, and we talked about the headlines for a while. So to answer your question, its pretty nice this time of year. 




 Yes, they absolutely did, but Halloween itself is a Christian holiday. Of course there were other influences. I guess I don't really see what your arguing here, Halloween is a Christian holiday just like Samhin was pagan. Historians today aren't really sure where Halloween itself originated, although there are many possibilities, Samhin among them.

Of course many Christian traditions come from other influence, whats your point though? Halloween is simply not celebrated in paganism, period. Nor any other religion. Hence 'completely Christian'.

EDIT: For the record, the term 'a completely Christian holiday' does not at all mean that there isn't other influence in it, nor does it imply it. 




 Yeah but...its fact. What is there to disagree with? And ambiguity of history? 




 Awww. Gracias, I'll fix it. 




 I canged it three times. Started with intents and purposes, changed it when someone said that was wrong, changed it back when I realized he was wrong. The first change was about two minutes in though, so no edit asterisk was added, the second edit was when I put in the EDIT. To be honest, I didn't see your comment until well after.  




 It doesn't change in quoted text...

Gotcha.

Try it.

I think the edit was the part with EDIT next to it. 




 Usually I skip straight to step two. I like to stay ahead of the game. 




 Reunion potentially revived? 




 Nope, [this one] (http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/33yg8j/what_are_some_unusual_things_your_parents/cqpm5jw) takes the cake. 




 Well no, not necessarily. That's definitely a possibility, but the origin of Halloween is still debated. Some think it was from Samhain, some think Pomona, or even Parentalia. No one really knows where it came from, but Halloween itself is a completely Christan holiday, regulardless of what holiday preceded and maybe even inspired it.

EDIT: Downvotes? I don't really mind, but why? 




 Although more of a commercial thing now, Halloween is 100% a Christian holiday. Its an evening of feasting to remember the dead (hence it's being called the day of the dead in places like Mexico), particularly dead saints (hallows). Costumes and fun was a way to approach the sad topic of death more lightly. And the 'scary' aspect of Halloween come from farmers and people dressing up to scare evil spirits away from their harvest. The entire holiday is essentially Christian though... If I were you I would tell them about it, just to see what they thought. 




 Thats so sad, some of my favorite memories are playing outside with neighborhood kids :( 




 Were you an only child? I feel like this couldn't even be enforced any other way. 




 Fucking fuck you... I don't even know what that is, I noped out after the word 'urethral'. The picture didn't help either.

 I know a few people who didn't touch alcohol until they were 21.

Before you go out for a big bash on your 21st birthday, maybe test the waters in the shallow end.

EDIT: I realize how few people this applies to, I mean thats an ungodly amount of self control, but this is for the good kids don't deserve embarrassment like that. 




 Not really, they just didn't get along together at all. They were both really nice to everyone else.

[I found out the hard way] (http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2tra31/whats_the_biggest_secret_you_would_share_without/co1s2h8?context=3). Anyhow, I guess thats what I'd be into. 




 In middle school, the quiet kid, Steven, had an arch rival. Robbie. In class Robbie always seemed to come out on top of their little scuffles, mostly because Steven couldn't really formulate or execute a 'burn' or 'comeback'. He just rolled over and let Robbie get his insults in until the teacher stepped in. One day I was walking behind Robbie after that class and Steven quietly crept up behind him. Before Robbie could even turn around, he got as close as possible and said, "If I was to come into your house and kill you while you were sleeping, I doubt anyone would even notice..." then he disappeared into the darkness of the science hallway. I don't remember the exact words, but the was pretty damn close. I was about 55% shocked, 30% laughing hysterically on the inside, and 15% terrified. Robbie never made fun of ol' Stevie again.

EDIT: Yippie, new top comment! Thanks, Reddit :) 




 I once won one (once won one...woah) of a those huge arcade prizes at the amusement park. Never have I been able to return to the same level of stardom. 




 "My anaconda *does* want some" 




 Everything about that fucking sucks. 




 Kinda thought [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TQQGqQtnBk) was the kind of thing I was looking at. 




 Uh oh 




 Um, incredible? ...Its a tunnel. I mean it looks very cool, and I totally want to drive a boat over that little boat-bridge, but its just a tunnel. 




 Holy mother of god, no one is safe! 




 Every season the first four games are just horrible, then they get it together later by around week 5. I need to explain this concept to all of my non-Patriot fan friands literally every year. And I get to explain it again every December :D 




 Is it somewhere behind that pipe?

 What? I wrote that example that way intentionally, changing it doesn't make any sense. And regardless, thats an example, the point still stands. His way was kind of wrong. 




 That had some of the best reactions I've ever seen. Yellow-blue jacket guy, beige jacket man and cool-blue-sunglasses-dude are among my favorites.

 One of the best smelling strains ive seen

Thats kinda like saying, "one of the best tasting dinners I've heard" 




 I'm a decent writer, or at least I like to think I am. I've been published a few times (mostly magazine articles, nothing too major) and very often wrire short stories just for fun. I can't promise I would be that big of an asset, but if you want me take a look at what you wrote and give you my two cents, I'd be happy to help! 




 Do NOT try to read this at a [9]... You know when you're mind starts to wander while you're reading but you're eyes keep moving down the words like you're actually reading them? Well I was reading this when I decided in my head I should imagine Obama saying this like he would have on the TV show, and that made me think of my friend who can do an awesome Obama impression, and then I thought of this guy on Americas Got Talent who does really cool impressions, which lead to thinking about Howie Mandels goatee for a while, and then I thought maybe I should grow a goatee, and then I was like, "Hey, King Tut has a pretty kick ass goatee", (for some reason I said that part out loud) and that went on for a while and I came to the conclusion that King Tut and Howie Mandel would probably be really good friends, a thought which developed into a TV show staring the two ('Howie and the Tut'), a sitcom about two dysfunctional, fun loving room mates living in suburban Giza. And then I guess I read the name 'Obama' and it must have registered in my brain because suddenly Obama was in the show, and he was like the guy in the gang that no one really likes but hes still always kinda around (not necessarily unlike normal Obama) and they all went on all kinds of adventures together, like white water rafting down the Nile, and pulling pranks on ol' Vlad Putin (as I imagine Obama does in real life). And then realized that I been reading the same line over and over again for literally eleven minutes.

It was a wild ride. 




 Thanks, man.

 Me: "...wait why isn't he starting till 4:20? Thats late, the sun will almost even be going down." 




 I know less now than I did before. 




 Welp, thanks for ruining the memory of Robin Williams.

 Thats only $10 more dude. 




 What time zone do you live in in Europe? We can just do some simple math here. 




 Never not upvote this

I got a second opinion as this is not my first language. I might have maybe forgot there was such a thing as a double negative, but lets not dwell on that. Small words used in quick succession occasionally confuse me sometimes... 




 It was the right choice against the wrong team. Think about it, the Seahawks had three downs, one timeout and lass than a minute to go one yard. The best game plan here is to throw it on second
 down, then if it's incomplete run it on third, if that fails use your last time out and run again on fourth. It might have been a better idea to throw it on third instead of second, but regardless the throwing was not the problem. As a coordinator or a coach you do not account for things like interceptions or fumbles. Sure you expect them once or twice over the course of a game (three or four times if your Rex Ryan) but you don't avoid choosing a play because you think the other team is going to come up with a miraculous play. Not only that, but as good as Marshawn Lynch is, he is NOT good at running from the one yard line. In fact, he's pretty bad at it. I'll direct you [here] (http://mobile.sportingnews.com/article/4634710-nfl-super-bowl-seahawks-marshawn-lynch-one-yard-line-analysis-context-pete-carroll-call-patriots-2014). His swooping left and right with bursts of speed doesn't work from the one yard line when an entire team is running at you down the entire line. Pete Carol and his offense made the right decision, the Patriots were just in the right place at the right time.

Theres no guarantee the game would have been over after that either. Who in the right mind doesn't think Tom Brady can't get a field goal (which is all they would have needed to tie) with a minute left? Especially considering how well Tom Brady was playing that night. 




 I don't think you understand, that was a glorious moment in Patriots history. Richard Sherman, the very man who disrespected Tom Brady with his "You mad, bro?", finally got what was coming to him: agonizing defeat in the form of Malcom Butler. I have nothing against the Seahawks, Russell Wilson seems like a great guy, Marshawn Lynch is hilariously unconventional, and I'm a huge USC fan so Pete Carol is and will always be a hero in my eyes. That being said, seeing the cocky sparkle in the eyes of Richard Sherman die a little bit at that exact moment was literally the most satisfying thing I have ever seen. 




 "Yeah, sure, but fuck that guy"

No, but seriously if you think they might be dating someone, approach the topic very casually, so that just in case they do its no big deal. It also might be a good idea to go into it fully expecting that they do in fact already have an SO. Then you get to play the other role, acting surprised if they don't or cool and collected if they do. Kind of just something like, "Really? Awesome!" if they don't or, "Yeah, I kinda thought someone like you probably would" if they do. Its tough to give exact examples or recommendations though because you really have to read the situation, but I think you get the point. Good luck! 




 He pulled this one out of the bag a few times this year. Where he drops back and when the pocket starts collapsing runs through it up to the line of scrimmage and guns it on the fly. I've never seen it from him in any other season, but its fucking awesome! 




 The consumers of the North Korean economy will surely rejoice! Well, they would if I hadn't just made them up. 




 Ohhhhhhhh, I get it! Took me a while, but I'm here now!

 Good for you, I'm 27. Too bad you clicked at 52 though, huh?

 He was also in 'The Wedding Ringer' where he dropped another reference. At the end they all get on a plane and he suddenly looks all dramatic amd serious and says, "I've got a bad feeling about this flight..." Last line of the movie. 




 Yeah, I guess it could also be argued that he killed Tricia Tanaka... 




 Hurley! Wait, he hit someone with a car. Did they die? Nah, he's Hurley. 




 Ah, the fabled Cockamouse. Half cockroach, half mouse. It's about the size of a potatoe, it has antennae, a hard exoskeleton, fur whiskers and the ability to fly. It primarily inhabits apartments and hotels on the lower east side of Manhattan, but has been sighted as far away as the subarbs of New York City. As of right now, there are an unknown number of wild Cockamice, although one was known to have recently given birth. 




 Confirm or deny OP, confirm or deny. 




 Me and some friends once smoked in a big park near my town. We went down a trail and found a good spot. The park closes when its dark so after a while we got everything together and headed out. It got dark a lot faster than I had expected though, and pretty soon the trees made it completely dark (the not-quite-as-awesome kind of trees). To make matters worse, we couldn't find the way back. I had been there pleanty of times before, but for some reason I couldn't find the right trail. We went in the same circle three times. Yeah, I know, but it was terrifying. At one point ome of my friends got way ahead of us and wouldn't slow down. He was gone eventually. We finally made it out and got a call from the guy who went ahead saying he was waiting by the gate to make sure they didn't lock it while we were still in the park. We finally got out and parked close outside the park. I thought we were home clear but apparently not. A park ranger pulled us over when we were leaving and questioned the hell out of us. Almost worse than I would imagine a cop. He totally knew, and would have definitely called the cops if he could prove it. He followed us for a while too. We were in two separate cars, so we went different directions and lost him, but it was still scary as hell. 




 ...and?? 




 Pavers? Good to know! Theirs looks like [this] (http://www.resourcedir.directory/images-uploads/2014/02/08/arbel-paver-patio-landscape-pavers-design-and-installation.jpg), it really is just about as beautiful as a drive way can get. And no I'm not the least bit stoned...lol I guess I'm just really passionate about drive ways.

Also, /r/casualconversations is good for stuff like this! I think. I'm not really sure, I subscribed like two days ago, but give it a shot non the less! Good luck:D 




 Nice, but the octopus above your TV really stole the show for me. That thing is fantastic.

 "My, what strong edibles you have!"

"All the better to get baked with, my dear!"

All I could think of for some reason. Please don't judge me... 




 Good lord, please don't sneeze OP. 




 This would give me the same exact dilemma as my neighbors drive way. I know, let me explain. You see, they have no ordinary drive way, no sir. Its made up of individual stones meticulously fit together without cement like some sort of road mosaic. It looks incredible. Every time I see it I'm like, "Damn, I couldn't drive over a piece of art like that!". Same concept with the ashtray. Good job, OP! 




 As a supporter of legalization, I hope not. As a recent watcher of 'Thank You for Smoking', I would love to see a sequel. 




 At first glance I thought that said "on the outskirts of Saint Louis, Colorado". I first questioned my historical prowess, then my knowledge of geography, then I read it again. 




 The pond is behind you, genius. 




 For those of you wondering, yes this is exactly what you think it is, no you should not open it if in public. Someone should probably throw a NSFW on there too. 




 I only say this because I'm sure that not everyone did, but you MUST watch the video. It's amazing. [Link] (https://youtu.be/qkpWwnNiGgE) for lazy people who use hyperzoom (like me). 




 Whats that? 




 That would be one hell of a box cutter. 
























 As someone who recently went through the whole college application process, that looks a lot more like a rejection letter than an acceptance. The acceptance letters are nice and shiny and professional, and they usually come in huge packets for lots of papers. The rejections are just single unflattering little envelopes.

EDIT: OP follow up, did he get in? 




 Yeah, but he'll probably charge you a ridiculous amount of money for something that should have been free and bore you the whole way through it. In the end, you'll be disappointed with the outcome and vow never to return to the field of dentistry again.

 The day the music died. Him, The Big Bopper and Ritchie Valens all in a matter of minutes. So sad. 




 As much as I love JFK, he really didn't do much of anything productive as a president. Anything he started either failed or fell to the wayside. And I mean literally almost everything. He also got too personally involved in the Cold War. He was a politician trying to fight a war with the wrong goals and prerogatives in mind. Someone in charge so far outside of his element made the entire conflict a rockier road than it had to be. He really should have just let the people who knew what they were doing make the big decisions. After he was assassinated, a few things he has begun were completed by his successors as he became a martyr, but for the most part, not much went through. A great man, personally one of my favorite historical figures, but a generally overrated president. 




 could have? 




 Jimi Hendrix. Died at 27 (basically founded the 27 club) of asphyxiation. Jimi Hendrix moved to Europe and formed the Jimi Hendrix Experience in 1964. They recorded with each other for about two years all the while traveling around the continent to play with the greats. In 1966 they hit the main stream. And then, almost overnight, Jimi Hendrix became a household name. In the next four years they would play some of the most legendary concerts ever preformed and write some of the greatest songs ever recorded. Even today Hendrix's influence is clearly recognizable in modern day music. He was one of the greatest instrumentalists to ever live. And yet, he was only a mainstream success for four years. Imagine how far he could have gone otherwise. Imagine the what he could have done if he had more time. Gah, makes me sad just to think about. 




 I'm not from the US. I would definitely argue it was an American victory. In the end, the British promised to stop their attempts at native American expansion in Canada and stopped the practice of impressment on American shipping routes. In contrast, the British got almost nothing out of the war.

 Surrender might not be the technical term, but it's generally accepted that the British lost the war. 




 It has worked on multiple occasions. 




 Not even close though... 




 The Battle of the Red Cliffs: Emperor Cao Cao's army was exhausted after a series of forces marches and unprepared for battle. Cao Cao did not reguard this and pushed on anyways. After reaching a river, a spy in his army advised Cao Cao to chain his ships together to avoid sea sickness. Upon seeing the ships, the opposing army sent fire boats at the fleet. The ships were trapped and quickly caught fire. This battle marked the end of the Han dynasty.

 nbsp;

Battle of New Orleans: In an attempt to revive the failing British army, General Packenham decided to attack the military stronghold of New Orleans and gain control of the Mississippi River. Andrew Jackson and the American army were well prepared however, and the British were easily repelled. The American army took only a fraction of the losses of the British. To make matters worse, the war was already over. Although word had not reached Louisiana by this time, the Bitish had surrendered long before the attack had even begun.

 nbsp;

Battle of Watling Street: As the Celtic leader Boudicca lead 210,000 tribal warriors south, burning and pillaging along the way, she decided to launch a surprise attack on a small Roman outpost on Watling Street. About 10,000 soldiers were stationed there. The Roman's could literally see the attack coming from miles away and easily out maneuvered the Celts. They began by using crossbows at long range and then setting up a phalanx when the army got closer. In the end, the entire Celtic army turned and ran. The Romans only lost 400 compared to the Celts 80,000. Boudicca committed suicide and the chance of Celtic victory was all but destroyed in a single battle. 




 Not really... I don't know enough about the English language to explain why that would be wrong, but I can identify it.

 Can I get a TL;DR on that? 




 0 Minute War!

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War 




 I tried to do this once. Believe it or not, a 100 pound 14 year old didn't have too much authority over a 250 pound 35 year old dad. I was honestly worried he was going to charge me. Then he took two tries to get out of his folding chair and my worry dissipated. 




 I used to ref soccer, hated dealing with this. I was at a game once where a keeper took a goal kick, only to have it immediately intercepted by the other team and shot into the open net. Goal, right? That's what I thought at least, and whistled the play dead before retrieving the ball and walking it back to the center of the field. When I was half way there the coach of the team that was scored on ran up to me and started shouting that "THE GOALIE WASN'T READY, SO THAT DOSNT COUNT! TAKE THEIR POINT AWAY!". I said that's definitely not a rule, and even if it was, if he wasn't ready he shouldn't have made the decision to start the play. These are middle school kids, they know the how the game works. He had no verbal response to that. Instead he grabbed the ball from me and punted it two or three fields away. "Go get the fucking ball, punk" he said. I calmly (and quietly, and very slowly just to piss him off) explained that the home team needed to supply the equipment for each game. Field, nets, etc. And if his team couldn't provide a vital piece of equipment, say a ball, I would have no choice but to have them forfeit the game and give the other team the win. Everyone quietly watching him walk across the entire park to get the soccer ball and bring it back was the most satisfying experience I have ever been a part of.

TL;DR: Made a very reasonable call the coach didn't like, he got mad and punted the soccer ball away and told me to go get it. I told him if he didn't get it and his team, the home team, can't provide the necessary equipment, they're team forfeits and the visitors win. He retrieved it. 




 No, you're actually very wrong.

*Insult: a disrespectful or scornfully abusive remark or action*. Again, and actually serious this time, is English your first language? That would explain a lot. Your definition was a little misguided. It okay though, let's just try steering that brain cell in the right direction, champ. Anyhow, I have not once insulted someone because I wanted to hear them reply, what the hell kind of concept is that? If I'm insulting them, I'm clearly not a huge fan of hearing them speak, so why would I even want them to respond? You for example, I literally could not care less if you respond or not. Literally. The best part is though how you act like you're not trying to come up with some sort of comeback or response. Who was the one who began this whole thing by responding in the first place? Oh, right that would be you. "What have you been doing the whole time?"

And sorry to disappoint pal, but if you think anything you have done, or even can do, by commenting on Reddit is going to make me the least bit angry, you are more than delusional my friend. 




 Awwwwwwwwwww 




 "Man sneezes into tombstone during concert? Woah. Intriguing. Let's watch. Wait what? Is this a church? Well that would explain the tombstone. Wait, come on test_subject3655, whens the last time you saw a grave on the *inside* of a church? Well hold on now test_subject3655, this could be some weird religion where interior burials are common. If Scientology and the Church of the Button can be a thing, well I'll be damned if graveyards with a roof can't be one too. Either way, some guys gonna sneeze in one, they better get to it. 7 seconds to go. Woah, woah, woah hold up. What in the fucking dick was that? Was that an elephant? In the church? Why in the hell wouldn't the title mention the fucking church going elephant?! What is the title anyways?-Holy Jesus Christ I'm in idiot."

EDIT: Watched the video again. Couldn't help but to feel a little disappointed. 




 R+R=L(S)? 




 Please please please post a video of all of this. And then train my dog to do it. But seriously, the first part. 




 How does one exactly laugh at something while not paying attention to it? Do you even think before you type? You got that one lonely brain cell left, use it.

While under normal circumstances it's easy to understand the difference between insults and jokes, yours seem to be the solitary acceptation. I'll tell you what, how about you actually make your jokes *funny* and your insults *offensive*. That way not only will I understand them, but maybe we could even consider what your saying 'coherent'. This might seem like a lot to take in for a person like you, but one step at a time, bud. 




 I literally said out lout, "Holy fucking fuck", even though this isn't even really a theory, it want this theory to be true the most out of all of them. 




 I think if you're already in the car, its too late for you anyways. 




 Is English *your* first language? Because it's  capitalized, genius (I think I should explain that 'blast' for your benefit. I'm calling you a genius sarcastically. That means that I don't really think you're a genius, on the contrary in fact. I'm calling a very stupid person.)

I keep responding no because I care about (but not limited to) your opinion as I think you should probably know by now, but rather to educate your dumb ass. In my own humble opinion, it seems we shouldn't waste the single brain cell you have left. But if you would rather waste it, hey it's your brain cell to 'blast' if you insist upon doing so.

And are you still defending your incredibly messed up sexual assault joke? I stopped reading your little 'retort', and I use the term very lightly, about half way through but was shocked to pick back up and see that you were still at it. It was hard to believe you made a joke like that in the first place, but to sit here and watch you defend these actions... Despicable. I don't care if you find that sort of thing hilarious, but I certainly don't, and I think I speak on behalf of the majority of the general public when I say that so please stop saying things that degree of fucked up. Gosh, it really brings your character into question.

And don't try to explain your joke; it's never funny when you need to explain the joke. Come to think of it, it was never funny in the first place. 




 It really is the trouble makers that get away with the most. 




 Are you really joking about molesting people? And comparing it to an almost harmless joke (I say 'almost' for your benefit. The teacher didn't care, the students thought it was ridiculous. Literally no harm or even unpleasantness that could have come remotely close to coming out of it lasted even the length of that day) someone made on a teacher in middle school?? That's and disrespectful and fucked up on so many levels. And to think your trying to preach righteousness. Unbelievable.

And I'm not trying to prove your weak insult about a 'shit' wrong. I literally could not care less about your opinion. In fact, I'm getting a kick out of watching you still struggling to 'blast' me. ('Blast'?? Seriously? Jesus, how fucking old are you?) 




 The class would just be dying about how far he could go

I did actually. And even if it didn't, you just assumed these things. As we all know, when you assume, you make an ass of 'U and ME'. Or, in this case, just you. So being 'blasted' on basic reading skills is on you. Its funny that you blame me for what you thought was clearing it up later, and then went back to the previous un-cleared up hypothetical scenario you made up in your head. If you didn't get it the first, or second time, I'll say it a third. I nor anyone in that class, have naver made or laughed at a 'borderline stalker joke'. Are you still assuming things?? Read it again, slower this time. Good lord, just get it together.

 Well I would be offended, but it just seems plain silly to take egotistical internet ass holes with a superiority complex seriously. For the record, no one thought what he was saying was funny, they thought it was funny that the teacher did nothing about it. Are you honestly saying that you were never a juvenile middle/elementary school student with a slightly distorted sense of humor that probably encompassed some sort of immaturity? If you say no you either missed your entire childhood, or you're a conceited dick. If you say yes, then you should understand why a class of children would find immature things like this funny, and apparently just troll people on the internet because you have nothing better to do with your sad pathetic life. I couldn't care less about your depressing little existence though, carry on making the world a worse place for the rest of us.

 Um, no. I get why it was seem like that, but I was there, trust me it didn't go down like that. The class would always be dying at how far he could go just walking all over her and when he was done she would laugh along with the class like it was a tiny little joke and no big deal. In reality, he regularly crossed the line and went after her personal life and family. It was hilarious, but so, so wrong.

 There was a kid who would just say some ridiculous shit to this one teacher because he knew he could get away with it and just wanted to see how far it would go. He said things like, "On Christmas Eve, I'm sneaking into you children's bedrooms (she had two infant girls) and painting myself green so I can and hold them as ornaments instead of your Christmas tree" and "In the middle of the night I'm going to climb into your husband, so that when he talks you'll hear *my voice*" (he put some great emphasis on that last part), and even "I went online to 'rentaslave.com' and ordered you a nice new pair. Oh, happy Martin Luther King Day, by the way". Just some weird fucked up shit. The most shocking part though, was her reaction. She never did anything about it. Just laughed politely and said things like, "Alright, now I think that's enough now, John" all the while still smiling courteously like he had just made some chuckle-worthy light hearted jab.

 Okay, so this one is serious. Probably going to get buried, but serious none the less. Can someone (preferably not too huge of a stoner, just to avoid bias) who lives in a state where marijuana has been legalized explain how it has changed things over there and if you're in favor of the changes? And if you partake, how the system works exactly and what it's like compared to going into say, a liquor store. It just seems like such an alien concept living in a state so anti-marijuana.

 The entire 'proof' system is not only confusing, but unnecessary. It differs from country to country. In the United States, 2 proof equals 1% alcohol. That means that vodka at say 80 proof is 40% alcohol. There is really no point at all to the system. Encouraging people to do basic math I guess?

To make matters worse, the system changes in each country. What 80 proof means in the US could easily mean something completely different in another country. But in the US, 200 proof is as high as it goes. Thats 100% alcohol.

What?? I've lived in many places throughout my life, New Jersy among them, and let me set the record straight, the standards of comedy in New Jersey are absolutely no different from the rest of the United States.

For god's sake, Newark?!?

 I get sad when people hate on people who drive nice cars (I don't think I have much of a bias, I drive a nine year old Nissan and I'm very content with it). Although there are those people out there, for the most part people don't buy cars based on what others think but rather based on wether or not they personally like them. One of my best friends owns a new Corvette, it's a beautiful car. He's not rich, he lives in an apartment smaller than mine and saved up for 4 years to get it. He's not a dick on the road, he's probably the best driver I know and would never drive the lest bit recklessly leste he put his precious Chevrolet in danger. And he didn't buy it because he's materialistic, he doesn't care what others think of it, he just loves cars and is willing to invest in a hobby he cares about. Yet people still assume they know enough to judge him based on his means of transportation. I mean wouldn't it be wrong for someone judged you based on your hobby or interests? 




 Don't use car stereotypes, a shitty driver can drive any vehicle. I've seen plenty of people that think they own the road in Hondas and Nissans. 




 I'm not the least bit rich, but I live in an EXTREMELY wealthy area. I personally don't want to live in a very big house, but they impress me none the less. As a lover of architecture and exotic cars, I often drive through some of the nicer neighborhoods just to see the houses. Many of them are truly beautiful. 




 Well that's ignorant. 




 Everything is obviously hard to master, but in my opinion martial arts isn't any harder to 'learn' than most anything else. I can think of lots of things that were more challenging for me. 




 In a totally serious way, Paul Blart... It gets so much shit but I really did like that movie. No one wants to see the second with me and it's been killing me. I might just break down and see it alone.

Also any movie that is the 4th in a series. On Stranger Tides, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, you name it. Sure they aren't nearly as good as the first few, but the nostalgia, the characters, the awesomeness, it's usually enough to make a pretty damn good movie, even if it doesn't compare to the others. Any movie with Jack Sparrow or Indiana Jones is awesome in my book, no matter how shitty the story line.

 Of all the great pictures of Snoop Dogg... 




 Plentiful downvotes for that misleading hoodwinker! 




 OP strongly implies it. 
























 You're original comment regarded the mass of the Earth being crushed into a black hole. That is what I was addressing. Are you debating a different point now?

Also this comment doesn't make sense out of context. What black hole is he talking about? Does it have an original size? Either way it doesn't really support your argument. He's saying that if a black hole was crushed it would have more gravitational pull. That would just extend it's event horizon, not change the force exerted on it.

Either way everything I said earlier is still relevant. The event horizon has the exact same force on every black hole. Being outside one of a small black hole will not put you under more gravitational strain than a large one. 




 If they hit pass by each other they will probably slingshot each other away. If not, there are black holes that actually orbit one another. If they come even closer though they will collide and from a single larger black hole. It would release an absolutely insane amount of energy. They would release huge gravitational waves into space. An event like his has never been observed before. 




 Oh, I understand what your saying, but the event horizon is a fixed point that has the exact same gravitational pull on every black hole. The event horizon on a big black hole is the same as one on a small one. That could only change if the singularity of a small black hole somehow had the mass of a large black hole, which is impossible. By definition they have already reached their smallest size.

Correct me if I'm wrong but here's what I understand you saying: an extremely small black hole would tear you apart before you reached it's event horizon because it's small size provides more distance between the furthest extent of its gravitational pull and the nearest. That's an interesting way to look at it, but it's not really the way it works.

An event horizon is the point where the gravity is strong enough to prevent light from escaping. The force of a large black hole at it's event horizon is exactly the same as one from a small black hole. And the gravitational pull extending outwards from the event horizon may extend further for a large one, but the ratio for distance away to gravitational pull is directly proportional, no matter how large or small the black hole. 




 That's a subject of considerable debate. Bear in mind that this is all theory, not law. We could never actually prove any of this.

Some say yes some say no. There are actually theories that if things could be sucked into a black hole and survive, they would remain there forever. So if I star could be sucked in, it could supernova itself and created another black hole within the first, and so on, and so on. An entire solar system could be created within a black hole, an entire galaxy, an entire universe. For all we know, our universe is inside of a black hole, which could be inside of another black hole and another. And many of the black holes around use could house their own universes and universes within them. This is one of the many multiverse theories. If it is true, it could even contain parallel universes. If there are an infinite number of universes, you could eventually find one that is exactly the same as the one we live in in every way. A parallel universe.

Black holes themselves are basically a product of dead stars. So if the universe didn't contain any stars before its conception, it couldn't have had any black holes. But who knows if there were stars when all of this happened?

Based on the Big Bang Theory though, nothing existed before, or at least not enough to create a star. Following that logic, black holes could not have been around. Our universe is not even old enough to see the first 'dead' black hole. The way black holes' radioactivity reduces as it's life goes on implies that they eventually fade into oblivion. We haven't even been around long enough to see one die though!

To answer your question, nobody knows, but there are plenty of theories. 




 Your nerves would eventually become disconnected, but I would think so up until that point. It would probably happen rather quickly though. 




 No it would actually be significantly more than that. How big would you consider a baseball? Ten inches around? That's about seven times more than the black hole you used in the event horizon calculator.

And you could absolutely not stand next to such an object without feeling considerable gravitational pull, but again you would most likely not be pulled  apart until you had passed the event horizon.

Think about it this way, you are feeling the mass of the entire Earth right now. Even if you were to tunnel down into the mantle of the Earth, it's gravitational force on you would not increase (in fact it would decrease but lets not go down that tangent). Your argument seems to be based off of Earth's consolidated mass creating a stronger pull, a pull that could effect you as you got closer to it. While it would eventually do that, it would not really happen until you were extremely close to it. 




 The two don't seem mutually exclusive. You could very well be spaghettified and then crushed! 




 It goes both ways... 




 [You're the best.] (http://24.media.tumblr.com/72dfc38636c9175f78dff498af34ea2f/tumblr_mqg385B0IR1qz581wo8_500.gif) 




 Oh yes, it would be like swimming against a much much stronger current. Once you go through the event horizon though, you fall off the waterfall at the end of the river. Even if you could overcome the current at this point, there is no getting back, not matter what. Unless you could go faster than the speed of light, but that the point where the laws of physics break down so lets not go there. 




 Think about it from the prospective that at any moment, all of your problems could be instantly destroyed and rendered meaningless! 




 An event horizon the size of a baseball would be absolutely tiny. So small in fact that while it could theoretically be created, it could not occur naturally. Anyhow, depending on it's exact specifications, it's gravitational pull probably wouldn't strongly extend all that far. You would probably break up someplace within the event horizon.

Gravitational pull doesn't increase as size decreases. 




 They probably don't all get their energy the same way, there are many ways it could happen though. When two things pass they each exert a gravitational force on one another. When an asteroid flys by Earth for example the Earth pulls it significantly closer but the asteroid also pulls the Earth very marginally off of it's orbit (we're talking immeasurably small distances here). If something went by a black hole it could get it moving extremely slowly the same way. And they usually don't have an orbit to stop them, once they're moving they don't stop. The bigger the object going by, the more it would move the black hole. If a moving black hole was to eventually pass by another object close to it's size (another black hole for example), they could slingshot each other flying into space at very high speeds. 




 No, the spaghettification doesn't happen until you pass through the event horizon regardless of the black holes size. I think that was what he was referring to by 'pulled apart'. 




 If **ANYTHING** even attached to you touches it, you're done. I saw an article or something that used a shoelace as an example. If so much as an aglet slipped through, there would be no escaping. 




 I don't think so, they don't each move at the same velocity. How could that happen if say two black holes were moving away from one another? Regardless, everything is moving. The galaxy the black hole is in for example be moving, so the black hole inside of it couldn't exactly just not move while staying in the same place within it.

Either way, the general theories of cosmology, which usually follows the big bang theory, prevent there from being a center to the universe. Even though it's all theoretical, I personally don't think there is one. 




 Sorry, where? This isn't easy on an iPhone.

EDIT: Fixed.
 




 I'm not exactly sure what you mean I guess. What is the difference between dying and ceasing to exist? I don't think it matters though, you certainly wouldn't live through it. A big black hole would pull you apart just as much as a small one. If anything it would even do it faster with its extra gravity. No one knows what would happen at the singularity, but you would probably be broken down into pieces so infinitely small that we couldn't even come up with a measurement for them.

I haven't read the article you're referring to though, I could be completely 100% wrong. 




 Absolutely, we're pretty safe though. The nearest black hole is about 6,000 light years away, not close enough to ever do any damage. Even the closest stars that could potentially go supernova are far enough away to be completely harmless. Personally, I'd love to see Betelgeuse explode, but that probably won't happen in my life. Or if its already happened, I probably won't be around to see it.

What's **really** scary though are rogue black holes. As the name would imply, rouge black holes don't have much of a fixed position. They wander around the galaxy aimlessly swallowing up anything in their path. Anything unfortunate to somehow resist a black hole's intense gravitaty and get close enough to touch it's event horizon would be immediately swallowed up never to be seen again. Well that's not exactly true I guess. Theoretically, you'll actually be able to see someone go into a black hole, or at least right up to the very edge of it. As gravity slows the speed of the image escaping though, it will appear the object getting sucked in will move towards the event horizon infinitely slowly until it almost stops moving completely. Eventually, the image will fade away long before it actually disappears into the black hole. Whats really happening that you can't see from the outside is called 'spaghettification'. I've just realized how much I wrote, anyone still reading please know this tangent has gone very far from 'black holes are terrifying'.

Anyhow, spaghettification is pretty much as bad as it sounds, and not nearly as delicious. As you are standing right now, or probably sitting, your feet are experiencing stronger gravity than your head because it is closer to the source of the gravity (the central Earth). The same thing happens in a black hole but to a much much larger scale. So much larger in fact that if you were to go into a black hole feet first, you would be stretched out with your feet stretching further than your head because they are under more gravitational strain. Spaghettification. Eventually you would be stretched out soooo far that what used to be your body would now be a single file line of atoms. In theory, they would keep spreading apart until they reached the singularity, the center of the black hole. Any theories regarding what happens at the singularity have very little to base off themselves off though, so its hard to know what happens next.

There are supposedly hundreds of rogue black holes bouncing around our galaxy. Although the methods of detection are getting better, they aren't perfect. A black hole could be flying at us right now and we wouldn't even know it. Personally, I'd rather have it that way. There is nothing we can do to stop or get out of the way of a black hole, so I'd rather not know it was coming than know inevitable spaghettification was looming around the corner.

TL;DR: Supermassive black holes=scary, rogue black holes=potential spegitification for the entire Earth (but probably not :) )

EDIT: Sorry about the rogue, rouge confusion, I'm on my phone, this isn't very easy to fix.

EDIT 2: It *is* rogue! I looked it up.

 The very definition of clickbait 




 Bulls/White Sox because I used to live in Chicago, Patriots because I've always absolutely loved their style of play, Penguins because I'm also a big fan of the animal and PSG because Pauleta! I started following most of these teams as a kid and it just stuck with me. 




 I have a similar rule of thumb. If it can't  be said in 5 lines of text, a call is easier. Unless there is already a text conversation in progress.

 In the other side of the spectrum, milk and pineapple somehow work together amazingly just as a snack. Like deceptively good. Locanda Verde has a desert made up almost exclusively of those two ingredients. I *highly* recommend literally anyone try it. 




 /r/humblebrag 




 I regularly watch the History Channel.

I'm like a genius. 




 Wait...you guys don't do that? 




 Wtf dude you left by far the biggest spoiler uncovered. 




 Inspired by [this] (http://youtu.be/). 




 Woah, cleavage. 




 Galifinaski. Plural. 




 The one and only. 




 Last comment I posted was "You know you're famous when your dick shows up on the front page in an hour and a half".

I'm so sorry Mr. Rogers... 




 Wow, you know you're famous when your dick to shows up on the front page of Reddit in an hour and a half. 




 ...you expected sarcasm. Sarcasm is what you expected. 




 If you're trying to come up with an example of one of their badly written songs, you've chosen a terrible one. What is this supposed to prove anyways? That your weak attempt at scat was somehow comparable?

If you actually take 20 seconds to understand the lyrics, its far from badly written. I'm not even sure why you'd need to take 20 seconds though, it's pretty easy to catch them as they go by. Around the World is definitely not my favorite, even a little overrated in my opinion, but still, not sure which point of yours this supposedly backs up.

Aside from all that, why judge a band solely off one characteristic? Even if you don't like the writing, the bass work is phenomenal, Flea is one of the best there's ever been and that's simply not debatable. The guitar has kind of been all over the place, but John Frusciante who played the majority of their albums was fantastic. The newer one is okay, but he's more of a filler now. Chad Smith is obviously awesome. Extremely talented, I honestly can't think of a bad thing about him. He brings a lot of order and direction to a band that's otherwise all over the place.

Apart from the performers, the production has always been done in precise minimalist taste by a number of talented producers. Rick Ruben, Danger Mouse, George Clinton, etc. All legends. Not many can say they've had a line up like that.

I could go on, but I won't. My point is, there are plenty of bands I don't like certain characteristics about. I don't let those few flaws ruin them for me though, instead I look past them to understand what really makes them great.
The Red Hot Chili Peppers have never been about the writing. In fact they've been known for *not* being about the writing. To say they suck because their songs are badly written is like saying Bob Dylan sucks because he has a boring voice. It's completely missing the point.

Again though, what point were you trying to make with the link? 




 Nothing says hair bands like The Beatles, Pink Floyd and Michael Jackson.

 I used to have a teacher named Mr. Dangler. Mr. *Harold* Dangler. Yup. Harry Dangler. Unluckily for me, he was a second grade teacher so none of us understood how hilarious it was to have a teacher with a name like that. Anyhow I was walking by his desk when I saw something with his first name on it. "Congratulations, Harry!" or something. I couldn't hold in my giggles, this was second grade, knowing a teachers first name was a BIG deal. The next time he called on me in class, I made sure to address him as 'Sir Harry of Dangler'. We were putting on some mid evil play in class, this was perfect. Apparently when I said it he thought I understood the hilarity of his name and sent me straight to the principals office. As a newer principle, she couldn't understand how a second grader had come up with in insult like 'hairy dangler'. It probably made it a little worse when I told her I had seen it on his desk.

TL;DR: Called a teacher by his first name, got in trouble, probably go him involved in some sort of school investigation. 




 I'd rather just give you some recommendations than my favorites. You would probably like them better.

OutKast is kind of R Bish rap. [Ms. Jackson] (http://youtu.be/MYxAiK6VnXw) or [The Way You Move] (http://youtu.be/xI5NQ-0Ubfs) are both geeat.

The Heavy are awesome. Some kind of magical blend of soul, indie rock and even a little rap put together in one significantly underrated band. [Same Ol'] (http://youtu.be/4OAkUelXoVY), [How You Like Me Now?] (http://youtu.be/sVzvRsl4rEM)

Ever listen to the Beastie Boys? They're style is a little underproduced by today's standards (yes, I know, Rick Ruben. Still too 'acoustic' for today's audiences), but some of the newer mashups with them are awesome. Try [this one] (http://youtu.be/XL0YWTPDMUI) on for size.

Rage Against the Machine is probably my favorite rock-rap band. You may or may not have heard the hits, but [Guerrilla Radio] (http://youtu.be/H0kJLW2EwMg) and [Now Sleep in the Fire] (http://youtu.be/w211KOQ5BMI) are awesome too. Audio Slave is basically the same band with a different (and in my humble opinion better) singer, Chris Cornell. [Like a Stone] (http://youtu.be/7QU1nvuxaMA) isn't my favorite, but it's up there.

Redlight King is okay, he takes some pretty cool creative risks. A [Neil Young rap cover] (http://youtu.be/lGt54Ozo8LQ) for example. Not exactly a cover I guess, but still pretty cool.

How about early Snoop Dogg? Like Doggystyle early? [Murder Was the Case] (http://youtu.be/Do4fA8tONY4), [Doggy Dogg World] (http://youtu.be/En3IgstEmcU), [Gin and Juice] (http://youtu.be/0Cxr1-b6Xkc), etc. The whole album is awesome, somehow both ahead of it's time and nostalgic simultaneously. Probably my favorite by him.

I think you might like Sublime too. They have a cool chill style. [What I Got] (http://youtu.be/0Uc3ZrmhDN4) is good, [Santeria] (http://youtu.be/AEYN5w4T_aM) is better.

Bad Religion is probably one of the best-of not, *the* best-punk rock bands of all time. [American Jesus  (http://youtu.be/12kcpP-8jfM), and of course, the sacred [Los Angeles Is Burning] (http://youtu.be/BxoD9zWY9Rg). They even released a Christmas album a few years back. I would recommend it to anyone that loves punk and Christmas.

Wolfmother anyone? Awesome band, they're one of the last bands that play a lot of older classic rock styles. [Joker and the Theif] (http://youtu.be/3afXXsJwYZo) is definitely my favorite song of theirs. Literally everyone I've ever shown it to has liked it. And then theres [Woman] (http://youtu.be/GN7syX6tz18) obviously. Their entire last album was good too, 'New Crown'.

 I can not believe that I'm the 70th comment and first to even mention New Jersey. Progress.

 Yeah but the answer is really really Florida.

 I would place some serious bets on American Pharo. I got a hunch. 




 Thats not in A Feast For Crows. I'd be a little disappointed if I didn't already hear about this particular spoiler. 




 That would be a HUGE spoiler for them to keep a secret for this long. Very few people are even expecting it at this point.

 The hype train has offered left the station!

 "Are you kidding me? It's not even close, Tormund looks way more awesome! Oh wait thats you" 




 Oh shit...this cliff hanger could carry over on two separate mediums...I don't think I could take that.

EDIT: After seeing some of the theories in these comments and reading the actor quotes again, I wouldn't be surprised to see a couple huge twists instead of just one. In fact there are two I'm like 75% sure could both totally happen in that episode 10. The hype train has officially left the station.

 That would explain the attitude you're getting from your grandma. 




 Not at all, I even got ahold of a lot of their b sides and bonus tracks to try and get into their edgier less mainstream stuff. Some of that was okay but an overwhelming majority wasn't. 




 Not even...Riders? 




 Glad we could get an expert opinion on this one. 




 Drake/Jay Z. I don't understand how they got so far. Jay Z is okay, but he has absolutely no flow, it's like listening to someone read a book. And nothing else about him really stands out as above average. Drake is just...boring. He raps about cheesy shit that gets him radio time. "Started at the bottom now we here". Really? Such a lame line that somehow became so popular. I'm getting off topic. There's a few songs by both Drake and Jay Z that I like, but they're both insanely over rated. Countless rappers out there not getting any recognition could put them to shame. 




 I like to play with little things I'm holding. I can spin and twirl my keys like a true professional. I can flip and twist my phone in the air like it's an Olympic figure skater gently gliding over the ice. I just like to toss and catch the things I'm holding. I know where you think this going but trust me, it's worse. Anyhow, I had just got out of the shower and was brushing my teeth and combing my hair. Normal morning stuff. I picked up a little Axe spray bottle and did a few toss-flips. I then decided to do an extra high toss. It was ambitious, but I was feeling good about myself. I bent down and gently sent it upwards sailing towards the heavens. It spun just inches below the ceiling, a perfect throw. I readied myself for the decent, hand out, knees bend, eyes locked. This was it, this is why we play the game. The Axe was spinning too fast to attempt a right-side-up catch, I would just need to go for the hail mary. The unpredictable spinning reception. The bottle came back down to Earth with more force than ever. Two feet away. One foot. Six inches. Contact. The bottle hit my hand held directly in front of me. The force proved greater than I had anticipate. It was enough to press the specially designed Axe release valve down, and send a fine mist of deodorant directly into my open mouth. Try and picture how dumb that must have looked. Tossing a bottle up, catching it upside down, it sprays into my mouth at point blank range. [It wasn't great for my self esteem.] (http://i.imgur.com/bjZTGSX.jpg?fb)

 I was okay with Alan, but his wife was unbearable. "We're going to take your money" First of all, 'we'? Is she doing anything at all to contribute? Second, your going to take their money? I'm sorry, weren't you generously invited here to play a game and maybe even land a spot in their big contest? You don't have to act like they owe you anything. Ug, there aren't many of them, but some people just get to me. 




 Yeah... The moon was an example but they're ahead of the game pretty much across the board. 




 Space innovation and exploration. In terms of the moon alone, only three countries have reached the moon at all (hopefully a fourth in 2017). Three! And China's was only two years ago! But the U.S. not only got to the moon, but visited it in person and returned back to Earth. Twelve Americans walked across the moon, no one else has come even close. Which kinda sucks, because the space race is over, it's not a competition anymore.

 Get off of Reddit. You've got to stop enabling me. 
























 Numbers? 




 Based on the very little I know about this sport, I feel expanding the 'court' to allow a third player on each team would make it a lot better. A goalie who maybe had a bike geared (pun unintended) towards less actual movement and more blocking (I have no idea what such a bike would look like. Scenes from Mad Max come to mind), almost like the special gear of a hockey goalie. Without a dedicated goal keeper the threat of the hail-mary-cherry-picker is all to real. A third player would also add to the intensity and awesomeness.

I feel like I'm writing a letter to the minister of cycle ball or something. 




 Welp, I'm off to Google 'quasi-legally'.

 I grossly misunderstood two things about your story:

**A:** I thought you were a girl the whole time. Not sure why, sorry about that. Had to reread a second time to figure that out.

**B:** I thought they were 6 and 11 years younger than *you*. I could not for the life of me understand why you were taking a nine year old (don't disprove me with math, I'm in no condition) to an R rated movie, let alone smoking with them. Had to reread about three and a half times before I figured that one out.

**C:** How was Ted

 **The Battle of Red Cliffs**

Unlike most military victories where the smaller side somehow scares the other side into foolishly fleeing or surrendering, Zhou Yu beat 800,000 men with his measly 50,000 *in battle*. He did it by first antagonizing the opposing Emperor Cao Cao to attacking his position across the Yangtze River. Before crossing however, one of his spies working as an adviser for Cao Cao recommended that he chain his ships together to 'reduce sea sickness among the unseasoned soldiers'. As soon as Yu saw the misinformed fleet attempt to cross he sent fire boats at them, which started a fire that spread to every ship given their conveniently close proximity to one another. That was the battle that ended the Han dynasty. Imagine being the person that ended your own dynasty with 800,000 men against 50,000. And that's just the smallest estimate, others said it was upwards of 200,000. 




 Holy shit, those birds from the Windex commercials were right... 




 (Yes) ? 




 I'll pretend to get it 




 It's just 'Pound', not Pound Town. Nice try, OP. 




 "She definitely noticed" 




 No, it's just bad. I assume you're on Netflix? Instead, watch...

**[Nightcrawler] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kYDQan8bw)** Unless you're easily creeped out. Jake Gyllenhaal plays a rather...odd character, and he absolutely nail the roll. It's good though, all about people who film accidents and dangerous events for the news and maybe even go a little too far to get the shot. Awesome movie, I might be over hyping the creepiness a little.

**[The Big Lebowski] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cd-go0oBF4Y)** Hilarious, well at least to normal people. Some don't seem to 'understand' this type of humor. I've honestly never loved Jeff Bridges more than after seeing The Big Lebowski, and that's saying a lot for me. In my humble opinion, everyone in the world should see this movie.

**[Dark Skies] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8iLp1xQtPQ)** One of my favorite and most underrated horror movies out there. Soo many good ideas in it, I'm not sure who directed Dark Skies but they did a great job. And J.K. Simmons is in it! Totally my tempo.

**[Chef] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgFws3AoIUY)** *WARNING: THIS WILL MAKE THE MUNCHIES ABOUT A MILLION TIMES WORSE. PROCEED WITH CAUTION* I have no idea how they got so many big name actors in an indie movie, but they did it. I'm usually not one for the easy, unstimulating watches, but they managed to keep this movie a little edgy at the same time. Would definitively recommend.

**[Inglorious Bastards] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AtLlVNsuAc)** One of my favorite Tarantino movies out there. Plenty of blood and gore so be prepared for that. If you like that one, you'll love **[Django] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUdM9vrCbow)** too. Christopher Waltz and Quentin Tarantino together again! Django also (although it isn't a commedy movie) has one of the [funniest scenes] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsaxyraBdQ8) ever too. Not sure why Jonah Hill agreed to come out just for one scene, but I'm sure glad he did. Amazing acting in both movies.

**[Hot Fuzz] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayTnvVpj9t4)** I can't be the only one that fucking loves Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Personally, my favorite is Paul, but that one isn't on Netflix. Awesome awesome awesome movie though.

**[Arrested Development] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfU2Td_MMf0)** It's not a movie (it's a TV show) but just give the first episode a shot, and I promise there's like a 70% chance you'll absolutely fall in love with it. Probably my favorite comedy TV show of all time. And Netflix is making season 5 as we speak! 




 I won't even ask how the lighter fits into the equation. 




 In my experience, everything suddenly turns to slow motion, you turn to your smoke mates in despair, cue [the dream] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16i0_NdPowE t=0m10s), and dramatically drop the roach off the bow of the ship as you wipe a lone tear from your eye. Adieu, sweet blunt, adieu.

 To be fair, both have lead to some shaky personal decision making.

Drunk = Lets go swimming in the local pond!

Stoned = Do you think peanut butter and sour cream would go well together?

I'd say they can both potentially be 'harmful', but with weed the only person you could harm is yourself.

 I dropped a quarter. Yup, I dropped a fucking quarter. I was at bagel store paying the last dollar in change, I like to give exact change if I can. I dropped the quarter, picked it up, hit my head on the counter on the way up. I imagine someone knocking themselves out by hitting their head on a counter probably looked pretty funny from a third person prospective, but it wasn't nearly as humorous from mine. A few moments later I woke up and was driven to the hospital by one of the girls that worked there. I insisted that I was fine but apparently it wasn't up for debate (I think the very grumpy owner was worried about getting sued). As we crossed an intersection about half way to the hospital the back of her car got hit by a speeding driver. As it turns out, this guy was a pretty hard core drug dealer. He had a metric SHIT TON of weed, cocaine and other drugs I haven't even heard of in his car. As compensation for the damage and agreeing not to call the cops, he gave the bagel girl $6,000ish in cash, and me $1,500 for going with it I guess. There was a giant nug of weed between one of her little stacks of money, not sure if that was an accident or not. Anyhow, we didn't go to the hospital I just said we should go get her car fixed. We're still very close friends today. The drug dealer gave her his number in case he didn't give her enough money (which was absurd, her whole car wasn't worth that much). That ended up having it's own impact on our lives too. Not even necessarily in the way you'd expect, we kind of know him now, he invites us to a lot of parties.

EDIT: Reading this over makes me realize my life could have been a lot more boring.

**TL;DR Dropped a quarter in a store, bent down to pick it up, knocked myself out on the counter on the way up, got driven to the hospital by a worker, her car got hit by a drug dealer on the way there, he gave us a lot of money to not call the cops and for the damage, still know them both pretty well today and have a pretty good party story.** 




 17 (I think). I drank half of a smallish bottle of rum (as I was told was the customary amount) and ended up stealing a probably very expensive but rather small ice sculpture, climbed a street light, accidentally marched in a gay pride parade, and then returned half of the ice sculpture and a case of bottled water. I'm told who ever owned the sculpture didn't share our sense of humor. I didn't stick around to see for myself. Didn't puke though! Saved that for the second time. 




 You would love Ruth's Chris.

EDIT: Sorry, thought this was *favorite* political correctness. 




 even when he'd do terrible things (killing his own brother comes to mind)

Really? *That's* what comes to mind?? 




 Go to kids sports games with friends and sit really really far away so we don't piss off the parents. Then we announce the game as if it is a professional level event, developing elaborate back stories for the players as we go. We end up cheering for both teams, as well as cheering against both teams (not loud enough for them to hear obviously). Chants and songs have been developed for each team, and even a few players. Celebration dances and typical sporting event crowd nonsense (the 'wave' for example) are also included. We've even gone as far to ask the kids for autographs and fist bumps after the games. They just think it's awesome, and the moms tend to be too naive to suspect anything. Everyone has a good time. 




 As a son of over protective parents, I feel I should stress the importance of not being overbearing. Not something you have to worry about anytime soon, but especially for when they get to be 13-18. My parents were crazy, they put parental controls on everything (computer, TV, phones, etc.), they didn't allow dating, I couldn't stay out past 9:30 and I couldn't see friends on weekdays. It was incredibly embarrassing and just encouraged me to become increasingly secretive and sneaky. I've seen it over and over again, families that are run by strict parents don't encourage trust. Don't make the same mistakes. I know it's a long way down the road, but something to keep in mind.

 I'm sorry, had to log on just to call complete bull shit on that. Your first time might have been awesome, but it *definitely* doesn't have to be anywhere near the best you can expect. I can clearly remember my first two times, and neither of them were anything special. In contrast to yours, it just goes to show that every time is different. There are a ton of factors that could go into why it wasn't the same, but you're tolerance probably isn't one of them. It may have gone up marginally since the first time, but not enough to make that big a difference.

I would recommend next time you do it in the early/middle day. That would leave you better rested and make it easier to resist the urge to go to sleep when it comes and go do something fun instead. fatmenareepiccooks was actually right though about indicas causing sleepiness in perticular, I would try a sativa if you could get your hands on it.

Every method is slightly different too. Somking, edibles, vaping, dabbing, etc. are all different in their own ways. Edibles tend to be more intense and longer lasting, I personally like them better, but you could easily have an equally good-even better-experience another way, say smoking. I would also try it with other people, that's usually more fun. Just do your own thing though and don't take any thing anyone says too seriously (including me). In the end everyone is different, so go try everything out by yourself and don't be deterred or motivated based off of what people say on the internet. Good luck! 




 Varys, Ned Stark, Stannis Barathron, Hot Pie (not even kidding), Khal Drogo, Arya Stark, Bronn, Davos Seaworth, Margery Tyrell, Syrio Forel and Joffrey Baratheon.

In contrast, they missed: Daario Naharis (both times), Jamie Lannister, Theon Greyjoy, Mance Rayder, Renly Baratheon, Meera/Jojen Reed, every single Sand Snake and all of the characters they left out but shouldn't have.

Not that all the characters they missed were necessarily worse, or bad even, but they were very different from the versions GRRM had laid out in the books. 




 It didn't work. 




 Woah, how did you still find this? 




 Lots of people quit watching the show because they hate getting attached to characters just to see them die. I've been pretty on board with it though, I like how it makes the show more realistic, the good guys don't always win. That being said, I would be so done with this shit if any of that happened.

EDIT: After thinking about it, I think we can discount this one. Azor Ahai is supposed to have some sort of ancestral link to the Targaryens, which Jorah obviously doesn't. The only two *real* contenders are Dany and Jon, no matter how you try and look at it. 




 Fuckin' Olly 




 I think Balon's was more of a "Quick! They're not looking, grab what you can!"

EDIT: Some of the comments regarding comparisons to World War II, ISIS and renaissance era diplomacy have taken this comment way too seriously... 




 You left out a few:

* Trystane Martell: I don't think he will have a *huge* roll in the next season, but they wouldn't have taken him along for the ride if he wasn't going to make a few appearances. Maybe another trial by combat volunteer like Oberyn? Maybe they'll find someone else for him to marry up in Kings Landing? His little story line is very uncertain, but he'll almost certainly be back.

* Jorah: There's a good chance he either dies, or cuts off his arm this season. I don't see him cutting it off, they already did that whole thing with Jamie. He could survive without cutting it off, but that only happens very rarely. Either way, he'll have a rough time on his road trip with Daario, and I wouldn't be shocked if he didn't make it through the season.

* Arya: She regains her sight after she kills the guy on the docks like she was supposed to. In the books that what happened, accept her blindness was a part of the training, not a punishment. Either way she eventually gets it back and becomes a near fully trained faceless man by the end of the season. Maybe even hitches a ride back to Westeros with Dany.

* Lady Stoneheart: I feel like GRRM wouldn't bring her back unless she was pretty important. I'd love to find out what that important thing is in season 6/Winds of Winter. What ever this 'thing' is though, I think we can guarantee it's very revenge based. S6E9 anyone?

* Stannis: I personally think he's dead. On the off chance I'm wrong though, he could make a big difference in the story line. He doesn't have an army though, so he wouldn't have to team up with or join someone that does.

* Davos: I love him as an honorary member of the nights watch. He really has no where else to go at this point. I hope they don't abandon the story line though.

* Jon: I know you covered Jon, but I can't imagine them holding on to Jon's body for 10 episodes. They are going to burn him, but and either hes dead, or he'll walk out of the fire like Dany with a little help from Mel. Him and Dany supposedly have similar ancestory after all, it's not a stretch to expect they'll both be 'reborn' in the same way.

* Bran/Rickon: Not sure why they missed a season, I guess they're story is a little slow. I really want them to be in the opening scene. Anyhow, major potential spoilers: [Season 6/Winds of Winter] (#g "In the books, Bran can see back in time using weirwood trees. There is a theory that Bran will discover Jon's parentage this way, since Rhaegar and Lyanna were supposedly very conveniently married in secret under a weirwood tree. I think this will be the way R+L=J will be revealed, assuming it does. Rickon, Meera, Hodor and that other girl whos name I forget will go down to Castle Black to deliver the news. Mostly because it would be very boring for them to stick around in the same place all season, and someone needs to tell Jon. I think this is likely because they need a way for Bran to stay engaged in the story. If this, or something else pretty major, doesn't happen, he'll just be sitting around watching everyone else but not actually interacting at all.") I wanted to block that just because it would be pretty huge if it turned out to be correct.

* Uncle Ben: They put up too much hype around him for him not to show up eventually. That might not be season 6 though, they could push it all the way back to 7 if they wanted. Still, I think we're closing in on his grand appearance. He could very well be an ice zombie by now though. Some people think he would be a white walker, but that only happens to the ones that were taken and raised from birth. And it seems very unlikely that he survived north of the wall for that long.

* Cersi: She has something wrong with her foot and everything goes down hill for her from there. It was said that 'Jamie was born holding Cersi's foot in his hand'. Having Jamie's hand cut off and Cersi's foot somehow injured would be pretty symbolic. And Qyburn said something about her injured foot at the end of season 5. Either way, she's completely and utterly defeated leaving Tommen and Jamie to run Westeros on their own. She might kill that nun though.

* Robin: Everyone's favorite brat gets to come back with Littlefinger. That's gonna suck. He might end up marrying Sansa eventually too, if Ramsey dies. I assume his time becoming less of a bitch has been slightly transformative for him, but not enough for him to be the least bit likable.

* Sam: He and Gilly and Sam go down to Oldtown where he gets a probably dull but potentially interesting story line involving how he becomes a maester. We get to see Oldtown, yay! He comes back to castle black by the end of the season but leaves Gilly and Sam in Oldtown for safekeeping.

* Hot Pie: Stories of his kidney pie and wolf cookies spread throughout the Seven Kingdoms. In every great hall, songs are sung about how he didn't give up on the gravy, and how he got his hands on a good bottom round steak despite the ongoing war. His new found fame has made him the lands first celebrity chef. His new restaurant, 'Cuisine de Tartes Chaudes', has a wait list that goes back ten months, you need to know someone to get in. He regularly caters to exclusive events, such as Clegane Bowl I and the Purple Wedding. His new book 'Unburnt, Unbraised, Unbroiled, How a Visionary from Flea Bottom Changed the World of Cooking' is highly anticipated, and is said to be coming out some time after The Winds of Winter. He's writing as fast as he can.

 Would you rather have nothing? Because there is/was no other way to do it. 




 He doesn't speak of having any association with the lord of light until he [ADWD] (#b "is on his death bed"). At that point it seems as if he desperately needs someone to pass on the information so he brings it up. The people he tells just think he's crazy at that point, it's just for the dramatic irony. Personally though, I believed he was right. I can't explain why, just the way GRRM had it play out in the books.

EDIT: Actually now that I think about it, Ameon has talked about it in events prior. I still think he's a more reliable source considering Mel's inconsistency. 




 I think he said he had a three way with a married couple he met on OkCupid when he was a crazy 19 year old. And then he said he said he was currently 20. 




 That's awesome. 




 "Once in a blue moon" 




 I was expecting something like "I'm 34 now". For all we know dude, that could have happened yesterday. 




 I'm so conflicted about giving you an upvote for the best possible answer to this question, or a downvote for one of the most messed up things I've ever heard. 




 Could we at least substitute it with 'that's what she said'? 




 They absolutely are, did you even read the books? Why do you think Jon is dead? Or Arya is blind? Or Cersi confessed? Of course there are some major changes, but the show still follows the general path GRRM has laid out, especially with regards to major events. 




 1. Varys is the master of secrets and his little birds
2. A popular fan theory concerns the mother of Jon
3. Joer is the father of Jorah, who used to trade slaves
4. An infamous disease is greyscale, which in the show is currently infecting Jorah
5. Ramsey Snow was legitimized by his father
6. Jeyne Pool was substituted by Sansa in the show
7. Qyburn is not an actual maester
8. The first city Daenerys visited was Qarth 




 I don't think there is any reason to be 'three', and I honestly don't even see any signs pointing in that direction other than the sidgle. If they wanted Aegon to be in the show, they would have introduced him already. And what reason is there for him to be the 'ice representative' (feels funny to say it like that)? In the books there is nothing to support that. 




 [ADWD] (#b "If this goes by the books I think we can go ahead and dis-confirm this. Before dying I think Ameon said something like "Melisandre was wrong, Stan isn't the chosen one, Dany is". There is obviously a decent chance it might not go by the books, but that would be a pretty huge thing to change between the two story lines.") 




 Wishful thinking. As much as I would love to see that, the one other time they tried a flashback it really fell flat. Especially as a season opener. It also seems like way too big of an event to put into the opening minutes of the first episode. I mean book readers have been waiting for years and years for this, and it's going to happen five minutes into season 6? I couldn't imagine it going down that distastefully. 




 Holy shit it might just be me but that actually seems like a lot. How much was in each bag? 




 Instantly. Literally before you even knew it. 




 Well the stregenth of gravity is inversely proportional to it's distance from it's source, but it will never reach zero. That means that yes, us humans are effecting the gravitational strain on literally everything that has mass, including black holes.

This however is really only significant on a mathematical level. The amount of gravitational influence we would give off to such a huge object so far away would be as close to none at all as you could get.

Most galaxies in fact have a super massive black hole at their center. Ours does. It acts similarly to the Sun in our solar system, but on a much much larger scale.

The Sun is pulling towards us gravitationally, but we are in an orbit because we also have inertia. Think about it, if it was *only* the Sun's gravity we would be pulled right into it. Instead our own momentum keeps us orbiting the Sun.

We don't orbit in a perfect circle because the momentum could almost never be perfect enough to allow for such a thing to happen, regardless of other forces pulling on us. There really is no such thing as a perfect circular orbit.

Theoretically any black hole could gather the entire mass of the universe. Lucky for us, the black hole would probably decay before swallowing up everything. Although the universe is not yet old enough for it to happen yet, black holes will eventually die out. Despite how ridiculously long their lifetimes are, I doubt one would be able to collect all of the mass of the universe before fading away.

If it did somehow achieve this though, it probably would not explode. Nothing can escape a black hole, not light or even an explosion. Even if something was to explode inside the black hole, it wouldn't be able to even effect anything on the outside. It probably wouldn't recreate the Big Bang. 




 Spaghettiception. 




 I hate to break it to you, but yes. 




 They can decay theoretically, though the universe is not yet old enough to even come to the end of a black hole's life. 




 They can decay theoretically, though the universe is not yet old enough to even come to the end of a black hole's life. 




 A black hole is as large as it's apparent horizon, not it's event horizon. A black hole the size of a baseball would have an even horizon much much further away. 




 I'm not sure where you go that from. The center of the Earth has no gravitational pull. It slowly becomes stronger as you move towards the surface. Once you get there it slowly recedes again as you move away into the atmosphere. The 'source' is the consolidation of it's mass. It pulls you towards it's center because that is it's central most point of mass. 




 I saw an opportunity and I jumped on it. 




 You could obviously never get that close to the event horizon in the first place with out being sucked in. That was just an example. 




 The size of a black hole is not the size of its event horizon. The black hole itself is the mass that makes it up. It's event horizon is the point at which that masses gravitational pull overcomes the force of light.

The very definition of singularity is it's so small it cannot become smaller, yet your argument is based off of making a black hole smaller? Shrunk to the size of a nickel? He was speaking in theory, it's not possible. 




 Your nerves would eventually become disconnected, but I would think  up until that point it would probably hurt. I mean imagine your hand falling off one atom at a time within a minute. You're loosing big chunks of hand at a time, that cant possibly feel great.

In the end, no one has experienced it, and even if they did they wouldn't live to talk about it, so we'll never know. It would probably happen rather quickly though. 




 There is so much that would kill us before we got to the black hole, this is just a 'what if'. 




 It would probably be doomed to fail. If we could harness the energy of just gravity, our energy crisis would be solved!

Many believe black holes *are* wormholes and that if you were to somehow survive the journey into one you would come out in another part of the universe or even in a different universe all together. This is all theory though, it would be impossible to prove. 




 It would happen with both. The singularity leaves no survivors. Once you pass within the event horizon you are exposed to roughly the same gravity no matter the size of the black hole, to an extent of course. 




 If it's in your pocket, than your already well with it's event horizon though... What point does that make supporting what you're saying?  




 Well we could be sucked towards a black hole before reaching the event horizon, that just the point at which we wouldn't be able to escape.

But yes, one could pull us without destroying the planet. As long as the gravitational pull is strong enough to overcome that of the sun and the inertia of the Earth's orbit, but not strong enough to suck us in, we would be pulled off of our orbit.

That applies to anything that has a gravitational pull though, not necessarily a black hole.

 Not physically addictive? Marijuana is addictive, it's a fact. Slightly less addictive than alcohol (alcohol is addictive to about 11% of the people that try it, marijuana is to 9%). There are negative physical and mental characteristics to extended use of marijuana, as well as a few positive ones. It's proven, it's a fact. I'm in support of legalizing it, but it's naive to say it's not physically or mentally addictive. 




 That time it is was time for dinner and it was dog food again. That was the best.

* The National Institutes of Health was given $800,000 to study the impact of a 'genital washing program' on South African men. 




 Fun fact: Even when compensating for inflation, the price for the Titanic movie was double that of the actual Titanic. They could have literally built the entire ship again twice for what they spent on the movie.

 I doubt Disney does that, but Six Flags, Busch Gardens, etc. 




 I find lots of wealthy people are motivated by the 'because I can' factor. They sometimes accomplish things just to tell others about how they accomplished things. 




 I rephrased something I think. 




 I'm not talking about all one person. 




 The person I was talking about is actually Filipino, not sure why it makes a difference. He didn't exactly come out, I believe he went to Vijay, where ever that was. His parents set it up for his birthday even though he didn't want it. A lot of celebrities will do stuff for you if you make a generous donation to a charity with their name on it, or get them a sponsor, or even pay them directly. I'm not sure which they did. Anyhow, he said Vijay was a nice guy in general but he could be a little intense. I think he probably would have mentioned the racism if he had noticed it. 




 Jon Bon Jovi*? 




 An Acura is more than modest to a man who owns an exotic car dealership. 




 No, I'm Toby. He's Leonard. 




 Even as high as 1900 degrees. Have you ever been to one of the higher end steak houses? It works, trust me. 




 I'm not sure what to say, I'm definitely not the type to be asking about this. You know how an office building would probably have a room full of servers and computer stuff? Same idea except in a house. Everything is connected too, if you forgot to close the garage door you could do it from your terminal at your bed. If you want to turn the pool lights on, you could do it from the console in the kitchen. 




 Just an example, someone of his equal status. 




 I think it's mostly because it sounds fancy. Most people haven't visited North Dakota, they don't know if its any different, but its 'imported' so it must be better. 




 I'm not exactly sure how it works, but my best friend has a 'guy' who was literally at his house four days a week to work on his computer system. They were his only client. 




 She was more of the guest of honor. She gave a short little speech and everything. The host family was **very** rich though, she didn't stand out as much as you would think. 




 That's the point. 




 I don't know if it's legal, but they definitely aren't the type of people to give a shit if it wasn't. I've heard of people getting their houses zoned as airports or something so that they could land there, he might have done some sneaky legal thing like that. I'm not exactly sure how it works. It's not visible from the street, you can obviously hear it when it's on though. 




 I wouldn't say any of them are necessarily billionaires (its kind of hard to tell how much they make at some point), but definitely upwards of ten-millionares at the low end. It's not all that shocking, although my house isn't as big it fits into the area just fine. 




 Yeah I kinda do... My family is probably in the upper middle class, but definitely not rich. I live in like a 2,750 square foot house surrounded by mansions two or three times it's size. 




 I thought I replied to this earlier, but apparently the comment before it got deleted. I live on  a piece of land that's basically a cliff. The developers put in about 30 mansions right there, plus about four or five normal houses where they didn't have enough room for a big mansion. So theres like four normal families right in the middle of a very rich community. 




 New Jersey. They make it all kinds of ways, some commute to Wall Street, some are retired, some simply inherited it. Most of them are owners of companies, or owners of large franchises of big companies. There is even one very very well known rock star that lives five houses down. I'd love not to give up my address, but his name is at least as big as Lenny Kravitz.

 You don't draw dicks on the host, that's just common courtesy. 




 I don't get it, it can't work because my neighbor is rich and I'm not? It works, trust me. I basically live on a cliff where they put gigantic mansions facing the water. Where they didn't have room or land for full mansions the developer put in normal sized houses. There's about five families in my neighborhood that are 'normal', all of the rest are filthy rich. 




 Steak. Ever wonder why yours isn't as good as the top notch restaurants? Two reasons, the quality of the meat, and the temperature at which it's cooked. Most high end steak houses broil their steaks at about 1500+ degrees, theses nothing you can do about that one. You can how ever buy their quality of meat. USDA Prime is where it's at, you'll never get there with Choice or Select. 




 Swim directly towards the shark to establish dominance. 




 I'm not rich, but I live in a very very rich town. My neighbor has a helicopter sitting in his back yard, that kind of rich. People here buy some truly ridiculous things.

* Don't you hate, for example, when you get on your private jet to go across the country, but as soon as you get there you need to go rent a car? Well, people around here don't have that problem. They pay a service to ship their Ferraris and Lamborghinis to their destinations ahead of time so they can drive them when they get there. Yeah.

* I've been to family parties and events where famous people are simply summoned and show up. I count this as something they buy, because I think they are very often paid. Literally two weeks ago Laura Bush made an appearance at my friends family barbecue. A month or so before that, Tom Selleck came by for a dinner party.

* Sometimes they buy theme parks or things like that for a day. They just rent it out a while in advance and then throw a huge party. It's just as awesome as it sounds, all of the workers are there, but there's no lines. There is alcohol being served too, because it's a private event.

* They can by lessons from professional athletes or dinners from famous chefs. Sure you're not going to get Tom Brady to teach you how to play football, but Teddy Bridgewater? Sure, anytime. My neighbors kid, who absolutely hates golf, got personal lessons from Vijay Singh. For those of you that don't know, hes a pretty big deal. Rich people do this just to say they did though. They'll get a professional dedicated instructor who coaches the likes of Tiger Woods if they want to actually get good, but they just want to say they got a lesson and a picture with Vijay Singh.

* A lot of my friends have two or three exact copies of their phones in case one breaks. That in itself ins't all that expensive, but it just goes to show their mentality towards money. Who needs a silly thing like insurance when you could just buy three more? Crack a phone? No problem, got a fresh one in my pocket. Crash your McLaren? No problem, got a fresh on in the garage.

* Some times you have to buy 'people'. Not exactly what it sounds like, but say you're having trouble with your homes computer system (most people here have huge house wide computer terminals, I have no idea how they work), well then you need to go out an buy a personal IT guy for your house. From now on, you are his only client and his job is to reset your router once a week. Rich people don't have time for such things.*

* If you need literally anything as a rich person, you can basically buy it even if it doesn't exist. A parking lot for example. My neighbor once had a big party, but didn't have enough room for everyone to leave their exotic cars so my dad let him use our front yard to park some of them. Literally a day later he had our entire lawn resodded with grass imported from North Dakota. There are no problems if you have enough money, only creative solutions.

* A lot of rich people live surprisingly modest too. They're in the minority, but they exist. As a kid I used to work for a guy who owned an exotic car dealership. Even though he had about a dozen Ferraris and Lamborghinis, he perfected to drive an Acura sedan as his everyday car. Not even a particularly nice one. Even though there are better options within their budget, a lot of rich people sill prefer the 'average' things we use.

EDIT: I'd prefer not to say where I live, but I will say that one person guessed it. A lot got bordering towns. 




 I was at a concert once where a number of rambunctious individuals chose to climb up on pile of large speakers off to the side of the stage, and then play king of the hill from the top. One bouncer noticed and started ripping them off one by one. He eventually got to one shirtless guy who he grabbed by the leg. As if it was a natural defense mechanism, the shirtless man immediately turned and projectile vomited directly into the bouncers face. The bouncer lifted his hands to shield himself, which caused him to fall back into the crowd, crushing those he had just torn down from the speakers. The shirtless man then ascended back to the summit of the speakers and pounded his chest like a triumphant gorilla.

 I absolutely hate the new music app. I'm not paying for Apple Music, so I don't need that, I have a Twitter and Facebook so I really don't need or want the social media aspect, and if I use any type music radio it's Spotify, not iTunes Radio. It seems like Apple is trying to force a whole lot onto their users, and I for one don't like it. I like how the old app was customizable, how it didn't have all the shiny social media, even how it showed you the cover art of all your albums in landscape mode. Is there any way to get it back? I'll do anything.

Me: "Thanks, you too!..."


Movie theater person: "Enjoy your movie!"

Me: "Thanks, you too!..."


Person of the slightly larget than average persuasion: "Nice pecs, man"

Me: "Thanks, you too!..." She tought I was mocking her...had to awkwardly explain it wasn't her fatness, but rather my dumbness. 




 I would have like to see how the Yigritte story line played out, Myrcella was innocent, Jory Cassel was tragic, Syrio Forel would have been cool if he was still around, Shireen was..., Oberyn was *soooooo* close,  




 No, but you can't exactly fake being educated. 




 *All hail His Grace, Hot Pie of House Awesome, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm!* 




 And then I transform again, 'the super-magical lord of shockingly convenient *and now even invisible* fire'! The small folk shall call it the legend of Ricky Bobby. 




 I use my lighter to transform me from a normal man into...the super-magical lord of shockingly convenient fire! Fuck Melisandre, can she make flames out of a colorful little piece of plastic? I didn't think so. Her followers will come flocking to me, and pretty soon I'll gain the attention of the Mannis himself. What's that, Stannis? Mel sucks and you're coming to join me on the path to righteous glory? Awesome. Let's go kick some Baratheon ass.

**TL;DR Use lighter to take over world**

EDIT: Let's go kick some *other* Baratheon ass. 




 Oh no, his hands! 




 Full? Hell no, would be like an episode. Probably won't have too many more flash backs either, it's been 5 seasons and there's only been one. 




 Lol 'the'. Singular. 




 After seeing a few of these comments, I'll do my best to keep this short.

1. It doesn't really give him any 'claim' in the sense that people will just accept him as their king, but it could give someone powerful a reason to put him in charge. Kind of like how Stanns wanted to put him in charge of Winterfell becuase he was a Stark.

2. Nah, they love the Starks. Even more so than that, they want any excuse to remove the Boltons of the world from power and put someone a little more sane in power. They would probably support his claim.

3. Howland Reed is the last living person from the Tower of Joy incident, he could prove R+L=J (assuming it's true). Bran can also see into the past through weirwood trees. Rhaegar and Lyanna supposedly got married in secret under a weirwood tree. How convenient...

4. I don't think it would be a thing like "You're a Targaryen/Stark, Jon" "Holy shit, I'm gonna go be king now", but I think he will leave the wall. I'm sure there will be some important, transformative event that leads to him leaving. He might even be forced to leave or something.

Fuck, there goes keeping it short.

**TL;DR: 1. He could still be a king/lord/in charge, 2. The locals love the Starks, 3. Howland and Bran could prove it, 4. He could leave lots of ways. He's forced to, GRRM finds a loophole in the Night's Watch oath, some big event, etc.** 




 Must be tough to pretend dragons are flying about when you're standing five feet away from a guy in a puffy green Northern Face vest. 




 Can you imagine cleaning the litter box aftet that thing?!

**EDIT** I'm going to make a game to help you chose one. Take your age, add the time on the clock to it (2:43  2+4+3=9), subtract the number of items you have in your pocket, add number of letters in your last name, subtract the number of the day of the month it currently is and then multiply it by the number of people you're watching with. Then count down the list and watch that one. If you go over the list, start again from the top. Yes I know it's stupidly complicated, but simplicity is overrated. 




 Jesus that's troubling. 




 I like how your TL;DR is like half as long as the actual post. 




 His name was Nigel? Dead give away. 




 This is one of the single greatest fuck ups I have ever seen in all my time on Reddit. I thank you for your service, sir. 




 ...Why do we hate her again? Sorry, I think I fell off the band wagon a little. 




 Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought house Windsor was founded some time in the 1910's? And either way, is that to say I should be interested in a person because their ancestors were significant? 




 Thank you, French. 




 Why does anybody like the ryoal family? Completely serious question, I'd like to better understand it. I never got the appeal of following people like Paris Hilton or Kim Kardashian who are famous for basically nothing. The royal family doesn't seem so much different in the sense that they don't really do much that has an interest or an impact on the everyday lives of the people following them. Serious answer please, why should people be interested in their lives?

EDIT: I'm prepared for the downvote train becuase I know people love the royal family, and I meant none of this in a derogatory way at all, but I'd appreciate a serious answer. 




 Worlds. Worst. Sleeper agent. 




 I don't get it, they all ended up the same way. 




 Ah, the classic 'New York Jets' logic. 




 I got fired a while ago, can I expect the naming rights on your next animal? 




 The realization will come in two weeks when it's relevance is gone. 




 Love crystal meth. Can't stand. 




 He already refused being heir to Winterfel because of his oaths. 




 Nights watch 




 I would honestly pay for that. What do you say, OP? 




 Go fetch the breast plate stretcher! 




 Okidoke, here we go:

**RIVAL SONS** You'll fucking love them. It's like the red neck reincarnation of Led Zeppelin, which as it turns out is better than it sounds. [Get Whats Coming] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDGtPOakEwM) is probably my favorite, give [Keep on Swinging] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ijOlAR3zs8) and [Open Your Eyes] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEZzLSPNZY) a chance too. I have a feeling you'll like this band.

**AUDIOSLAVE** Notice you didn't mention Audioslave...is that because you don't listen to them or don't like them? On the chance that you don't listen to them, allow myself to enlighten you. Audioslave is basically Rage Against the Machine except with Chris Cornell (who is a fucking incredible singer) instead of Zach Dela Rocha. It works sooo well. [Show Me How to Live] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVXIK1xCRpY), [I am the Highway] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy2ZUGc2mSs list=PLRam0XIF5Xatyny8TALt9KNuFfw592JtV), [Be Yourslef] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC5FdFlUcl0 index=2 list=PLRam0XIF5Xatyny8TALt9KNuFfw592JtV), etc. Tom Morello at his finest.

**WOLFMOTHER** Fuck yes, even talking about Wolfmother gets me pumped up. [Joker and the Theif] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySjXFjLTagQ). Stop reading this, just go listen. [Woman] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPNredrDO0), Andrew Stockdale is a god among men. Their entire last album ([New Crown] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7_foo7rE3k)) is awesome. Every time I mean to listen to like one or two songs on it I end up listening to the whole thing.

**UNWRITTEN LAW** I miss bands like this so much. A few are still around I guess, but they don't excite me. [She Says] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIDvDyro8VA list=PLtrJ2FwdCr1j7e68RTpVHgoFZeQcsb94j), [Up All Night] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azbzkeTHXKQ index=6 list=PLtrJ2FwdCr1j7e68RTpVHgoFZeQcsb94j), [Seein' Red] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tq-T49MqRiQ list=PLtrJ2FwdCr1j7e68RTpVHgoFZeQcsb94j index=2) and my favorite, [Shoulda Known Better] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0JazftbEgk index=10 list=PLtrJ2FwdCr1j7e68RTpVHgoFZeQcsb94j). The singer could be better, but the song writing kinda makes up for it.

**INCUBUS** Prepare for the weirdly amazing sound that is Incubus. I don't really know how to describe their sound, just [listen] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_xjBaXor0). Oddly awesome, right? Brandon Boyd has a cool voice that really fits the style perfectly. EX, [Wish You Were Here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8295rOMvtQI). They're new stuff is pretty good too ([Absolution Calling] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTuAMlR3WuM)) although yes, I will admit, the music video absolutely sucks.

**THE HEAVY** Some people don't consider this 'rock', but I think the argument can be made. You've probably heard [How You Like Me Now?] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTuAMlR3WuM), but they've got so much more left to offer. [Same Ol'] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OAkUelXoVY), [Coleen] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jDAvcBgEOU), [What Makes A Good Man?] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08h0IVs4RKQ), [Short Change Hero] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1QUZzeZoPQ), I'll stop myself. Awesome genre, regardless of what you consider it. Can't believe they're not more famous.

**HALESTORM** The only thing I miss more than classic harder rock bands, are female power singers. Luckily, we still have Halestorm. [Love Bites (So Do I)] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmkHqUwa4zg) was one of my anthems back in the day (aprox. three years ago). I like the rawness behind it. [I Miss the Misery] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpJAmlnBxoA) (sorry, shit quality). They also have like two albums of covers that are pretty awesome. [Bad Romance] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vmhnxVF1GU). Give em' a shot.

**AFI** Mostly known just because [Miss Murder] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMxU2ToSunY list=PLDJpDK05PqjIWYyOSkH-Jc2lB1utgBF4q) was in Guitar Hero 3, but still a pretty solid band. I like that they were able to age over time without abandoning their roots. [Medicate] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCwEBz3ego8) Not my favorite band in the world, but still has a place on my iPod. [I Hope You Suffer] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSNyOYT3dJ8).

**BAD RELIGION** The epitome of punk rock! Aww, I miss these guys too. I mean they're still around, but they're an inconsistent band. For every ten songs they release, one is awesome. But that's okay considering they have like a 20 album discography. Even a Christmas album! They kind of remind me of a punk rock version of Green Day I guess, except more original. [American Jesus] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12kcpP-8jfM). [Los Angeles is Burning] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxoD9zWY9Rg) classic, gotta add it to the ol' playlist. [Infected] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ik9ofiRTTQM) and [21st Century Digital Boy] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN6kCgMUjFw).

**FRANZ FERDINAND** He has songs other than [Take Me Out] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ijk4j-r7qPA)! Who knew?! Franzie Ferd has an undeniably awesome groove, even in his newer stuff. Kind of reminds me of a Strokes, Muse style. Kinda. [No You Girls] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25sBhhOR4lw list=PLcPgUEOw_nvBOpnGVRkdfUbTiw1B4cwx7) and [Twilight Omens] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hi-ENlLALU) are among those newer ones I was talking about.


EDIT: Shit I didn't see Audioslave. Oops. 




 Seor Drogo 




 Okay 




 There's still that whole problem with his little oath. 




 Wait, what? That would be a HUGE thing to miss.

EDIT: Someone please clarify. 




 Honestly, depending on how fast you read, you might not get there by next season. 




 Sassafras is tough, but the Giant Sequoia takes the cake. 




 One of the slightly weirder kids ran away at recess and climbed up a tree to evade the perusing principle. He also called the enormous 225 lbs+ principle a 'nigger'. The principal picked him up by the collar (feet off the ground) and carried him into his office. It wasn't a short walk. And I was later told that he broke one of the special kids electric wheel chairs with a fork. Yeah. Pretty much everything about him was an 'incident'. 




 Joking... 




 I'm not sure how legit this is, [I'm partially color blind] (http://i.imgur.com/fwLC1FF.jpg). 




 I hate to be the one to break it to you, but you got ripped off. Yup. That's nowhere near 1/4.

The music video won a Grammy in 2007. Well deserved if you ask me. 




 I was at a dinner party with a few friends one time. It was me, my best friend, a few couples, the hosts family (husband, wife, three kids) and the grand parents. At the end of the day everyone was leaving and the kids were all begging to sleep over at their grandparents house. For whatever reason the dad said no, I forget why. Anyhow, everyone goes home and sleeps off the light beer and appetizers.

The next day I got a call for the host. It was an 'invitation' for his father in law's funeral, the very same one that I had seen at the party last night. Apparently, when the grandparents had gotten home last night there was someone already hiding inside their house waiting for them. He waited until they were asleep to sneak up and stab the grandfather to death. His wife was also stabbed, but she managed to make it outside where a neighbor saw her and was able to help her.

She was taken to the hospital where she was treated for minor injures. While she was there the same man that had broken into their house came strolling through the hospitals front door. In his trial the grandma claimed that as he walked by he stared at her and smiled.

Apparently he had somehow cut himself during the attack, and a neighbor who had no idea what was going on insisted they take him to the hospital. The very hospital the wife of the man he had just murdered was at. Creepy as shit.

He was arrested shortly after being treated, thank god.

**TL;DR A man hid in my friends parent's house and waited for them to go to sleep to murder them. The wife escaped and was taken to the hospital. The attacker soon showed up at the same hospital.**

 nbsp;
 nbsp;
 nbsp;

EDIT: I got one more I wasn't planning on using but decided to anyways.

One week my best friends parents went out of town. It was the first time they ever out of town without him so it was kind of a big deal. We were pretty young, so we didn't throw a party or anything, but we did have an awesome unsupervised sleep over at his house.

I quickly realized I greatly under estimated how scary this would be. His family was rich and he had a **huge** house. Seeing such a big dark empty house was pretty frightening for both of us. We spent most of the night playing video games in the basement.

The next morning when I was getting ready to leave I kept looking for my laptop. I had brought it over to watch a movie we ended up never seeing, but now I couldn't find it. I told my friend I swore I left it on the kitchen table upstairs with the rest of my stuff. My friend decided this was the perfect opportunity to show off a little and show me the security camera terminal his dad had shown him how to use before leaving. I knew he just wanted to brag a little bit that he could even do that, but I figured it might actually help find where I had gone with it. Plus, although I'll never admit it, a security camera terminal sounded really cool and I kinda wanted to see it.

Although there was no camera in his kitchen, the camera nearest clearly showed that I had gone into the room with it (as well as with the rest of my stuff) and came out without it. Naturally, we both assumed the worst. Ghosts. We kept watching though because I insisted that if *I* didn't move it, it must have been *him* that did it some other time that night.

At about two in the morning a man walked past the camera. A very big man with a bat. He came into the shot, looked around for a moment, and then walked into the kitchen. Naturally, we freaked the fuck out. We checked the other cameras for that time. After piecing together the video like a puzzle, we saw that he walked up to every door in the house and tried to open it. The screen door on the side was unlocked. He walked in, and did a preliminary tour of the house. Then he left out the door for a moment, and returned minutes later without the bat. This time he grabbed some stuff from my friend's dad's office, a computer and my laptop. He also took some jewelry, but we didn't find out until later as that was of camera. After collecting his prize, he closed the side door, and left. If my computer hadn't been gone, I would have never known he was there.

I couldn't sleep for weeks after this. A man broke in and robbed the place while I was in the house. That can be pretty god damn traumatic for a kid.

A few years later the police got the guy. I never got my computer back though.

**TL;DR Slept over at my friends house while his parents were away, house was robbed while we were sleeping inside.** 




 Psh, ones that visit Pluto.

 The throw at the end is the best part.

 nbsp;
 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Raspberry Snapple has always been my favorite. Not just my favorite iced tea, my favorite drink. No matter where I am, I always have a Raspberry Snapple in hand. My friends constantly make fun of me for it. Raspberry iced tea runs through your veins! they say, One of these days the Snapple factory might need to donate blood for you! I dont mind, I sit back and chuckle with them. Its all in good fun.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;My friends have become so accustomed to my habit that they will often have a six pack of Snapple sitting in their fridge waiting for me. My best friend Tom usually has two or three in his. Sometimes Ill catch his girlfriend sneaking one out too. One of us! One of us! I tease. Nicole and I have become good friends over the years. I spend a lot of time hanging out at their apartment. Or at least I used to.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Tom and I had a falling out a few weeks ago. He works as a doctor, a plastic surgeon. He makes good money doing it, not too long ago he moved his office to a brand new building downtown. Its amazing, exotic fish in a tropical tank, expensive paintings on the wall, attractive receptionist behind the desk, the whole nine.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;He even offered to get me a job there. Nothing too glamorous, mostly ordering and stocking all of the medicines he needed. I was a little skeptical at first, but then he told me the salary. When can I start? I said eagerly.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;The job was pretty easy. He really only needed botox and aesthetics, as well as the occasional new surgical tool. Once I got the hang of the order forms it was a breeze. My day would consist of, asking what Tom he needed, waiting for the 9 AM delivery guy to drop off the new medicines and filling out the forms for the next day, After that all I had was time to kill. Sometimes I would watch the fish swim around, sometimes I would surf the internet on my phone, sometimes I would talk to Allison (the receptionist). It was probably the best job Ive ever had.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;One morning I walked in to find Tom waiting for me. He was tapping his foot impatiently as he stood with his arms crossed. What the hell is this? he said handing me a small medicine bottle.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I read the label. Tretinoin I said rather puzzled, Why?

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Well? Where is the rest of it?

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;The rest of it?

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Yes, the rest of it! He said angrily, I have an operation in three hours and this is all that was in the medicine storage. Where is the rest of the Tretinoin?!

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Confused, I grabbed the order form off of my desk. Tretinoin, Tretinoin, Tretinoin-ah, there it is. Tretinoin, eight bottles

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Eight bottles? No, no, no this was the only one in there. You didnt order eight bottles, you ordered one! His voice was getting louder and louder. Allison politely pretended not to notice from behind her desk. "I can't operate if I don't have the first three days of their prescription ready for them! I'm going to have to cancel, and it's on you!"

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I shook my head, There must have been some mistake, I ordered eight. Look, it says it right here on the form. Eight. If we only got one it must be on manufacturing or shippings end. I didnt-

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I dont want to hear excuses, this is *your* job! If you cant handle it Ill have to find someone who can!

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I was shocked. I couldnt believe he would shout at me like that. We were friends, best friends. Was it even that important? We had lenty of medicines could be substituted for trentinoin, I should know I ordered them myself. No, this was ridiculous, I didnt have to take this from him. Not from Tom. Fuck this I said quietly as I turned and grabbed my coat. I thought you were a better friend than that

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;He wasnt impressed. Dont bother coming back tomorrow! he shouted as I walked out the door, Dont bother coming back ever!

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I didnt hear from him in the following weeks. Although I still hung out with Nicole, I always made sure he wasnt around when I was. He must have known what was going on as he saw the number of Snapple bottles in their fridge dwindle, but he never made an effort to reach out or say anything. I didnt mind. At some level it was satisfying to know he was aware I was spending time at his house but couldnt say anything about it.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Me and Nicole ended up spending more and more time together now that my time was freed up not hanging out with Tom. We stopped spending time at their apartment so much, I think he was finally getting frustrated enough to say something about it to her. Instead we went to the movies, to the mall, even to my shitty apartment sometimes. It became a routine. Every time she finished work we would meet up in a bar at the mall for a drink, then go window shopping past all the trending stores, then go back to my place. It was great. It was like I had lost a best friend, but immediately found a new one.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;At least I thought she was a friend. She started texting me things that suggest she might have wanted to be a bit more than that. I didnt dwell on it too much, she had been in a committed relationship for a few years now after all. Every now and then though it made me stop and think. The hints slowly became more frequent and more serious. Things like, Why am I even with Tom? I spend more time u anyways lol and I wish I was single when I met you. I always responded with something light like, lol whatever you say or something. What else could I say?

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;One day Nicole stopped at my house unannounced and bluntly laid out. She said she didnt want to just be friends, she wanted us to be together. At first I was completely against it. Tom is my friend I would say, I cant do that to him

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;She kind of laughed at that. You think youre friends? You havent seen him in months, we sneak around so you two never have to make contact and youre worried about his feelings?!

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;That made me think. Were still best friends? Were we still even friends? No, how could we be? I havent seen him in months...he didnt even care enough to say anything when I was in his fucking house. Why should I let some asshole who fired his best friend decided how I live my life? No, fuck that. Its *my* life.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Me and Nicole started dating soon after that. She said a few times that she was going to end it with Tom if things between us got serious, but she wanted to make sure it was the real thing before burning any bridges. I understood that I guess. I mean it was sleazy, but I get it.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Over time I started feeling guilty about it. She tried to comfort me saying things like, Weve been drifting apart for a while now but it didnt help. I decided to end things, or at least put them on hold until they figured out how things were going to be between  in the long term. Blah, I hate this drama shit.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I went by their apartment to end things for now. I knocked on the door. No answer. I knocked again. Nothing. Eventually I heard the locks turn and the door slowly opened. Nicole was standing there in tears. Behind her glass plates laid broken across the floor and a mirror rested smashed in against the wall. He found out she said in between tears, he read my texts

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I tried to comfort her. I suggested that we take a break to give her and Tom a chance to figure things out, but she didnt want me to leave. She didnt feel safe around him anymore. She told me that after he had found out he went crazy and started breaking and throwing things. He tried to go after Nicole too, but she locked herself in the bathroom. He said he was going to kill you she said still crying He said he was going to find you, and he was going to kill you I brushed it off but she felt she needed to warn me. Nicole looked me dead in the eyes, he said hes going to find you, and hes going to kill you

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Eventually I calmed her down and drove her to her brothers house. I wasnt sure if I should to to the police or what. I decided I should just go home for now. Let things simmer down a little.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;As soon as I walked in the front door my phone started ringing. Tom the screen read. I was a little shocked, this was the first I was hearing from him in what seemed like forever. I answered.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Tom, listen I-

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Did you take the Snapple?! his shout cut me off mid sentence.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I was lost. The Snapple?...

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;In the fridge-my fridge-the raspberry Snapple, did you take it? Did you drink it?

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I looked down at the half empty body of iced tea in my other hand. ...Yeah, I did. Im sorry, I thought you knew I was at your apartment

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;There was a brief pause. SHIT! he yelled at the top of his lungs, Shit, Im sorry. Im so sorry man, Im so sorry. I was caught up...I'm so sorry...

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;What the hell is going on, dude?...

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Im so sorry, Im so so sorry he kept saying over and over.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Whats going on! What are you sorry about??

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;He was silent for a moment, it seemed like he was almost on the edge of holding back tears the tea I...I put a bottle of Botulinum in the raspberry iced tea

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;That didnt mean anything to me. Botulinum was something I was used to ordering for him, I think he used it in botox operations. His desperation scared me though. I panicked and ran over to my computer so fast that I tripped over my own feet. I quickly Googled botulinum Snapple. Nothing. botulinum iced tea? Nope. I tried just botulinum. Woah. I clicked the first link and read. As I read a chill raced down my spine. I completely involuntarily dropped the phone. This couldnt be happening I read it again, and again. ***The Botulinum toxin causes Botulism, a fatal condition if not treated immediately upon ingestion. It involves muscle paralysis, eventually leading to the paralysis of the respiratory system and, consequently, death in a matter of hours*** For the first time I realized I couldnt feel my feet. I looked down at them. My right foot was awkwardly bent to the side, it actually looked rather painful, but I couldnt feel it. A horrifying realization rushed over me as I tried to move my foot and watched as...as nothing happened. It didnt budge an inch.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;No no no this couldnt be happening! I tried to get up, nothing moved. My knees wouldnt move! I couldnt get out of the chair! I tried again. I tried so hard to get just twitch out of my leg, anything, but it wouldn't move. No! I twisted my stomach and reached for the phone I had dropped on the floor. It was too far, I couldnt get it! Shit! No! **REACH FOR IT!** I tried again. With every bit of energy I had I reached and stretched as far as I could. Nothing. I didnt even brush the top of it.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I sat there completely defeated. I didnt want to believe this was happening. There must be something, some way to stop it! I yelled at the top of my lungs over and over again, hoping someone would hear me. Eventually I stopped myself. What was my endgame if they heard me? What could they do to help me? I was too far gone by now. There is no saving me.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;There is no experience in this world more terrifying than watching yourself die. Watching what's left of the life inside you slowly wither away and being utterly helpless to stop it. I can feel the numbness slowly moving up my body. Its passing my stomach as I type. I think its even beginning at the end of my fingertips. Soon Ill have nothing. What happens then? Will my heart stop beating when it gets to my chest? Will I sit here unable to stop watching my computer until it all ends? This could very well be the last sight Ill ever see.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;The suspense is very literally killing me. I have never known a horror as terrible as this. Im considering finishing the bottle of raspberry iced tea sitting on the table next to me. Will it end this faster? Will it finish the job, and put an end to the doubts I still have? I have so many questions I dont want to have answered, and yet I know Ill have those answers in a few short hours. Or will it be minutes? Or days? I wish I didnt have to find out, but I know I will.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Only time will tell. 




 MIL? 




 Aren't puppies fun and playful and adorable too though? 




 I don't necessarily disagree, but aren't cats fluffy too? 




 I never realized it would have to be 'Big Hero 6 2'. You'd think the marketing department would have changed that. 




 Baymax V. Baymax 2016?! 




 Nailed it. 




 I know this is long, but I think it's worth it.

Me and a friend used to do some yard work at a neighbors house for some extra money. A family of four owned the house, mom, dad, young son, younger daughter. Each time we went there we would ring the doorbell so they could start the clock and ring it again when we left so they could stop it. One time we got there and the dad opened the door wearing boxers and a tee shirt. He was out of breath too... We joked about it, but he was a pretty weird guy so we didn't think much about it.

When we left we rang the door again and exactly like the last time he answers the door. Half naked and catching his breath. He hadn't paid us this week and promised to, so he went into another room to get his wallet. Suddenly there was a scream, then another and the wife, who had apparently just gotten home, ran past the door shouting. Then the babysitter ran by. Unlike the husband or the wife, she wasn't wearing anything. Suddenly it all made sense, the babysitters car was always there even when the kids weren't.

A very intense argument began and somehow made its way onto the front porch. We would have turned and ran, but the dad insisted we "hold on just a sec" so he could pay us. He kept saying things to and about us in attempt to take himself out of the spotlight. To make it even weirder, the dad and babysitter didn't feel inclined to put on more clothes before stepping out onto the porch. She was actually very attractive, but even sixteen year old me just wanted to get out of there. Out of anger, the mom stepped back inside, closed the door and locked it. Still naked, the two others shouted and pounded on the door for her to open it. A few neighbors heard. I know at least one called the cops but I didn't stay long enough for them to arrive. We waited there at the edge of the porch for ten minutes while the dad repeated over and over again "just let me get my wallet so I can pay the boys". She never did, and to this day neither of us have gone back for the $30 they still owe us.

**TL;DR Wife caught husband cheating with babysitter while me and a friend were at their house, they got locked out on the front porch next to us without their clothes.** 




 Yeah but...for Father's Day... 




 That we will win! 




 You're right, I hate when things like the laws of physics change. Then I have to get used to a whole new laws of physics. 




 What an...inappropriate Father's Day gift... 




 Just going up to someones front door just to see if they want to hang out. Not like a random person, a good friend's house though. Apparently that's 'weird' now. I was a little sad to learn that. 




 It feels weird that there used to be 'smoking' and 'non smoking' sections in restaurants. That sounds like something my grandparents would say when talking about the olden days. 




 Give myself a hell of a salary, retire on pay day, let the next guy actually run things. 




 Could have been worse. Could have been a bunch of chili powder. 




 No way... 




 But, but, but pants are not required for a sexual encounter... Opportunity squandered! 




 The only reason I doubt this a little is because even in such a perfect situation to say that, I would **never** say that to the parent of someone I just broke up with. That just...rude? Excessively rude? Something like that. Also that term hasn't been around for all that long. That would make you still pretty young, right? 




 Personally, I hate Family Guy but love BoJack. I would give it more of a chance if I were you. I mean every animated cartoon has an amount of stupid, even South Park, but that doesn't necessarily make it good or bad. 




 Probably not. I mean I'm not going to judge you either way, I don't know the details or anything. 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Ijr621tM 




 Certainly not a law, in fact there's about a 50-50 chance that's *not* what would happen. Everything is theoretical, we can't prove any of it. Or at least not yet. 




 Spegetification! 




 I'm in college but I'm not studying physics. Just a course I took, although I do find it more than interesting enough to research in my spare time. 




 Is...is that what you got from it? 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgNDao7m41M 




 Every time I talk about rogue black holes, that is the biggest obstacle. [To put it to bed though] (https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS536US536 ion=1 espv=2 ie=UTF-8#q=rogue%20black%20holes). 




 I would even understand it a month into a relationship. And I assume you even knew her before that too. It's more people who just meet and decide this must be what love is. It really cheapens the term. 




 Ah, thanks I'm not so familiar with the term. 




 The opposite, if I was single I would never be able to come up with such a complete list... 




 It's more when people who are fat are now content with it because being curvey has become popular. They act like they have a perfect figure because they qualify as 'curvey'. I've even heard a rather fat lady once tell an extremely fit person they should work on getting more curves instead of working on 'silly things like abs'. I really dislike that kind of attitude. It gives those that don't care about their health a reason to care even less, and discourages those who do from staying healthy. I'm not saying I am that fit a person myself, but I would never say anything like, "you would look better if you stopped going to the gym and got some more curves". 




 Sorry, what I meant is it would *be* longer but not *seem* longer. 




 Actually they already made that one. It's called 'Teeth'. 




 You've never seen BoJack Horseman. 




 Ohh, even better. 




 When people comment on comments commenting about people commenting on their own comments. 




 For a second I thought you got it in the Amazon. I didn't question it, that seemed to make sense. 




 When people comment on their own comments 




 Taken...and also Taken 2. 




 "Fish in a Barrel" working title 




 Whaaaaat? Mr. Peanutbutter and BoJack Horseman in the same restaurant? Is this a crossover episode? 




 But he's the best god damn not an animator the world has ever seen. 




 You are a liar, final answer. 




 Don't look down. 




 Anddd I'll be sleeping with the lights on tonight. 




 Yu-Gi-Oh cards. The best part about it was no one knew how to play the game, we just had an irrational want for the cards. 




 What does that have to do with expecting the wold to change on my behalf? 




 That makes sense I guess, I live in an unreasonably cold area.

 Although better for the car, that's a little impractical. You can't give the car three minutes to catch up every time you start the engine. 




 "I love you" is thrown around way too loosely these days. I've seen college/high school kids saying that almost immediately after they start dating. Excuse me, you're in love? You didn't even know them a week ago... 




 /r/space is awesome. There are also a lot of Youtube videos that can be very interesting regarding space or black holes. Search something like 'space time' or 'black holes' and I'm sure you'll find something. [This one] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgNDao7m41M) is one of my favorites, very insightful.

If you're really committed there are also plenty of books on the subject. Stephen Hawking is probably one of the best authors out there right now, he goes on much further than just black holes though.

Even TV shows like Nova sometimes talk about black holes. Although I would agree Googleing it probably isn't the best method, there are still plenty of sources out there. Good luck! 




 The world isn't going to change? Why did you think I expected anything to change? The question asked what I found annoying, I answered. 




 Good god, that would be a truly horrifying person.  




 I guess it just depends on how often it's said. I'd say the maximum limit to a phrase like that is about once per conversation before it really becomes noticeable. 




 * Pants that go up past the belly button

* Constantly checking phone, even in the middle of conversations

* When people who are fat act like they are in their physical prime because they have 'curves'

* 'Emo' hair, makeup and clothing styles. That trend is more than dead.

* Must take a picture of every. Single. Thing.

* Talking about how fat/ugly they are, regardless of weather or not it's true

* Highlighter hair colors

* Choker necklaces. Not exactly sure if that's what it's called.

* Too many piercings
 
* Fake nails exceeding an inch in length

* Rather take pictures/videos of concerts and sporting events than enjoying them

* Constant talking about male celebrity crushes, getting mad when a guy references a female

* Tattoos that cover as much as the entire neck

EDIT: Obviously this doesn't apply to anywhere near everyone, many probably apply to both genders too.

EDIT 2: I'm not referring to any one person, just things I notice seem to be becoming slightly common in the social world today.

EDIT 3: Reworded the 'curvey' thing. That is more what I meant. 




 A classic. 




 I love that one. 




 I've kind of seen it too many times for it to still be funny to me, but [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F9jXYOH2c0) used to be mine. 




 Bojack Horseman.

I really love how the jokes continue on through the show instead of just being around for one episode (Hollywoo, Halloween store in July store, etc.). I hate when they do that in sitcoms. 




 A very good joke, but far far from the best. 




 No, but it's easier to understand worded that way. 




 Well, the singularity, the center of the black hole, theoretically is a point of infinite gravity. It's called that because there is simply no other way to explain it, although it's all theoretical.

Since the singularity would by definition have to be the same on every black hole, they wouldn't have to have the same gravitational pull all together, but they would be the same at the center. That's because the singularity is as small and as dense as it gets, there is no difference from black hole to black hole.

The size varies because although the singularity of black holes are all the same, the mass is not. And the gravitational pull does not extend at the same strength across the universe. It is lowered exponentially until there is almost no pull at all. Thats why not everything would be sucked into one black hole. 




 Any other pictures? 




 ...where the fuck did they test this? 




 Sadly, no. Although that would make an awesome science fiction movie. The only way to make a black hole would be to crush an object below its Schwarzschild radius. The ratio between normal size and Schwartzchild radius is so ridiculously big that us humans could never hope to reach it (not yet anyways). Just as an example, the Schwarzchild radius for an object the size of Earth would be about as large as a peanut. It would be impossible for us to crush anything that small.

But assuming we could make a black hole, we would have to feed it things until it obtained enough mass to become larger than the oncoming black hole. That again is a problem. We could of course throw in the planets of the solar system, but that probably wouldn't be enough. The rouge black hole has probably swallowed up much more than a few planets, maybe even a few stars, it's likely much much larger than any other black hole we could conceivably make.

If well placed enough however, we could probably use a black hole with enough mass to divert an oncoming black hole from it's collision course. The gravitational pull would at least alter its path slightly, wich could be enough.

All in all though, no that's not really an option. 




 Yeah sorry, I did this on my phone. 




 Yes, that's the one. I know where it is, no one ever seems to use it though. Even when I get letters from the government they always have the sloppy right orientation on. 




 That thing on Microsoft Word where the lines fill out the whole page instead of just stopping at a jagged edge on the side of paper. It looks so much more professional, but no one knows to do it. 




 I [just went on for about twenty minutes about black holes and the universe] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3dsllj/what_is_the_weirdestscariest_most/ct8g29u), and I could go on for hours more. In my humble opinion, it is by far the most interesting topic of discussion out there, or at least within the top five. 




 Black holes are crazy. Basically if you can crush something small enough, it can create a point if infinite gravity and density. Not only that, but it could potentially create a bend in time space so dramatic that it connects two parts of the universe millions of light years away. Even the laws of physics are at the mercy of black holes. A black hole could slow time itself!

There are even theories that black holes contain stars, planets-even galaxies-within them. When something is sucked into a black hole, like say a star, it is compressed into the black holes center where it will stay forever. Eventually more stars get sucked in adding to the collection and creating a star system, and even a galaxy! And what would happen if one of those stars went supernova? It could potentially create another black hole, with another galaxy inside of it, with another black hole within that! Theoretically, we could be living in a black hole inside of another black hole inside of another.

Some theories are far more sinister though. Some believe that getting close enough to a black hole will start a process called 'spegitification'. Spegetification is the stretching of an object so far that eventually every atom that made up the object will be layed out in a single file line.

As you are standing right now, or probably sitting, your feet are experiencing stronger gravity than your head because it is closer to the source of the gravity (the central Earth). The same thing happens in a black hole but to a much much larger scale. So much larger in fact that if you were to go into a black hole feet first, you would be stretched out with your feet stretching further than your head because they are under more gravitational strain. Spaghettification. Eventually you would be stretched out soooo far that what used to be your body would now be that single file line of atoms. In theory, they would keep spreading apart until they reached the singularity, the center of the black hole.

And then there are rogue black holes (yes that's how you spell it, no it's not the color. I think the Bitish spelling is different, that can cause a little confusion). Rogue black holes are black holes that don't have a fixed position and instead wanted aimlessly thought the galaxy. It's pretty scary when you think about it, there is literally nothing that could stop a rogue back hole and it could swallow you up in a matter of seconds (although it would seem considerably longer than that for the person being sucked in). At any moment, the Earth-hell, the entire solar system-could be destroyed by a black hole moving by at near the speed of light. It's unlikely anyone would even see it coming, although the methods for finding rouge black holes are getting better they're far from perfect. At every moment, the threat of spetification could be looming around the corner, but we can never know for sure.

Honestly though, I'm not sure I'd even want to know if one was coming towards us. There is literally nothing that can be done to stop it or get out of the way, might as well cross our fingers and go on with the day.

The science of how black holes could connect different parts of the universe is also fascinating. Space time is a physics and mathematical term combing both space and time in a single continuum (sometimes referred to as the 'space-time continuum'). It can be visualized as a flat plane, think of it as a table cloth with the ends held up to keep it straight and flat. If there was nothing in the universe, this is what space time would look like. Gravity bends time space though. Things like planets, stars and black holes cause bends in space time. Imagine that there was a few marbled dropped on the table cloth. The marbles represent planets, or stars, or anything holding mass and therefore gravity. Each marble bends down a small portion of the table cloth surrounding it, creating a crater. The areas of the craters slope that are bent the most have the strongest gravity, while the areas that are relatively flat have less. If the marbles move, their 'gravitational craters' move with them. Space time is filled with bends throught it.

Many believe space time isn't *just* flat though. They think it is more the shape of a cylinder. Imagine that two ends of the table cloth have now been joined creating a circle. The marbles are still bending the cloth inwards, but it is shaped more like an 'O' now. To represent areas of ridiculously high gravity (such as black holes) we can't use marbles, they're simply too small. Instead, lets drop a bowling ball right on top of the table cloth amidst all the other marbles. The bowling ball is so heavy that instead of just bending the table cloth a little, it stretches it all the way down until it is touching the cloth on the other side of the circle. It is so strong that it connected two points extremely far away from one another directly through the middle. Black holes extreme gravity could very well connect points in our universe the same way.

That means that if we could somehow survive the journey into a black hole, and then escape out the other side, we could come out trillions upon millions of light years away on the other side of the universe. This is what is known as a wormhole, or an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

Absolutely insane stuff, and I've really just scratched the surface here on the basics of black holes. There is so much more I didn't go on about, so much more than that that's miles over my head and so much more than that we don't even know yet.

**TL;DR Black holes are fucking insane.**

EDIT: Just realized my phone changed everything from 'space time' to 'time space'. I'll try to fix that. 




 Gracias! 




 No, I understand how Reddit works. It's a good fact, it deserves be higher up in the comments. 




 Can someone please reverse this so it looks like he's moon walking? 




 Dildo of god. Oh my. 




 Jesus, what an unfortunate farmer. 




 I think the Dutch are just trying to pull a fast one. "This is called a carrot, it used to be blue. You're just going to have to trust me on that one." 




 For science.

 Holy shit, this should be higher up. 




 Sorry, but I'm gonna one up your Aztec fact a little bit. Did you know, that Oxford University is older than the Aztec civilization? Crazy. 




 "To battle, you god damn motherfuckers!"

-Polly 




 I'd love to go on a boat trip one day and see a Great White float on by, belly side up. 




 I like facts like this. Oxford University is older than the Aztecs. How crazy is that? 




 "Oh yeah, I uh, grew a beard and aged ten years and lost my accent. Adult onset puberty." 




 It says 'gold shall be their shrouds'. The prophecy seems to go in order, I think Tomen died before she's killed. Maybe that's even why she's crying when she's killed. 




 In my humble opinion, Mergery is the 'younger and more beautiful'. Cersi was the queen until she came along, now she has to give up everything to her. Even her precious Tomen.

Her children's hair are 'gold'. I don't think it means literal crowns, unless Marcella is somehow made a queen. Apparently they'll all die to, probably before her considering how the prophecy seems to go in order. Watch your back, Tomen...

It says she'll die when her tears have drowned her. Tears for the death of someone perhaps? Such as Marcella? Or Tomen? Maybe both. It also says '*the* valonqar', not '*your* valonqar'. That makes it seem like it really isn't one of her brothers. It would also be difficult for them to be the killer considering Jamie doesn't have hand*s* and Tyrion is half a world away. Who does that leave? Sandor obviously, not sure if that's realistic or not. I'm not really sure who else. Could be a new character of course, but I can't imagine her being killed by someone just introduced.

The entire 'valonqar' part wasn't in the prophecy during the flashback in the TV show though. They might do things very differently. 




 In the books maybe, but they've kind of burned that bridge in the show so I have my doubts. They could of course make a change, but I couldn't imagine such a huge difference. GRRM is an executive producer after all.

Brienne don't even really fit the prophecy. She's not more beautiful than Cersi, they've definitely established that through both the books and the show. I'm not sure which of them is younger though, they seem to be about the same age? Either way, it doesn't fit for her.
