 All his Dracula parts, but his best Dracula was in Jess Francos El conde Dracula! 









 Wow! Cool! Glad you liked it  







































 Thanks for the feedback, i try to come up with new ideas :) 




 Its ok was a small experiment 










































































 Hope you were'nt too creeped out   




 Thank you. Yeah it becomes very sudden.. 












































 so. In many movies or tv shows (Buffy comes to mind) vampires lose their souls upon turning. A take i dont really like. That would make turning into a vampire totaly...meaningless.. Since you would just wake up after death in heaven/hell/whatever while your body walks around still on earth! Just a thought...lol.. 




 Good question!  












































 Heck yeah! This was a great video! 



















 Im kind of experimenting, hence the warning. Lol.  




 Now i remember! Played that long ago lol 




 Yeah it does kind off :) 




 Blue pages? 


































 Thank you my friend!  









 I was refering to leatherfaces mumbling lol 
























 Well i would call peter pan fantasy, and if it can make some people relax to, its a win win :) 







































 glad you liked it :) 



















 Thank you. Means a lot  




 Aww thank you. Might do another later. This was kind of improvised very quick after i saw the movie today :) 






















































 This is awesome!!!!
 




 This is top notch! Highly recommended! 



















 Ha ha i try to do it with a tounge in cheek approach :) 




 Ha ha the vid you link to was meant as a joke lol. But yeah i have some weird vids.. And judging from my audience they get asmr from it... I just try to think out of the box :) 



















 Those vids are supposed to be relaxing with lots of sounds, and i didnt want my viewers to get a heart attack :) 




 Well it was basicly made for my ASMR channel so i thought i warn sensetive veiwers lol  


































 Awesome video. Why tear down other people its sad! 



















 Ok my bad :)
