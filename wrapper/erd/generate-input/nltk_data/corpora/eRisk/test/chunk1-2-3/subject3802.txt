 Have you looked in the settings for the messages app? For some reason it isn't enabled by default.  




 If you're planning to root and ROM, I'd go the GS2 because its a little cheaper and has better almost everything except screen. If you're going to stay stock then it's definitely Nexus, no comparison. 




 Probably running a custom rom. Guessing from the "swagger" toggle, it looks like AOKP with a themechooser theme. 




 In all honesty, if you want to get your hands on new updates as soon as they come out and you don't have a nexus device, you better be prepared to root. It's either root, or wait. 




 Custom shortcuts in the nav bar? Nope, it's [AOKP!](http://justreboot.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/jt_aokp1.jpg) 




 The new notification shade looks... amazing. 









 Galaxy S2. 




 What about people with unsupported devices but are using unofficial builds? :( 




 No. You cannot uninstall system apps without root, regardless of what launcher you use. 




 Incorrect, this will only allow you to uninstall userspace apps. Many bloatware apps are put on the system partition of the phone and cannot be removed without root access (eg try to remove stock messaging or contacts - even though they are not bloatware they are system apps and you will see what I mean) 




 There are plenty of ports on the SGS xda forums, it only takes a few hours for some of the devs to port over new builds once they've been posted. [Here's what I'm using.](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1712185) 




 Juice defender or tasker? 




 It can handle up to 32gb, just not moving or copying anything over that's larger than 4gb at any given time.  




 A cat meowing? 




 Calendar  menu  calendars to display  




 I think you're forgetting the important fact that Google voice is nowhere near being internationally available. They can't merge functionality on an os that reaches all over the world, when that functionality is only available in a few select places. Until voice is universal it has to be a separate app.  




 Yay, this post again! Seriously, if you don't like an app then why have it installed?  




 Yes right now CM7 has way more features than 9, but that is because of the CM team's choice to focus on stability and clean code before features - there were posts saying that some features in CM7 were "dirty hacks", and they're doing everything a much cleaner way this time round, so features will be slow. In the meantime I suggest an AOKP-based rom, as they have more features atm. 




 Fyi cm9 nightlies are pretty damn stable.  




 I read somewhere that once the battery drops below 5% you have to boot into webos to get it to charge.  




 The development scene for the i9100 is more at xda.  




 Reddit news is awesome, but its not flawless. (I'm using it now) Alien Blue just feels so nice to use.  




 But none of them have the polish that Alien Blue does.  




 Strangely enough this actually never happened to me. The worst its done is refuse to load content and a force-kill and reopen usually fixes that. 

And if you don't like a piece of software, nobody is forcing you to use it.  




 Flash a stock rom with Odin.  




 Well it certainly seems that way haha. Tell me, how is Verizon's new data plans relevant to Android? Sure, you use Android to access the internet but posting about it here makes about as much sense as posting about new cable infrastructure in r/windows. 




 In a single country. Everywhere else it doesn't apply. 




 Oh, we're still doing this joke? 




 I watched The Shawshank Redemption for the first time ever a few days ago. 




 While we're at it, can we lose the carrier posts that have NOTHING to do with android? 




 Not defending the people that do suggest it, just giving some insight on why they do. :) 




 Come and join us on the dark side, [AOKP](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/20526467/Screenshot_2012-06-12-20-56-54.png). (its only green because its currently charging, is otherwise blue.) 




 While valid for Nexus devices, which come with vanilla Android out-of-the-box, I think a lot of the root/rom suggestions stems from the fact that fans of the platform don't want a users view of Android poisoned by a shitty manufacturer UI - I know a lot of people that have HTC phones and they complain about bug X and not being able to do feature Y, which, upon further inspection turns out to be because of shitty, bloated sense. 




 Its a feature that a lot of custom roms have, namely CM9 and AOKP. 




 Solid explorer has all this. You don't even need to install the app to know that, its right there in the description... don't simply dismiss things immediately, investigate.  




 To build a home - cinematic orchestra 




 What features does Solid explorer lack in comparison to your current one? I find it suits all my needs, its very functional.  




 Slim ics is available for the Gnex also.  




 Its simply because the devs didn't code it into the app.  




 Hey look everyone, this guy doesn't have **Facebook!**  




 Also comes with some pretty sweet wallpapers.  




 I think I may be the only one who picked up on the [reference.](http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/bluesclues.asp) Unless it was unintentional...

 How do you do it though? I'm trying to place one on top of the other and it just moves to the nearest available space. I'm using the free version.  




 Uninstall the CF3D binary, and then remove the app completely.  




 As long as custom roms exist, the android phone will always be dependent on the computer.  




 The only thing stopping me from completely swapping over to Reddit Sync is comment editing/deleting!

 Thank you so much! I've been experiencing this issue for a while now! 




 What's the benefit of using this over an ad-hoc network which can be done with your laptop/computer already? 




 As a person currently suffering from depression, fuck you. Do you mean to say that the fighting it has taken me to still be alive to type this out is meaningless? Depression is a cancer of the mind and soul, and there have been studies that show *physical manifestations* of depression in the brain. What gives you the authority to dismiss scientific studies on this *life altering disease*?  




 I think that per-app DPI requires some serious hacks and modifications to the android framework itself. I don't think its possible without a custom rom, unfortunately.  




 Ah that makes more sense. Thank you for explaining. :) 




 Why don't you just have it utilize the Share function instead? That way you can simply hand over the information to wherever they want to share it (ie if they want to share it via some other messaging service).? 




 Only thing I'm waiting on for this app is comment editing/deleting.  




 I enjoyed the remade multiplayer. But I wish they kept both versions. And the Xbox version was more censored. :( 




 Not until reading this thread did I realize that this company is responsible for my childhood... 




 I know that, but just letting people know its a feature of AOSP, not CM.  









 Tell me what its like to look in the mirror and hate everything that you see. Tell me how it feels to know that for every second of happiness you are going to have an hour of suffering. What does it feel like to look around yourself, see the people that care for you, but theyre so far away. You scream and yell and cry but they cant hear you. Theyre looking, looking for you. Where did you go? What happened to the happy little boy that lived life to the fullest? Why am I so tired, tired of this world and this life? Every snide remark and ignorant comment feels like a punch to the gut. Im being eaten alive by a disease whose first mission is to knock out your communications. You cant tell anyone about the dark cocoon youre wrapped in. Wave after wave it crashes down on you, youre drowning, gasping for air. In between the waves you might be lucky enough to see a bit of sunshine, but only for an instant before your sight is robbed from you once more. What is a life without true happiness? Where the best feeling is no feeling at all, and sleep is the only real escape? Can a person really be blamed for wanting to escape such a hopeless place? What is living if it is simply out of guilt for the pain you would cause loved ones? If only I had gotten help sooner. 
 




 Not sure how to start these things. I'm 16 years old and I was diagnosed with depression about eight months ago, but the effects of depression and suicidal thinking I've been experiencing for much longer, I'd say about 2 and a half years. 

I've had suicide "attempts" but I view these only as testing the waters, seeing just how close I can get to death before I back out. The most recent one was the most frightening. When I do this stuff to myself an intense clarity comes over me. It is quite literally a calm before the storm: everything is crystal clear and in those moments I swear I knew the answers to the universe. I was ready to die that night, but again I backed out. Each time I get ever closer. 

Right now I'm the happiest I've been in a long time; just gotten out of hospital and I'm on new medication, making huge strides in therapy. Yet I cannot shake this feeling of utter dread. This feeling of knowledge - the simple plain fact that my time is limited and when I die, it will be by my own hand. I am my own worst enemy. It feels like trying to hold up the sky - I can fight as hard as I can but eventually, the time will come when I break and the sky crushes me. I am loved. I can see it, feel it and experience the joy that it brings. But it feels worthless. I am unable to dredge up any meaning from life. I know I should try harder in school, but I just don't - I don't see the point in it. I want to make it clear that I am very happy, content with my life how it is at the moment. But similarly to how a terminal cancer patient is enjoying their last days, I enjoy my last days with those that I love. I know that people will be hurt - my family, friends, girlfriend will be absolutely crushed. But I feel like its not up for me to decide - the darkness within me is too powerful. It is relentless and I am its prisoner.  









 My plan allows me to use unlimited Facebook with 200mb of data/month for everything else. I'm currently using Onavo Count to manage my data usage but it's inaccurate as Facebook usage isn't metered by my carrier. Does anyone know of any data-watching apps that would allow me to add an exception to any connections going to facebook.com? 



















 depression is

turning your phone off because you think nobody will try to text or call you anyway

having to deactivate your facebook so you arent tempted to impulsively post depressing and attention seeking statuses

being paranoid to the point where you ruin your friendships with people before they have the chance to hurt you

walking into your room and collapsing onto the floor and into tears as soon as youre out of everyones sight

having to say what? all the time because you cant seem to focus on what anyone is saying

looking at your school books and being unable to read or write anything because you just cant seem to think at all

getting angry at people when they touch you

not being hungry or feeling sick when you try to eat

the feeling of a constant weight on your shoulders

always being tired, no matter how much sleep you get

staying up all night because you dont want the next day to come

lying to your friends, psychologist and parents, telling them that youre getting better because you dont want to stress or worry them anymore

feeling like youd be better off dead

seeing the worst in people at all times

being unable to take a compliment or accept anything nice towards you

testing people to see if they actually care about you

overthinking things to the point where a kind gesture can become a hateful insult

spilling your whole story to people again and again in the hopes that maybe someone will save you

not being able to take a joke

having to fake a smile all day

hurting the people that you care about the most

asking yourself why cant you just be happy? on a daily basis

being constantly judged by people who have no clue what youre going through 



















 16, depression for 2+ years. something tipped me over tonight, tried to hang myself in my closet but clothes rack/metal bar thing broke from my weight... i blacked out for a few seconds and woke up on the floor. i don't know what to do. i'm such a fuck up, i can't even get suicide right. 




 My Facebook app refuses to load the newsfeed or anything for that matter. Instead of posts it just says "no content" in the newsfeed, and trying to load any other page just throws me an error "no content" or "connection timed out".

I can connect to the mobile site fine and everything works.

Rocking a Galaxy Gio, running CM7.2 (as seen in my flair), done all the usual things, rebooted, logging in and out, cleared data/caches of the app, uninstalling and reinstalling and I'm still at the same place. Anyone had this problem before? 




 Why? Just why? I hate myself. It's like I'm just too used to being depressed and sometimes it just feels more... comfortable. Like being happy and normal is an effort for me. I don't want to feel like that. Why does happiness come so easily to everyone else? Why do I have to try? Why do I have to lean on this stupid green pill like a crutch? What happens if I just stop taking it every morning? Do I just go back? All the "progress" I've made, does it just disappear? I'm so angry and frustrated because I can see myself hurting people that are important to me. I just want someone to understand. I hate this. I want to be better. 














 Would like a few people to squad up with on the weekends. c: 














 I know there's plenty of guides in the sidebar but the thing that I find myself having most trouble with is simply the vocabulary and lingo that is used in this game - I'm trying to read guides and posts on reddit and I end up coming away more confused than I already was! If someone could point me in the right direction, that would be great, because I've totally enjoyed the few games that I've played. 
























 I know that there is already a reddit group on flickr, but would anyone be interested if I decided to create a flickr group purely for people to post their photos for the assignments into?

Edit: Due to all the positive feedback, I went ahead and created [reddit photoclass2012a](http://www.flickr.com/groups/1828866@N24/) on flickr. :) 





























 There's an online sketching/drawing site, based on Flash I think. When you draw it automatically draws lines in between your lines, sort of like a spider web. It's hard to describe.  












































 Hey there /r/photography. I've got a bit of a problem with my camera.

I recently bought a second-hand Canon 300D (the first Digital Rebel) from eBay for $350. I've been using it for about a month now, no problems. The camera came with two CF cards; one 512mb and a 128mb.

When I first got the camera, I put the 512mb card into it and hadn't taken it out until last night (I don't have a CF card reader so I simply plug my camera into my laptop and transfer the images that way, so there is almost no reason for me to take the CF card out.) I was planning to take more pictures than usual today, as I was going out with a couple of friends and I tend to take quite a few shots when I do; so I decided to make sure the 128mb card worked, since I'd never tried it before.

This is where the problems started. I replaced the 512mb card with the 128mb card and turned the camera on. When I do this, it takes much longer to turn on then usual ("EOS" is displayed on the screen for about fifteen seconds, as opposed to the normal one or two before I can start taking pictures). The screen then starts flashing with an "Error 02". 

I googled around a bit, and apparently Error 02 has something to do with the card and not the camera, and it suggests to format the card and try again. I tried to format the card on the camera, but the error wouldn't let me access the menu to do so. I simply wrote off the card, deciding that I'd pick up a 1GB card from an electronics store as soon as I could to use instead.

No problems, the 512mb card had done me good so far. I'd just have to be scarce with my picture taking.

So then I go to swap the 512mb card back in. The camera turns on as normal but the CF reading LED (which usually flashes for about ~1 second before I can save pictures to the card) only flashes once, and then I get a message on the screen saying "Full CF". Which is weird because I know for a fact that it's not. So I went into the menu, and tried to format the card. Before I format the card, it gives me information on the space - "2.7mb used of 3.8mb" - which obviously can't be right because it's a 512mb card.

So I go ahead and press format and then I get an "Error 99" on the screen. A google search of the error brings up mostly results about cleaning the lens connection on something similar; which I know is not the problem because the shutter works just fine when there isn't a CF card in there.

So has anyone experienced this before or know of a place I can take the camera? I'm not sure where I'd go to get it fixed, given that it's quite old. 




 Hey there, /r/Android. I just recently got my first Android phone (yay!) but I've been a long time android researcher and /r/Android lurker.

Anyway, I'm looking for an app that makes the backlights for the touch sensitive buttons on the Galaxy Gio flash or pulsate when I have a missed call/unread message/other notification - basically emulating a notification LED. Does such an app exist? 


































 Australia has had metered internet usage ever since I can remember (I'm only young, so that doesn't really mean much - but we've had capped usage for *at least* five or six years). I fail to see why it's such an issue in Canada - if your cap doesn't have as much data as you would like, then doesn't it just make sense to upgrade your broadband plan? Or am I missing something important here? 




 I just bought this phone online, and I can't seem to find **any** custom ROMs for the Backflip - my Google-Fu must be weak tonight.

The reason I want a custom ROM is because - frankly, Motorola's custom UI **sucks**.

*"If you knew you didn't like MotoBlur, then why did you buy the Backflip in the first place?"* - It's currently the only Android phone available to me through the carrier I want   the price I am willing to pay. Besides, I know I can just install LauncherPro and be done with BlurHome, which is my prime concern anyway. 
























 Hmm okay, I suppose it makes sense that a 1st party flash works better with the body than a 3rd party would. I guess I'll just have to save for a bit longer. 




 Thanks, I'll look into it! As for the slave flash, I can disable the pre-flash in my camera, would it work if I did that? 




 Hey there r/photography. Recently I've been wanting to get an external flash because I feel limited with what I can currently do with the onboard one (I like to do a lot of portraiture). I currently use a Canon 20D and I'm on a pretty tight budget. I was wondering if the [YN-460](http://www.ebay.com/itm/YONGNUO-Speedlite-YN460-Canon-EOS-Rebel-XT-XTi-XTs-/160593250447?_trksid=p5197.m1992 _trkparms=aid%3D111000%26algo%3DREC.CURRENT%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D14%26meid%3D1806658724969685563%26pid%3D100015%26prg%3D1006%26rk%3D3%26) would be suitable for my needs? I mostly do a lot of indoor portraiture.

I was also considering getting a stand/tripod I could mount the flash on (use it as slave). Would [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Hot-Shoe-Flash-to-Bracket-stand-Mount-Adapter-Trigger-/220982002387?pt=Camera_Flash_Accessories hash=item33738dc2d3) and [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/656-200cm-PROFESSIONAL-Light-Stand-Tripod-for-Photo-Studio-Video-Lighting-2m-/290764698956?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0 hash=item43b2ed354c) do the job?

Thanks in advance! 




 When I replied to your comment I thought you just were talking about how the original AOKP toggles take up too much space, especially since they can't be hidden in the JB notification shade. I was just saying that there is an implementation that takes up as much space as CM's. The only differing aspect of the appearance that I can see is the lines underneath? Otherwise they're pretty much exactly the same. 




 http://www.imgur.com/meJ8k.png

ROM control  toggles  toggle style? I used AOKP ICS fairly extensively and I'm 100% sure this is an option there too. 




 AOKP has an implementation that is identical to CMs, its just a setting change away.

 I don't think it could be done with tasker without a reboot. The only way I can see this working is with the Paranoid Android ROM. Its DPI changing interface is the only thing I know that can change from phone to tablet UI without requiring a reboot (it simply restarts the framework-ui, which takes a few seconds)

OP, your best bet is to install PA and just change to the tablet UI when you need it. It only takes a few seconds.

 The result is from WolframAlpha. Makes about as much sense as saying iPhone made your day when you Google searched something funny.  




 Probably something to do with the fact that the notification shade is always there, while the home screen requires a button press.  




 Try clearing data for the app.

 Its a comment, and my original comment talks about being able to edit them. Which you said I could.  




 It does, OP just doesn't realize that paragraphs require double enter. 




 Desktop link for those interested: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeaIvjoH1FY 




 I'm sure he could, but that does not warrant posting incorrect information. Your post adds nothing to the discussion and shouldn't have been posted in the first place. 




 You kinda missed out a pretty vital step in your initial comment

initial comment

You didn't link it in the initial comment, like I had said. You only provided a link after I commented, and I'm sure it was only because you Googled the information after you read my comment - something you should have done before posting and assuming OP is stupid and treating him like so. 




 Why do people constantly try to make out that we're some sort of tight-knit community? Our "reputation"?! This site is frequented by tens of thousands of people daily, and its a total mixed bag. There is no reputation, this does not "have to stop". You're an idiot. 




 You kinda missed out a pretty vital step in your initial comment. Was the OP supposed to just magically know where to find and download the Android File Transfer application? +1 douche points man. Good job. 




 Wow not only were you condescending, but you are absolutely incorrect. With 4.0, android devices default to MTP for file transfer, something that osx does not support natively. 




 How would I go about that? Long pressing the comment only reveals these actions: http://www.imgur.com/SxAI3.png 




 IMO posting about carriers in r/android makes about as much sense as posting about ISPs in r/windows. It has nothing to do with Android, at its core as an OS.  




 Yeah I meant to say r/all, not my Reddit front page. 




 No problem haha. Your post actually reminded me of the feature and inspired me to set it up for myself just now. Also blocked /r/atheism from the front page. RES is amazing. 




 Why is it that so many new Reddit apps lack the ability to edit comments and self posts? Being an app for a mobile device, on which typos are frequent and easy to make, you'd think that this would be one of the first features implemented, right after comment posting. This is literally the only thing keeping me from switching from Reddit News to something like Reddit Sync or even this. 




 The reason these posts make it to the top is because they're being upvoted by people. There are obviously people that frequent this subreddit who want, for whatever unfathomable reason, to have this subreddit spammed with "OMG APPLE SUX!!11". You and me and everyone else in this thread are just going to have to accept the fact that we are in what is called a "vocal minority". The best thing you can do is install RES and filter out any and all posts with the word "Apple" in them from /r/android. 




 lightweight/no-frills

This is kinda what the OP asked for. 




 Solid Explorer has this. Just press   hold on a file and then choose properties, "Calculate MD5" is an option there. 




 That's not the expanded jellybean notifications. They've been doing that since ICS. 




 I politely disagree.

Maybe you're seeing different kind of therapists to me, but I think they provide a wonderful service. Let me tell you why.

Going to a therapist is shit. Even if its helped you at some point, everyone has to admit its awkward, feels pointless and embarrassing. You feel like you're wasting everyone's time and money. Even now, with the knowledge that therapy has helped me make HUGE headway in my recovery, I still dread going to see him. 

But the thing is, every now and then, there's that one session. You walk in, and you just gush and gush and gush. And even if they say something you think is stupid, or you disagree with, the fact that you've got someone there to bounce ideas and solutions for problems you may be experiencing off, is the best feeling. Even if you go to 100 sessions and only 1 of them is like that, it is 100% worth it.  




 This is amazing. Love the support for RES: awesome attention to detail. Please x-post this to /r/pics or something, so the rest of reddit can enjoy this piece of beauty.

Edit: Found a bug. When attempting to visit a subreddit that doesn't exist, the page that suggests possible related subreddits has a bug where the "view images" link is pushed out for some reason. Screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/9473K.png (Windows 7, Chrome) 




 Ah, a quick Google search reveals you're correct (which I should have done in the first place!) but also brings up this: http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/01/netcom-shows-off-microsd-card-with-integrated-nfc-goodness-vide/

Regardless, it doesn't make gilles' comment incorrect, so I retract my comment. 




 I was under the impression that it could become NFC-enabled with the use of a special battery?

 SD card slot will never happen.  




 * No. You don't need to be rooted to run Gameboid.

* The BIOS is the firmware for the GBA. It can't be included with the app because its illegal to distribute it - you're technically supposed to rip your own from your existing GBA (which is the same for game Roms). Obviously this can be found on the internet.

* Yes, ROMs from any location should be fine. Just put them somewhere on your SD card and then point the emulator there when you go to open them up. You can leave them in the .zip file. 




 The ability to edit comments is basically the only thing I'm waiting on to switch over from Reddit news. 




 Reddit Sync

Gameboid (not on the market but there are always apks floating around the internet)

Chrome if you're on 4.0+, Opera Mobile otherwise. 




 For your first point, AOKP (The ICS version, JB builds don't have it yet) has the ability to have the pattern or pass code appear after the slider, so you can have both.  




 If you put an AOSP ROM on it (which is what the other replier is suggesting) you WILL lose Touchwiz features like SmartStay and Direct Dial. 




 If you're going to do that then you have to abolish carrier posts as well. How does the fact that T-Mobile now has unlimited data plans have anything to do with Android as an OS? It doesn't. You can't pick and choose between these things. If the Apple posts go then so do the carrier ones. 




 That's a basterdized carrier version. The dispute is between the iPhone and the International Galaxy S, which does bear many similarities. 




 I think it's safe to assume that this was done for the purpose of the photo. 




 Only things missing now are:

* Comment editing
* View subreddit sidebar
* The ability to go to the subreddit that a post is from (when viewing from /r/all or the user frontpage) 




 There was a game for N64 where this would actually work. You could control your floating sidekick thing on the same screen with the other controller. It was undocumented in the game manual and I discovered it accidentally when I bumped the other controller while playing. Coolest discovery ever.

 I've been having a weird problem recently, I'm not sure exactly when it started occurring (ie whether or not it began with a recent update to Chrome or some significant change in my system). Anyways, basically what happens is that on some sites, for example on Youtube, I get this weird text clipping issue where half of some of the characters appears to be clipped off/missing. Here's a screenshot http://i.imgur.com/GX996.png (notice the clipped letters in the comment, the most obvious one being the "E"). As you can see I'm running Windows 7.

I assume its either a font issue or something to do with something called Windows Cleartext or ClearType, I can't remember what its called or how to reach the setting in control panel.

Also, now is as good a time as any to ask why the look of disapproval ( #3232;\_ #3232;) appears as 2 boxes for me (see screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/K3ddQ.png)

Any help for either of these issues would be appreciated!

And then, once rooted, you can SIM-unlock your phone using this method: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1064978 




 Probably because TWRP isn't available on all phones, whereas CWM (almost) is, and its usually the first thing that gets ported to a phone. Its that way simply because it was around first. 




 I was under the impression that Odin was leaked by a rogue Samsung employee? It would explain the total lack of documentation on the program and the fact that any and all download sites for it aren't affiliated with any official Samsung website. 




 You really should look into rooting and flashing an ics/jb rom. It'll feel like a new phone.

 If its a replacement then you can restore a nandroid backup from your old device onto the new one.

umm, why am I being downvoted? 




 The trouble is, without personally knowing you, its extremely difficult to give advice/extend a helping hand without it sounding super generic. I can't tell you that your life is worth living, or point out the good things in your world or tell you who to talk to. Possibly a close friend or family member could provide that sort of assistance to you, but certainly not a stranger over the internet.

I can however tell you that you *deserve* to live. You deserve the right to a depression-free, happy life - and from one person to another, I sincerely hope you fucking make it mate, I really do. I'd say I'd understand, because I've been there, I've been on the edge, that teetering point of sanity and insanity - but I can't understand you. Everyone's battle is different. Not harder, not easier - different. Hardship is subjective and I don't think anyone should ever claim to know what anybody is going through.

I know its bullshit and its frustrating, especially if I, or anyone else, tell you that only you can do it, only you can move forward. The only thing other people can do is be there. They can just hang around and support you. They can stop you from moving backwards, but the forwards is all on your own. Hopefully you have people like that in your life, that are willing to be there for you in your time/s of need. I was lucky enough to have a huge support network. But I can proudly say I made the journey to where I am now entirely on my own.

You made it this far. Don't back down. You're worth it. 




 Google is probably a good place to start... http://www.google.com.au/search?aq=f client=chrome-mobile sourceid=chrome-mobile ie=UTF-8 q=root+incredible+2 




 Touchwiz provides this functionality directly in the dialer and contacts applications, which adw can't touch.  




 Just an fyi: you're being downvoted not because you're wrong, but because you're being an asshole. 




 I think what s/he means is that the two images you linked to ([one](http://i.imgur.com/xL83s.png), [two](http://i.imgur.com/8pqo2.png)) are both technically "Google search" - albeit in an exceptionally condescending way. 

"Google Now" is *technically* only the notifications you get in the shade without interacting with the device; eg. I frequently get "traffic to home". Google Now utilizes the new (4.1+) Google search interface (which is what the cards are) to display its information. *Technically* the new "cards" interface is not actually "Google Now" - it is just Google search.  




 Yes. Data from any and all apps (especially 3rd party ones or from the Play Store) can cause issues between major versions of the OS. 




 I think the difference between this and update me is that update me requires the use of the dev's own servers, whereas this OTA solution supplies hosting for free. 




 Wow thats embarrassing haha. Okay now I've processed that and got t'(x), found the x value of the stationary point - how do I verify that this is minimum again?
Find the minimum of t by computing t(0), t(x0) and t(8).

Stuck on this too. Are they just random values? And what is t(x0) - I've never encountered that.

Again, apologies for being thick. :( Thanks so much for helping me out. 




 Is it not required to give b meaning, as b is a percentage of V? 




 Okay, I apologize if I'm being a little slow here, so just bear with me. I'm trying to take things one at a time so I'll get to the rest of your comment later:

t(x) = ((36+x) 100/b + 8-x) / V

A little confused as to how you got here. Obviously you substituted W = bV/100 back into the equation and simplified it, but how did you get here? When doing that I get something like:
(100(x^2 + 36) - xb + 8b)/bV 




 Okay firstly I'm just going to type out the question word for word:

Alex, an accomplished runner, has just been dropped off at Bandicoot Camp in the bush. The roads back to her home on Dugong Lane run south for 6km to the top of Cassowary Hill and then east 8km to the turn off for Dugong Lane. After limbering up for a run home through the bush, she gets a call on her mobile that she needs to get home quickly and there is no transport available at the camp.

Alex decides to run through the bush directly to the road heading east from Cassowary Hill to Dugong lane on a bearing of 135^o T.

If she runs at V km/h on the road to Dugong lane and b% of V through the bush, evaluate whether this is the best heading to run on?

Investigate Alex's options if she runs along the southerly road to Cassowary Hill between 10% to 20% faster than she can run through bush.

You will be assigned a value of V and b from the tables below. Circle your assigned values.

My assigned values are: **V km/h = 20** and **b = 50, b = 61**

I've gotten as far as drawing up a [diagram](http://i.imgur.com/JqJLg.png) to represent the paths, with the diagonal line being the direction Alex is travelling in (through the bush). I'm having a total mind blank and can't get any further than that. :/ Any help would be appreciated.

**edit** Forgot to mention that the top inner angle of the triangle is 45^o (because 180 - 135 = 45) 




 Perhaps a data wipe is needed? Major version updates seem to cause trouble until a full wipe has been done. 









 I was just letting you know because your link isn't in the self post haha. Usually that happens when someone tries to submit a link and a self post at the same time. 




 You can't have a link and a self post, just an FYI. It has to be one or the other. 




 Majel? I was under the impression that that's what Google Now was. Why would they release something like Google now and then have another voice assistant? 




 Its only become that simple since ICS. On gingerbread it requires you to be rooted - except for some Samsung phones, which come with a built-in screenshot feature in Touchwiz.  




 Quick question - do the toggles appear and disappear from pressing the settings button (like on ICS AOKP)?  




 Should just be able to flash it through Clockworkmod Recovery. If you don't have that, flash a [CF-root kernel.](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1103399 highlight=cf+root) 




 I'd you're looking for similar functionality, search for Airdroid in the market. 




 Been using these builds for a couple of days, everything is pretty much rock solid except for ocassional graphical glitches and lag (mostly in low memory situations with lots of apps open). 

The thread OP just syncs repos with teamhacksung and builds it every 24 hours. Official cm10 experimental builds seem to come once every couple of days so this should satisfy other crack flashers like me until they start churning out official nightlies. 









 The CM10 preview with the stock CM kernel, gets pretty decent battery life for me with no underclocking/tweaks. 




 Rocking JB on my SGS2 right now. No regrets. :) 




 This was remedied in JB. :) two finger swipe extension reveals more info on gmail notification.  




 Interesting, thanks for the tidbit. :D 




 If its got 150+ upvotes, maybe its because 150+ people thought it was? 




 What makes you use noLED over BLN? 




 Yeah, you can get it on the market. 




 Go away with your logic and let this user belittle the other for a minor error. 




 Probably won't have it because sense uses a keyboard other than the aosp one.  




 "I'm still alive." Its honest and not impolite or awkward if someone was just asking it to be nice, but it still leaves it open for the person to further pursue it if they're interested/care about you.  




 Not trying to be a downer but in the last 24 months alone I've had 3 different people say this same thing... and they all bailed on me when they realized just how fucked up I really was. Fuck people.  




 Jelly bean.  




 Your kernel has to support it. Search for a kernel that supports "BLN" 




 The fact that you posted this shows that you are not.  




 Why would they make a JB release when they don't even have source? 




 Not sure about miui but the jellybean transitions have been backported for use with any aosp ics rom. http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1738350 




 Just an fyi, aokp has an inbuilt setting to turn off data or switch to 2g when your screen is off. :) 




 Just find the latest stock firmware and flash it with Odin. 




 Handcent seems to work well and r/android likes it.  




 JB sources haven't even been released on AOSP, its gonna be a little while before you start seeing builds available for anything other than the gnex. 




 This is just a port using assets from the SDK and the OTA zip from the Nexus that someone uploaded. It will be majorly improved once the source drops in AOSP. 




 Proof of concept or "just cause" more than anything else IMO. 









 Flash back to a stock rom using Odin. 




 Swappa is US-only. 




 I think that's why the default browser and chrome are staying separate... chrome is a brand and its trying to stay consistent across all platforms, this means that it can't take on the holo UI. 
























 Honestly, I think when you're so far down you just don't know where to start, medication is the kick up you need. I still take it at the moment, but my psychologist is considering getting me off them by the end of the year.  When I started on them, it was like day and night. You wake up one morning and its like a switch. You look around and just think... "this is how normal people feel?". While I felt this, it also increased the severity of my lows (basically making me bipolar while I was on them) and it was because of this that I attempted suicide twice. The ones I'm on now (mirtazapine) are much better for me I think. The only downside is it causes difficulties downstairs - something that has caused a bit of trouble between me and my girlfriend. 




 I totally feel you man. It's so hard at the start, when you suddenly realize how far down you are, and the climb to the top looks so hard. It is really hard. Its all about baby steps and focusing on what you have already accomplished instead of what is yet to come, what you still have to do or what you've failed at. You've already accomplished something today by reaching out to me - my feedback and even reading your own comment can help you feel better or have a greater understanding of your situation. I never liked keeping a record of things - I used to keep a (private) blog and journal, but I found that reading over my dark thoughts actually made me feel even more depressed - I was frightened of who I was and what I was saying.

Try your best to find someone you can trust. Don't hate them if they can't understand - if you don't understand what's going on with you than there's no way they're going to. Just let them know that all you really need is someone to listen to you. That's all you need. It gets better, there's a light at the end of the tunnel etc. I know it sounds dumb and honestly, when I was at my darkest I would literally scoff at advice like the stuff I'm writing now, but its so true. You need to understand and accept that you are viewing the world incorrectly, your perceptions are altered, skewed negatively. An important thing to do is try to observe your thought process. Actually listen to what you're saying in your head, watch how you react to things. When you truly start to do this, you start to realize how irrational some of your thoughts are, and you can start to try and change them. 

Good luck, and from one human being to another, I care about you. 3 Feel free to PM me. 




 Yeah I'm 17. I'm really not that smart, I just have a way with words because I (used to) read a lot. Thanks for the recommendation, I'll pick it up from the local library when I get the chance. :) 




 Through the help of medication, lots and lots of therapy and hard work. The first step is, as everyone always says, reaching out. You really do need that hand up out the hole before you can start doing things on your own. Its a slow and painful process, and for me it contained many many setbacks. But I pushed on and got myself to a functioning, happy state (and consistently feeling this way!). If you haven't reached out to a family member or close friend yet, I sincerely suggest that you do. 




 Yes, I understand that, I sorta mean "I won this round" and feel ready to win all the ones that are sure to come after it. (see my above comment). Next time I hit a roadblock I feel I'll be able to deal with it much better.

edit: since I believe my depression is the chemical kind, (not due to environmental factors) I understand that it's something I'm going to have to manage for a very long time, possibly the rest of my life. I'm okay with that. 




 Downvote, hide, move on. These posts reach the top because people upvote them. You are in a minority.  




 Launchers can't move the notification bar, only hide it. Notification bar on the bottom is something that must be baked into the rom. 




 Thanks so much. I'm not really all the way out of the woods just yet, but I have come so far in the last three years (had depressive symptoms for about 2 years before I was diagnosed 12 months ago) and learned so much. I know its something that I'm going to have to manage for pretty much my whole life, but I feel prepared and empowered to do so. :) 




 Its not new. Flash a stock ROM with Odin.  




 No worries. Seriously dude... you are just wrecking shit up tonight/today. You've bounced back awesomely after the Play Store fiasco and are obviously working very hard to make yours the best Reddit app there is. Its definitely the best looking at the moment, and if it keeps improving the way it has been there will honestly be no competition whatsoever... congrats. 




 IMHO [this](http://i.imgur.com/q9rfO.png) looks way better, but to each their own I guess.  




 Are you seriously able to compare [this](http://i.imgur.com/stHzx.png) to [this](http://i.imgur.com/z2clm.png) and tell me that RiF looks better?

edit: just realized that this is [already an open issue on the github](https://github.com/laurencedawson/reddit-sync-development/issues/84), but it's almost two months old. Is there any particular reason why its taking so long to fix? 




 RIF is functional but ugly. 




 Just off the top of my head:

* Sidebar viewing
* Intents (handling reddit.com links like you said)
* Sharing a link to posts that aren't self posts
* RES-style advanced comment/post formatter/edior 




 Reddit News is way more functional but Reddit Sync is *way* better looking. I personally have both installed. 




 There are still loads of features missing when compared to Reddit News... 




 Mine probably got up voted because its a self post - I don't get any karma for it. Yours was a link.  




 Yeah it's still missing a bunch of features such as sidebar, sharing comments and a few others. I really want to make this my main, but its still not quite as functional as Reddit News. 




 Technically they coded their own implementation.

 Set up a Google account. Otherwise nothing, just do what you want and use it as a phone.  




 What do you want to do that requires rooting? If you can't think of a reason to root then there's really no point in doing it. Stay stock for a little while, learn the ropes. Rooting is really not necessary for a first time user, and the stock experience on the s3 is pretty good.  




 Do you have a custom recovery installed? Wipe cache, dalvik-cache and fix permissions.  




 /r/gifs is a default, no? Both of these posts appeared in my /r/all when they were posted, at any rate.

 No need to install any apks, just saying that CM will come with a different messaging app than you're used to.  




 I'll never understand why people love this ROM so much. Its bloated, slow and the dev has themed every single inch of it with ugly, tacky metallic backgrounds and blue hues. Ugh.  




 Facebook sync can be rectified with HaxSync, force closing of apps  with back button is present in CM10, and the Touchwiz (Samsung stock) messaging app won't come with an AOSP ROM, but with the AOSP MMS.apk.  




 You won't, as long as you ONLY root. If you install a custom ROM or mess with system files, you probably won't get offered the OTA. Installing the OTA will *un*root you however. 




 If its stock then you should still get an update notification. I don't know how well a deodexed ROM will play with the official update, though. It's probably safer to go fully stock and then install the OTA. Or just wait until someone puts up a deodexed JB build. 




 not sure if trolling. 




 wat 




 Flashing back to stock will unroot you. AOSP roms will improve greatly now that kernel source code for the S3 has dropped. You shouldn't have any problems with updating as long as you do a data wipe first. 




 Noob question: will this help at all with CM10 for the SGS2? 




 visit him. seriously. nothing would make his day, his whole *year* more than his best friend just being there when he walks out of the place. 




 Anyone older than 15 really. 17 here and I remember the macerena very clearly.  




 The RAZR M is a mid- to low-range phone. That's just the quality standard for low-end phones these days, isn't it great? :D 




 **Hey r/android, please be aware that OP is not talking about the Razr Maxx, but is instead talking about the newer [Razr M](http://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_razr_m-4974.php) that is coming out soon.** OP should ignore all recommendations in this thread because everyone is talking about the **Razr Maxx** - they're [two completely different phones.](http://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=4974 idPhone2=4666)

OP: The Razr M has a smaller, lower resolution screen when [compared with the Galaxy Nexus](http://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=4974 idPhone2=4219) (4.3in, 540x960 vs 4.65in, 720x1280). It has an arguably better processor and but on the software front the Galaxy Nexus will offer a *much* better experience. The Razr M has a larger battery and a smaller screen, so I think its safe to say that battery life will be less of a problem on the Razr M than the Galaxy Nexus. You must also decide whether expandable storage is important to you - Galaxy Nexus doesn't have an SD card slot while the Razr M does.

Personally, I'd go the Galaxy Nexus. Guaranteed software updates for at least the next two major versions of Android + a bigger and better resolution screen. 




 [Razr M != Razr Maxx](http://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=4974 idPhone2=4666) 




 The Droid Razr M is one of the newer mid-range phones that Motorola has put out. OP is not talking about the Maxx. 




 Honestly, probably because it was the best-looking one on the store. Either that or a competitor is playing dirty. 









 This. Nothing comes close to that feeling in your chest when you find yourself on the floor, yet again, and realize that you really can't take another day. Hug for you dude/dudess. 




 RR is a bloated piece of shit with a disgusting theme. I don't know why so many people love it.  




 [Unofficial builds for the Intl. SGS2 (i9100) on Goo.im](http://goo.im/devs/aokp_s2/AOKP-i9100) if anyone's interested. 




 [CM10 nightlies are coming along nicely.](http://get.cm/?device=i9100) It won't reach "stable' status for a while, because they're having trouble with hwcomposer (which means that Project Butter isn't completely there for the SGS2 at the moment.) **Note**; this is for the **International Galaxy S II** (i9100), if you have a carrier variant than you'll have to go to its relevant XDA forum.  




 If you have a recovery installed, wipe cache, dalvik-cache and fix permissions. If you're 100% stock then a factory reset will also fix it. 









 http://i.imgur.com/9zjG8.jpeg 




 Both aokp and cm9 support software keys. It can be activated in the settings.  




 Wat 




 Install a Rom with software keys.  




 Commenting to enter.  




 There's an app called AppExtractor - this can restore messages from a nandroid. 




 XDA developers is your best bet: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1674286. The intl. GS3 is officially supported by CM, you can find nightlies here: http://get.cm/?device=i9300 




 Yes I realize that, but the only real difference is the name of the release channel.  




 I'd recommend both of those things (SiyahKernel + CM10) but honestly, the only way you're gonna be able to tell is just try it for yourself. Make a nandroid and test it for a day or two, and if you like it then keep it. Everyone's experience is different.  




 [Huh?](http://get.cm/?device=i9100) 




 Read by comments above about anecdotal evidence on the issue. 




 No shit, its my photo and its meant to be over-exaggerated - its a family snap that I shared with friends and family. I was simply showing the OP what happens when you do the technique I described. 




 The point I'm making is, it should not have been posted here in the first place.  




 100% agree with you. From a consumer perspective, its a perfect solution - in typical Apple fashion, too. Sure we can rant and rave about how non-standards-compliant or compatible it is, but at the end of the day, Apple has provided a solution to an existing problem - however limiting that solution may be. Its excellent for Apple; not so good for the rest of mobile technology. Apple has never seemed to give a fuck about anything other than profit though. This ties in perfectly with their existing vision. 




 Perhaps. There doesn't seem to be anything other than anecdotal evidence on the topic. Many of my friends use (or did, until they switched to iPhone) Nokias and a few have used Samsung (non-android) phones (with some sort of Java-based OS), and this problem has occurred. (In Australia, on various telcos, if that makes any difference). 




 There's a difference between posting an up-and-coming band that a few people in the subreddit know of and posting [a band that has hit #1 in the UK.](http://www.gigwise.com/news/42517/list.gigwise.com) 




 [This](http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_Note:_Full_Update_Guide) will take you from 100% stock to a custom rom - when you get up to "Flashing Cyanogenmod", simply replace the "latest version of Cyanogenmod" with the PA flashable .zip. Good luck! 




 Because they both support the format? Seems kind of obvious... 




 Haha, I know that feel. Normally I just ignore it, but today I felt like being a bit of a dick. 




 Its sad how true this is. I almost feel like its an underhanded way of enticing users to buy into the platform - so many times I've seen people with Android phones receive MMSes from iPhones with this issue, they mention it to the person who sent it to them next time they see them, and the person laughs and says something along the lines "oh well, it wouldn't happen if you had an iPhone." - so people start to think its a problem with their phone, not the other way around.  




 The Kooks are pretty well known (well, amongst people in my age bracket), but they're not exactly "one of the worlds shittest bands". 




 This deserves its own submission. 




 From the sidebar:
Listentothis is a place to discover new music, new or overlooked artists 




 Its a problem on the iPhone end, it has nothing to do with Android. Apple have decided to use a non-standard format of MMS. 




 Wow thanks OP, the Kooks are so underground, I've never heard of them before. What a gem. 




 No, I'm sorry, but backups should always be made when flashing something, especially for newbies. That's great that that works for you, but there have been times when I've flashed a new version of a kernel or ROM and my phone didn't boot because of a mistake that the developer made. 




 No worries, good luck! 




 According to its XDA-developers thread, if the app TriangleAway is installed and used on the ALE8 firmware, it will reset the flash counter and remove "System is modified" from Download Mode. [The thread can be found here](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1494114). 




 You're asking the wrong questions. What do I want to eat? Yum, I feel like some mac   cheese. Who do I feel like talking to? Talk to them. Ask them how their day was. 

So maybe you cut yourself tonight - that's okay. You'll go longer without cutting next time. Put it in the past. 

Things aren't happening to throw you back into your depression - sure, it seems like that, but depression is a failure in thinking and correctly assessing situations. Your depression is overwhelming you, it is using these things that happen in your life as an excuse to get the better of you. People are shit. Its a fact. People will always fuck you over. Find people that don't and don't fuck them over either.

Is there anything specific that has made you feel this way at the moment?  




 Congratulations on finding a release. Now you know what helps you, the only thing you need to focus on is finding the motivation to do it when you start feeling down (I often find that's the hardest part. Doing things you know will make you feel better - sometimes you just don't want to.)

I find bike riding, playing video games and watching a particular scary movie achieves this for me. Be careful you don't cross the line into escapism though - by merely using these things as a "distraction" instead of actual stress relief, you are simply ignoring your problems and letting them get bigger. When I was really bad, I would play video games or go for a really exerting bike ride, but I would only feel better *while* I was doing these things - the second I stopped and my mind wandered from the task at hand, I immediately felt like shit.

Anyway, hope you're having a fantastic night. :) Thanks for sharing your awesome news with us. 









 Yeah people's first impressions have all seemed to be "Dude, did your sister have a stroke or something?" haha 




 So... Google Play? 




 Nightlies of the same ROM are generally pretty safe to dirty flash. Just make sure to wipe cache and dalvik, and **always** make a nandroid backup before flashing anything.  




 Are you sure? Your camera icon in [this](http://i.imgur.com/9zc2i.png) picture doesn't seem to be in that theme. 









 What icon theme is that? 




 1/100s f/3.5 ISO 200, Canon 20D w/ 18-55 kit lens @ 18mm 









 Do you have a custom recovery installed? Try wiping cache, dalvik-cache and fixing permissions from recovery.  




 Have you tried clearing data for Play Store and Google Service Framework and rebooting? 




 For step 6, you can also lift the bottom end of the RGB curve to make the blacks look flat. Like [this](http://www.flickr.com/photos/lukeboland/7919616866/in/photostream). 




 Not sure if being serious or mocking other commentor. 




 So explain to me why swiping away Facebook while uploading a photo doesn't stop the upload, and why swiping away goo manager during a download doesn't stop a download, when killing both of those apps with a task manager or from the settings does? 




 No, it doesn't. Swiping it away from the multitasking view politely asks the app to close - its up to the developer whether or not their app actually stops running in the background from that command.  




 Ahh true, my apologies, I misread the post. OP, try flashing the ICS gapps again, wipe cache, dalvik and fix permissions (usually under advanced  fix permissions). 




 Not sure why its doing this, maybe it was trying to check for an update when you didn't have a signal (or data connection)? Anyway, now is the perfect time to swap to [AdAway](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.adaway feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsIm9yZy5hZGF3YXkiXQ..), a much better alternative IMO. 




 If the compatibility checker says its unable, then I don't think there's any way around it, unfortunately. It has something to do with the Bluetooth hardware, and the compatibility checker checks your device if the Bluetooth chip has the capability.  




 New android version = new gapps version. [Here](http://goo.im/gapps/gapps-jb-20120726-signed.zip) you'll find the latest gapps available for JB. Flash that, clear cache and dalvik, reboot, should all be sweet. Good luck. :) 




 Clock, stopwatch, alarm and countdown timer are all available in one app. This is what I'm talking about.... 




 It is already, no? http://i.imgur.com/4N46s.png pressing the world "Alarm" takes me to the alarms screen. I thought this was apart of AOSP? 




 It doesn't.  




 http://i.imgur.com/wI0cB.jpeg 














 While there are a lot of better alternatives out there, I think people just use it now because back then, there *weren't* any usable alternatives. Go Launcher was fast, light, and highly customizable. GO apps have only become bloated in the last ~12 months. 




 I think the camera app comes in the gapps package - have you flashed the latest one? 




 http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S_II:_Full_Update_Guide

Where it says download the latest version, use this. Good luck. :) 





























 What's the advantage of using this over chrome2phone? 




 It doesn't even have cut/move functionality... 




 Even so its pre-release, unfinished, leaked software. Your complaints are not "legit" because for all you know, the final product could be completely different.  




 Its for any aosp based ROM.  




 Don't rely on anyone. Everyone fucks you over eventually. And I'm only 17... 




 I've found that app2zip doesn't properly backup some data for apps, so I unless you're just backing up for the sake of not having to download all your apps again, I'd recommend titanium.  




 It works fine for me on an S2 w/ clockwork 6.0.2.something 




 Not at the moment. Reddit news and a few other clients can filter nsfw posts, but nothing like res functionality. Hopefully in the near future.  




 I think OEMs have to pay a fee to Google to include gapps on their phones. The Goophone Y5 received root and the ability to flash gapps a few weeks after release, thanks to the (small) community, perhaps the i5 will receive the same treatment? 




 $20 + a 10fps increase in average fps (according to tomshardware benchmarks).  




 yeah sorry not exactly the same price but thereabouts, and I'm willing to spend ~[$140](http://www.umart.com.au/pro/products_listnew.phtml?id=10 id2=247 bid=4 sid=99233) on it. According to /g/ I'd be better off getting a 2nd hand 560ti? (http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-gtx-560-ti-448-core-benchmark,3082-4.html) which go for around ~[$140](http://www.ebay.com/itm/ZOTAC-ZT-50303-10M-GeForce-GTX-560-Ti-Fermi-1GB-256-bit-GDDR5-PCI-Express-2-0-/170845275785?pt=PCC_Video_TV_Cards hash=item27c72c0689) also. 




 Would the [GTX 650ti](http://www.umart.com.au/newindex2.phtml?bid=4) be the better choice at the same price? (based on http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-gtx-650-ti-benchmark-gk106,3318-5.html)  




 changed the OP to a gtx 550. its a little better than the 7770 (http://www.hwcompare.com/11894/geforce-gtx-550-ti-vs-radeon-hd-7770/) 




 I'm really new at this. I'm not using pcpartpicker.com because I'm in Australia and the prices are a little bit off (total cost varies by ~$100 because of special deals and stuff on the website I'm looking at - umart.com.au if any Aussies are interested.)

Anyway this is what I have so far: http://i.imgur.com/xaUZ4.png

I know the graphics card isn't exactly top notch but I'd rather be underbudget than over, and I'm really really new at this so I'm pretty much clueless. Any advice would help.

Its also my first time posting here, so please let me know if I'm doing something against etiquette/subreddit rules.  









 ...because **there is no quality control/copyright filter**. 




 Cyandelta updater only downloads what's changed in between nightlies and builds a flashable .zip for you. ie, instead of having to download ~120mb .zips, you only have to download ~9mb between nightlies (obviously the longer you leave between the nightlies, the more there is to download). It makes staying on the latest nightly a little easier.

 Is the widget not working for anyone else? 




 Blacklist functionality exists already in Droidwall. To switch, press the top part where it says "Mode: whitelist". 




 Thatsthepoint.jpg 




 Not a universal one though. eg Apple iOS word processing app (Pages? I believe) can send to dropbox but not to Google drive (or any other alternative apps), even if they are installed, because there is no universal "share" list. The developer of the app that's being shared from has to manually add an entry for every possible app - which just isn't feasible with the amount of apps out there. 




 As someone with depression, this whole thread is just making me think "yikes" over and over again. I've been this person - and its arguably worse because I'm a guy and I'm expected to just be able to handle things.  




 How on earth are there still kernels being released with this bug? 




 On a good day: like seeing the world in black and white. On a really bad day: a big black cyclone inside and around my head.

 That's because your phone is being mounted via MTP. Your **internal storage** yes, **internal, *not* SD card** is mounted at this directory ON YOUR PHONE: /storage/sdcard - **the Android OS treats your internal storage *like* an SD card because that is just simply how Android works.** Your **INTERNAL STORAGE** can be wiped by going into mounts and storage from the recovery menu and choosing "format internal storage" or "format /sdcard" (it depends on your recovery). 




 Stock Gingerbread can't. 




 Screenshot capability wasn't added to stock/AOSP android until 4.0. Any devices that are running versions below that with this capability have had it added through the manufacturer's custom firmware. 




 Perhaps longtime lurker is a homosexual man who was previously in a heterosexual marriage? 




 S2 has only been supported by AOKP since JB build 3, afaik. I don't think many people realize it has official support, since there are a lot of unofficial ports on the XDA forums and they all have quite a bit of following. 




 Why shouldn't there be? Nexuses (Nexii?) are arguably the easiest device to develop for. 




 Yup, so am I. The Galaxy S2's internal storage is mounted on /sdcard and the external sdcard is mounted on /sdcard/externalsd (or something similar). 




 When I had posted that comment they were only up to the Verizon Galaxy S3.  




 Data wipe/factory reset only wipes /data and /cache, everything else is untouched - the internal sdcard is stored on a partition called /sdcard, which isn't touched in a data wipe, mostly because the sdcard won't have any affect on boot or apps and almost never causes problems. That and the fact that clockworkmod backups are stored there, as well as flashable zips. It doesn't make sense to wipe it, there really is no need. If you really want to wipe the internal sd card, reboot into recovery, choose mounts and storage, and then choose "format /sdcard".

For your other problem - it sounds like a gapps issue. Do you have the latest gapps? (gapps from 2012/07/06 won't work with CM10 nightlies from 18/10 onwards due to the 4.1.2 code merge) - the latest gapps can be found [here](http://goo.im/gapps). Download the latest ones, flash them and reboot, and it should work fine. 




 Do AOKP have a build bot or do they build for every device manually? The wait for i9100 is killing me. 




 The problem is that WTF is subjective. To me, the last frame of this comic is very WTF. Maybe not to you, but what gives your opinion a higher value than mine or anyone else's on this subreddit? I'm not saying you shouldn't downvote - downvote the content you don't want to see and if enough people agree with you then it won't even make it to the front page (it is evident that you are in the minority here, given how many upvotes this submission has), but don't post stupid comments like this that don't add to the discussion. 




 Even phones with removeable batteries often have a hard reset button combo. My sgs2 does, and I much prefer doing that than a battery pull (the battery cover is a bitch to get off and on again)  




 Its not wtf until someone complains about it not being wtf. You sound like one of those people on 4chan calling everyone newfags. R/wtf was never good. There was no good days. You're an idiot. Find a good shock site and stay there.  




 Xda will be your best bet. If the builds on there are buggy than its just going to be buggy. developers aren't hiding secret ROMs that people on Reddit are privvy to. Its just how the development scene is for some phones.  




 Backup locally and upload to Dropbox... 




 I 100% agree with you, just pointing out that there is a (tiny) amount of merit to people saying AOKP is built on "stolen" code. 




 In terms of actual device code, for many devices (not all!) This is actually the truth. Official AOKP builds for the i9100, for example, are built entirely off cm code because they were the first to get JB to a usable state on this device.  




 The [apk](http://i.imgur.com/osZYS.png) is still there for me in system/apps (its called GoogleEars.apk) but the widget isn't available for me. Cm10 on the latest 10/18 nightly.  




 Clear data for the play store and Google services framework, reboot. That used to be an old trick anyway. Why are you afraid of downloading / installing the new apk? Its signed by Google - it wouldn't allow you to just install it over the existing store if it wasn't, it'd give you an error. If someone opened up the apk and inserted something malicious, they would have to resign it and it would give an error before installing (because the signatures don't match). Its 100% safe. 

Either that or you could just download and flash the newest gapps package, which has the new store included: http://goo.im/gapps/gapps-jb-20121011-signed.zip 




 The development scene for the Desire C is unfortunately pretty much nonexistent. There seems to be only 3 ROMs for your phone, one of which hasn't been updated since August. http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=29295672

 What does bitesms have that other SMS replacement apps don't? (Admittedly all the replacement apps are pretty shit, but they don't lack features. I myself use the stock SMS app.  




 Would love this feature. Have you submitted it on the github yet? 




 I'm talking exclusively in terms of the i9100

yup :) haha 




 There is no official ROM for JB for the i9100. 




 Adding a small amount of noise helps too, especially on the face where they sorta appear like pores from the distance. 




 Not at all. Is it merely coincidence that all ROM devs were floundering around after JB dropped until codeworkx posted his first CM build? And then suddenly everyone else's builds started to work... I'm talking exclusively in terms of the i9100, which has had huge hurdles in terms of hardware to get it to the smoothness its at at the moment. This isn't just bullshit... its fact. You can look at the git pulls and commits yourself if you'd like. 




 No worries. Builds include 4.1.2 code as of 10/10.  




 They changed to the model # instead of name (i9100 vs sgs2) for the latest builds - I think it was because people were flashing ROMs for the incorrect device (there's about 3 or 4 variations of the s2). Latest nightlies can be found [here](http://download.cyanogenmod.com/?device=i9100 type=nightly) 




 Previously (4.1.1) you needed two fingers to expand a notification. Now its just one.  




 Yeah I have. Its not the greatest but I'm usually on the bleeding edge of custom ROMs so I'm used to charging my phone every night, its decent for my needs (gets me through a full day of school. I can push it to 16 - 18 hrs but that's with switching data off when I don't need it. I only have WiFi on when I'm at home.  




 In all honesty, nothing to brag about. :/ I don't have any tweaks or under voting, just whatever stock settings Siyah has, and it usually gets about 12 hours with about 2 hours screen on time. I have BLN enabled but I think the impact on battery life for that is negligible. 




 I don't have that charger problem. The latest nightlies broke custom kernels, that's correct (I'm using an experimental version of Siyah) but this is not because of a failure on cm's part; they simply updated their code and custom kernels haven't caught up yet. The new code is Mali drivers, which means we are one step closer to having full butter (current 10/10 nightly is the SMOOTHEST this device has ever felt).

I don't know about dual booting. I do recall some people in the forums having issues. Here's a [link](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cm10i9100vsync/files/vsync_sysfs/) to the latest experimental kernel anyway. 




 You realize you can flash any kernel you like over any ROM? You flash the ROM  flash the kernel. Done. I'm using siyah right now. CRT off is here but its not toggle able. Its just on. I can customize my status bar plenty, what features are you looking for in particular? And I'm charging my phone as I type this on it, no probs here. What was the issue you faced? 




 Cm focus on stability and quality rather than quantity. Since cm7 was such a clusterfuck of options and crazy levels of customisation, a lot of users didn't even know about many of the features it had. Since cm9 the cm team have decided to focus their efforts on producing a professional aftermarket os - they're aiming to make it feel as though this is the software that should have come with your phone.

I prefer cm10's simplicity over what I personally feel as buggy, although "feature-packed". (Please note that I used ics AOKP from build 31 onwards until cm10 came out).

Besides, what features does AOKP have that cm doesn't? 




 Memleak is patched in latest nightly. Yay. :D 




 The cm10 nightlies work just fine... I just meant for the monthlies.

And pretty much all JB ROMs have used CM as a base, so the smoothness is thanks to them. 




 On the plus side, there's an app called [app2zip](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=scd.app2zip) that does exactly what you describe. :) 




 You should still be doing CWM backups in case something goes wrong with your ROM. 




 Still no intl SGS2 love. :( 




 Only thing of note is the ability to expand notifications with one finger (instead of two). Otherwise its basically just an incremental update to cater for new iterations of the Nexus 7. 

Edit: as for custom ROMs getting the new update, cm10 is having the changes merged as we speak, and they should be in the next nightly (depending on your device). After cm merges the code, most ROMs will follow suit pretty quickly (AFAIK most ROMs are based off cm in some way) 




 Not to mention the S2! 




 http://db.tt/9NCsvWj7

That's a copy of the free version. Can't give you the paid one for obvious reasons.  




 Its not a Reddit sync issue, its a Google play issue.  




 Force stop and clear data for the play store and Google services framework. If that doesn't work, wipe cache, dalvik cache and fix permissions in recovery.  




 HAHA BECAUSE GAMERS DONT HAVE GIRLFRIENDS MIRITE? UPVOTES TO THE LEFT 




 Not really. What OP is talking about is full hardware support of Project Butter - which some devices don't have given that JB builds are unofficial for them with no source code from manufacturers. (Eg my sgs2 has jb but Project Butter isn't really in full effect because they haven't managed to port hwcomposer from ICS) 




 I think that's a Gnex exclusive.  




 I think he's more worried about the lynch mobs found on Reddit, such as SRS. I'm sure the commentor now has an inbox filled with hate about how much of a racist fuck he is because he used the word "nigger". 




 http://code.google.com/p/cyanogenmod/issues/list 




 Wipe cache, dalvik and fix permissions. If your volume doesn't work than how do you use a recovery...? 




 Even so, that's still digital zoom. OP is talking about having an 8 MP camera, zooming in and having the resulting photo still be at 8 MP (instead of a cropped portion of the original image). I honestly don't see how this could be achieved without moving parts. 




 Don't most, if not all phones have an "extended battery" available from the manufacturer? I think this is the best of both worlds - the people that want more battery life at the cost of form factor can do so with just a little out of pocket (extended battery + casing for my SGS2 was ~$8). 




 Same with 10. 




 Probably not. There's one for unified Google Voice and SMS: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mdrtools.apps.gvintegration 




 It sorta depends on what device you have.  




 What's the difference? 




 Nova has it. Settings  drawer  drawer style 




 Why is an honest question being down voted? God some of you people in here are so elitist...

No, you don't. But you have to be rooted to take advantage of the widget functionality (drag n drop widgets from the drawer to the home screen). You can still place widgets without root but it just uses a dialogue similar to Gingerbread.  




 It does. Settings  developer options  kill app with back button (its all the way down the bottom) 




 Doesn't work for casual subreddits.  




 That codeworkx fiasco that's been going on, there's about three posts on the front page ATM of it. It only affects the international (exynos) version though.  




 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias 




 Easy A. Emma Stone, Good humor, Emma Stone, plenty of memorable one-liners, Emma Stone, and... did I mention Emma Stone? 




 It does. I just meant it looks/behaves differently than the TW ones that OP would be used to. 




 Have you tried a data wipe? 




 Just an fyi: OP has the international SGS2 - not the epic 4g touch. If s/he flashes this rom, it will probably brick their phone.  




 Isn't that basically what Paranoid Android does? Why are AOKP trying this, their implementation is horrible... 




 Wow. Is that based on Android? 




 If you don't already have a reason to root then there really is no need to root. When you want to do something specific that requires rooting, do it then. Don't root and then try to find reasons to justify it afterwards.  




 CM themes are system wide - they theme the status bar and system assets such as buttons and highlights, a launcher can only theme the home screen. CM brings a bunch of features, custom lock ring targets, customizable notification toggles, weather and your next calendar event on your lock screen, status bar changes such as center clock and battery percentage, and custom hardware button mappings ( http://i.imgur.com/ISI09.png). 

The main reason people use CM is because its based on AOSP, which is (arguably) better looking - its what Google intended Android to be. It also allows you to be on the latest version of Android - ie I am currently running Jelly bean thanks to CM10, whereas stock SGS2 is stuck on ICS.

You will lose any touchwiz features. I haven't used Touchwiz in a very long time but things like the stopwatch and alarm clock and the notes app won't be present in CM. 

Anyway, the only way you can decide if you like a ROM is to try it yourself. Make a nandroid backup and give it a whirl for a day or so. 




 A good relationship with an understanding partner can provide this.  




 This is arguably a feature of a good relationship too... 




 The past few months have helped me *really* get to know myself, and I've discovered that a huge character flaw of mine is that I just love helping people... almost to the point where I cannot feel happiness on my own, but I have to be making someone else happy to even feel okay. 

I've always been the guy that people talk to and I love giving out advice and taking care of my friends. I care way too much about people that don't care about me and its resulted in me getting burned time after time. I try to not let it change me into someone uncaring, because I'm only 17 and I know that I'm the nice guy at heart. I'm a little less trusting now though. 

So thanks, your words hit home and mean a lot to me. :) 




 I know that feel bro. :( The only thing that ever really helped me was medication, and even though I feel I have it under wraps at the moment, it still resurfaces fairly frequently, and it only helps to increase my depressive thinking. I hope you find a solution that works for you. 




 That's really nice to hear, and is definitely the reason I posted this. Hopefully my story inspires others to seek the help they need. :) Good luck. 




 Thank you so much. :) I'm sorry for your downvotes, I have no idea why anyone would do that on this subreddit for such an uplifting comment! 




 No, it wasn't easy. I didn't just wake up one morning and was suddenly ok. This is the result of *three years* of struggling, and I am still in the midst of an ongoing battle. Everyone's experience with depression is different, because its caused and triggered differently and affects everyone in a unique way. The steps that I took to get me back on my feet may not work as well or at all for you. I understand and appreciate that, but there is no need to undermine what I feel is an accomplishment on my part.

I also understand that depression can also incite feelings of anger or hate towards anyone that is remotely happy - I felt this myself and for a long time I hated everyone around me simply because they didn't feel the pain that I did. 




 For me it increased the severity of my low points (my depression seems to come in waves, and when I started medication these waves were suddenly 100x more intense). But yes I think it also gives you a lot more energy and motivation, unfortunately fueling those suicidal desires. 




 Thanks, good luck. :) 




 Thanks, updated! 
























 The inverse of this (for nice little old ladies who are exceptionally polite and friendly): when they ask for the senior discount and present their senior's card, I take the card and squint at it and bring it close to my eyes and then look between the card and the old lady and say "I don't know.... you don't look like a senior to me." with a wink to go with it. Always gets a chuckle from them.  




 I think the comment was deleted because it revealed personal information about the guy. You can still see the comment on his userpage (http://www.reddit.com/user/connor-lj) 




 You can manually flash the update without having to root.  




 Its not really about the physical issues that arise, its a matter of principle. Nothing quite says "I think you're white trash and you don't have the right to touch me." than people deliberately avoiding your hand to place the money on the counter. You have obviously never worked in sales/hospitality because you would understand it if you had. 




 You'd be surprised at the amount of customers that will actually go around the hand you're holding out just to put it on the counter. If I'm in a particularly foul mood I'll hold the change/receipt out as if I'm going to put it in their hand, wait a moment, and then place it on the counter. 




 Its been explained time and time again, but people like you keep using the wrong argument. Skins exist not because manufacturers don't like the look of stock android and think they can do better. They exist to create brand loyalty. Blur only exists on Motorola devices, and if someone's mom only feels comfortable with blur and everything else looks different and confusing, what do you think her next phone is going to be? 




 How about just an update to Drive itself. Where is my automatic camera upload?! Literally the only thing holding me back from switching from Dropbox. 




 uhh, I think that's the point? 




 Being introverted and having no friends aren't the same thing.  




 Isn't this an android issue, not cm? 




 Perhaps when someone wants to try or install a Linux distro? Just a guess. ;) 




 Holy shit, this was TWO YEARS AGO?! 




 CM comes with this ootb, fyi. :) 




 So what's wrong with just installing the latest nightly and updating when you feel like it? 




 Why are you being down voted? This is accurate.  




 Why not install onto a virtual machine directly from an iso file? 




 ...except none of the money goes to the content creators, which is the point here.  




 Wtf? Did anyone else get redirected like five times? 




 Or solid explorer.  




 Have you tried this using the Beta? Once the site is fully loaded its pretty damn smooth.  




 I'd suggest the following alternatives that I feel are better:
[Reddit News Free](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=free.reddit.news feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImZyZWUucmVkZGl0Lm5ld3MiXQ..) instead of RiF for reddit browsing and [ES File Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5lc3Ryb25ncy5hbmRyb2lkLnBvcCJd) for a file manager. It is also free and has more features than the one suggested above.

Onavo Count is useless since 4.x+ comes with a built-in data monitor (Settings  Data Usage) 




 Community channel. 




 Where does it say what movie this is from? 




 If you read the comments on the post about the Bug's Life one, it turns out that the colors were selected and put in order of a rainbow purposefully - as in, it still took the colors from the frames, but not in the same row of pixels each time.

 The userscript also adds a link directly to the .torrent file as well. 




 You can disable them in the messaging app.  




 This functionality is available on torrentz.eu using a user script. (Search for magnet links for torrentz.eu user script) 




 Facebook, for one. 




 I think a lot of it works with the calendar as well. So maybe if you create an event "Dinner with Michael"  it'll pop up with a card for restaurants at that time? idk 




 This doesn't actually kill the app like the hold-back-to-kill does, it simply politely asks it to close. If the app is coded poorly it can still run in the background, but the back button method will kill it no matter what.  




 Misleading title. Ubuntu for Android and Ubuntu for phones are two different things.  




 The group messaging used by iphones and 4.2+ android devices uses MMS to attach additional info such as other contacts included in the message. 

Ie if you send a group message as a normal SMS the recipients won't be able to see the other recipients and when they reply it will only go back to the original sender, not everyone in the group. Think of it like individual SMS versus a Facebook-like group message.  




 You don't hate Touchwiz? You should probably ditch this subreddit.  




 I actually really enjoyed this movie. It seemed to close to reality and just had this raw feeling about it.  




 Replace the battery and if that still doesn't work, get a knife or a needle or something and push the middle sticky-outy thing in the microusb up a little bit, make sure it doesn't contact the outer edges of the port at all. I had this same issue and this resolved it. Just be careful not to snap it off. 




 * Do a nandroid and a titanium backup.
* Download desired cm10 ROM and equivalent gapps (remember, cm10 uses a different gapps package than cm10.1) from get.cm or goo.im or wherever else and place on SD card/internal storage
* Wipe caches, flash cm10, flash gapps, flash anything else you desire (kernel, init.d scripts etc), wipe caches again to be sure and fix permissions

You should boot up and it should bring up the "optimising apps" screen. If you start getting force closes or get stuck in a bootloop then perform a data wipe and restore only user applications and data from titanium. 









 This is an alternative. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tvshowfavs

It also crashes when I try to send a message. :/

 I disagree. It goes against Apple's walled-garden philosophy and for an app like Tasker to have full functionality it would literally require a full re-write of some aspects of the OS. You will never see an app with the level of control and automation of Tasker on iOS, ever. 




 Tasker is a 3rd party app not implemented by Google, so I don't see why Apple would be expected to implement something similar? While you're right about alternative apps and widgets, NFC is something that Apple are highly likely to introduce in the next iPhone. They would be silly not to. 




 I don't get why everyone is saying this... OP is talking about a combination of NFC and Tasker, the things he has automated are done with tasker and NFC is just a way to trigger those. Even if Apple were to implement NFC, there would never be a way to imitate this behavior on iOS. So yeah, this is a perfectly valid reason to never switch back.

 You have to root your phone to install cyanogenmod. Why didn't you just Google it? http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S:_Full_Update_Guide 




 Stock is what comes with the device as default (stock firmware). In this case its Touchwiz. For an AOSP device like a Nexus device, stock would be AOSP because that's what it comes with as stock.   




 AOSP != stock. 




 flash a stock rom. otherwise no. 




 Can someone explain to me why this ROM is popular? Its buggy, slow and bloated.  




 http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S_II:_Full_Update_Guide 




 Its called bloat ware, and is the main reason why so many of us use and advocate custom ROMs. Welcome to android.

 Its not about predictions, its about shortcuts. On the iPhone you can have @email be typed and automatically replaced with your user-defined email. Now amount of predication can do that.  




 I think its just referencing the movie "Inception", where there is "a dream within a dream". The word has also become synonymous with "mindfuck". 




 imo what you just said then directly opposes the original comment. he just said its bad if you smoke it daily. the fact that you say you NEED marijuana every morning is a really bad sign. 




 Wow, TIL, thanks.

 Perhaps it just means another M release? 




 Create a folder on SD card called "ringtones" and put any songs you want there. They will show up in the same list as the default ringtones.

 If Google pushes source to AOSP before the release of the phone then there will probably be ROMs the day of, if not before release. If not, maybe a few days after (CM will probably get there first).

 Are you joking? Reddit sync lacks so many features compared to Alien blue. Its comparable to using res on the desktop and many people I know who have it on their iPad would actually prefer to use Alien Blue than their desktop browser.

 /r/mildlyinteresting  




 This is frequently discussed in this subreddit and various other related forums. For devices that don't come stock with AOSP, the stock ROM will *always* have superior camera quality. This is simply due to the fact that the manufacturer has access to hardware binaries that indie devs do not. There is nothing you can do. If image quality is important to you, then you best switch to a stock-based ROM.

 The miui launcher also has this feature.  




 /r/Android is a no-piracy zone

But just use browser + google? Why do you need to use a dedicated app? 




 Not really. You can see where it loops after the 7th throw. 




 I didn't actually read the post. The whole issue doesn't actually bother me at all, I for one love the idea of including a File Manager and I'm in love with the UI. I was just providing the opposing opinion for the sake of discussion - and to say that bloat doesn't always mean a large filesize (although the two often go hand in hand). 




 Bloat doesn't necessarily mean size, although I get where you're going with that. It more about whether or not its necessary. CM has functioned fine without a file explorer for all this time and nobody has complained or asked for one (that I've heard of anyway). I personally don't mind but its about the philosophy that cm has had up until now - people put cm on their phones to *remove* bloat and only have the absolute bare necessities on a fresh install, with the ability to install what they need/want afterwards. Including a file manager in cm assumes that *every single person that uses cm* will want and use it. Its not a safe assumption to make.

Plus, when do you draw the line? Would having a lightweight PDF viewer be considered bloat? How about a full-fledged eBook reader and manager? By adding a file manager to the default install, cm have changed their stance about bloatware from very clear to blurry and uncertain. Its not about the file manager, or the size of the apk. Its confusing their philosophy.  




 Unzip the flash able zips with an archive manager. The apks will be inside.  




 Its an unreleased version that's been hacked to work on a version of android it wasn't intended to. There are going to be bugs. 




 I doubt its a problem with the actual alarm app and more with the fact that we're flashing a system app from an unreleased version of Android on a version of Android it wasn't made to run on.... The app will be fine on 4.2 release.  




 Direct quote from the link in your own comment:
Android 4.1, Jelly Bean, is the fastest and smoothest version of Android yet. Jelly Bean improves on the simplicity and beauty of Android 4.0, and introduces a new Google search experience on Android.

Everything in Jelly Bean feels fast, fluid, and smooth. Moving between home screens and switching between apps is effortless, like turning pages in a book.
Jelly Bean features improved performance throughout the system, including faster orientation changes, faster responses when switching between recent apps, and smoother and more consistent rendering across the system through vsync and triple buffering.
Jelly Bean has more reactive and uniform touch responses, and makes your device even more responsive by boosting your device's CPU instantly when you touch the screen, and turns it down when you don't need it to improve battery life.

JB definitely *did* bring system-wide optimisations. It was the entire point of the release - to speed things up. Did you not hear anything about "Project Butter?" there was a 15 minute keynote on the damn thing.... JB should *definitely* be noticeably snappier. 




 short answer: no

long answer: nope. 




 Post a screen shot of settings  about? 




 Its supposed to be a 3d viewable image, navigated in a way similar to street view on Google maps.  




 Depends on your device and the dev community it has. Siyah kernel for the i9100 has dual boot capabilities. Check out the xda forum for your device.  




 yeah. haha? 
























 Make sure notifications are enabled again in the stock messages app. SMS replacement apps disable stock notifications so you don't get double.  




 SlimBean has a feature called "The Real Dark Slim" which nightmode-ifies all the system apps on your phone (from messages to the play store). For this to work with gapps like gmail and play store, you have to flash the slimbean gapps (I think). This is because the setting just switches out the apks for the inverted ones when you turn it on and vice versa.  




 Can't say I've run into that issue yet, on any ROM. Sorry.  




 To be honest I'm not entirely sure. I'd flash the slimbean package just to be safe.  




 Battery life is about the same, 18-22 hours with 3-4 hours SOT. 




 **ROM Name:** Slim Bean

**ROM Version:** 4.3 Build 1 (09/15)

**Android Version:** 4.3

**Download Link:** [slimroms.net](http://www.slimroms.net/index.php/downloads)

**Kernel:** Slim-4.3-JWR-RC-1.1 (default ROM kernel)

**General Feedback:** I initially tried this ROM because it was one of the few ROMs that had a JWR+JSS hybrid kernel - I was on CM 10.2 nightlies w/ Franco kernel and I kept running into the JSS deadlock issue. I initially intended it to be a temporary thing but after running this ROM for a few days, there is nothing I miss from CM (read: SlimBean has all of CM's features) but I would certainly miss some features of this ROM if I went back, so it looks like I'll be staying for the foreseeable future.

**Hardware Comments:** Nothing really comes to mind... there have been no bumps in the road in terms of hardware issues, which is to be expected from a Nexus device.

**Features:** All of CM's features + way more (and their ROM size is somehow ~100mb smaller than the average CM release!). My favourite have been the way they handle custom navigation buttons/layouts (the UI/options for it are better than CM's implementation IMO, plus you can do things like have custom actions done on long-press of a button, which as far as I'm aware of, isn't available on CM) and transparent navbar and notification bar on the homescreen (which results in a simply beautiful [homescreen](http://i.imgur.com/c49K0Tk.jpg)). There are just so many more options for things, and it doesn't at all seem bloated.

**Stability   Performance:** Both have been absolutely stellar on the stable release. On CM10.2 I was experiencing daily random reboots and keyboard freezes due to bugs in the JSS AOSP build - granted I was running a nightly of CM compared to a stable release, but CM only has nightlies for Android 4.3 ATM and I wanted to be on the latest. It just seems lighter overall.

**Caveats   Warnings:** Honestly, at this stage, absolutely none. I've been gushing about this ROM to all my friends (well, those who know what a custom ROM is) ever since I installed it. I have only been running it for 3 or 4 days though, so there may be some hidden bug that I have yet to discover. 




 I'm in the market for an alternative messaging app myself, here's a few that I've found;

[88SMS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thinkleft.eightyeightsms.mms) - Pretty much the stock SMS pulled from Jellybean with some enhancements (such as quickmessage popup, night mode and emoji support)

[Textra](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.textra) - Quite nice. I used this for quite a while before switching back to stock.

[Pansi SMS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pansi.msg) - Has a very similar UI/style to iOS 7 messaging, I suggest you give this one a try if you like the iOS 7 messaging.

[Now SMS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=crometh.android.nowsms) - Google Now-inspired UI

[Sliding Messaging](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.klinker.android.messaging_donate) - This has the best UI out of all of the messaging apps (IMO). The hangouts UI and animations are just phenomenal. The only reason I'm not using this as my only SMS app is the fact that it freezes quite often. Really unfortunate.

 In the meantime you can install supersu. Should fix the issue.  




 [Auto HD for Youtube](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/auto-hd-for-youtube/koiaokdomkpjdgniimnkhgbilbjgpeak) 




 Yeah its fine. Running it now.  




 Uhh, no. 10.2 is based on aosp 4.3. There is no 10.3 and there are only nightly releases for 10.2 at the moment.  




 You can do that with onandroid, which is tightly integrated with nandroid manager.  




 But that's where I'm confused. I'm not talking about restoring the whole nandroid - nandroid manager allows you to explore the nandroid and pull individual apks and their data from the nandroid.  




 I'm actually confused why it seems that everyone does a backup of their apps AND a nandroid (which includes the /data partition anyway!). I simply do a nandroid and restore my apps/texts/wifi passwords from the nandroid itself using [Nandroid Manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.h3r3t1c.bkrestore). Saves a lot of time and storage space. 




 S3 mini? Wouldn't bet on it.  




 Why stay on 4.2? 




 I was in the exact same position as you a few days ago. Was rocking an S2 and I hadn't done any research on the sim tray so when my N4 finally arrived I realized I couldn't just pop my sim in. Cut it down to size with a pair of pliers and a nail file. Took me about an hour and it works fine.  




 Nope, only the 10.2 9/6 and 9/7 nightlies (as the title says).  




 Except for the part where, on some devices, nightlies are the only option for CM.  




 Well that's wrong. I dirty flashed the 9/6 nightly over the 9/5 one and it still didn't boot.  




 Meant to say CM 10.2 in the title *

[XDA Thread](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2408130 page=15) 




 Did you do a full wipe and use the latest gapps package? 




 To be fair, it didn't commit suicide. You dropped it... 




 But is there really? I mean if the n4 had hardware buttons, wouldn't they be in the same place as the software ones and the screen would be smaller? I don't get this argument.  




 Did you download the latest gapps package? 




 I think its a software issue with the default camera app. I have this lag on the default camera app but not CM's Focal.  




 You can talk about them, just don't make it obvious that they are an ex. Simply say "my friend" or "a girl I know" etc.

After breaking up with my girlfriend of 4 years, I realized that most, if not all, of the interesting anecdotes of my life that would be good in a conversation were with her present. This is an easy way to tell those stories without directly advertising the fact that she was my partner.  




 The camera shortcut is hard coded into the lockscreen, similar to how the camera shortcut on iPhones are. Your best bet is a lockscreen replacement.  




 I'm pretty sure that this isn't possible unless the app dev specifically codes it.  




 An app called nandroid manager can restore data + apps (including SMS and mms) from a nandroid.

 Yeah, clinical depression or depression that isn't brought about by a bad situation (where you are chemically imbalanced) can only ever be managed. There isn't really a "cure" or way to "beat" it, you just learn to live with it and manage it in a way that allows you to have a relatively happy life. For some people this means medication and others therapy (oftentimes both).

 Not entirely correct. A parallel for self harm is (arguably) drug use. Some people do it to look cool/for attention and others do it because they do derive pleasure for it and it is a coping mechanism... I am probably wrong here (I don't have a source for you and I'm on my phone) but I remember reading somewhere that self harm releases endorphins into the body in response to the pain, and people can get addicted to that as well. 

There are also the psychological reasons behind it, such as feeling in control (when the self harmer feels that all other aspects of their life are out of their control, so they self harm because they can control the pain and it makes them feel empowered)

And say what you want about attention seeking, but if someone is so desperate for attention that they feel the only way to get it is to deface their body, don't you think they need some help, regardless of the severity of their self harm? 









 You obviously don't know much about anxiety. Although it is a mental illness, anxiety manifests itself in sometimes debilitating physical ways. Saying that people that suffer from anxiety suck for not just manning up and dealing with people is similar to telling a person without legs to "just walk" and getting angry at them for not doing so. 




 What controller are you using? 




 [Stepmonster](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjXt-TgqXhs). It was rated as a child's movie but it really should have been for mature audiences... I had severe night terrors from it for almost an entire year. Awful. 




 Lied to me and broke my trust multiple times, then had the nerve to turn around and claim that I was the one who didn't love her. She was co-dependent on me being depressed and miserable, and when I started medication and getting better the relationship started to turn sour. Then, when I broke up with her, she made me out to be some psycho and that I broke up with her because she was hanging out with a gay guy, when she knows full well that I left her because of trust issues we'd been struggling with for well over a year (because of *her* actions).

I loved her and genuinely thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with her. She was my best friend and soulmate, but best friends don't do that to each other, especially if they are supposedly in love. 




 I love the new UI, but there is one issue that bugs me: with the previous version, when you launched the app it would automatically open up to the last screen/activity you had when you were in the app (for me this would often be all songs in alphabetical order). The new app no longer does this, and instead always opens directly to the "listen now" page.

I only use my phone to play songs in my car, so it is quite annoying with the new app, as it takes 7-8 taps and swipes to get to "all songs" when it previously took one. 




 Just an fyi, you can't have a link + text post in the same post. Its a limitation (or intentional design choice) of reddit itself, not your app.

 Just to be clear, the comment above yours is talking strictly about FB Messages only. You can set Messenger to handle SMS as well, but it does not support group SMS (try adding more than one **phone number** to a message, it gives you an error). It also doesn't support the sending of MMS, so you have to switch back to Go SMS or stock MMS to send pictures. 




 Huh? Just tap the edge of the page.  




 The 2 year club is a lonely one, my friend. 




 Sorry, you just confused me here;

Nope, sorry

Which implied that what I was saying was wrong. It isn't, stock android does not have this feature.

ninja edit: btw, the feature is system-wide for iOS. It probably has to be hard-coded into the app for the touchwiz implementation. Am I correct in saying that the same feature wouldn't work in 3rd party apps eg. Chrome or Facebook? 




 That is specific to samsung devices. We're talking about stock android here. 




 In iOS, tapping the notification bar in a scrollable app/view will scroll quickly to the top of it. Eg in safari you read a page and scroll down through a blog post or something, and then you want to quickly get to the top to click on one of the site's navigation buttons, you just tap the top bar. In android you have to scroll up.  




 You know you can disable chat heads, right? 




 Thanks for the comments, I'll definitely fix up the horizon on that photo.

 There have been numerous posts about this issue over the years since Android's release. Someone ended up making a google docs spreadsheet of all the apps that did it the correct way, can anyone provide a link? 




 That was only a secondary point. My main argument was that he was saying Facebook? oh that's probably why I have no idea (HAHA GUYS LOOK I DON'T USE FACEBOOK) instead of a "Oh okay, I don't use Facebook so I wasn't aware." or better yet, no reply at all... 




 Well that doesn't mean much, the Facebook app is codenamed katana.  




 He was downvoted because he said it condescendingly - like "Facebook? Too mainstream for me, no wonder I have no idea what it is." Not only that but fb home / chat heads has been all this subreddit has talked about for the last few days. Its kinda hard to miss.  




 You actually don't need to change all those values, if you change model, name and device to i9300 it works. 




 No, it doesn't. I really wish it worked like that but it doesn't. Activating the SMS feature simply creates a new chat thread for each contact, so you have two for each one; SMS and Facebook messages. If you want to send them a Facebook message, you have to go to the fb one and its the same for SMS. It does not intelligently switch between the two a la iMessage. Which is such a shame because I would really love it if it did that. 




 It does show as incompatible on the play store. This is the screen you get when you manually install the apk on an unsupported device.  




 Yeah it doesn't merge the two, you've got two separate threads for each person.

And the fact that it would still occur in split screen, when no possible latency could be occurring.

 Advice from just a kid maybe but, please listen to me on this; you need to take some time for yourself. Find someone that you trust to take care of your kids for a day or two, and go to the beach and just let the grief take you. Let it wash over you, let yourself experience it. Do what you have to do, cry, scream, break things - so long as you do not harm yourself (excessive drinking, drug use or self harm or probably not good ideas).

I guarantee allowing yourself a moment to truly take the loss will help you be stronger for your children. Because the last thing you ever want is to break in front of them, and take it out on them. I watched this happen with my ex-girlfriend's mother, and the effect it had on my ex-girlfriend was terrible and caused a few lasting issues between them.

Lastly. Take a breath. You can do this. You did childbirth, this is nothing. Stand tall and proud, and live the life that you know he would have wanted you to have. You are strong, and everyone here is rooting for you. 




 Is there some scientific reason that your memory becomes so muddled from those dark periods? I have legitimately lost close to 6 months of my life because the only thing I can recall from that period is the crushing darkness that I constantly felt. There have been entire events, parties, even my own birthday, that I have absolutely zero recollection of. 




 Kelpie? 




 I used [shortblogger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.luckydroid.tumblelog) up until the official app was released. Pretty decent and supports multiple blogs. 




 Flashing a stock ROM would overwrite the kernel (and bring it back to stock). 




 Ahh, the daily anti-facebook circlejerk, right on time! May I suggest you at a little bit more superiority, the post wasn't dripping with enough condescension for me.

 How is the server/lag situation in AUS? Just about to pull the trigger on it. 




 I don't have this issue on the latest hangouts. When I go over the character limit it simply automatically begins to split it into a multi-part SMS. http://www.imgur.com/KcGFThA.png 




 Nope, Australia. 




 Just because it happened to work in earlier versions of Android doesn't mean that they should support functionality that they had purposefully designed to not be there... your arguments are silly: "This hack that used to work in Windows XP doesn't work in Windows 7 anymore, why doesn't Microsoft patch this!" 




 Mightytext runs a mini-server on the phone that sends them either directly to your PC (if you are on the same LAN I believe) or through mighty-text's servers. It's not to say that Google *can't* do it - its just that they *won't* because it is hacky and not graceful. 




 They played highway to hell at my ex-gf's father's funeral. For those that didn't know him it may have seemed inappropriate but those that were close to him knew that ACDC was his favorite band and he wouldn't have expected anything less. My exgf also showed up in a bright pink and yellow dress and got me to wear a brightly colored belt. We got some looks from people but fuck them, it was a celebration of his life and he was never a serious man. He would have been so proud of her. :)
 




 Why not just wait until the factory images drop - usually within the hour there are flashable zips that come pre-rooted.  




 Yeah this is kind of like using a memory editor to get into an unfinished level in a game that you were never intended to access, and then complaining because the room subsequently has bugs... 




 iMessage works exactly the way as Hangouts works now, it just threads iMessages and SMSes in the same thread *on the device*. When you send an iMessage (blue) that message is viewable on any iDevice, including computers running OSX - this is because it is sent over the data network, through Apple's servers. If you disable data on an iOS device and send a message to someone, it will send as an SMS (green) and is *only* viewable on two devices - the device that sent it, and the one that received it.

To reiterate: **iMessage on OSX cannot send or receive normal SMS** - messages sent and received on the desktop are iMessages. With this understanding, Hangouts is already operating exactly the same way, and matches iMessage in functionality on the desktop - that is, messages sent and received on Hangouts are viewable on any device where you have access to your Google account.

edit: in reply to your statement about the Verizon messaging app - the reason this works is because, either way, Verizon handles your message. Your phone will send your message to Verizon over the GSM network and then Verizon will either: 

a) send it directly to the appropriate # (if the # is also on the Verizon network)

b) send it to the relevant carrier, who will then send it to the device

Because they are handling your message *anyway*, you can send and receive SMS on Verizon's website, and because they can match your account info with your #, it sends as your number. The way Google voice works is that you send your message to them over *data*, and then they send it from a # that *they* own (but is uniquely given to you as per their service) to the relevant carrier. 




 [rascarlo](https://twitter.com/rascarlo) has builds up on [fitsnugly](http://fitsnugly.euroskank.com/?rom=rastakat device=mako) as well, and they are the first builds I've seen that have any custom ROM tweaks (slide notification bar for brightness, clear all recents button etc). Quite stable aside from some wifi issues. 




 ART doesn't work on anything built from source just yet, only the N5 ports. Not entirely sure why, but apparently has something to do with the gapps. 




 This has been asked numerous times in this sub. **You will never see this happen.** For this to work, Google would need to send every single SMS you send and receive to their servers and then serve it up in Google hangouts on the desktop - meaning that you would have to have a constant data connection for it to work, and SMS sent and received may appear in a different order on the desktop Hangouts than they do on your phone (unless the Android version of hangouts syncs with Google's servers, meaning that Google would get your SMS before you could even read it). There is no graceful or efficient way to do this, *unless* they do it in a Google-voice-esque way; which again would end up only working in the US and would require you to change numbers. 




 Ah, was just about to submit this, you beat me to it. Scary stuff, I can't believe it happened within just a few kilometres of where I live. 




 You need to install it using cwm. Twrp has been having issues with flashing 4.4 Roms.  




 That's actually incorrect. When you flash a ROM it will always overwrite your kernel, so you aren't running Franco (Franco wouldn't even work on 4.4 anyway).  




 Don't try to turn it on for at least a day. You will make it worse.  




 What are you asking here? Just try the launcher and see if you like it.  




 Nobody knows what device you are talking about.  




 If you're after good battery life I wouldn't flash Kitkat until the official images drop... right now, although it is quite smooth, its a hacked-together mess using 4.3 binaries on what is essentially a Nexus 5 port. Franco kernel is pretty good in terms of battery life for 4.3. 




 I doubt we will ever see this functionality in stock.  




 Has something to do with reddit automatically choosing the image from the linked page that has the highest color contrast (or so I've read many times in comments) 




 Make sure you are using the latest TWRP (2.6.3.3) and SuperSU (1.65) 




 It depends on the device, but probably not. External harddrives need to be powered and I doubt a phone would be able to supply the power needed over OTG. 




 1. That's just how it is with Android OEMs unfortunately. Even with a flagship device like the S4, you're realistically looking at a 2-3 month wait before you see KitKat. This is why the Nexus line and custom ROMs exist.
2. Check your APN settings (settings  more  mobile networks  access point names) and make sure they are properly set up (look up your carrier's APN settings online) 









 You're pretty much SOL. Best course of action would be to make a backup, flash a 4.3 rom, restore SMS and back them up using SMS backup and restore (which has 4.4 support), restore your 4.4 backup and then restore from SMS backup and restore.  




 Not sure about changing your status, but you can disable notifications for just Hangouts messages by going Hangouts  Settings  Your gmail account  and unticking Notifications. 




 That's correct. You can still run custom launchers though, so not all is lost. 




 SMS support on Hangouts desktop will never, ever happen. For this to become a reality, the phone would have to run some sort of server and push SMS to Google's servers as they come and go, which just isn't efficient. 




 No, it doesn't. The only phone with this feature is currently the Moto X. 




 1. Can't answer
2. There are a few but none even close to the same playing field as Garageband, unfortunately - I doubt it will get better until the audio latency improves on Android.
3. Can't answer
4. Kitkat comes with a [cloud backup service](http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/nexus-5-leaks-time-hints-cloud-backup-android-4-4-kitkat/) that is similar to iCloud - I doubt it will be as wholesome or effective though 




 The "hot word" option only works on US English ATM. 




 [Scrotter](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yttrium.scrotter.free) is updated fairly frequently (last update 4 days ago). It doesn't currently have the Nexus 5 but I'm sure it will support it in the future. 




 ART is a little bit faster but, since it is experimental, may break compatibility for apps. I currently have it enabled with no issues but I've heard that Whatsapp doesn't work with it. 




 Maybe they changed it to match 4.4's white statusbar icons? Not sure though. 




 Micro. 




 The PA builds overwrites the recovery, you simply have to reflash it over ADB. 




 Bar work (or hospitality in general) is always plentiful, and you can travel the world with it since it's such a translatable skill (I mean, everyone needs to eat).  




 I had a long-term relationship with a girl who was molested as a child (6 or 7 I think) by a close friend of her father's. I was quite shy so strangely enough all the sexual stuff usually initiated from her end. The first time she gave me a blowjob she went into a state of shock... I'm not talking just upset but like PTSD flashbacks sort of shit, she was shaking and it was like she was unable to see or hear me at all. I sorta just held her on the floor and kept saying "It's ok. It's ok." over and over again. One of the scariest things I've ever experienced and I would never have understood what was going on if she hadn't shared what had happened to her with me just a few weeks prior. 

There were a few more episodes like this whenever we tried anything sexual but we just took things slow and I made sure she was 100% comfortable. After a while she was pretty fine with anything and in the later years of our relationship she was quite a minx in bed.

Unfortunately we're not together anymore but I'm glad I got to help her through that little speedbump so now she can have a healthy sex life.

edit: thanks to whoever gave me gold. To everyone saying what a good guy I am, it's really not as amazing as it seems. I had a girl on my hands who was willing to push through extreme childhood trauma to ensure that *I* was satisfied (both sexually and in our relationship). Staying with her and working through it was an easy decision. 




 Sorry but what on earth gives you the idea that Google would implement FB messages into hangouts? You know that will never, ever happen, right? 




 I never said that they weren't? I just said that the images usually end up on the developer page before anyone gets the OTA update. They push them both at the same time, but the OTA doesn't actually roll out to everyone at the same time due to carriers and connection issues. Developer images are more reliable this way. 




 Are you talking about an OTA update or for when the ROM scene reaches 4.4?

If the former, you have to do the following steps:

* Flash stock recovery
* Flash latest stock ROM (if you are not already on it)

An OTA update will remove root and overwrite your radio (assuming there is a new one) so you will lose root and LTE.

If the latter:

* Nothing - When you flash a 4.4 based ROM you will have to wipe data though, so you may want to ensure you have some sort of backup. 




 I believe he's talking about an OTA - which won't work without a stock recovery. 




 No. I doubt an OTA will be pushed before the images are up on the [Google developer page](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images). 

4.4 ROMs are up and stable, why don't you take the plunge if you're eager? 




 If its stuck in a "pressed" state than unfortunately that is the case, and Xposed mods won't do anything. Every android phone I've ever used has a hardware switch that will kill power to the phone when holding the power button for a certain amount of time. 




 You can test it by removing your Google account. It is slightly duller.  




 The recovery gets overwritten when you flash the ROM, all you have to do is flash twrp again.  




 I just flashed supersu from recovery and it seemed to work fine.  




 Paranoid android has released a kit kat build for the nexus 4, it's one of the top posts on r/android right now.  




 Why are we fingers crossed? The device has been released... Just read a review.  




 Rule of thumb is to never dirty flash between Android builds. In fact, the only time it is ever not a bad idea to dirty flash is updates to the same ROM. 

So: 
Android version change - clean flash

ROM change (even if same Android version) - clean flash

Update to newer version of same ROM (but same Android version) - dirty flash 




 They ported it to the N4 using only blobs from 4.3, I don't see why they can't do the same for the gnex. 




 Ahh, right you are. That sucks. Looks like its back to Textra for the time being. 




 Yeah, server's down. I thought I managed to get it before it went but turns out I didn't, the zip is corrupted and failed to flash. :( 




 Backing up now, will report back. 




 Can I just flash SuperSU to this? 




 SMS popup on the play store. :) not a messaging app replacement, only does popups.  




 Many teenagers and girls (of all ages I've found). I know at least 4 people that chose an iPhone 5 over an S4 or HTC One when they had the chance to upgrade, because of this single feature. I am not joking.  




 Really? So it even works in the twitter app? 




 Really? So you have the full range of color emoji in every single app with no addons required? Instagram, Facebook, snap chat etc?  




 System-wide emoji! 




 This was confirmed in the nexus 5 ama :) 




 This is really surprising given that one of kitkats new features is running on low-specced devices. Surely they will push an update for the gnex? 




 Already been posted http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1pmpge/android_kitkat_platform_highlights/ 




 It's been there since release. It sends an SMS to people that don't have Hangouts if you message them on Hangouts - so not full SMS support. 




 Because Google voice doesn't actually use SMS... It uses data. It sends your message to Google servers which then send the SMS for you. Gv is allowed on the app store the same reason Facebook and whatsapp are, because they are internet messengers. SMS replacement apps are a no go on iOS.  




 IOS app will never see SMS support, it goes against the app store rules.  




 Let me show you something http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=Australia country2=United+States 




 I think one of the main issues that is being ignored right now is that ISPs are *decreasing* data caps, instead of increasing them.  




 Wow. As someone that was on the opposite side of this exact situation, can I just say that there is a very real chance that she was just as confused about what was happening as you and your friends were. Depression is a HELL of a disorder and when it gets really bad it can warp your reality to an insane degree. I hit a really low point in high school and as a result, I systematically destroyed every single meaningful relationship I had... No bridge was left unburned. You do this because you are so determined for the reality inside your head to match the one in the world around you, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Honestly I look back on that time and I couldn't explain half of my actions, your brain operates on an entirely different level. And I think your friend would feel the same way. Thanks for keeping in contact with her. I managed to reconnect with a lot of old friends when I started getting better and it meant the world to me that they stuck around.

 The only OmniRom builds that are currently available are unofficial builds, and they haven't implemented the Multiwindow feature yet (mostly because it is still unfinished). Slimbean uses a JWR/JSS hybrid kernel that rids you of the deadlock issue, FYI. 




 Does that not come with MIUI? 




 Have you tried an AOSP ROM? Much snappier than Touchwiz.  




 This has been around in custom roms for literally years though.  




 Screen out doesn't work on custom Roms for the sgs2 




 http://techstroke.com/use-your-android-as-a-wifi-dongle-wifi-adapter-to-access-your-home-wifi/ 




 Not officially, but I'd put money on it that this gets an unofficial port.  




 Because AOSP apps are being deprecated in favor of proprietary Google applications.

Source on this? Google is still actively developing AOSP. Calendar and Keyboard have both been released on the Play Store and their respective AOSP versions are still updated to the latest with every release of AOSP. It's just a way of Google getting a close to stock experience on any phone with access to the Play Store. 




 I'm honestly confused, with the comment starting with the world "welp", how can it not be read sarcastically? 




 How? 




 Why is this a bad thing?

edit: TIL "[welp](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Welp defid=5929265)" is an expression of enthusiasm.

 If you prefer the stock messaging app give 8sms a try (its on the play store). Basically the messaging app pulled from cm10.2, so it includes a dark theme and quick reply.

 What does being Australian have to do with anything? We have the exact same thing over here, they're just called "consultation hours" in the majority of universities. 




 "Confirmed" 




 The highlight color changes every year so non-schoolies don't come back and use their old band to get in.  




 I've never seen them anywhere other than schoolies is Australia. They're pretty unique. http://mobile.abc.net.au/news/image/4386546-3x2-460x307.jpg 




 Do you live in Australia? 




 Well, there is evidence that he's Australian. The yellow wristbands in the photo are schoolies wristbands, which can only be found in qld Australia during schoolies week... 




 Sudden clarity clarence is an Australian. Even if you don't believe the person I know is him (which I know it is, but whatever), the Australian part is undeniable because of the yellow wrist bands in the photo. Wristbands like that are only seen in Australia, on the gold coast, during schoolies week.  




 He most certainly is Australian. This photo was taken during schoolies week, as evidenced by the [schoolies wristbands](http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/4386546-3x2-940x627.jpg). 




 Actually, he has been identified, numerous times by myself. I usually point out who he is whenever there is a post or thread questioning his identity. He was in the grade above me in highschool, and the picture was taken during schoolies in 2011. http://imgur.com/a/LGc9O 




 Just an FYI: you can't post a link and a text post at the same time. Its one or the other.  




 I had the same problem with the lockscreen icon, hated the S one. There's a zip you can flash that changes it back to stock, its under the "addons" section on the slim website. :) 




 No worries, I'm glad I could share the experience with someone else!  




 Yeah I pretty much did a straight copy and paste there. I still have yet to come across any bugs, that includes random reboots and freezes (which I was getting daily on cm10.2). Can't help but love this ROM. :) 




 I posted in the flash Friday thread last week but it can't hurt to share again, in case anyone missed it.

**ROM Name:** Slim Bean

**ROM Version:** 4.3 Build 1 (09/15)

**Android Version:** 4.3

**Download Link:** [slimroms.net](http://www.slimroms.net/index.php/downloads)

**Kernel:** Slim-4.3-JWR-RC-1.1 (default ROM kernel)

**General Feedback:** I initially tried this ROM because it was one of the few ROMs that had a JWR+JSS hybrid kernel - I was on CM 10.2 nightlies w/ Franco kernel and I kept running into the JSS deadlock issue. I initially intended it to be a temporary thing but after running this ROM for a few days, there is nothing I miss from CM (read: SlimBean has all of CM's features) but I would certainly miss some features of this ROM if I went back, so it looks like I'll be staying for the foreseeable future.

**Hardware Comments:** Nothing really comes to mind... there have been no bumps in the road in terms of hardware issues, which is to be expected from a Nexus device.

**Features:** All of CM's features + way more (and their ROM size is somehow ~100mb smaller than the average CM release!). My favourite have been the way they handle custom navigation buttons/layouts (the UI/options for it are better than CM's implementation IMO, plus you can do things like have custom actions done on long-press of a button, which as far as I'm aware of, isn't available on CM) and transparent navbar and notification bar on the homescreen (which results in a simply beautiful [homescreen](http://i.imgur.com/c49K0Tk.jpg)). There are just so many more options for things, and it doesn't at all seem bloated.

**Stability  amp; Performance:** Both have been absolutely stellar on the stable release. On CM10.2 I was experiencing daily random reboots and keyboard freezes due to bugs in the JSS AOSP build - granted I was running a nightly of CM compared to a stable release, but CM only has nightlies for Android 4.3 ATM and I wanted to be on the latest. It just seems lighter overall.

**Caveats  amp; Warnings:** Honestly, at this stage, absolutely none. I've been gushing about this ROM to all my friends (well, those who know what a custom ROM is) ever since I installed it. I have only been running it for 3 or 4 days though, so there may be some hidden bug that I have yet to discover. 




 There are two types of people; those who have shit their pants, and those who have yet to. All in due time, OP. 




 The installer is only going to work on devices that come unlocked out of the box or have a Dev unlock tool supplied by the OEM. Devices like the LG Nitro would still have the same issues.  
























 But... It does. When you say "overlap" it just sounds like a duplication of features when it is simply not the case, if they have different implementations then they will break and neither gravity box's nor the ROMs implementation of that particular feature will work (see: quick settings on omnirom) 




 An alternative is to use light flow, it can do this for you and then you can use any messaging app you want.  




 ...well, yeah. You were the one that said that it won't "interfere" with the ROM, I was just pointing out that it will (and thereby do more than just "overlap") 




 Well... Yeah it does. It broke omniroms quick settings before the gravity box dev added an option to disable tweaks individually. And if you install it on cm and enable pie controls in both it breaks that. Its really only meant for stock.  




 That's because they strip a lot of stuff though. Factory images for nexus devices are typically 400mb+ 




 No, it really is that bad. As a non-american I notice at least 2 carrier posts on the front page at any given time. I simply down vote and hide them but it is somewhat annoying - it makes as much sense as posting about ISPs in /r/windows or /r/Linux since that's how they access the internet.  




 I think the problem with that is that there are some girls that will offer to pay for things but expect you to not let them do so, and if you don't you're not being a gentleman. (or perhaps I've just been going on dates with shitty girls) 




 How does using a different ROM affect the screen? 




 The point is, the exploit they "burned" was one that many jailbreak developers used to find other, more difficult to discover vulnerabilities, since the exploit was apparently a very easy one that has worked on every iOS version since comex discovered it. Now that they've used it, it will be patched, causing any and all jailbreak efforts from here on in to take a significantly longer amount of time. You're probably right about them sitting on an exploit until iOS 8 or 8.1, but the problem is that now, they may not even find an exploit in 7.1 to sit on until 8, meaning the community will have to wait much longer. This also affects all future iterations of iOS, not just 7.1 and 8. 




 Question: how did the photographer get such a paper-thin dof? 




 Xposed automatically creates an xposed-disabler.zip on the sdcard upon installation. No need to download it.  




 Best I could do with such a low quality image. http://i.imgur.com/Jxt9T3i.jpg

 If you're going to root may as well just use appopsxposed 




 Unless you side loaded the apps, which doesn't require having a Google account.  




 Have the 20d, can vouch. 




 How is this even remotely helpful? 




 Yeah and it works just as well as PA.  




 Make sure busy box is installed and that  /system is mounted as RW 




 Do you have any more pics? 




 I believe there us a dictionary all that you can install where you can highlight text in any all and then share it to the dictionary app for a definition.  




 Actually its a font set by the guy that took the screenshot. In touch wiz you can apply systemwide fonts. Look at the clock.  




 He probably had a legitimate reason to fall over, I really doubt there was a sni- 




 I had this problem for ages on my old Samsung device. I wiped my phone, flashed new firmware on my router, did everything I could but it consistently happened. A data wipe would fix it for a bit but it would simply happen again. The only way I was able to fix it was using an app called Mac Changer, which changes your device's MAC ID so your router thinks it's a different device. Every time the obtaining IP address thing happened I'd generate a new Mac address and it would work for another day or so. Only thing is, the app requires root.  




 Omnirom nightlies with Gravitybox is an awesome experience. Been rocking them for a while with no issues.  




 Didn't they say that when 4.4 dropped though? They probably just hid it again.  




 Not sure but it probably would have been a smarter idea to cover all your bases before just giving up. 




 Did you make sure that /system was mounted in recovery? Do you have the latest version of your recovery and supersu? These are all things to check.  




 "away" 




 I've been using a combination of Omnirom and Xposed modules for things like Quicksettings customisation and lockring targets and its working quite well, you should give it a go. 




 All of them. Omnirom are focusing on their original features (namely active display and their new incoming call screen) before they start porting over the more common ones. This means that features you have come to expect from custom roms (since they are in almost all of them) are not present, such as lockring targets and quicksettings customisation. In the mean time, I'm using Xposed with Gravitybox to bring those features to my device. Active Display alone is worth flashing for. 




 No. 




 Yeah xhalofloatingwindow can do this.  




 Search parameters work on YouTube:

"Song name -cover -acoustic" 




 Just FYI: you can hide people from appearing in your news feed. Just go to their profile, clicks the "friends" button and untick "show in news feed" from the drop down options.  




 Official nightlies haven't dropped but they are actively working on the KitKat branch (CM11) so anyone can build for their own device. There are heaps of unofficial builds on xda, just have a look around, but I'd suggest euroskank's KitKang - it has a bunch of cherry picks and customizations that aren't found in other builds.  




 Uhh, are you aware that that's a downgrade? 4.4 - 4.3 will probably mean that the radio and possibly bootloader won't work, so you'll have to downgrade those first. You can do this by flashing the 4.3 factory image. 




 Its a separate activity in the same app. Its the same way that g+ used to have an icon for messenger even though it was just apart of g+.  




 Tasker? 




 you have to have stock recovery to install OTAs. TWRP is what is causing the issue. 




 Gravity box.  




 I remember having many nights like this with my ex girlfriend, its a connection that runs so deep and something that I will never forget. That feeling of someone truly getting you and you getting them, it's indescribable. I'm in tears now because I am so afraid of never having that ever again. I miss it so much.  




 Best bet is to flash the [factory image](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images#occamkrt16s). This will get you a working device on the latest possible stock. 




 I think Cataclysm   Omnirom have this. 




 People are more likely to come to reddit with issues than "everything is fine" posts. Its a vocal minority - the update is fine. 




 Because Android runs on all sorts of hardware, its difficult to write native code that will play nicely on all the devices its available to. So, to combat this, Android ships with a VM - the Dalvik VM. This means that developers can write their apps in Java which are then translated into native code on the fly for the device. This extra compatibility comes at a cost: performance. ART is Google's effort to help lower that cost and increase performance. Instead of compiling the apps at runtime, ART completely pre-compiles all the apps on your phone (theoretically) making them faster to launch.

^ this is a very basic understanding and something that could have been Googled. 




 It has new more original features than other Roms but not any of the ones you've gotten used to (quick settings   lock screen customization for one). Will definitely be keeping an eye on nightly progress though.  




 Yeah I think its more likely that people are going feature phone - android phone than iPhone - android.  




 **THE LIBRARY** 




 This is already implemented in a bunch of 4.4 ROMs, and has been for a while. 




 Apex and Nova both offer this feature. 




 This was on the front page of reddit yesterday.  




 You have to be rooted. 




 There is a noticeable performance increase. It's marginal, but still there. 




 I've got it working with Advanced Reboot Menu (CM doesn't come with reboot to recovery or bootloader options, which I use a lot), but a lot of the modules don't work properly since a lot has changed in AOSP. 




 It's a framework that hooks into the Android system files that allow the changing of those files on the fly (versus flashing or overwriting the files for individual mods). This has many benefits such as ease of use, and increased mod compatibility - such as two different mods that make changes to systemui - instead of having to choose between the two mods (since installing one on top of the other will only make the last-installed one active) they can now be implemented side-by-side. 




 4.4 brings systemwide emoji  




 The issues TWRP had with flashing 4.4 ROMs have been fixed in the latest version (2.6.3.3). 




 Just FYI that's a 4.3 build. 




 Currently on [gearheadcustoms' CM11 build](http://fitsnugly.euroskank.com/?rom=cm11 device=mako). Has pretty much all the features I was missing from 4.3 ROMS (customisable quick settings, lock ring   nav ring targets, hold back to kill app - to name a few) and very quick with ART enabled. Haven't run into any issues thus far. 




 Try clearing data for Snapchat maybe? I was having frequent crashes on 4.3 but since updating to 4.4 I haven't had a single one (and I use snapchat every day). 




 http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2527806 




 We'd rather have Abbott fight climate change.  




 To receive the ota update you have to be 100% stock (stock ROM, stock recovery, unrooted). I don't see PA pushing a build anytime inside a month tbh.  









 There is no such thing as group SMS. Group SMS is always an MMS.  




 Has anyone tried cataclysm? My friend is running it on his n5 but I'm not sure if its worth trying out on the n4 since the dev doesn't actually have the device.  




 Everything is pretty bare bones at this stage in the game, however, I found slimkat to be a little bit laggy in comparison to the others.  




 Running 4.4 and I am unable to reproduce this bug.  




 You can't post a text post and a link at the same time, if that's what you're trying to do.  




 There are quite a few kitkat ROMs already (well, for the N4 anyway) and you have to realize that the majority of Kitkat talk is coming from Nexus 5 users, of which there are quite a lot in this sub. 




 Purity now has a 4.4 release. :) 




 Ok.  




 You can't unless you are rooted or running a custom ROM. Transparent notification bar and nav bar are 4.4 features that the GEL takes advantage of, not the other way around.  




 Downgrading from 4.4 to 4.3 requires you downgrade the radio, otherwise WiFi stops working.  




 It's an experimental feature that hasn't been fully fleshed out. **You are going to have issues.** Disable it.  




 I think there is a HTC device called G2.  




 Not the factory image. When someone uploads the OTA .zip you'll be able to sideload it. Lurk around XDA, it will surely be posted there soon. 




 You cannot send and receive MMS on Google Voice unless the MMS is sent from a T-mobile number. 




 Its an intentional design decision. The circle isn't meant to be in the center because of other icons that go around it http://www.imgur.com/cpZuWGL.png 




 Crashes on N4 when I hold both. If I just hold the app drawer and tap an app it simply opens the app.  




 No. You will still have to use Google voice. Do not remove the app.  




 You can't.  




 Try changing it to another language and then back to us English.  




 A factory reset won't touch anything on the sdcard or internal (user) storage. It only wipes /data, so the only thing you lose is apps.  




 Can't change a link after its posted, just post the fixed link in the comments.  




 Make sure the version corresponds with your android version.  




 I use Common Sense 2013. Its free and doesn't come with any toolbars or nonsense.  




 Nothing that happens to you before 30 matters, in the grand scheme of things; it just doesn't. The sooner teens and 20 somethings accept that, the better off they will be, and the less suicides and depression will occur.

While I agree with you somewhat, let me also tell you why I disagree with you invalidating the way people feel as well. Life is proportional... as you get older, things that may have previously seemed huge to you are not quite as big. This is simply because you have experienced more. Take this [crudely made pie chart](http://i.imgur.com/U59ok5I.png). Say you've been in a relationship for 3 years. For an 18 year old, it is *proportionally* larger than what it would be for a 30 year old. That relationship ending, if we were to scale it, would feel the same way it would for a 30 year old to lose a relationship of ~5 years. It's a bit poorly explained, but hopefully you do get where I'm going with that.

The point is, just because things are insignificant to you does not mean that the validity and strength of the feelings that a person experiences is not real. I say this because at 18 years old, I have been through a bit of shit. And maybe it's trivial. Looking back now, I can see that what was going on was stupid and dumb, but hindsight is always like that. If I could go back to my past self and try to explain it, I wouldn't listen. The vastness of my feelings wouldn't go away because I told myself that it was insignificant (I even did so at the time).

So; I do agree with you. But you should never, ever invalidate someone's feelings. Because that will cause more suicides than people "taking what they go through far, far too seriously". 




 Ahh posted this before I saw your comment. Such a moving song. 

"I held on as tightly as you held on to me." ;-; 




 [The Cinematic Orchestra - To Build A Home](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB0ordd2nOI feature=player_detailpage)

tears, every time. 




 The Play Store version won't be 2.0. Reinstall the .apk you have. Google rolls out big updates like this slowly based on your device's IMEI and country, so not everyone gets 2.0 at the same time (even though the app's description says so).

Edit: to understand, go to hangouts in the play store, expand the description and look at the current version. Mine is still 1.2 ( http://www.imgur.com/6kLfCTf.png ) 




 Have you tried reflashing the 4.3 factory images? Might be a bit of a pain but if you could get everything back to 100% stock it might fix your problem. 




 You did something wrong then. Whenever you flash a ROM, it always comes with a kernel, because otherwise it wouldn't boot (well, it might, but ROMs always come with a kernel that the developers KNOW is compatible to ensure that it actually boots). Franco kernel doesn't even support 4.4 yet, so if you actually did have it on 4.4, you would either not be able to boot or see a shit tonne of graphical glitches. 




 No, as in, you don't have to do anything special. When you flash the ROM (in fact, any ROM - even the same one) the files that xposed modifies get overwritten. 




 No.  




 I don't really understand how I'm biased... I made the decision to get a Nexus 4, and part of the consideration was the softkeys. I previously used a Galaxy S II for a year, and when I compare the two, I much prefer the softkeys. I could have chosen any number of other smartphones available. 




 My university has a similar implementation and my device (Nexus 4) has no issues with jumping from AP to AP.  




 I don't really understand the question.  




 And how exactly would you know what other phones I have had? I had a galaxy s2 before my n4 and it had hardware keys, and I much prefer onscreen ones. Especially since my home button needed a push so hard I was blistering my thumb from extended use.  




 Well... Yeah. Because you already have hardware keys. Hardware + software keys at the same time don't make sense. 




 While I agree with many of the points you made, I think that a lot of people in this thread are jumping to conclusions. I think its a safe assumption to make that Google were rushed with the nexus 5 release, and have only had the resources to get KitKat optimized for the nexus 5. I'm not going to promise to eat my dick but I'd bet good money that the factory images that drop for the nexus 4 will start with 4.4.1.  




 What code are you talking about? 




 It didn't do nothing, he just didn't reach it in time.  




 Because the official app was released, it met my needs and I felt more comfortable giving them my account info since it was 1st party.  




 As far as I'm concerned, content-aware fill is black magic.  




 My only opinion of women as a whole is that I will never understand them. Everything else is on a girl-by-girl basis.  




 Not gonna lie, that looks absolutely delicious.  




 With the sizes of screens these days, does it really matter that such a tiny % of the screen is taken up with software buttons? I've had my Nexus 4 for about 4 months now and never have I thought "Gee, I wish I didn't have onscreen buttons so I could have about 40 more vertical pixels"... There's plenty of room on the screen. 
























 It is so much lower than you think.  




 I just finished this book last night, I loved every second of it. The last few chapters definitely felt rushed, as though the author got bored of writing it and only continued because she had already spent so much time creating the characters so she may as well finish it. I don't understand why so many people disliked the ending. While I can see why people may find it unsatisfying, to have Nick or Amy kill the other would be completely out of character for both of them. I got the impression that Nick, deep down, knew all along just how much of a psychopath Amy was. When he figured out that she was framing him, his first thought was to admire the sheer brilliance of her plan. He knows that if his catastrophic love tragedy with Amy comes to an end, nothing will compare to it, for the rest of his life. He loves the depth of her intelligence, her ability to manipulate and weave stories of fiction into reality. 

No, the ending wasn't exciting - but it was realistic, and true to the characters that the author created.  




 What are your sources for this accusation? 




 What about the new exploit they used in the new version of the Pangu tool? 




 I wouldn't call wanting to see proof for a claim before I believe it is genuine wanting "to believe" a "narrative" 




 Sorry, but I am honestly having trouble with believing any claims ionic makes on twitter:

https://twitter.com/i0n1c/status/482002723026788352

https://twitter.com/i0n1c/status/482394671705247744

https://twitter.com/i0n1c/status/481392466202210304

he makes some pretty wild accusations without anything to back them up. 




 Except the Pangu team used logic and critical thinking and decided that using the exploit for iOS 7 before 8 came out made rational, logical sense given that it was likely to be patched for 8. If they hadn't, ionic would have continued to withhold the exploit until 8 came out, and by then the exploit would be wasted. So now, instead of saving an exploit, 2 have been used because of ionic's childish kicking and screaming, and asshole apologists like you. 




 No one cares, not even i0n1c

uh, have you seen his twitter lately? I'm pretty sure he cares, a lot. 




 Are we looking at the same tweet? The tweet doesn't tag any other twitter users in it, it simply links to a reddit post by /u/BarCouSeH, which doesn't seem to have any links to the Pangu team. 




 Why do you care? Ionic 100% gave them this code of his own free will, and they decided to use it. They can do whatever they want with it. If you've never paid hundreds of dollars to attend a class and then use the skills and knowledge you learned during that class then I guess it's hard for you to understand the situation. 




 Uh, yeah, that's entirely accurate. Is there another, valid reason for ionic to keep the exploit secret? I don't really understand how that equates to = pangu did it to teach him a lesson. It doesn't imply that at all; I simply stated a fact. 




 you think Pangu took bugs from i0n1c just to teach him a lesson

sorry, whereabouts did I say that? 




 Can you provide a source on him being apart of the Pangu team? 




 Um, who already told me that? The only comment saying so is yours.  




 I was under the impression that ionic revealed to them a bug or vulnerability in iOS that they then exploited with their own code. The vulnerability may have given them access to the system, but they still had to code an actual jailbreak from there - a jailbreak often takes multiple exploits/vulnerabilities to access various parts of the system. So how is it obvious that they "fucked it"? Even if they had copy and pasted a ready bunch of code that ionic wrote, does it matter? Honestly he deserves it for being such a dickwad and teasing everyone with his jailbreak, and he was retarded to think that it wouldn't eventually happen given that he didn't take any precautions against it. Additionally, the fact that the Pangu team released the new version with a new exploit proves that they are a completely capable team on their own feet, and simply used ionic's exploit because it was likely for it to get patched out in iOS 8 and there was no reason for it to be kept secret (except, you know, to make ionic money...). The fact that Pangu simply re-released it with their own exploit instead, not because they were in the wrong, but because they can't be bothered engaging in childish drama, speaks volumes about their character - especially in comparison with ionic.

This whole thing is beyond a joke, I have never ever seen a community that is nearly as dramatic, childish and whiney as the jailbreak community. Ionic should be embarrassed.  




 All that does is prove how melodramatic and childish he is.

And to further back that up:
https://mobile.twitter.com/i0n1c/status/475664357893079040

So he is fine with people using his exploits, so long as they don't release to the public (so he can keep making money from his classes)? This kid is a grade A douchebag.  




 But they didn't use his code? They simply used a vulnerability that was shown in ionics class. They still had to write the exploit and the jailbreak code. IMHO they have done absolutely nothing wrong, and ionic is just being butthurt because now he can no longer tease on twitter "omg guess who has a jailbreak for 7.1.1? ME NOT U LOL" 




 God I hate this thought process. Ionic taught them these vulnerabilities in a class that they PAID FOR. They had every right to use them, just like someone has the right to use code they wrote in a programming class. They do not need to ask him for permission, and it sucks that they felt so bullied/intimidated by him that they used another, separate vulnerability that could have potentially been used for ios 8.  









 Its extremely likely the nexus 4 will see L at this point. The device would have no issues running it, and google quoted the fact that the manufacturer for some aspect of the galaxy nexus' hardware was the reason it never saw an official KitKat update, not because they didn't want to update it. Everyone just chill out, and be patient.  




 DNG *is* a RAW format.  




 Nexus 4 would probably get it before GPE, IMO 




 tbh the bright, flat colors remind me a LOT of ios7. 




 Sorry, what I said was actually incorrect. I just checked the xda thread for multirom and it turns out it does support multiple android versions, provided that you unchecked the "share kernel" option when installing. Apologies for the misinformation.  




 Keep in mind that the galaxy nexus certainly had the ability to run kitkat, but it never got an official update.  




 Looks like [this guy](https://plus.google.com/103847211392162949263/posts/hZWiNuMoJGt) was almost spot on with the multitasking (almost 2 months ago). 




 Multirom doesn't work across multiple android versions. 

Edit: this is incorrect, see my comment below. Sorry.  




 Same thing happened to me when I had a car accident, a lady waited with me until the ambulance came. Never knew her name, I don't even remember her face - the only reason I know is because the EMTs that saved me told me so.  




 Or a person can get a job as an assistant bartender/barback, and get a year's worth of experience WHILE getting paid. 




 Sorry but how is any of this incorrect? I've been bartending for just over a year now and everything listed is pretty much entirely accurate. I've found that the majority of people don't mind explaining whats in a drink and even if someone gives you shit for not knowing, that will only ever happen once for that particular drink - once you know, you won't have to ask again. It's all about learning. Its unreasonable to expect someone to know every single possible drink and cocktail combination, bartending school or not. 




 http://www.redmondpie.com/download-ios-7.1.1-ipsw-for-iphone-and-ipad-download-links/

Once downloaded, shift-click on "restore" in iTunes and choose the downloaded ipsw. Make sure you download the correct one for your device, cause it can really fuck things up if you install an iPad ipsw on an iPhone. (Side note - restoring hacked ipsws was how some early jailbreaks were done!) 




 Yeah it really wouldn't have been much more trouble to add the vendor prefixes, there are websites you can just copy and paste the code into and it will automatically generate the extra code where relevant.  




 A lot of the stuff he's using (rotation, skew, border radius) is css3 spec, which Firefox only has basic support for. Chrome pretty much supports everything.  




 What makes you say that? Outside of /r/android, the nexus line is meaningless to the general public. I have a nexus 4, and people constantly ask me "is that the new Samsung?". Google has put ZERO advertising / marketing into the nexus line. I don't think I have seen a single advertisement for a nexus device here in Australia, whether that be print, television or internet. In fact, I'm pretty sure the only way to get a nexus phone in au is to buy it outright, off contract. 

While it seems silly for google to drop the nexus line, it isn't completely outside the realm of possibility. I doubt they make much money from it.  




 Ota won't work with those changes to your /system partition. AFAIK the ota updater does a checksum of /system and compares it to the stock image of your current android version to see if it matches, if it doesn't it will refuse to install. Best bet is to update using the factory images (make sure to remove -W from the script, otherwise it will wipe everything - either that or just flash each image manually with adb). 

That or you can go ahead and undo all the changes you made to your system partition (remove cerebus and su binary from /system etc) 




 Only downside to this: nobody to tell you what happened while you were in the bathroom.  




 kinda looks like a [kelpie](http://www.pups4sale.com.au/black_tan_kelpie_01.jpg) 




 Kelpie!

 Assuming a stock ROM, being rooted has no effect.

 As with all dark humor, it is context sensitive. I was just pointing out that I feel that I have attained the right to make jokes at my own expense in company of people that I am comfortable with and would not take offence to such a joke. (My mother's reaction to my above comment was a sharp intake of breath covered by a hand, "that's terrible", followed shortly by a suppressed giggle) 




 Thanks for the suggestion. I did look into other options but after consulting with my doctor he said it wouldn't really be worth it given that I'm staying in a relatively low-risk area (siem reap in cambodia). 




 from the original comment:  
Killing yourself isn't really something you joke about. Ever.

I was just pointing out that, like many tragic things, suicide can be joked about in the correct context. 




 As someone that has attempted suicide before, and suffered depression for 4+ years, I think I'm allowed to make jokes about suicide. I love to make people squirm. 

Example: I'm going overseas for the first time soon and so I had to get shots for things like flu and hep a, but we decided against me taking the vaccine for malaria (comes in pill form instead of a shot) because it has a significant risk of causing a relapse in people who have suffered from mental illness (or currently are). When we found out about the potential side effect, I turned to my mum and said "So what should it be, suicide or death by mosquito?". She was not pleased.

edit: this is gold. downvoted because i'm being insensitive about something that happened to... myself? i guess humor isn't an acceptable coping mechanism on reddit.

edit 2: i am finding it extremely amusing watching this and my comment below swing between negative and positive karma every few seconds. looks like reddit is really torn on the appropriateness of dark humor. 




 omg i cant get a job  
here's a list of jobs that are below me and i refuse to apply for 




 wait what? how do you get it to mirror the monitor? 




 Are you aware that's exactly what I just said? Different shutter lengths (all other aspects remaining the same) = different exposures. The exposures are then overlaid. 




 Ok, so explain to me exactly what "low level" HDR is? 




 The HDR on the Google camera is done by taking three exposures: under, on point and over - which is a true HDR.  




 Do you also tell people to stop being happy because someone else has it better? 




 "You shouldn't be happy because someone else has it much, much better than you." 

See how stupid that sounds? 




 That's kinda the point though, isn't it? The more people that use it, the larger it will grow and you'll be able to use it for more stuff.  




 Finally, an askreddit thread I can actually contribute to! 

I was officially diagnosed with depression in the October of 2011, after a suicide attempt - but I suffered from depression dating back to as early as 2009. I've read many of the responses here about exercise, diet and hobbies, and while they are very accurate and can be extremely helpful to a person that suffers from depression as a result of an event or life situation, sometimes extreme cases of clinical depression require additional life changes such as medication and therapy.

I've written about my experiences on reddit before, so I'll try to keep this short. I suffered from very severe depression for about three and a half years (my diagnosis has jumped around a fair bit because of my unpredictable behaviour and mood; things like bipolar II and borderline personality disorder were thrown around before they finally settled on clinical depression and severe anxiety disorder). Depression cost me countless friends, almost tore my family apart and has come very, very close to taking my life more than once. It is indescribable and if you have never suffered from it you will never be able to comprehend the depth of the despair a depressed person feels when they're at rock bottom. I used to fake a lot of smiles and laughs, and I remember the first time I genuinely laughed I immediately burst into tears; I realized - after years of nothing but a dull plateau that was occasionally interrupted by extreme spikes in both directions - that *this was how normal people felt all. the. time.*

Anyone that's suffered from a depressive episode and then started a course of antidepressants knows the way it feels when you start to feel normal... have you ever had someone sit on your shoulders for a while, and then taken them off? Once they get off, you feel so *light*, like you're about to float away. You just feel... good. Nice. Everything doesn't take stupid amounts of effort anymore, you can hold more thoughts inside your head, and everything feels warmer and moves quicker. 

I'm stable now, and currently not taking any medication. When you have depression, there is no beating it. It is just something I have to manage, and I will do so for the rest of my life. I know the signs of when I start to spiral, I have devised and perfected the necessary steps to keep myself safe, stable and functioning. When I see the signs, the first thing I do is let someone know - usually my parents - and ask them to keep an eye out for any strange behaviour and let me know. I know what the onset of a panic attack is now, I know how to keep my thought patterns in check and the kind of situations and people that I need to avoid.

Having said that, it's hard. Its really fucking hard. What is normal everyday life for other people is an uphill battle for me. Few people will ever understand why, while waiting for a train, I have to close my eyes as it enters the station. Or why I cut contact with my best friend because he has certain personality traits that have triggered depressive episodes for me. Why I say no to social outings sometimes, because I know that if I spend a lot of time with other people I have problems adjusting to being by myself again so I start to crash. None of even my closest friends get it, and in all honesty I hope they never do - because it would mean that they have experienced it themselves.

Its ok. This is my lot in life and I'm glad for it. Being a depressive make you see the world in a completely different way, and I like that. 




 That comment didn't actually say anything about the persons gender. 




 Your references are out of control man, everyone knows that.  




 No, Gerald. 




 You mean Gary 




 Yeah it is. Its to avoid YouTube's automatic copyright scanner thing.  









 What happened to klyph? 




 Look at ops comment (currently at the top). He cut the guy off because he was previously waiting in the line but got OUT of the line to cut ahead. Not cool.  




 haha love your take on this, thank you! 




 I think people get caught up in it, I have honestly never seen anyone "freak out" about it though. Its important to follow it when you're first starting because it takes a while to learn when its appropriate to break the rule. Someone who has never followed the rule of thirds will not have the compositional skills as someone who followed it religiously and now knows when, and how, to break it.  




 Don't know if its what you were going for but I'm getting a real tron vibe from this and it is AWESOME. Thanks! 




 I love watercolor, thanks so much! 




 I really like the first one, thank you! 




 sorry I honestly didn't mean to come across as demeaning or condescending, but after re-reading my comment I can see how easily it would be perceived that way. Most smartphones have a "tethering" feature that essentially creates a wifi hotspot that would make a chromecast operate as desired. :) 




 God damn I keep coming back to my jawline haha. It's such a small part of the drawing but I love the way it looks. 




 this is really good, especially for something drawn in such little time. Thanks! 




 Not Australian until its a green hose pipe.  




 Don't know about op but I personally work in hospitality and regularly do 12-14 hour shifts. When you're in a fast spaced environment like a busy restaurant, bar or night club, the hours fly by really quickly, since there is always something to do. (Except if you're closing. FUCK those last 2-3 hours). 




 Could you not setup a wireless hotspot on your laptop (adhoc) or phone? It only needs a WiFi LAN connection to work.  









 Your launcher has little to do with it.  









 I was instructed by management to do it, and it was one of a very long list of reasons that I left. 




 I guess so, but RR (or at least, the ones I worked at) are particularly bad (especially compared to say, McDonald's - I have worked there also). A few things off the top of my head:

* It is common to still serve food that has been dropped on the floor
* Chips are often served 30+ minutes old in a slow period - the heater keeps them hot but they are still old chips (they are sometimes dipped back into the fryer to freshen them up)
* Stores would regurlarly re-date the desserts kept in the fridge - it was not uncommon for customers to come back complaining about their cheesecake or chocolate mousse being sour/out of date/otherwise off
* When food was returned to us (due to a customer complaint) it would often be re-used (with us having no idea what the customer has done to it during the time it took for them to bring it back)
* Our gravy and mashed potato is just made from powder + hot water (this one ain't so bad, cause it tastes fucking delicious anyway lol)
* Rooster rolls are made using 3+ day old chicken that they were unable to sell. They are made in the morning and kept in the fridge until close and are simply microwaved when they get ordered - it is not uncommon to find bones in them (kitchen staff have to strip the chicken from the carcass when making them, and kitchen staff are fucking lazy)
* If you order chips without salt, there's about an 80% chance they will simply drop already salted chips back into the fryer for a few seconds and then serve them to you
* Those banana fritters that everyone loves - has anyone tried pulling off the crumbs to see the banana underneath? 95% of the time they're a mushy, black mess. 
* Gloves and hairnets are optional

The ONLY thing you should eat from that place is the roast chicken. They have good quality chicken, and it is properly slow roasted in ovens (although how clean those ovens are depends on how quickly the kitchen closer wanted to get out the night before) for about an hour. 




 I worked at a red rooster on the gold coast for 3 years, and covered shifts for pretty much every store on the gold coast... Trust me, you do not want to eat there.  




 Voxli used to be able to do it. You had to install a plugin though.  




 I had to scroll too far into the comments to find this reference.  




 What about it didn't you like? 




 Are you being serious? I thought Sinister was really well done.  




 Again,less to do with actually using the software but more about converting a database over to its system, possibly manually reentering tags and creating collections.  




 Workflow in terms of modules, presets and the persons database (how tags and star ratings are handled, as well as collections and filenames) can be quite different and extends further than "a bunch of sliders". 




 Short blogger was pretty good before the official app was released, but I stopped using it since I preferred the official one. What don't you like about it? 




 This can be fixed with custom ROMs/xposed but your point is still valid. Full screen landscape keyboard has no place in android anymore (or at the very least there should be an option).  




 Can confirm, currently using a 20D. :( I love this body to pieces but it has terrible ISO performance.  




 I have the TTL 465 and love it.  




 That's my point here... its not actually doing any SMS sending - the app does this over data. Turn off your data and wifi and the app won't work anymore. 




 No they don't? That's why there are no SMS app replacements on the app store. You have to be jailbroken. 




 Huh? 




 You can apply the preset in the develop panel and then click the compare button (the Y|Y button down the bottom of the develop module) if that helps? 




 There is no difference, all canon DSLR flash mounts are the same. They're just trying to saturate search results (people will often search "flash for canon t3i").  




 You can replicate this by layering the original image and the filtered one on top and just lowering the opacity.  




 How will they manage that when apple doesn't allow apps to interfere with sms at all? 




 Its not House on the Haunted Hill or it's sequel, Return to the House on the Haunted Hill? 




 fuck sake i hate reading things like this cause it always gets me upset and angry. i broke up with a girl i had been dating for 4 years - it was me that initiated the breakup but i was still extremely heartbroken to do it (i still very much loved her but our relationship was toxic for the both of us). knowing that my best mate was kind of a dick head and a desperate virgin, i specifically asked him not to try anything with her and, because he was pretty much my only friend at the time (i lost the majority of my friends through the breakup. fuck people are petty) that i would really need his support for the following months. what happens the next day? he's texting her and snapchatting her nudes. FUCK PEOPLE.

 Did you read the article? The title is a bit sensationalist but it basically boils down to KitKat is now only allowing apps to write in a specific place on the sdcard - this is good for everyone! No more sdcard clutter.  




 Why? 




 Its not a feature in gravity box unfortunately but some ROMs do have this. I know cm does for sure.  




 A good barista should be able to control how much foam goes into the cup without a spoon. ;) 




 Nothing in this thread has touched me but this hits hard. This was something me and my ex used to do every now and then (OK I lied, we did this quite often, we were both in our mid teens so our metabolisms could handle it without it affecting our weight) 




 Assuming the machine is hooked up to a water source, it pushes water through the coffee in the group handle (the cup that holds the coffee) and into the cup. Then you froth the milk using the further (which also heats it).

 It's a joint so its a little but different.  




 People still make fun of me for taking antidepressants.  









 The gravity box dev recently released an update that allows you to turn off individual tweaks, so if you disable the navigation bar tweaks you shouldn't have any conflicts (the reason you were having issues with it was because gravity box is really only meant for stock and so your ROMs navbar implementation was conflicting with gravity box's).

 Solo revs is an experience in and of itself. Just do it.  




 Try to think of your diagnosis like diabetes. :) I find it easier to brush of peoples ignorance that way, because I wouldn't feel ashamed or upset if someone tried to make me feel bad for having a broken leg or something, just laugh at them for being an idiot. At the end of the day, your brain is an organ and can get unwell just like any other.  




 Thank you for that. I think the hardest thing has been, after having the diagnosis explained to me and what the symptoms are, I had this epiphany-type moment where I went back through all the shit that has gone on in my life and, with the revelation of this disorder, realizing that every single episode was caused by me and me alone. My entire understanding of my past and my friendships has been completely flipped, and it makes me sick to think of the things I have done to people because I thought they deserved it, how I pushed people away and yet expected them to come back and save me. I'm so deathly afraid of the road ahead. Its bittersweet in a sense because for once in my entire life I have an understanding of the chaos that is inside me, but at the moment I can't see it changing or getting better (even though, logically, I know it can).  




 I'm a 20 y/o guy that has struggled with episodes of rage and depression my entire life. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder in 2011 and have been treated on the basis of that up until today. A few days ago I had my first major depressive/suicidal episode in almost two years and was admitted into a psych hospital after much convincing by my doctor (I could feel myself sliding into a depression so I decided to see my doctor to get a referral to a psychiatrist). After speaking with some of the doctors here they are confident that I have BPD. I never even knew what it was. After reading up on the symptoms, every single thing is applicable to me. Intense mood swings, splitting, issues in my friendships and relationships, impulsive behaviour, self destructiveness and suicidal thoughts etc etc.

I've been reading up on BPD and I feel so so much worse. I always knew there was something really wrong with me, and I thought it was Bipolar - I WISH it was bipolar because at least it is treatable. It feels like a death sentence. I cannot see myself ever finding love or holding down a meaningful friendship (my life is a long, smoking trail of destroyed and failed attempts to connect with people). I feel lost and upset and confused. I don't want this. Where do I go from here. FUCK 




 The issue is that she is practically living here and not paying rent. I do like her as a person, I consider her a friend, which is why the situation is so difficult/complicated because I want to resolve this without damaging the friendship. I probably should have mentioned this before but she was actually living here before I moved in. She was living here with Roommate B until they split up, and I took over her lease. They got back together after a few weeks which is when this all started. Putting her on the lease is not an option because of a few things: 

- the apartment is simply not big enough for four people (its a two bedroom apartment, and the room that I'm in isn't really a room)

- there is only three car spaces, with no other place to park within 3km (she currently parks in the visitor spot when she comes over, which residents aren't allowed to do)

- the landlord would not allow her back on the lease anyway, because she handled leaving so poorly last time (she basically just up and left and stopped paying rent - it was just luck that I happened to be moving around the same time because I was looking at other places before Roommate A asked me to take over the lease)

Having said all that though, myself and roommate A have discussed asking her to pay a share of the utilities bill when it comes next, based on her being here literally every weekend and having showers etc.  




 That's the plan at the moment - I'm just finding it difficult because my options for getting away from the situation are minimal. I've moved interstate to a city where I have no friends or family. Short of eating out   sitting in coffee shops all day   night I have no other options, I can't go anywhere else except home. And most of these issues arise when I'm trying to sleep.  




 As stated in the OP, I have brought all of these issues up with both himself and the girlfriend on numerous occasions, and have always gone about it in a polite way and going in with a plan on what I wanted to say and a solution to fix the issue. The problem is fixed for a while, then it slowly seeps back in over a week or so before going right back to how it was previously.  




 **TL;DR: My roommate has no respect for myself or the apartment, does not make any effort to keep the place clean or contribute to the household in any way. His girlfriend (who does not live with us) is at the apartment basically 24/7 and does not respect the boundaries of myself or my other roommate. There is constant drama in the household, and despite my best efforts to tame the situation, nothing is changing   it is affecting my work performance and getting me down. I don't know where to go from here.**

I moved in with roommate A   roommate B in February earlier this year. Roommate A is great - I have been friends with him for over 10 years, and we rarely have issues between us when it comes to household stuff. Roommate B (who I had only briefly met once before I moved in) on the other hand is an absolute fucking nightmare.

So there are a lot of issues at play here; Roommate B

- Never cleans up/washes his dirty dishes

- Never contributes to shared items for the household (toilet paper, cleaning products, milk etc.)

- Refuses to do stuff like take out the rubbish

- Has a total disregard for the noise he makes when other people are sleeping (Roommate A   myself both do shift work and generally work weekends while Roommate B has a day job and weekends off, so he's always having people over for drinks   coming home late over the weekend and just being as loud as fucking possible)

These are some of the more minor grievances, which are sort of a non-issue because of one thing - his girlfriend. His girlfriend will come over and do his washing, cleaning, cooking, and buy his share of the household shared items (they have a joint bank account). But that is also sort of the problem here.

Roommate B's girlfriend is over every single day of the week - from the afternoon when Roommate B finishes work (~4pm) until late into the evening (10-11pm). As I said above, she'll come over   cook for him, clean up all his mess, do his washing and pack his lunch for work the next day. The only reason she goes home is because myself and Roommate A sat down with them and told them that she could no longer sleep in the apartment during the week (after she had slept there for 15 consecutive days). So now it just feels like they're taking the piss. She is here as often as possible during the week without actually sleeping over, so technically following the agreement we had made with them, and then she is here from Friday afternoon until late Sunday evening (and will stay on a Monday if there is a public holiday because 'its apart of the weekend'). 

This has been a constant issue in the household, and myself and Roommate A are constantly having to address it. The issue isn't really so much even the time she spends here, its the way she treats the apartment   the fact that she comes here not as a guest, but to basically live in the apartment (without paying rent or utilities). Further issues with Roommate B's girlfriend;

- She does her washing here (not all of it, but regularly enough to be noticed)

- She has her own bath towel   hook in the bathroom

- She frequently refers to the apartment as 'home' or 'our place'

- She will invite her friends to the apartment without letting any of us know (has brought them over for dinner)

And just yesterday she walked through our front door unannounced, with a friend, while Roommate B was not home (he had given her his key to get in).

So all this stuff is going on on a regular basis, just constantly building up my frustration at the situation and both Roommate B   his girlfriend's total lack of respect for myself and Roommate A, and then on TOP of this, every single weekend (or close enough to not make a difference) they will go out for a drink, come home and have these loud, melodramatic arguments that go on for MINIMUM two hours. This is not just bickering, its huge episodes where she's screaming and crying and threatening to leave him forever. If he hasn't cheated on her, he's spent too much of her money or he's taken drugs again. This is of course followed by them making up and having ridiculously loud sex. I haven't been living here all that long but I have already lost count of the amount of times I have had to go into work with NO sleep because of this shit. 

This honestly sounds like an episode of some stupid TV show and I legitimately feel like I'm trapped in the big brother house. I have voiced my concerns numerous times to the both of them on all of the above issues, and they say all the right stuff and it gets better for about a week, and then quickly descends right back into where it was.

I just want to be able to feel comfortable and safe in my own apartment. I want to be able to sleep   have my roommate respect my space and the apartment. I am on the lease until January and I am at a complete loss of what to do here. 




 Infuse it with apricot and make a Charlie Chaplin. Mmmmm 




 I've actually just been asked to write the cocktail list for my bar, with heavy suggestions on certain alcohol so they can move some old stock. 

45ml fireball cinnamon whiskey, 15ml frangelico, 30ml thickened cream. Shake, strain, awesome. 




 It's also in Australia, where almost everything is significantly more expensive. $20 an hour is really not that much here.  




 Did you not see the part where he tried to use the terminal and it shutdown/locked itself?  




 Nothing like a cheeky nandos after some banter with the lads, ay bruv? 




 Jesus Christ please do not encourage the use of bisexual as a stepping stone to coming out as gay.  




 If the screen turns on, its not bricked. You can just flash it with ODIN.  




 Check out the Melbourne bartender exchange on Facebook. You're not likely to find work here. (Also, there is a shit tonne of places hiring in the cbd and northern suburbs at the moment. Just print out a bunch of resumes and drop them in person) 




 Heavy liquor licensing laws prevent such a place from existing. You will be back on the streets by 4am, so no partying til sunrise unless its in an apartment (or at the casino, but let's not go there). Swingin safari has a pretty cool vibe though (depending on what you're taking - I'm assuming MDMA) but I don't even know if its still open.  




 Melbourne. Its entirely possible to go out Friday night and not stop partying until Monday morning. Look up revolver Melbourne Sunday morning on YouTube.  




 I get what you're saying but its now been two days since it happened and I haven't heard from her. I would have given the benefit of the doubt if she had reached out and apologized for her behavior, given that she was under the influence and no actual harm came of it, but she clearly does not have an issue with her behavior and that says enough for me.  




 100% certain. Only thing I'd taken was the pills (and a handful of drinks) and while I had started to have some auditory hallucinations by the time I got to my apartment, I seriously doubt I hallucinated coherent sentences.  




 Definitely did not help the situation haha.  




 Yeah I guess you're right. I think I'll just stop making the effort to contact her, but if she apologizes on her own I would just let it go (but still never be in a situation with drugs and her again). We were all definitely still under the influence, but she was also lucid enough to know exactly what she was doing.  




 I was the one spending the money on the drugs. Maybe that was it... 




 I'm a guy, and the other two people were another guy and another girl.  




 Haha you got me. "Let's go to revs." Was said more than once. 




 Last Friday night I met up with a friend and a couple of her friends that I had not seen for a few months - after a few drinks we ended up getting our hands on some ecstasy and took a few pills each. These were the strongest ones I'd ever done and I ended up on a completely new level - it was fun and awesome, we basically just hung out at a bar until they closed at 7am. By the time we got outside I had started to come down, and after getting a bite to eat I started having mild hallucinations (likely due to sleep deprivation) and decided to go home. Up until this point the night had gone fantastically, but my friend and the other guy we were with instantly turned nasty as they wanted to keep going (there is a club where I live that is open 24 hours Fri-Mon and is generally filled with people that don't want the good times to end). They started taking advantage of the fact that I was coming down (both physically and mentally) and were trying to scare/guilt me into staying. I have only just moved to town so I didn't really know where we were, and they refused to give me directions to the nearest train station and even actively tried to make me confused/lost - I tried to get my bearings by walking the direction I thought we had come and they followed me, laughed at me and told me I was going the wrong direction. I was becoming extremely upset and just wanted them to leave me alone but kept my cool and did not give them the reaction they wanted - just pretended like that weren't doing it and gave them both hugs and thanked them for a good night when I finally got on a tram home (thanks to my phone).

Why do people do this? I have no issue with going on multiple-day benders but when someone decides they're done, why on earth would you try to make them feel like shit for making that decision? Because I was coming down extremely hard it really rattled me and I ended up in tears on the tram. It has truly affected the way I view this person (after being decent friends with them for 3 years) and I probably won't socialize with her ever again. 




 So many people on this sub misunderstand this. The reason they make those unnecessary modifications isn't because it enhances the experience, its so that when you hand your mum your HTC or Moto device to take a photo, they look at it and go "oh I don't know how to use this, I have a Samsung.". It creates brand loyalty because people go with what's familiar.  




 It explicitly says that it is unlikely to work on modified ROMs (eg cm) 




 The reason this rule usually exists is because some people have tattoos that are distasteful or inappropriate for the workplace, and so instead of having to make a judgement call per tattoo (and thereby inviting the possibility of outrage and drama from an employee that is upset because they have to cover their tattoo but another employee doesn't) they just have a blanket policy.  




 Guess we're all different after all. :) OP did say they were into pubs over clubs though, so that's what I recommended (club Liv is awful). Take it from a 19 year old who goes out quite literally every night.  




 Surfers is tragic compared to the nightlife of almost every other major city in Australia, so don't expect much. That being said, fiddlers green and the avenue are usually pretty enjoyable any night of the week. If you're down for a boogy I'd hit up Bourbon Bar - pretty much the only club in Cavill that's worth the entrance fee. Beer garden is always good fun too.  




 Yes, you can do this by shrinking the existing partition to whatever you desire (the minimum being the amount of data currently on it, so 400gb) using Partition Wizard in windows or gparted (from a live linux disc). You can then create an additional partition to install OS X to. 

Just FYI, it's recommended for beginners to install OS X on two separate hard drives as installing them on the same harddrive can cause issues that may be difficult to solve for someone that has never hackintoshed before. The OS X installer will refuse to install on a drive that does not have a GPT partition table (windows machines typically have MBR) and you will need to patch your installer to allow you to do so. 




 How do you feel about paying taxes?  




 If we're taking this to a realistic level, each month there'd be a performance rating and if you don't reach a certain rating (or have too many customer complaints) your mandatory employment is extended an additional month, until you complete every month with satisfactory effort.  









 Make sure you don't have NO PLS RECOVERY installed.  




 When I was suicidal I used to write letters to the few people I thought I owed an explanation to if I were to actually commit suicide. By the time I finished each letter, the feeling would pass and I would promise myself that I would sleep on it and if I still felt like doing it tomorrow, I would. Each time I would wake up the next day feeling really silly and dumb and continue on. I kept each letter that I wrote in a book. I wrote about 10 in all, and then a day came where I realised there was nobody else I felt I should write a letter to - which means I no longer had something to distract me from the suicidal compulsions I had. I left the letters on my bed and stood outside my parents bedroom door for about an hour, hoping that they would somehow be able to sense that I desperately needed help. They didn't, so I got in my car and drove to a stretch of road that I often travelled to clear my head, which I had never seen any other cars on at night. I closed my eyes and just put my foot down and let go of the wheel, ended up going off the road and rolling a couple of times before crashing into a tree.

What went through my mind? Nothing. Not to take away from what other commenters have posted here, but I have noticed a lot of people are posting about having a rough night and thinking about suicide. When you really make the decision to end your life, you don't think about anything. You have considered every single option and to your (irrational) brain, suicide isn't just the best option, it is the *only* option. An overwhelming sense of calm and clarity overtook me. My mind was blank. 

I walked away from that car with a couple of stitches in my head and back (crawling through the shattered windshield) and a broken finger. To say I was incredibly lucky was an understatement. 

Depression is no joke. If you think someone you know might be struggling, PLEASE do something. The thing that made it the most difficult for me is that I had reached out to people and nobody really took me seriously. My parents wrote off my behaviour changes and general deterioration of my mental state to being a teenager. Please, don't ignore shit like this. Suicide is a fucking horrible thing.  




 I installed it without issue, so I'm not sure what YouHawk's problem is, but I have no idea how to check if it actually deleted afc2. 




 It's viewed by many in the jb scene as insecure.  




 iLex RAT and restore will essentially restore your device without losing your jailbreak (using the restore option). Regardless, while Apple is still signing 8.1 and 8.1.1, just restore to whatever iOS version you want and rejailbreak.  




 Boot into safe mode by holding volume up while booting (disables all tweaks). From there you can either try to uninstall tweaks one by one (you'll have to reboot each time to get out of safe mode and see if the tweak was at fault) or you can make a backup and do a fresh restore.  




 Your best bet is to uninstall any tweaks you've installed in the last 24 hours since you started having issues (you can do this in safe mode). Respringing in safe mode just goes back to safe mode again, which is why your tweaks aren't showing up. You have to reboot, and if you're sill getting a black screen then there is still a problem tweak. Possibly try installing ilex rat while in safe mode and use that to remove all your tweaks.  




 Make a backup through iTunes of the old one and restore that backup on the new one. Done.  




 According to ipsw.me (which is updated every 60 seconds) 8.1 is still being signed.  




 You need to follow a guide, Google around for a bit and read one. At the first Yosemite selection screen, type "-v" without the quotes and hit enter. Your mouse isn't supposed to be responsive at this point, what you're seeing is the bootloader, which only responds to keyboard input.  




 I think I may just be the worst here: Smirnoff vodka, Jim beam, Gordon's gin, cuervo tequila, bundy rum, Johnny red   Bacardi. $8 for a 1oz pour.  




 Niresh has a lot of tweaks and changes to the system compared to a vanilla install (moreso than any other hackintosh) so doing a direct update to 10.10 would be a bad idea and you'd probably lose your working install. Its recommended to do a fresh install to update between major releases anyway. 




 Anyone know if I can take advantage of this deal in Australia? 




 What's your point? 




 I know they have been transparent. I don't actually have any problem with them doing it. My point is, if you do your banking on an operating system that WILL send your bank account login info over the net, you are extremely naive. Not even your bank knows your password. All it takes is a disgruntled Microsoft employee.  




 Why on earth is this guy being downvoted? It's absolutely true. If are using Windows 10 as your main/only OS right now you are retarded.  




 You come back to that area later in the game and you have a new tool to get through.  




 Graphics enabler is a hack to use unsupported graphics cards on osx. Osx supports the HD 7xxx series natively as of mavericks. Leave it off.  




 I think "less intelligent" is a bit of a stretch. Building a pc is an enthusiast/hobbyist thing to do. A person is not "less intelligent" because they choose to channel their time and energy elsewhere.  




 The "charm" you're talking about is called nostalgia, dude. The current gen (and every future gen, likely) still provides that same "charm" for the 10 year old that gets a COD Xbox One bundle for Christmas. 

"It used to be so much better pre console x" aka when you were a kid. What a stupid comment, of course its going to seem better/cooler/more "charming".  




 You can uninstall the motioninjoy software once you've got the drivers up and running and just use better ds3 exclusively. That's what I did and it works like a charm.  




 Why not just exclude connections made to certain IP addresses/websites? How are you catching the data usage in the first place? 




 I think that might be your problem - I'm fairly sure virtualbox requires you have at least 8gb of RAM to host a 64bit OS for performance reasons. Have you tried installing the 32bit version instead? Your computer might handle that better.  




 Are you on the latest version of virtualbox? You have to choose 64bit from the drop down list of OS options. http://imgur.com/uHIzuZk 




 Virtualbox definitely supports 64bit and has for a long time.  




 You can't post a link and text at the same time, just FYI.  




 I think this is more in terms of if it gets taken to court.  




 Its a graphics issue. The GUI is loaded just after that Bluetooth message (the Bluetooth message isn't stopping the boot, your GUI just isn't loading afterwards). Try graphicsenabler=no 




 Omniroms split screen is pretty slick.  




 Try myhack 




 Why on earth would you make a comment like this in the nexus 4 subreddit? 




 That's just luck and coincidence. Osx WILL work on a lot of hardware but just because it has happened to work for your devices does not mean it will work without fail every single time. Still incorrect.  




 This isn't accurate, at all. Certain hardware parts will simply not work with OSX, no matter what modifications are made. If OPs friend has intentions of installing OSX on his PC he should make sure it is as compatible as possible before purchasing it, otherwise he's not going to have a great time.  




 Unlocking the bootloader   rooting makes it significantly easier to perform an unauthorized SIM unlock.  




 Lol, didn't OP post this theme on /g/ and everyone there said it sucked? (Not saying that I was one of them - I think it looks great) 




 At the chameleon bootloader (black background with grey text that has a countdown - this screen appears before the grey apple logo) type in "-v -x" (without the quotes) and hit enter.  




 A somewhat easier solution is to install Niresh in a VM and then create the USB installer through that way (saves you screwing around with partitions and reboots) - and IMO myHack is easier to use and has slightly more features than Unibeast. Great guide though! Also I'm pretty sure everything you put after the -v flag is redundant: -x is safe mode and implements all those flags itself anyway. 




 Given that 8.1 is a free update to 8 I can't see why your 8 key wouldn't work, but I haven't personally tried it myself so I can't say for sure, sorry. 




 Those programs are for updating an existing Windows installation (e.g. Windows 7 - 8), and cannot be used for a clean install. For a clean install, I'd suggest downloading the Windows 8.1 .iso that corresponds to the version you currently have from [here](http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/53564-murphy78-s-Windows-8-1-Server-2012r2-with-Update-MSDN-iso-files), then making a bootable USB installer from it using [rufus](http://rufus.akeo.ie/) and then doing a clean install by booting from the USB (and backing up any important data beforehand). 




 Where would I find USB kexts? I have already searched for motherboard and chipset kexts for my hardware, as well as USB. I know I need something I just don't know what the correct term is. :( 




 I'm having issues getting my Wifi USB adapter to work. I previously installed Mavericks on my PC via Niresh 10.9 and after seeing how well it worked I decided to create a clean install USB and reinstall OSX (Niresh comes with a lot of extra kexts and random apps and I wouldn't really feel comfortable doing anything that requires me to put in a password on it).

The USB adapter I have uses a 8191s Realtek chipset, and on the Niresh installation all I had to do with download the Mac drivers from Realtek's website (used the ML drivers as they were the latest one). No issues there, all up and running perfectly.

Now, with the clean install, after installing the drivers and wireless utility app that comes with them (using the exact same install package that previously worked on 10.9) and then restarting (as per the installation instructions), the Wireless Utility app refuses to start. I open the app and I can see the icon appear briefly in the dock before immediately disappearing again.

Things that I have tried:

* Installing different/older versions of the driver (tried every driver available from realtek)

* Tried modified drivers from macbreaker forums

* Manually installing the kexts that are contained in the installer.pkg

All with multiple reboots - no dice. Still the same issue.

One thing that does stick out to me, on the Niresh install, when viewing USB devices in System Report, it listed the USB as RTL8181S Wi-Fi Adaptor, whereas with the clean 10.9.4 install it is simply listed as Miscellaneous USB device - which makes me think its an issue with a missing or unmodified kext that had already come with Niresh and I have yet to install; only thing is, I have no clue how to figure out what I'm missing. Is it a motherboard issue?

Any pointers would be great! 




 Yeah it will work fine, just did this myself actually. If you install osxfuse and ntfs-3g on OSX you can read/write to the NTFS partition too. I just set up all my libraries on Windows and home folder on Mac to point to that partition, so now I share photos/videos/documents/downloads folders across OSes. Works pretty well. 




 How is this the highest upvoted comment here but it doesn't have a single source to back it up? 




 My friends mum gave her some for a birthday present and she uses them because she doesn't want to make her mother feel bad that she's not using her gift. They're not all bad :( 




 Did you wipe /data and /system before flashing again? If it booted the first time you flashed it, there is literally no reason for it not to boot again on a clean flash.  




 I'd love one! 




 Its a fresh install, and has been an issue the whole time (even before I managed to get it to boot to desktop). I don't see how reinstalling could fix it.  




 So I just recently got my hackintosh build up and running, everything works (except for some sound issues that I'm dealing with, but I am confident in my Google-fu for those) but I am having the most bizarre issue: every time I boot into OSX, my CD drive ejects itself (at the apple logo)? And when I get to the desktop I get a popup stating that I have inserted a blank disk (and asking me what to do with it). I have an Asus B75 Pro3-M as my motherboard, if that's relevant.

edit: in case anyone with the same issue comes across this in the future, updating to 10.9.4 fixed the cd tray issue. 
 




 Uh because the reason people get there early is to prep for the day - prep that will screw you over later in the shift (at rush times) if it isn't done. The time spent serving is wasted prep time. I run bars at weddings and if I stop prep to serve the few early birds then I'm running around trying to get stock (beer, fruit, clean glasses etc) during the rush, making me lose more money than if I had just ignored the few early birds.  




 Hello Melbourne-dwelling redditors! I have plans to move to Melbourne (from the Gold Coast) in January and wanted to get some advice on a few things:

1. **Housing**: Firstly, I need somewhere to stay. I intend for the move to be permanent, so I am looking for something long term, and was leaning towards a house share with a couple of other roommates (so I don't get lonely). My question is this: I would really love to have living arrangements sorted before I head down there, but a lot of people I have spoken to have advised against making a commitment to a place that I haven't seen in person, as people will often post misleading photos on the internet and places are generally a lot less favourable when you actually get there. I'm also a bit worried about getting scammed and sending a bond payment to a person for a house that doesn't even exist. How prevalent are these scammers in Melbourne? Is this something I should be looking out for? How realistic is it of me to expect to have living arrangements made before I go down there? Would I be better off staying in a hotel for a few weeks while I inspect houses? Would people be willing to agree to let me rent from them without even having met me first? I thought having a Skype call might mediate some of these issues - myself and the ad poster would get a feel for each other and then they could give me a sort of 'virtual tour' around the home. Also, how early should I start inquiring for accommodation? I have noticed a lot of the Gumtree ads are looking for people to move in ASAP, so I don't think they'd be willing to wait for me to come down in January - but I really don't want to be leaving it to the last minute.

2. **Work**: As well as living arrangements, I would also like to have a job strapped down for when I get there. Many of the same questions apply here; how likely would it be for an employer to hire me based on a phone/Skype interview? I would like to start working immediately when I get down there. I have approx. 1.5 years worth of hospitality experience, the last 4-5 months of that being in a senior supervisor role - how marketable is this experience? Are there a lot of hospitality jobs going down in Melbourne?

3. **Transport**: This I'm not too worried about, but thought I'd mention it just in case I'm being a little naive. I've been to Melbourne about 5 times in the last 2 years, so I have a fairly decent feel of the inner city suburbs and how the public transport works. However, I will be without a license until mid February, and without a car until I can afford one. How survivable is Melbourne without a car? Will I be able to rely entirely on public transport (I would like to avoid taxis at all costs, those things are killer expensive)? I have no family or friends down there, so I have nothing to fall back on (other than taxis...) if I get stuck somewhere there isn't public transport. I intend on buying a bicycle as soon as I get down there as well, and I am used to riding around to get myself from A to B. 




 When someone is having an anxiety attack its important to 'ground' them. Usually resting a hand on an arm or a shoulder and speaking to them calmly will be the most you can do. Generally the person suffering the anxiety attack just has to let it pass. Just let them know you're there. If you realize they're having a panic attack, tell them. "You're having a panic attack. You are not dying. It will pass soon. Try to steady your breathing." in the calmest voice possible. 




 HSCs are a standardized test that certain parts of Australia undertake at the end of highschool. It's what gets you into university. If you fail the HSC, no university will touch you and yes, there are other ways in but they can add another 1-2 years onto your study. It's a pretty big deal.  




 I stayed in Cambodia recently for just under a week and honestly, in comparison to home (Australia) there were virtually none. No flies either. I did stay in Siem reap though, so it might be different in the more rural areas.  




 Just for clarification: "driving" as specified by the law here (QLD: $330 fine for touching your phone) means your car is running, regardless of where you are. Just started your car in the parking lot and quickly checking a route on Google Maps? $330 fine. Hit 'next' on your music player at a stop light? $330 fine, and now you've lost your license. I understand the reason for the rules, I really do, but seriously, stupidest fucking thing ever. (I may or may not have first hand experience with this...) 




 Movie 43 









 [Higher quality](http://gfycat.com/IckyUnlinedAiredaleterrier) 




 Its from Movie 43. Essentially just a bunch of random skits. In this one, Emma stone plays a checkout chick at a grocery store and falls head over heels for a really gross looking customer. He's sweet talking her in this scene.  




 If it is actually him, it could be a trick of he lighting. The photo on the left has a flash directly pointed at him, causing shadows under his chin and jaw, making it more pronounced, while the second photo is lit from the right hand side, making his chin seem weaker.

 I'm pretty sure hangouts is closed-source and Google doesn't provide any APIs for 3rd parties to hook in, so you're not likely to see a 3rd party with hangouts capability any time soon, if ever. 




 Son I'm too high for this 




 Fair enough. I just can't imagine being any level of upset/annoyed if this happened to me. I used to make graphic-intensive profile designs and coding (all original) for some anime forum site, and I had people messaging me about other members lifting my graphics and even code (with my comments still in it) and selling it for the in game currency - it never bothered me in the slightest, in fact I even remember feeling excited the first time it happened lol. 




 Not trying to be a dick here but... does it really matter? I'm not entirely sure why people on reddit get so upset about reposts. The entire idea of reddit is built upon linking to other websites, which can be considered "reposting". I get that it can take a significant amount of time to create a gif, especially high quality ones (I've just started doing it myself so I can appreciate the effort that goes into them), but unless the reposter is making real world $$$ from it, I don't see the issue.

 About monetizing xposed tweaks - a lot of xposed devs put their modules on the play store as well, but charge for them (while they are freely available on the repo). I think that's a fairly honorable way to get donations and a little easier than trying to get people to send you money through PayPal (people trust google more).
