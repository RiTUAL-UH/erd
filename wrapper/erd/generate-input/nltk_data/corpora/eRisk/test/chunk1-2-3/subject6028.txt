 No, I'm not a psychopath

 Just a joke, back in some of the early YogPods Simon would use the same voice, the "pubby" voice, and people would complain that it was racist or some shit 




 First few minutes of this video... so fucking racist :P 




 I beat the Asylum demon without dying and thought I was a God... but now I'm being decimated by poison in fucking Blighttown.  




 Don't tell OP what to do

Edit: dank scones for the downvotes for asking a question ho ho ho 




 if it helps I thought it was funny... just the mental image of this perma-cringed face, hilarious 




 guys, guys, guys, guys... hold up. you dont fucking downvote OP in his own thread. show a bit of respect. 




 Should make a self post about it 




 Jack is really entertaining in this episode 




 funny. it's counter culture 




 well there's no need to be rude about it  




 so OP posting his opinion   some criticism makes him an asshole? wtf? 




 fanboy alert 




 whatever 




 well ofc its subjective 

also maybe you just dont like satire? its not for everyone 




 thanks for explainin my joke, noone got it :P 




 um think i'd know what im doing best, thanks.

 I don't even know what "yer okie" means.

   If they're not a punk band then how would you classify them?

Alternative rock, but wikipedia says punk so fine I concede

 You do know that songs like Savior does not represent band's discography, right?

sure

 Did you not even listen to the link I posted?

skimmed it 




 generally what a sentence consists of, yes... 




 sure you can, but partying is detrimental and your intelligence will taper off at a point 




 whatever, you have misunderstood 




 they just fall into that category dude, dont expand your mind or anything, you aint learning if you're coked up listening to some dubstep malarkey 




 not for everyone else just trying to enjoy the music

also, rise against isn't punk 




 i dont think what redthatalready meant was in sexism but in opposition to the prevalent anti intellectualism (drugs electronic music parties extrovision) that is on the rise in the western world 




 Wish not death on your satan, but enlightenment to deliver them from ignorance. 




 Ah yes, the Top Gear lads, partying it up in their free time, destroying the environment in their working hours. 




 Work at Target for six years 




 Why? 




   I don't consider you human.

Ever stop to think that maybe you are no better than those you go against?

oh and don't downvote me either ever again 




 they won't but don't tell people what to do or they'll do the opposite 




 hey thanks for completely missing the point and winning karma by chastising me

i thought you guys liked satire? 




 well yeah because my satire deters them 




 'cause when this post gets more attention there will be an influx of people crying about sponsor only content, might as well fire off a preemptive ridicule in their general direction

 I cut off all contact with her, her family and our mutual friends. I did the best I could to remove my internet presence and pretty much became dead to that friend circle.

My breakup wasn't too bad, just generic compatibility issues. No hard feelings. 




 no it's funny cause he's stuck in the Ecuador embassy in London, so, like, who else is he going to have a press conference with? Drederick Tatum?  




 No Gavin?! ARGHHHHHH ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

Edit: 

satire
sat/
noun
the use of humour, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.

 Strippin is a damn traitor. Ditching his friends and moving to the US. Can't we just ignore this guy?

 That's not a bad thing! 




 Pretty sure I'm shadowbanned from /r/gaming, which is weird because I've never posted there prior to my ban. 




 Oh, sorry, I forgot that oh-so important politically correct term "in my opinion", oopsies.  




 How am I?  




 hey by posting that comment /u/Fiji_Artesian is just pointing out his favourite bit :) 




 He's not a teenager anymore, so he's FAIR GAME

Michael to everyone else: he is a fucking arrogant, lying, piece of shit. "oo I never said Jaws once", stfu, LOSER!

Michael is a psychopath, to think he's married. What a joke. Least he provides more entertainment than SOME members, though (eyes looking at you Narvarez Jr).

Insult to injury, Michael: "Gavin said Jars." REALLY?! 




 Missed the reference, eh? 




 A fedora would suit you. 




 Gavin: Remember his fleshlight?

Love how nobody responded to that out of fear of the backlash. 




  Esbrainrot, my brain rot, one-sixty, swiftly

Edit: forgot the fanbase is a bit to young to get that reference  




 yeah um I never want to see miles again 




 Hahaha, yeah bro, man, dude /s 




 Ah, alright. Thanks. 




 Black Widow is a cool character, really, I mean, she's attractive sure... but she's not just eye candies

 I don't care if this is fake, it's fucking funny. 




 And the tumblr user is ripping off Nintendo.  




 This is offensive.

 Did ya ever think it'd be so easy? 




 Hey, why shadowban me?  




 Hi, why am I shadowbanned?

Edit: kk looks like I AINT, ty

 Oh, shut the fuck up. 




 Hopefully you'll be judged by your merits and not your appearance
 




 Not sure if you're joking but you could just wear gloves to your job interviews and nobody will know 




 liar, it's summer.

 Leave out the bit about not reading the book, it undermines your entire opinion hehe 




 ... what the fuck? 




 whatever dude, I don't pander to the masses and censor myself 




 Nope! 




 That haircut is rad, what are you talking about? 




 Haha, wow. What an aggressive reply[!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzpndHtdl9A) 




  Be respectful of each other. This is not a place for hate. 




 careful mentioning other let's players in this sub

Edit: not that I have a problem with it personally, but I've seen people saying they enjoy the yogscast or whatever, and BAM, downvotes and rage

Edit 2: And my experimental first edit has proven this, mentioning the yogscast has tripled my downvotes. Nice! 




 no gavin? 




  Just because he doesn't make the same joke 815 times doesn't mean he's half assing.

lol 




 some sort of fetish of yours?

;'( ;'( ;'( ;'( ;'( ;'(

hope this helps 




 ;'(
 




 oops, I meant JJ, my bad 




 so many enraging things in this video.

Chris, that Jerry hick, an advert, Blaine, Gilby, a game of thrones spoiler, ~~Brandon~~ JJ, shameless shirt plugging, and a cliffhanger 




 man, he sounds so hurt at the end 




 hey dudeman it stands for Drunk Gamers - the website they had before doing RvB 




 oh man far out 




 Podcast crew... but um...? I don't... haha...



NO GAVIN?!? 




 tits are tits 




 Doesn't 




 Watch the video... proof is right there 




 Hopefully not, drunk people are annoying. Remember when Gavin was drunk in that Goat Simulator video? Got annoying fast, imo 




 No, you were pretty spot on 




 Haha, this is so sly. "Oh, look, Geoff is in this, wahoo." Then BAM! Lindsay.

I can smell the rage. 




  people here downvote for the dumbest shit 




 as long as one person finds it funny (me), then it's still subjectively funny 




 Ummm, subjectivity, bitch, look it up 




 Oh btw, Gavin bought a house

Edit: Obligatory woooooooooosh! The joke is that Gavin buying a house has been mentioned in like 20 things now 




 So glad that didn't end with the Loch Ness monster. Thanks for the reply! I always forget that for Americans to travel to Europe etc they're looking at an 8 hour flight. 




 Ehhh, not really, imgur links are more convenient and not many people will click a random tumblr link 




 Which country did he go to? 




 Gilby, I think 




 oh, a lot of us are boycotting russia for obvious reasons 




 Shame this game is set in Russia 




 Gavin is so tryhardy when it comes to alcohol 




 Yogventures, a game that was in development, was cancelled because it was pretty unrealistic or something, so now people who paid for it on kickstarter are angry.

Then there's some other thing called YogDiscovery which I've only found out about, apparently yogscast want indie devs to come to them, they'll make videos of the game and depending on how many views the video gets, and how many sales the game gets, yogscast will take a percentage of the profits from the devs.  




 that's a literary technique though 





























 Maybe if those jackasses would stop shooting his tires out... 




 he did 




 Do you like Huey Lewis and The News? 




 no gavin 




 Wonder what that acronym means?

 I mean he looks more likeable TO ME. Like MY high school fat best friend, early Jonah Hill style. Now he's more of a Seth Rogen and that is lame, IN MY OPINION.

Subjectivity, how does it work? 




 I mean he looks more LIKEABLE. Like your high school fat best friend, early Jonah Hill style. Now he's more of a Seth Rogen and that is LAME

Edit: heres  [$100$] now answer me, guy 




 caught ya whackin', eh? 




 It's hardly a binge if you're doing them 1 a day ;) 




 Yes, that's true. People respond to incentives. But, a worker is going to resent a boss who is mean and therefore put in less effort, meaning said employer will not benefit. A, maybe overly, kind employer will be well liked and workers will be more willing to put in effort, both parties benefit.

See Dale Carnegie's book, How to Win Friends and Influence People 




 If he is a good employer, he'll give you a raise or a bonus or something. Employers that treat their employees like shit get shit employees as a result. 




 arm chair gynecologist, back to /r/theredpill with you... 




 This has nothing to do with gender, I never disclosed mine 




 am not who you directed it towards, you'll need to write up a unique diagnosis for me, Bartlett 




 you're obviously not socially awkward then, that's the point i'm making. who told you you were socially awkward?
also don't call me names, this is a civil debate 




 arm chair psychiatrist  




 same thing 




  some girls are attracted to socially awkward guys, just like some guys are attracted to socially awkward girls.

You're thinking of "quirky" people, not socially awkward people. The two often get confused. Social awkwardness is a mental illness that makes any social interaction unbearable - no one with it could possibly form any romantic bonds.

 




 and you have a husband. you're about as socially awkward as frank sinatra was.

 did Van Gogh cut off his ear because his gf dumped him? 




 I kinda see what you mean, but I don't see what you mean 




 Any examples? I never really paid much attention to his tweets. 




 Kinda sick of him having blocked me on twitter, aswell. 




 Yeah but you don't downvote OP in his own thread, that's just rude 




 NO WAY DUDE 




 sat here wondering if that is why VG cut off his E? 




 You either wake up soon enough to be a hero, or keep dreaming long enough to be a villain.  




 DAS DA DOKE DOT DAY DEG 




 Ah, my bad. Haven't slept :) 




 You'd go way too fast unfortunately  




 NO WAY DUDE 




 is that why Van Gogh cut off his ear? 




 What's wrong with WND? 




 so that's why Van Gogh cut off his ear? Huh. 




 I know, its just one of those things 




 I get him and Brandon mixed up so its for the best 




 RUDE 




 obviously not what he meant 




 trust me, guy. it bothers them 




 he'd make a good Patrick Bateman 




 Yeah. The cake would cushion the blow anyway, no way what we saw in the video would knock her out 




 wishful thinking, guy 




 it is, getting slamdunked into cake wouldn't knock you out 




 more like strippin is traitor 




 dont tell me who i've never heard of 




 not sure about him, but i do, english not my mother tongue

 I always thought the "you shall have no other gods before me" was borderline crazy girlfriend territory where she doesn't want you having any other female friends.

 Gasoline evaporates extremely quickly, which quickly creates a volatile mix. It doesn't help that it's heavier than most atmosphere, so it tends to collect in pools instead of dissipating quickly.

Same!

 I know plenty, and know how to practically apply it, and I apply that knowledge in my every day life.

Are you a firefighter?

 You're the type of person that gets people killed, by not being prepared to handle situations as they come. Many situations won't be about your choice or what you did.

Yeah, so not my problem. 

 Say a car is on fire, and you need to decide how you're going to save a person out of it, will you be prepared to act?

Again, not my problem.

 I have no faith in you except sheer blind luck.

 Famous last words 




 white people 




 Well, my philosophy is growing innit. That's what debate is for.

And I'd consider news organisations integral to society, so BAM you get a car. 




 Cameraman for what sort of organisation? And yes, I'd say the majority of people need cars currently... but a lot are just lazy, you don't need to drive EVERYWHERE. 




 I am not a troll. I just don't censor my opinions. Think of it more as an experiment. How many redditors do you think trim down their comments to ensure they get positive karma? I'd say the majority. 




 I'd allow public transport in my world vision, but not that scabby gross public transport we have today. And I'd have security stationed on each bus or train or likes to deal with rabble rousers.

I'd allow access to cars for emergency service members, and government officials. And people with disabilities, such as wheelchair users (or I'd invent some wheelchair highway they can speed down). Everyone else must walk or cycle, or use the premium public transport. 




 yes it does dude

 Waiting for a friend when they are LATE, when I don't have any sense of TIME, and when I having nothing to DO. That's what I'm saying. Psychologically it is torturous. 




 Situation A (waiting on friend), you'd agree that is kind of torturous?

Situation B (trapped in car), that's like Situation B EXEMPLIFIED. I'd argue they are comparable in the sense that psychologically they are both strenuous.  




 You ever been waiting on a friend and they don't show for AGES, and you have no watch to check, no phone to pass the time? And it feels like time is going really slowly? That's probably what this guy was feeling, so I think saying he survived 2 months is completely fine. 




 It's closer to 1 month, yeah, but it may as well be 2 months. The poor guy was trapped in a car, fuck sakes, give him the benefit of the doubt. 




 43 days is roughly 2 months, stop being a pedant.  




 Not trolling, I just believe in a world where we all should respect each other. Thanks, though. 




 He put the time and effort into delivering this content upon us. You don't downvote OP in his own goddamn thread. 




 To be fair, /u/NuclearWookie came in to this post and insulted our OP. Show a bit of respect to the creator of this thread. 




 That's low 




 but not for me???? 




 haha 




 I would but it is fucking impossible to get Exalted without dying of boredom. 




 This isn't cringe. 




 eh I'll allow it 




 Upvoting you for having the gallbladder to reply to yourself. 




 Not my cup of tea 




 Blaine :( 




 you leave Drew Carrey's son alone 




 yeah, only in Belfast though 









 You'd die, dude 




 Hmm, nah, stick to the AH Six. Joel and Adam aren't for everyone 
























 It's a figure of speech... 




 If by the audience you mean one dude, then sure 




 *bursts into tears* 




 But you are. Can I have your autograph?

Also, way to attack the one person defending you. Never meet your heroes, eh? 




 You know that's /u/billyK_, right? The dude is pretty fucking famous in this subreddit, so show a bit of respect. 




 yeah well we can't all have read Shaq's autobiography 36 times, dude 




 You're pure evil. 









 Nose doctor for those who don't know 




 ITT sweating RT superfans worrying about how the whole fanbase is perceived so they flame stuff like this even though they actually find it sorta kinda funny. Die Schutzstaffel. 




 she is bae 




 Maybe not James, but I think we could arrange a Lawrence and Joel collaboration 




 Yeah mate it just means Accident and Emergency. 




 Yeah, it just means Accident and Emergency. 




 Final Fantasy 7 spoiler at around 0:48 




 Shame they seem to bully Lawrence

 i'm a lone everything dude 




  Same applies to Simon, who is currently battling with a condition which sent him to hospital and he's still recovering from.

Which condition? 




 I am included in everything, so yeah 




 Everything is a joke. 




 Go back to /r/roosterteeth, dude. 




 y-yeah...? that's the joke 




  former

that's the joke 




  1. Submissions must be directly related to Rooster Teeth. 




 what like? 




 method acting 




 I mean, it depends on context 




 I'm taking the piss, I know that Double Dragon predates Sips/Lewis's channel 




 WWE Heavyweight champions, dubbed Double Dragon. 




 it's a prank, it's a prank, it's a prank 




 Ripping off Sips and Lewis?????????? 




 Yeah, it was. It's funny because OP is Jonnie Risinger 




  1. Submissions must be directly related to Rooster Teeth.

it was a joke ffs 




 so whats the story behind the Howard Stern joke? 




 Um, like 'test tube babies'? Or is it like surrogate mothers? 




 Excluding adoption, no, because that's not "having children", in the sense we are talking about 




 Nice, mate. How many runs did it take you? 




 How? 




 wait, how can your mom be a lesbian? 




 funny though 




 no way dude 




 Not sure why you've been downvoted, you are right. 




 No 




 FUCK OFF KDIN! 




 SHILL! SHILL! SHILL! SHILL! SHILL! SHILL! 




 two times in a row, is that a joke? 




 The unpublished sequel to 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' 




 y-yes? 




 What'd he say?

Edit: guess we'll never know 




 Oh, come on. This guys delivery is so fucking perfect even if you disagree with him how could you downvote this? 




 I guess so 




 I mean, if a post is titled "just finished Flowers for Algernon" you can assume there will be spoilers in side. 




 No, unless you've specifically allowed them to play. Try checking your settings

 Do I? 




 its a prank its a prank its a prank 




   light reflecting off of it

what light? its 5am. 




 LE CLICKBAIT 




 I really enjoyed it. Thought that the premise was really cool, too. I would love to have the powers that Ig has. Also, [Lee Tourneau is an evil piece of shit, the chapters from his POV where he abuses his dying mum made me feel kinda sick](#s) 




 Objection 




 and ditching his m9s in the process, aye 




 Dude is a traitor anyway 




 TIL it isn't crying 




 I have the habit of buying books when I have a huge backlog to get through. 




 Awesome, thank you. 




 So, I've lost my "Asia Minor" allies. Sad times. Hopefully I can get Greece back...

Domestically, Newfoundland was annoying to invade for some reason, I rushed it I guess. And, of course, still stuck in the eternal stalemate with myself and my ally vs GAA. 




 I've not read To Kill a Mockingbird yet :( I should get on that. 




 Breakfast of Champions is on my to read list. Have you read many Vonnegut books? 




 Nice! I really want to get into Pratchett, was considering picking up Mort a few weeks ago but decided against it in the end. 









 Redditors, its like a combination of both 




 It's a dumb prank, sure. But punching someone over it seems like a bit of an overreaction 




 Hey you don't insult OP in his own fucking thread 
























 ah, hello, David 




 stop victim blaming dude 









 Jack was pretty funny this episode 




 I got d/c'd now I can't get past the loading screen

Edit: may have just been my ebola internet 




 You don't downvote OP in his own goddamn thread. 




 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA 




 For some reason this reminds me of that video of the dudes Grandma who is allergic to semen comes over and starts touching all his shit and dies.

 




 that's quite poignant :( 




  I tend to not care for first-person games largely because you have no idea what's going around you if you're not turning around every twenty seconds.

Just like real life dude 




 alright back off dude 




 Haha, that Italy conflict is awesome. Looking forward to the next update. 




 Oh... I see it now. My bad. 




 Is this for all Goblins or just the Bilgewater ones? Or do all Goblins originate from Kezan or something?

Probably a stupid question 




 Huh? What are you talking about?

 The genocide was carried out during and after World War I and implemented in two phases: the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour, followed by the deportation of women, children, the elderly and infirm on death marches leading to the Syrian desert. Driven forward by military escorts, the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery, rape, and massacre. 




 :( 




 If I recall correctly, Juniper 




 Ray Nazareth Jnr 




 plus he has his army gig 




 Hungarian friend of Geoff and Gavin* FTFY 




 crazy how Smith from Hat Films edits these 




 NO BARBARA?! 




  (note: I'm not Swedish).

So you should know that's a stupid thing to say ;) 




 Would a youtube video be able to show these improvements? I heard something about compressing etc 




 *bursts into tears* 




 He recently got a Sylvanas tattoo too. 




 Wow it looks...


exactly the same... 




 RIP 




 Fuck... 




 I mean, I guess I could have guessed? I've never seen a Fast and Furious film though so idk 




 lol'd but I'm still so confused 




 yeah, that. and she's a cunt. 




 what movie 




 Who? 




 Sinn Fein. 




 I agree with you. Streams in general aren't typically funny to me, but that's okay, I see them as a different form of entertainment. Something you'd tune in to eat a meal to or something, I dunno. 




 Hmmm, good argue 




 People like this guy ruin the raiding experience for everyone else. Fuck you, Stevie Nics. 




 Same. 




 Debatable. 




 It is. 

(See, I can be an asshole too.) 




 TIL what numlock actually does 




 what did Ray say to Gavin in Let's Play Rainbow Six Vegas Co-Op Part 1? 




 what did he say 




 what did ray say that got censored 









 What did Ray Narvaerezeze Jr. say? 




 I wonder what Ray said to Gavin 




 Do you know what Ray said...? 




 What did Ray say. 




 What did Ray say? 




 What'd Ray say? 




 Who? 




 Joined it as Rumania :) 




 nah 




 It's not 




 He's in a public place, he's not immune to having his picture taken. 




 *bursts into tears* 




 Welcome aboard!

 Maybe they have more "competitive" players

 **Look Who's Back, by Timur Vermes**

I picked this up because the other book I bought had a "buy one, get cheapest half price" sticker on it and the man at the till recommended it. It's an easy read and I've almost finished it. I'm interested in how the author plans to end it.

 




 Back off dude 




 those who can do, do, those who can't, cunt 




 Like to see you make a movie 




 like to see you run 3 miles ryan redford boy 




 Oh thank god 




 Why do *you* care? 




 Good argue. 




 Dropping all his mates to go live in america for a girl he had never even met before 




 Top Gear is a show about cars so its not very surprising that the most die hard fans of Clarkson are idiots 




 So, they're not idiots at all? 




 Well, they lasted long. 




 Being a traitor must take its psychological toll 
























 Are they bae? 




 Are you talking about me, dude? 




 Boogies down?
 




 Mad Twatter 




 It's a fairly normal thing to do. 




 Same, really. I've done one year of Uni and it was alright at first, but after Christmas it just become a drag. Now that I'm back home with nothing to do I simply play drink beer, play videos, read, or watch something on youtube/Netflix.

Regarding netflix recommendations, I dunno much about movies, but I watched Sin City 2 recently and it was pretty good. If you're interested in TV shows then Sense8 was a hoot, and I'm currently enjoying Attack on Titan, an anime. 




 Where are you from? I'm assume the USA from "summer break", if so, which state? 




 Happy bday dude 




 Hello everybody,

last night I had a dream and in this dream the power got shut down worldwide for a week

I wake up and see this article

In conclusion, buy a generator 




 Last night I was reading for a whopping five hours but only managed to bat out 200 pages, which is what? 40 pages an hour? 

I have this mate who says he can read faster than that and flamed me.

"that's

not

SUPER fast m8 :P

no offense"

So, yeah. What tips do y'all have? 




 cause bae was in it 




 [ohhhh shiiiit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdza03XOmTw) 




 -70 for a harmless joke, oh boy 




 aka fap material 




 Shame he's a hunter 




 lovably so, though, jerkwad 




  NO GAVIN?!?

FTFY. 




 mad 




 He's a hunter 




  tipped their hats to each other and rode off on their separate ways.

its a meme, you dip 




 It's $60k 




 Mine, PERSONALLY. How about yours? 




 Show some respect, guyberry thirdstein. 




  You're not the main character of the story, buddy.

Depends on the story, guy. 




 Well, it won a 25,000 Scottish literary prize with a 'mesmerising' work.

So, yeah probably 




 Oh man, why? 




 Yes, still. Can't fault a guy for dedication?

Also, was that just via memory you linked that? 




 What happened? 




 Downvoting the creator, thats fine 




 I want to lick Barbara and Mica's shoes. 




 She? 




 scared baby 




 Disregarding what you said about video games because it is irrelevant and nobody is talking about that (like really m8, what? where'd you even get that from?).

And yes, people being shot by police is obviously bad, but you're attaching a QQ sentimentality to it. We need to look at facts not "woah, what the hell, I can't believe that cop did that".

Thats how all cops get fingered (;)) as baddies.

 




 Yeah, well... 




 to counterweight the sentimentalisation;

piss off. 




 Maybe if they gay? I'd take it right home and turn it into a cumbox sorta thingy wingy 




 thats what a butt pad is, guy 




 looks like he deleted what he said. For context it was him asking about rumors whether Jack and Ray maybe didn't get along all that much. 




 Maybe I'm just being more attentive, but Jack has been really, really funny as of late. 




 "Lol"

Screw you, dude 




 I want to lick Barbara's shoes.

why the downvotes? 




 Ah right, cheers. Personally I think people are too sensitive over stuff like this, but eh, I'm not the one getting affected by it so I guess I can't really complain much! 




 As someone from a fairly undeveloped country, what IS the correct term? 




 How long did you live with him? 




 Trigger warning

[im fat](/spoiler) 




 What'd you say before the edit, I wonder? 




 Tanktops and tooth gaps. Vogue Summer 2015. 




 Attention seeker
 




 Maybe you should reply the first time then 




 Where do you order from? 




 If one of my friends is doing a transmog run and I wish to tag along, I will always pass if a mount drops. Since I'm being boosted.

And its the same thing whenever they want to join on my runs. 




 What even happened with that? Why'd the co-pilot do it?
 




 To be fair, quotes in title, it has been 12 months and its from a different subreddit. 




 Lol'd but felt bad 




 . 




 I dunno, that sounds sorta fun 




 . 




 Not really, dude. There is diminishing returns with this sort of thing. It'll taper off and you'll just remain at the same level, probably after a week or less. 




 Solar flares maybe 




 Different game I think, mate. I'm Romania in this one 




 I'm sure it has. Modern though? Useless. 




 Is it wrong though, sunshine? 









 It's worth at at least a DOLLAR! 




 choo choo 




 Fuck. Sake. 




 Same shit 




 Regaining my mind isn't on my to-do list. Regaining my LAND, however... 




 Poor Matt (and Jeremy) 




 Matt is Chewbacca 




 Relax dude 




 Then he released his own "Ashensbox" for 25, which is overpriced considering what you get in it.

Not really sure if its a joke or not, but people buy them so, eh 




 "MY OTHER LEG!" 




 Timestamp? 




 NO RYAN?!?! 




 yeah from the bible, the apostate narc  
























 So then I started dreaming that I was lucid dreaming because I was before I "woke" up even though since I woke up it broke it and I'm not actually lucid but just dreamt that I was.

Anyone ever had this happen before? 




 Maybe, maybe. I go back to Uni in a month and a bit. They aren't like bedbugs in that they infest and follow you fucking everywhere, or?
 




 Yeah? My room has had problems with mold. I don't really have anywhere else to put my books though. Nowhere that they wouldn't be "in the way". 




 I'm not really looking on ways to get rid of them because I'm lazy and am satisfied with just blowing/wiping them away at the start of each reading session. 

However, what is with them? They just appear. I read that they are common on old books, so why are they on my copy of The Casual Vacancy, that I bought back in February or some equally dismal month.

They do give me a bit of anxiety though, nothing major, but just the expectation of seeing them as I'm scanning each paragraph. I know they're not harmful to humans but I have a thing with bugs. My main issue is spiders. Just last week I was minding my own and  reading "The Five People You Meet In Heaven" by Mitch Albom in my bed and this spider struts up to me on my pillow, and I recoil. Good book though, sorta depressing but I enjoyed it.

So, yeah. What are your experiences with booklice or other insects? 









 why is lego so expensive :( 




 You're a whore. 




 shouldn't have to ask.

why is such an old lady in an airport anyway, what is she even up to, go back to bed and watch your fucking soaps

ARGHHH 




 No, no. /u/dillwillhill is correct. Minecraft is a bitch to get the mods working. 




 They're murderers. Fuck 'em. 




 He's not ACTUALLY going to murder anyone. Calm your many tits, fatboy. 




 To be fair, it's not like the shit on askreddit has copyright attached to it, and if someone wants to grab the ideas and make an entertaining video... whats the deal?

It's like flaming /u/Shitty_Watercolour for illustrating someone's comment. 




 Except, Mecca is a city with, as the OP said, a lot of historical value attached to it. People are going to be interested in it and these people aren't all going to be muslim.

Comparing it to the Queen of England's private residence is a bit of a leap. 




 mad 




 scarves are weird
 




 same 




 same 




 Hahaha! Where you from? It's a common variant where I live. 




 whatever, rube. 




 DAMIAN RISES! 














 No Barbara? *sigh*

Hope that idiot Blaine paid for that book he destroyed, also hope he doesn't ever drive again, because shit me, did he hit someone? 




 What a sly dog 




 Yeah, that's what I'm saying. The dick pics are harassment and absolutely uncalled for.

The rest I found funny.  




 This guy is awesome,  but I think he went a bit too far with sending unsolicited dick pics.

But the satire and making fun of SJWs had me cracking up;

"Did i trigger you"

"You're an obese tumblrina..." etc, that whole section was great.

and then the ending

"The patriarchy is watching ;)"

You played right into his hands and gave him what he wanted: a beautiful reaction. 




 NO MEG?! 




 NO MEG?! 




 Cool.

*waits for the next shitstorm* 




 You're not missing much, it's sticky and moist and gross and... and... *bursts into tears* 




 Nobody NEEEEEEEDS a haircut, you fascist.  




 Yeah, then you get viruses and have your account nicked :( 




 WHICH COMMENT DID I DOWNVOTE? DIDN'T DOWNVOTE /U/RANDOM-REFERENCE COMMENT AT LEAST, AND WHEN HIS COMMENT CAME THERE WERE NO OTHER COMMENTS TO DOWNVOTE SO BE MY GUEST AND TELL ME. I GUESS YOU BELONG IN THE BOX WHERE THE OTHER SHITSTORM STARTERS CAME FROM. SHOO. GO BACK IN YOUR BOX AND NEVER COME OUT. JUST IN CASE IT REQUIRES SAYING YOUR NAME BACKWARDS: AROODLAB

Yours sincerely,

 EUGH! 




 hehe ;)

 Are you bae? 




 Haha, okay. I won't spoil it. I've not been a fan of Claire since the very start though. 




 They are cute unless used in excess. 




 You are... just... awful... 




 Bet you are a Claire Underwood fan. 




 Sorry you're not attractive.
 




 Nasty! 




 Why? Free speech, white knight bitch. 




 *vomits* 




 Disgusting. 




 I thought that was Denmark 




 It's still not a male name :P 




 Shannon is NOT a man's name... 




 Are you being followed by a downvote brigade or something?  




  The pet may still be there, but it's dead to me

brutal 




 It's a hard thing to gauge, isn't it? I read a book on it. The Psychopath Test by Jon Ronson, and there's some little test but even that isn't a good indicator IIRC. 




 ASMR? 




 *slowly raises hands like Walter White*

Ya' got me.

*grins*

But, nah. Do you think I am a psychopath?  




 Oh man, tamer than what I imagined. So, uh, what scenario lead you to finding out you were into this? 




 Hamid is a name, aye. Zwalisan, no idea, just pulled it out of my ass. And, woah, woah, woah! I'm not the psychopath here, I'm not the OP.  




 What does this ear fetish involve? 




 It's an affectionate term, Zwalisan. Calm down. 




 "Bae," Urban Dictionary says, is an acronym that stands for "before anyone else," " 




 Alright, Hamid. Can't be too careful now can I? 




 The women that you date. Are they bae?
