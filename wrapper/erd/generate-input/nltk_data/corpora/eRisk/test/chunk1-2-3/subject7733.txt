 valid point, wp rpeet 




 my post was obviously meant to be taken with a grain of salt, I knew pr0lly would never read this 




 I got dumpstered by a Fizz, then bought him as my first champ and dumpstered on other people because of his high burst. Then I began to systematically branch out and tried to pick 1-2 champs for each role. I would experiment on specials champs or I'd play ARAM so i'd be forced to mess around with different champs even though it was still an ARAM. I also began to main Pantheon in the jungle when he was stronger and got quite good with him. So basically I think it comes down to enjoyment. I'm sure you've read about people maining an unpopular champ and getting into diamond or other divisions. So if you pick a champ that you enjoy playing then you should main that in my opinion. 




 There are plenty of good youtube videos directed at new players that will give you a bunch of general knowledge to help you as you learn the game

edit: damn why the downvote :'( 









 Can someone TL;DR pls? lol 




 Nasus is really reliant on farm, more so than any other top laner. The current meta denies cs to the top laner. If it takes about 20-25 minutes for a Solo queue nasus to become relevant with easy farming. It would be too late for nasus in LCS gameplay

 IT'S A DATE

EDIT: DAMN IT 




 I saw this on reddit a couple days ago and I agree. It was a post about how it was embarrassing that the LoL client was so out of date, that 3rd party organizations have created clients that are far superior. 




 You made a lot of good points, and I appreciate you're really thoughtful insight. About your point on buyouts. I wasn't necessarily suggesting a company buyout. We both acknowledge that Riot more or less has a monopoly on the MOBA market, aside from Dota2 being the only competitor which really can be seen as negligible in my opinion. 

You're also right to point out that I was basically asking for LoL with Riot that makes little to no mistakes. I was just trying to think about games I know that have risen to popularity in the gaming scene. My first real experience with the gaming scene was with Halo 2 back around 2007-ish at the beginning of Halo 3.  Halo dipped because of their own shortcomings, but rose to prominence? Call of Duty in the First Person Shooter genre. Which was always in my opinion, a simplified Halo. So I was thinking that simpler is always better for gamers. Whether that be because of people's attention span or something else.  I don't think we'll see a change in the foreseeable future. 




 Good looking girl with some self-respect, but not enough *personality.*
See you on the second page. 




 This is purely a skeptical post to talk about the current state of affairs and *professionalism* of Riot.

I'm not creating this solely because of the recent Korean uproar, but it definitely served as an impetus for me to finally put this out to the community. 

In my personal opinion, I think Riot is setting the stage to be over taken as the world's largest MOBA and competitive gaming scene. Not within the next year or even the next few years, but eventually I think their mishaps will culminate to their downfall. I believe this is because of how they conduct their interactions with the community and how whimsically they conduct the professional scene.

**FIRST**

I will first talk about the community interactions and secondly about the professional scene.

Riot has historically been a company that interacts largely with it's players and with positive results. I don't wish to talk about Riot-to-player interaction because I don't have any problems with the way those situations are handled. But the thing that they fail to do is live up to their promises. These promises include client updates, champion releases, VUs, reworks, etc. Things are promised and aren't really delivered as expected, hence the popular soon^TM when upcoming releases are discussed. To me, this is unprofessional, however, Riot never gives a date or timeframe for their releases which allows them all the flexibility in the world so that they don't back themselves into a corner. This is the general gist of the unprofessionalism without going to much further.

**SECOND**

The second topic was about Riot's conduction of the professional and perhaps the most astounding one to me.  I think Riot aren't doing themselves any favors with the way they reprehensibly plan their events. Most notably:
* Korean *miscommunication* about the location of Worlds
* Treatment of Gambit with the London LCS event
* Replay of LCS game because of Aatrox bug

This is just a short laundry list to exemplify in major ways that Riot is failing it's fanbase and perhaps it's most famous players.

**My thoughts to the problems**

For the first topic, I'm a little bit more forgiving because complications in testing and designing are a necessity when aiming for perfection. However, where is the line drawn with how much leniency Riot gets after they make promises.

The second topic, however, just can't happen in a professional setting. As a major gaming company, you can absolutely not allow these mistakes to happen. Poor planning and unfair treatment of your own teams resonates deeply in me and cannot happen.

**RIOT ISN'T EVIL**

Now this may be completely unfair of me so lets talk about the great things about what Riot has done professionally.

NA   EU LCS are streamed for free in a professional setting, Free game, many compassionate employees that care about making the game better, and **FREE GAME**

**REPLACEMENT?**

Now what would it take to usurp Riot at the top of the totem pole? It simply comes down to money in my opinion. Riot has generated so much money and invested so much money into this scene, that it would take a great sum of money to topple Riot. Dota 2 turns off fans because it is seen as a more complex MOBA that can be unforgiving. LoL holds your hand as your learn, its pretty simplistic and can be learned within a couple weeks. 

So I think it would take a new MOBA that was as simple as LoL to learn, instilled many of the elements that LoL has, and most importantly, can offer **money** to tournament teams as prize money. Money used to advertise the brand and money to pay the best employees with knowledgeable MOBA experience.

**TL;DR**

* Riot doesn't deliver on promises that are generally advertised earlier
* Riot mishandles professional teams and events
* Riot is obviously still a great company, that has obvious room for improvement
* Would take bookoo bucks to usurp Riot


**Again, these are just some general thoughts of mine! I wish to only stimulate conversation and kind of bounce thoughts off the reddit community. Thank you for your time! CRITICISM OF ALL KINDS IS APPRECIATED, TRY TO KEEP IT RESPECTFUL**

 Also for clarification, he wasn't absolutely being forced by the NBA to sell the team. It would go through a vote of owners to decide his fate, but even then would go through countless legal proceedings because the team is his property. And you can't force someone to sell their property, pretty unconstitutional.

 Loco is annoying as fuck 




 The kid he called was 17 I think xD. I couldn't make out all of the conversation, and only caught bits and pieces. I heard something about him being a prince or some shit. There are a lot of pro streamers that don't have quite the popularity as other streamers. So maybe it'd be easier to get an interview with them. 




 Well some dude was just watching Imaqtpie and donated a bunch of money, and then qt got his number and called him. It was pretty tubular so maybe if you have 250 quid lyin around.

 At the beginning of a game once, a Brand ran straight to the mid turret and suicided. Afterwards, everyone was spamming their own versions of "WTF LOL" and after a brief pause. Brand says, "Gotta get them turret hits" Wiser words have never been said.

 I've definitely said some bannable things, but I haven't been chat restricted. Not necessarily raging, more or less I've said things in jest. Essentially my point is, system seems incredibly broken. 




 FINALLY HECARIMJOB! 




 WHERE THE FUCK IS HECARIMJOB? 




 Boring people do boring things. Simple. 




 Just Main Street 




 Is lich bane still the best item to build first on Fizz? Or is there a better item? 




 If the LoL/esports community needs to call on the fans to make a Hall of Fame, then it doesn't deserve one. To have a hall of fame, it requires tradition, this game hasn't been around long enough to prove it deserves something as prestigious as a HoF. Just an opinion.  It should also be created by the governing body (Riot) to preserve the integrity of the Hall. 




 Only word I understood was 'Fuck' 




 If I play mid I always play Fizz if he's open (he's my main). However, I don't know what to build first with the recent Lich Bane changes. Is this still the best item to rush? Another question of mine is, who are the best AP junglers? I'm not good enough to play Elise, Fidd is too situational, and Evelynn is more AD than AP. 




 You're seriously put-off by some champions (a digital character) taunting? Damn dude, would hate to see you get tea-bagged on Halo. You can also keep the pentakill because it's extremely rewarding and badass. I've never seen someone steal a penta then have a teammate ragequit/grief. Why have equal portraits either? This is an extremely soft view you're taking, I'm sorry.

           The only point that I really agree with is the "all chat". Because that is essentially useless in 100% of the cases. There is nothing that you can communicate with the opponent that can help you out. It usually stems from playful joking from 0-1:55, then after that its nothing important from 1:55-end.  




 Heres the tiers in my opinion,    Riot  ESPN  British Football Commentators, those lads are brilliant over there across the pond. 




 RIP headphone users, fuck
 




 Came for the prospect of Iker playing League, left disappointed
 




 I know it's your body and not my decision in the slightest. But come on man, do you really want a LoL champion tattooed, the game probably won't survive 5-10 more years. Commence my down votes. 




 Yeah I'm totally disregarding that comment, athlete sports take a level of intelligence in their own right 




 Seems like the problem lies within riot and not the fans. With the amount of cameras they have, the commentators could announce it remotely in the next room over without missing a beat. I will admit that league does involve a precedent never seen before in sports. This precedent is that live commentary is actually a necessity for the fans. Seems weird to think about goin to a football game and have an analyst over the speaker the entire time. 




 So I'll preface this, like I did in my title, that I'm a long time sports fan before I ever got into e-sports. There is an unusual thing that I'm seeing with the e-sports fans. There seems to be factions forming about how fans should be cheering and other etiquette issues, which is foreign to me. Maybe it's just because I support Philadelphia sports teams that have some of the harshest fans that made me like this. But I say that fans cheering and being loud is all a part of the game and it's the atmosphere that riot should want to generate energy in the building. Now I don't think fans should be able to call out opponents positions or if the other team is baroning. In the real sports world there are unfair conditions, home field advantage, etc that can swing games, but it's a part of the game. Fans do whatever they can, within reason, to help their team win.

TLDR; If you want to accept the popularity of the growing sport and help keep the exciting atmosphere, then accept what real sports atmospheres are really like. 




 I hate cosplay and think it's one of the most awkward things I could ever witness. If I'm ever fortunate to have kids some day, I'd rather walk in on them beating off than have them dressed as a league character and dancing To make a YouTube video. 




 Vel'koz is the Flying Spaghetti Monster, what an awesome skin idea concept! Anyone? 




 CFC CHECLSEA!!! 




 Yet again I can't play Hecarim even once! Rito plox! D: 




 Does that yellow show up on their screen too? 




 Can I just have a quick clarification for Evelynn's stealth? When I'm around my opponent, the eye above them is gold. Does that mean that they know that I'm around, they just don't know where exactly? And when it turns red, it means they can full on see me. I just want to make sure I watch for this as I learn to jungle eve. 




 Yeah this helps, thank you. I know what you mean about the trouble with some mids picking AD assassin champs like a talon or zed. I don't have a very deep jungling champion pool. I keep it to panth, j4, and fidd. I'm still trying to learn eve, but I think Elise might be above my skillcap to use her well.  




 When I'm picking a jungler, is it right for me to want to keep a balance between the AD and AP on my team? So lets just assume that mid is AP, bot is AD with an AP support. If my top picks an AD champ, do i always wanna go with an AP jungler, and vice versa? I realize that it is in a sense situational and it depends on my team comp. I'm just kind of looking for a general rule of thumb for know which junglers to pick, given a team comp. 




 I feel embarrassed that this dude was wearing that in public.
 




 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand another week without Hecarim 




 If it happens in real professional sports, its even more definite to happen for League Of Legends. Since English isn't your first language, this analogy might not be very effective. However, for basketball, Kobe Bryant (Famous  dude) this year was almost voted an All-Star despite being injured for pretty much the entire season and not having any stellar performances. 




 If you check his right ear, ya missed a spot. 




 Riot's own Vitruvian Man 




 What happens when Vel'koz gets The Lantern 




 I feel the exact same way man. It's been well documented that the toxicity of the LoL community is pretty great. I see posts all the time about these issues and it happens to me all the time too. I actually almost considered quitting the game entirely because I was amazed at how selfish most players are. Reminding people to be nice to other people, and remember who is actually behind the computer screen doesn't really work. In theory its great, and practical, but its so easy to be angry. So really the only way to make great environments for playing is for riot to take drastic action, and place all the trolls together. But they've already stated that they won't do that, so don't hold your breath for any changes in the ranked environment any time soon. Essentially the only time I feel like I'm in a relaxed environment is when I'm in normals, and the result of the match doesn't really matter to me. So good luck in trying to get out of bronze and thence forward. :) 




 Ever since I started playing about 7 months ago or so I always saw Hecarim as a badass. However, he hasn't been free since I've started playing and I think 6300IP is too expensive to try him out. Hecarim I want to try you please come out and play! D:  




 Out of the 5 or so best junglers currently in the meta, which have the best level 1-3? And which counter each other so you know whether to invade or not? 




 Why have game modes been playable for a week or so and then removed? Why not give players the options to play a variety of different game modes? Seems interesting that they keep a game mode like dominion, yet neglect game modes that get a lot of traffic. Maybe, there are server issues and it becomes just too hard for Riot to keep all these game modes functioning simultaneously. Does anyone know an actual reason or do they just like to keep things fresh and new? Thanks! 




 Plus his eye is basically an extra pink ward if you look at it. OP 




 Ah, those were all very good points to be made. Especially the time zone one, since I live on the east coast and the time I play before bed, could be the time that someone on the west coast just ate dinner. 




 I was just making an observation and this is in no way a definite truth, but I feel like I win more games during the night time. And this is independent of what day of the week it is. So I began to wonder what the cause might be. Is it that I just am more relaxed and focused to play before I go to sleep? Am I just at an awkward ELO that it's hard for be to be too consistent? Now before I make my main point, I'd like to preface that I'm over 18 years old :P. But could I have a better win percentage because at night I'm more likely to play with other players of my age demographic? Since I wouldn't be playing with younger players, is there a less chance of having ? I realize that this is completely different than the 65-year old trying to text and just being completely confused by a younger generation. But could this age gap with my teammates during the day be causing me to lose more? I also want to point out that I'm not trying to condescend to younger players that are better than me ha. However, is there a point to made? Please let me know if you find this interesting or if I'm just seeing things that aren't there. Thank you. 
























 Cherylee by Gowns on spotify, second half of the song is powerful 




 John Frusciante's solo in Wet Sand by Red Hot Chili Peppers or the face melting solo in Alive by Mike McCready of Pearl Jam 




 What's your favorite short song? I'm gonna set the limit as anything 3:00 or shorter, I think that's reasonable enough to be considered short. So what're your favorites? I think the top on many people's list might be Immigrant Song by Led Zeppelin, but I think my favorite is Songbird by Oasis, great summer tune. 




 As soon as saw this as a topic I knew it'd be about these lines of the song. If I were green I would die just fits the melody. It's the same thing as misheard lyrics to me. In Pearl Jam's song Yellow Ledbetter, Eddie says, "but they don't wave" but it legitimately sounds like "potato wave". We all know it's not potato wave but it sure as hell sounds like it. 




 I'm in love with their ability to tell a story that can draw emotional responses from the listener 




 That Western Skyline or A Little Bit of Everything by Dawes 




 John Frusciante's cover of How Deep Is Your love, originally by the Bee Gees

http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=awKM1YLAl18

This is so awesome, John is so talented, love this guy. 




 Wow, yes it is still on netflix, I checked, looks super intriguing, thanks. 




 RHCP is in my current top 5 bands, I love those dudes, I dont care if reddit thinks they've fallen off either 




 Helllll yes, I love early hip hop, this is gonna be awesome 




 If this isn't a documentary about Kevin Federline as a backup dancer than I don't wanna watch it. Nah, I'm kidding, thanks for the netflix link. 




 hmm I'm not familiar with any of these, that can only be good news 




 Hmm first 3-4 albums you say? I'll give it a whirl 




 Definitely looking forward to seeing the Talking Heads, I don't know much about them really, pretty obscure fellows I imagine 




 Hopefully this will help me understand the punk scene more! Thanks for the suggestion 




 AWESOME, I'm a fan of all these dudes, can't wait, thanks 




 They recently came to Hershey, PA. Near where I'm from, and I think some people said they put on a pretty good show. I'm not a fan of theirs myself, but I can appreciate good showmanship 




 I love watching documentaries, and I love music and I've watched a few rock docs. Can anyone suggest any good rock docs that discuss music from any time frame between the 50's and now? I like when they are specifically talking about genres or artists, but I wouldn't mind a documentary discussing multiple genres at once and how their fan bases felt towards each other, and how it effected the genre in all. 




 Ayyyyy a Marina fan, I see you kid  




 Spotify has allowed me to broaden my horizons so immensely, I'm very thankful for it 




 Gnarly amigo, that's what I like to hear 




 This song is so gnarly, too bad only one album was ever made. 




 Ahhh!!!!!!! I totally had a similar situation with Black! It was always one of my favorites, but after a certain situation it actually made tears swell in my ears and I had trouble listening to those exact lyrics.

Sage Francis from his new album. "May the bridges that we burn light the way"

And lastly Johnny Cash's cover of Hurt in combination with his music video is heavy shit. "You can have it all, this empire of dirt" as his hand is trembling and pour out a drink onto the ground. 




 I was in England at the time she died, and there was a bunch of hooplah, but I frankly didn't care a whole lot. I don't know why I'm not a fan, it could be because she dated a bum and she shoplifted tabloid magazines, but I guess that shouldn't affect my opinion of her as a musician, but oh well, it does. 




 Hmm, its easy to see the benefits. I would envision that this would grant the new player base experience in going forward with their gameplay.  




 Ahh it was a low budget (relatively speaking) indie film that received all great reviews as far as I know. I think the movie is awesome. Anyways... I always, for some reason thought the song "Satellite" always seemed like a narrative for the movie District 9. I dont know... something about this combination always made me think they clicked together.  




 Thats actually the song I had in mind when you mentioned Rise Against, debatably my top 3 song of theirs. Ok Sephiroth, I have a question, have you ever seen District 9? 




 I've always admired Rise Against's lyricism, good lyric choice 




 I really liked Copper Gone by Sage Francis and Southsiders by Atmosphere 




 That was awesome 




 Ahh gotcha, thanks man, I was trying to get a general gist of what people thought, and this makes sense to me. 




 Hey guys, I was just wondering  what all of your guys' favorite Frusciante songs. I dig Central, Murderers, The Mirror, Before the Beginning, Time Goes Back, and The Past Recedes. Those are my top 5 probably in no particular order.  




 Mariah Carey

Cherylee by Gowns
 




 Ahh, so I guess that's why it's never brought up :P Thanks for the heads up man. I also totally dig the album, and Greenwood rips the tits off his guitar. I guess now I'll just sit and wait for my ass kicking. 




 Hey all, I've been browsing the music subreddit for only about a week or so and I've seen a bunch of Radiohead fans (not really a surpirse), however, most of the discussion I've seen has been about OK Computer or Kid A, deservedly so. I was just curious as to what the community thought about Pablo Honey, being there first album and all. Creep doesn't need to be mentioned, but you all probably already knew that. 

One of my favorite tracks is definitely "You". Yorke's voice just incredibly shreds through the song and gives me awesome chills and I'm left amazed. I just thought I'd make this quick point.

Anyways, I was just wondering what the general feeling of this album was, cheers. 




 Michael Jackson, why do you call Sprite "Jesus juice?" 




 Keith Moon - Wanna grab a beer since we have the same birthday? And maybe we can talk about your Holiday Inn story 




 The first time I heard contact I was actually blown away by the build up, I thought it was Sooo good, but you're right it almost feels like the the rest of the song is anticlimactic. 




 Hmm and I only like the first half of Touch... Maybe RAM wasn't the best choice on second thought 




 Hey not a bad remix to it, you definitely did enough adjusting to "make it your own" so to speak. 




 I've only listened through it once so far, and it seemed like if you like Rise Against, you'll probably like this album. It didn't seem to stray too far from the norm, which is fine. I was just wondering what the community on here thought about it. Thanks. 




 Motherboard on Random Access Memories didn't do much for me 




 I agree, I think I get the message that Radiohead was trying to convey, but I wouldn't say it ruined the album. I definitely could have done without it though. 




 Open Happiness by a collective of artists 




 you're awesome 




 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aYiiGd3PZc t=2m2s


 









 It can sometimes be hard to pull off a tribute song that is really as cohesive as this one. Slug did an awesome job. R.eye.P 









 The intro of "Stranglehold" by Ted Nugent. As soon as you hear that you know I'm in the zone and about to show you a girthy yet humble 6.4 inch dong slice 




 I stopped filling it out once I saw Mac miller with more votes than slug 




 O.A.R. Are one of my summer bands 




 As if I needed another reason to love Eddie. 




 Yep I'm not sure if it's still on there, but yeah we started watching it as a joke, then we decided to stop ha 




 Lost me at Avril lavigne, and made me want to kill myself at Bieber. 

EDIT: just saw Bruno Mars (I'm dead) 




 Skalett Johansson 




 FIZZZ LESS'GO 




 The only thing I could think to hide is when my roommate and I watched the first 10 minutes "Nude Nuns with Big Guns". I could not wait to get that off my previously watched list. 




 Fancy - Iggy Azalea 




 Ahh sorry to hear that man, truly I am. It's also good that you have BB to turn to that can bring back good memories. 




 Bringing back the memories of listening to Breaking Ben. First heard of them playing Halo 2 and their song "Blow Me Away" was in the campaign.  




 Thanks fellas, I'm going to check these out ASAP 




 Piano Man by Billy Joel, American Pie by Don McLean, Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen, and Under the Bridge by Red Hot Chili Peppers 




 I re-watched School of Rock the other day, and it has always been one of my favorite movies from when I was growing up (come at me). I think I first watched it when I was in middle school. I can still remember that scene where "Bonzo Goes to Bitburg" by the Ramones is playing and Jack Black is basically teaching his students everything about the History of Rock, and what a huge impact this scene had on me the first time I watched it. This was the first moment I can remember really getting into music, and it was because of this scene. With Freddy watching live performances of the The Who's Keith Moon, and Jack Black filling the blackboard with hundreds of bands and connecting their genres and influences. It was just incredible to me. So after re-watching it, I wanted to know some of the best live/historic performances ever to watch. I want to see how the legends played and the iconic moments they had. THANKS :) 




 Teams should always be bigger than the players in any sport. There are usually BIG problems that arise when players think they are bigger than the team. 




 Well so much for being coy. I reciprocate the feelings, what can I say. 




 Put your ear down to the earth and listen for it. Put your heart into it, and ye shall find what your heart desires! 




 you're right, as much as it pains me, gotta take it down. 




 Stop thinking of it as a losing streak. Each game is independent of one another. So try to just put past losses behind you and focus on the next game, to avoid going on tilt

 




 No one pays them. It's a video game. 




 Anyone else think that it would be nicer if they played the replays a bit slower so the pros have enough time to speak about the fight. A lot of time the fights are too fast paced and some of the strategy and analysis is left out. Especially in crucial fights when there are so any moving parts, it'd be nice to absorb as much info as possible. 




 Somebody is on Fantasy tilt 




 Looking at the champs compared to the actor. Christian Bale seems the most believable. 




 Ahh okay, I would think of a champ with no cc. Multiple abilities that can cc usually help define a support champ as well as their ability to shield or heal you. Master yi offers no cc and will steal your cs without protecting you. An adc also come to mind that doesn't really support but helps kill, is Lucian. Zed also doesn't seem to offer too much into the role. And I'm not sure about Vlad or not. 




 You mean the most viable, nonpopular pick? Or do you literally want the worst champion that could ever try and support? 




 I think it's the fact that no team is really head and shoulder above the other teams. So confidence in ending games is an issue. It took TSM so long to close out that game. 




 Xpecial and Cop on the analysts desk, stick knives in my ears plsssss 




 Cosplay still sucks. 




 Who's this guy at the announcer's desk???? WTF 




 Why did he make out with Meachum? Can anyone explain that scene? 




 Actually really helpful and concise. I've been wanting to learn Elise as well, but was kind of discouraged by her two forms. I don't like champs with 2 forms because I have a tough time judging each forms power. Thanks. 




 So basically this post is about how EU LCS makes me really hard, but ends up being anti-climactic. Reflects my last 3 days fairly accurately. 




 Not sure if a parody or not. 0(o.o)0 




 If reddit didn't have a "remember me" system when logging into the site, you'd be screwed. 




 really? :( first time I've seen it. It's original to me. Uh-oh philosophical debate incoming.  




 CLASSIC MIX-UP 




 I'm confused. Explain pls. 




 Hmmmm Interesting. 

Pros: Rewards team for defending wards ( as you stated)  

Cons:Would make the pink slightly stronger (not sure if a noticeable difference) [Not sure if this is even a con]

Hmm. It's actually a pretty fresh and original idea. Good Work. Wouldn't mind seeing it implemented. Not sure if it will, but I like it nonetheless. 




 Dodging is the last good defense against trolls, I say lower the LP penalty, even though i'll never reach that division. I approve of the ideology behind it. 




 Can you make a tutorial video pls? I think the community would be grateful. 12/10 on improvements, would buy it from a 3am infomercial on comedy central 
























 This would be a stupid move on Wilmots case in my opinion. I think Wilmot mismanaged this Belgian squad in Brazil. Though Belgium got as far as some expected after the draw was revealed. I can't help think that he didn't do enough to get Hazard motivated or involve him enough. Hazard at the beginning was tipped to be one of the stars of the WC, but turned out to be a shadow of his usual self. 









 This quote seems kind of odd. I feel like he didn't need to apologize because he wasn't owned by us. If anyone should be close to apologizing, it's Courtois, but even so, I don't want him apologizing either.  Costa didn't have a %100 guarantee of being sold to Chelsea so he shouldn't be sorry for putting on a good *audition*, he should probably apologize to terry for irritating him haha. 




 Ha ok then I don't know. 




 
Hmm, it was working initially... I even checked since I posted it from mobile to see if the URL was different. But now I'm actually having trouble accessing it too. Might be a disruption on their end. 









 Why did Argentina bring Palacios to Brazil with them instead of this man? 




 Separate ways by journey?? 




 Yeah I remember his album with josh where is was basically all guitar instrumentals. And that's an awesome fact about curtains ha 




 Yes indeed, John is a beautiful human being. Now I don't have any knowledge of this, I haven't read any articles or anything. But in his solo albums does he make all the sounds? Not necessarily play all the instruments but maybe does he use computer programs and such? Or does he bring people in to sort of collaborate. 




 I know, he's one of the guitarists that I associate with their guitar. In a sense when I hear him play, it feels like it's speaking for him. He's a pretty eccentric dude so I can only assume that he's been trying to really experiment, and maybe it's selfish for me to tell him what to make, but oh well. 




 Why is this a thread? Seems like Marketing 101 for the 1960's. 




 My other favorites from the album are The Mirror and The Will To Death, gotta love John, however, I couldn't really get into his newest album 




 Zzyzx rd - stone sour, absolutely a great tune 




 Damn, that was good. So now you got me wondering why this doesn't get equal praise. Probably the simple answer, Rise Against being the most recent to do it. Also with the lessening popularity of our involvement in the Middle East, with the video playing a very key role in my experience with the song. 




 i'll have to give it a listen. 




 From my experience, I haven't heard a song that talks about the warrior after the war. And the regret the warriors have when every gratifies them for their "heroism". If there is another song that does this, then so be it. But I haven't heard it 




 This is actually really awesome, is there somewhere he'll be posting the songs or has it already been done by him elsewhere?  




 It seems like English papers get away with posting bullocks 




 Sergio Busquets 




 Even though I feel like the East is getting stronger, it's still not the west... so we have a chance to at least maybe surprise some people 




 Damn, sixers drafted Elfrid before they traded him, woulda been oodles of fun 




 Oh god, that handshake at the end was cringe-worthy. Handshakes bring out the whiteness in all white people. 

Jokes aside.. Lookin forward to Joel's impact in the future 




 I want the Sixers to be above .500 with Nerlens having a good year after recovering from injury his entire rookie season. BECAUSE HAIR. 




 Last Kiss - Pearl Jam 




 Camera Thief - Atmosphere

Make Em Purr - Sage Francis
 




 I've always admired Rise Against for their lyricism, but damn did this song step it up for me. 




 DK in Donkey Kong 64 




 Hey reddit, I see this album mentioned a lot and how it has had a major influence on the history of music. I was wondering if anyone knew any articles that discussed this albums influences or basically anything that would teach me more about this album. I like music history a lot, but this isn't something I've looked into deeply, any comments would be great. 




 I'm just messin around, it's actually a good point 




 Fuck Iggy with a Ron Jeremy dick 




 Wax is back and crack is whack kids  




 EDIT: duh 




 Doesn't lead to a fulfilling climax? Then you've obviously never shouted "oh mama Mia mama Mia" as loud as you can, very fulfilling 




 Innuendo by Queen has some awesome acoustic guitar soloing, definitely worth the listen if you haven't already. 




 I blame Rosie O'Donnell 




 And sisters! You eugenist 




 Wish you were here - pink floyd 




 Nah, I wasn't talking about your whore mother specifically, just in general. The thesis was about the whore in everybody's mom. 




 His name is Simon Carmichael, got his PhD at the age of 16 from Oxford in Computer Science, and his doctoral thesis was on "The correlation between Broadband speed and your moms level of whoreness." Great guy. 




 Black by Pearl Jam 




 I see that album mentioned a lot, could you point to a good article or anything that would help me understand its influence a bunch more? 




 Higher Ground by RHCP is also pretty dope 




 The Scientist - Coldplay

Imagine - John Lennon 




 Ha, I remember their Pants song. I used to think that song was the funniest shit since Ace Ventura. Oh to be 7 again. 




 yeah i get it, god isn't real. 




 That's kinda the joke I'm going for. We all live our lives assuming God doesn't exist. So if we get to the Pearly Gates, we're all gonna say... "shit" because obviously we won't be getting in. Don't think too hard 




 Yep no problemo man, enjoy 









 Good album since nothing for the past like past 3 or 4 years. Sage is a lyrical creative monster as usual, shows a lot of emotion with isolation and heartbreak and such. My favorite tracks are Grace, Make em Purr, ID Thieves, and Vonnegut Busy. But essentially, if you dig Sage, you're gonna dig this album.

Ahh thanks for the clarification, I just always group Sage with those guys. 




 Rhymesayers label produces so much quality. Been bumpin Copper Gone and Southsiders since they came out earlier this year.  




 Lupe is pretty outspoken about his hatred for violence, one of the most well known, and that's what I respect about LUpe 




 And then my roommate looked at me and said, "dude that was totally tubular" 




 You probably think this song is about you don't you, don't you? 




 you mean you don't like that T.I. is gonna "split your ass in two?" :p 




 Link? 




 I remember the first time I heard this. It was a live performance on one of the late night shows. And I was like, "Holy Shit, what was that? That was great" 




 Have you ever listened to a song and it seems to really gel with you, except there are lyrics that just don't click? This is how I feel sometimes, and it can be off-putting. However, these songs I'm about to mention, I still listen to and love.

The two that come to mind off the top of my head are "Champagne Supernova" by Oasis and "Human" by The Killers


I know Champagne Supernova is the most famous one, but can't go without being said.


* Champagne Supernova "Slowly walking through the hall, faster than a cannonball..."

EGAD! Does not compute  [The moment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3C7DECI0jU t=0m43s)


* Human "Are we Human? Or are we Dancer? My sign is vital. My hands are cold"

I don't get it, does anyone? [We are Dancer, I guess](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIZdjT1472Y t=0m43s)


This isn't a thread about the worst lyrics, I'd like it to be the lyrics you'd like to change to otherwise good songs.


Conspiracy theory: Both songs occur at the 43 second mark... dun dun dun

Thanks! 




 Lover of the Light and Dust Bowl Dance by Mumford and Sons. And War Song by O.A.R. 









 I love RHCP, and even though a lot of redditors really dig BSSM, I think Stadium Arcadium is my favorite Frusciante workings for RHCP

I'm not a big Beatles guy so I won't witch hunt you about Lennon, even though Imagine changed my life (post-Beatles I know). And as for Thom Yorke, I really like about half of Radiohead's discography, and the other half I just like. And from the interviews and musical talks it seems like Thom gets a lot of the shine, but you'd be better off asking someone else. 




 *Marcus Mumford 




 Brian May, the only famous musician I know to have a PhD in astrophysics. Stud in my book.
 




 Townsend/Moon destroying instruments frequently, Townsend hitting Sinclair at Woodstock in '69? Sure Roger was the frontman, but I think it's unfair to say he overshadowed those fellows. 




 'Giorgio by Moroder' by Daft Punk on the Random Access Memories is a really cool and unique track that has Giorgio talking for a portion of the song. 




 Ehhhh I don't agree with The Who, Pete Townsend and Keith Moon also managed to make sure they weren't out of the spotlight. 




 Yeah Pete Townsend took them to a whole new level. As for another contributor, I think Neil Peart, the drummer from Rush is up there. He is a really smart dude that also writes the lyrics, lots of good lyricism in Rush songs. Not to mention, he's one of the best drummers out there.

I think it's also fair to mention John Frusciante of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Once he joined RHCP, he changed the game for them. Him and Jimi Hendrix are two guitarists that I really think are 'one' with their guitar/sound. So good to listen to. 




 The Who, Keith Moon helped turn drummers from time keepers into bad asses that can express themselves on the drums. Pete Townsends lyricism and brute force when playing influenced punk and expressed anger. Roger Daltrys presence on stage was also awesome. 




 Somebody To Love, Live in Montreal... To any nonbelievers

EDIT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpEUXRz08t4 




 It seems like encores have become a pleasantry to the bands from the fans. If the fans don't call for an encore then they might be seen as rude or ungrateful. It's the same thing as saying "bless you" when someone sneezes. It serves no purpose, but if you don't say bless you, then you look like a dick. Unless someone sneezed before, then I might cheer for a sneeze encore, depending on the quality of the sneeze. 




 Words I Never Said by Lupe Fiasco from Laser. Sky Full Of Stars by Coldplay from Ghost Stories. These are pretty mainstream, but what resonated with me the most. These songs in my opinion are a shining light in a lackluster album. Personally, I don't hate Lasers like most hip-hop fans did but I thought Lupe killed that track even if the beat was a bit industrial-esque. As for Ghost Stories, the best track is an Avicii song with Chris Martin as the featured singer. Everything else about the album is mehhhh. Gwenyth Paltrow sucks. 




 I know the leaders of TPB got caught, but as for the site as a whole, is it still safe to use? 




 This album is so chilling, watching any live performance of this album gives me goosebumps. 




 It's not like riot is cutting them royalty checks, it's more or less a pat on the back. 




 Southsiders by Atmosphere, Copper Gone by Sage Francis, and Lazaretto Jack White 




 The Pokemon? 




 I like the idea of riot developing the community's idea, but they should also give credit where credits due. Maybe just a footnote on the bottom of the page that says "Originally designed by:_____". Doesn't have to be anything too flamboyant, and maybe give that user the champ for free and some RP, seems like good enough compensation for their contribution. 




 With the emergence of youtube and talent search shows, A LOT of people have the capability to be really good at singing. The person with the best image then emerges on top 




 I feel like writing your own songs is such a big part of the artistry of music 




 I suppose you're right, maybe I need to take a chill pill on it 




 I'm not saying their not talented because they can sing really really good. I just don't think they should be idolized based on the lyrics they sing. And people quoting their lyrics as mantras for their daily lives seems like a sham. 




 I get the feeling that with modern autotuning equipment, that radio artists are a dime a dozen. Find someone with a pretty face that can sing, and we'll do the rest for ya. I lot more people are able to sing than are able to write songs. 




 I don't know about full score, but Promentory from Last Of The Mohicans is such a slept on song 




 Personally, I really don't like the idea of a band not writing their own material. It's okay in my opinion for some of their material, but people that gain fame without writing their own material isn't really that impressive to me. When someone releases a song under their name, they are effectively advocating whatever they're saying, unless its satire. So it seems like when people admire an artist/band, they're worshiping a facade. How do you guys feel about this? 




 I can't listen to them any more after finding out their lead singer is in prison for 35 years for sexually assaulting an infant. 




 This is actually pretty off base. First off Motrhead and will.i.am aren't representatives of their genre. And there's also a clear difference in time frame and it's correlation with popularity. Motrhead isn't as likely to get recognized on the scale Will is. His popularity is a lot larger so he's getting haggled everywhere he goes. Motrhead is in the twilight of their career and loves the intimacy they can have with their fans at this time in their careers. Also, if you're in Hong Kong having visa issues, how badly would you care about having your photo taken with a stranger. Must've been frustrating, as is. 




 I BELIEVE IN LOVE, THATS ALL WE'VE GOT, LOVE KNOWS NO BOUNDARIES, NO BORDERS TO CROSS! 




 First person shooter? Yeah you're gonna get kids screaming profanities regardless of nationality. 




 And yet Finland has some of the highest test scores amongst the 15-18 year old range. Get more aggressive America. Little ironic.

 




 This is just speculation and I don't have any hard evidence to back it up. But I did see that record sales are down since last year, and I don't know if it's a trend or not. However, with iTunes and such, it's a lot easier to cherry pick the songs you like and not need to buy the others. Could it be easier for the less active fans to quickly sift through a bands *newest* and *best* tunes without having to listen through them all. Basically, is a band better off hyping 3-4 singles for a bunch of sales than an entire album? 




 I'm not afraid to admit that I love power ballads, I'm not even afraid to admit it on reddit where I'm sure they're scorned. That being said, who's brave enough to admit some of their favorite power ballads? 
























 Not only does it set the time for a great album, I just listened to it and I have a final in 5 minutes, and I just realized how powerful of a song this is. That is all, I needed to share this. 




 Time 3:18-4:45, pretty much just sex on my ears, one day I'm gonna find a nice girl and impregnate her to this solo. 




 Right down the pisser! 




 So basically what I got out of this was that I'm going to become a Taylor Swift fan. Just kidding man, sweet pics of that airship and even sweeter beard brother. 




 Meh 




 I regret the fact that I have to say tDSotM is a perfect album, besides this one song I always skip :( 




 Upvote for O.A.R. I saw them a few years back in Hershey. Great live performers, the saxophonist is great. 




 Didn't see that one coming /s
 




 The Division Bell by Pink Floyd


Don't know how many times I've immersed myself in this album whilst studying. 




 Hmm that's still interesting. Thanks for the link, I do wish they would announce a number, seems weird that they didn't. 




 Halo 1 might be difficult to discern, but I was talking with my roommates today about what Halo had the most simultaneous players. The only thing I really found out was that Halo 3 had 1.1M players in the first 24 hours which is incredible. Can anyone point me in the right direction or know the totals for each? Thanks 




 *cough* wow *cough*

[2 days ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/pinkfloyd/comments/2nb5xp/hypothetical_discussion_what_if_roger_waters_solo/) 




 DISCLAIMER: The thoughts in this post are just my opinion and should be taken as such, so please just keep that in mind.


So I listened to The Final Cut then Amused To Death right after that, and it got me thinking. What if Waters came to the band with AtD instead of TFC? I personally really like most of TFC, but there are moments I don't care for. I also don't dislike it in the way some PF fans do. I also personally think AtD is Waters' best solo album and really enjoy it, however, I feel like it's missing a small PF feel to it. 


To many fans, I think, they'd consider DSotM through The Wall as the golden era of PF. Would AtD been a continuation of this era? Did Roger have such a chokehold on the band at this point that anything would've split them up? Would it be a great success and considered a classic? Would things have played out differently? 




 One of the better songs off TFC in my opinion. Especially, "SHOULD WE SHOOOOOOOOOOUT?! SHOULD WE SCREEEEEEEEAM?! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE POST-WAR DREEEEEEEEAM?!" 




 Sam's Town is such a fucking great album 




 Dear McLordy, 4 incorrect uses of "they're" 




 Are there any sites that catalog pretty much every song by PF? Besides Wikipedia which I'm sure credits each song with the appropriate singer. I like this list you did, but obviously it's not the entire catalog as I find myself confused at times. 




 Dear lord, what a shame... I never heard of him, so excuse my academy ignorance, but it's a tragic time when any blue falls, 1st teamer, academy player, fan, or not. Rest easy bud. 




 As a student at WVU, this song is of great importance to me. To the place, I belooooooong, West Virginia  




 That's fair. I've been there.  




 "Gilmore".... cringing 




 I think out of all the carvings, this is the best one I've seen yet. Very well done. 




 More specifically: His favorite song by the band in general, and his favorite song to play on drums 




 As awful as the NCAA is, I hope they do the right thing and punish UNC accordingly. And this time when handing out punishments, make sure that they are punishing the correct people... not student athletes that weren't involved in the scandal. This is a total breakdown of the university at the highest level and it'll be hard for the NCAA to punish appropriately. But I have no fear that they will royally fuck it up. 




 I want some more of it. 




 Should have made Any Colour You Like longer and got rid of On The Run 




 This is my absolute favorite song to jam to in the car. Especially driving around town and having it blast for other people. I feel like I'm putting strangers in a great mood 




 Surprised no one said The Wall by Pink Floyd. Even came with a movie and it's super bad ass! 




 At the very end of the song is an amazing guitar solo, as we are all aware of. But I always wonder what could've been because as the song fades out, you can hear David Gilmour still just melting faces with that guitar. The solo is perfection, but damn do I always wish I could here more of that solo because by that point of the song I'm in such a trance-like state that I want more.  




 Twenty One Pilots and Pink Floyd. You can never have too much Pink Floyd though 




 Holy shit, you are awesome 




 Special shoutout to you too man. Hope to see you around here from time to time too. 




 I'm glad you've been given the reins. I don't post here much, but I check it daily and read your posts many times and it couldn't have been passed to a better dude. Anyways that being said. This song was kinda disappointing because Nobody Home to Comfortably Numb is my favorite part of the entire album. I actually find myself done listening to the album after Comfortably Numb, just because it gets a bit too abstract for me. That's all 




 Holy hell that was confusing haha, I'm not sure what I was voting for tbh 




 I thought Endless River wasn't going to include any new tracks? Just some archived material from back in the day. If so, there wouldn't be any new tricks unfortunately
 









 Thanks  man, glad you liked it. Yeah with those albums, only the most dedicated RHCP fans are listening  so that has an effect on it. I'm not sure what effect exactly ha 




 Thanks for the politeness man. I was a bit surprised about If you want me to stay, but Higher Ground seemed like the obvious favorite imo. 




 Hey all, I did a similar thing before with other bands where I looked at each album by an artist and took note of which song had the most plays.  I don't include live or greatest hits albums. Enjoy!

Format: **Album** song, plays

* **Red Hot Chili Peppers** True Men Don't Kill Coyotes, 275,575
* **Freaky Styley** If You Want Me To Stay, 190,731

* **I'm With You** The Adventures Of Rain Dance Maggie, 6,746,450


Not that many surpises to be honest, but interesting nonetheless. 




 Is nobody gonna notice the shitty goalkeeping? 




 Hey all, I did a similar thing before where I looked at each album by an artist and took note of which song had the most plays. I'm going to do this with RHCP since they have a large discography/fanbase. I don't include live or greatest hits albums. Enjoy!

 about 60,000, which is less than 1% difference 




 There was actually like a 2 million play difference too, really surprised me. The closest was between like Comfortably Numb and Brick in the wall pt. 2 




 Drink some platinums and play this jam. 




 "I'll have what she's having" - Peter Griffin 




 I was just curious to see which Pink Floyd songs are the most listened to played by on Spotify. So I compiled this list real quick. I didn't include live versions or greatest hits albums.

I would try to see if I could guess the most popular song off each album before I checked. Was surprised by a few, and others were sometimes obvious. Interesting stuff, hope you guys enjoy. 




 Well, I didn't intend on coming into r/pics to shit myself 




 Am I the only one when in the air, imagine that I'm looking at an ocean with the clouds being icebergs? Or nah? 




 I think the shoes are awesome and incredibly well done. I won't buy em because its just not my style of shoe. Thats not in any way an insult to you. Just not my thing. Only lower the price if the market demands for it to be lowered. 




 I didn't like Final Cut at first because I thought it was too polarizing. But the more I listen to it, the better it gets because I listen to it from Roger's point of view.

 Wet Sand by Red Hot Chili Peppers. This songs guitar solo was playing as I turned 21 and it's still my favorite shit ever 




 If he's fit, that's more than great. But with remy, my anxiety that has lingered for the past couple of years could be relieved. Not to hail remy too early before he's done anything. But there's no denying a complete mentality shift with regards to our strike force this season. They have awesome confidence that we've needed badly. 




 Big Brother is always watching 




 This was posted about a month or so ago and went straight to the top... I see you guy. 




 Rhymesayers 




 Badass intro I love it 




 Ahhh good suggestions. Too much hip-hop gets slept on in here. 




 So /u/LackOfForesight (gotta give him credit) did a thing where he asked /r/music for 52 albums to listen to over a year in an attempt to expand his musical palette. I suggested on his thread, that we listen to the albums as a community and discuss them on a weekly basis. It didn't get really popular but it seemed that there was still a contingent in the community that would like to do this.

* So I was wondering if that's something the community would actually be interested in doing. If this gains enough traction I will definitely be happy to facilitate the postings.

* There's a couple things that need to be cleared up first. Would you guys want use the list of 52 albums that he already compiled, or create a brand new list of "52 must listen to albums"

If you want to suggest a new album please put it in a format like this:

* Artist
* Album
* Genre

You can suggest as many as albums as you'd like, I'll keep track of it all, but keep it reasonable to albums that you think everyone should hear. This doesn't need to be an obscure list either. Suggesting famous albums is perfectly valid too.

I hope to get a decent enough response from you guys, Thanks!

EDIT: Good start, it looks like we'll be making a new list. So this needs to preferably hit the front of music's page to make sure we get enough suggestions. 




 I NEED THIS 




 Perfect, thanks man. 




 There has been a lot of variety and changes within the game since the start of the spring split. Champs have come and gone.I was wondering if there was any documentation of all the champs that have been used in this Summer split or Spring Split or both splits combined. And if that list was further broken down by region. It could be like an infographic that shows which region uses the most variety of champions. I'm sure this exists somewhere, so if someone wouldn't mind pointing me in the right direction, I'd appreciate it. Thanks! 




 Let me guess, you read the thread title but not the thread? 




 Dude... We should just make this a community thing. Where everyone listens to the same album and discusses it. :) 




 It's because he's just matured so much since his past recordings, I think. He's an older more thoughtful dude, I expect this to be his new sound 




 Camera Thief is definitely my favorite song from this album, but this song is still pretty good 




 I think this is a phenomenal signing, hell I would've taken him as a number 1 striker if we didn't ever get Costa. 




 The perfect sunday morning tune 




 Wish you were here -- pink floyd 




 The music video for hero of war is so appropriately good
 




 I remember AIM ;) 




 This sub-reddit has a thing called their music hall of fame. It's not a list of the greatest bands ever. It focuses more on the bands that have the most links posted of their songs. So to reduce the amount of songs that get posted over and over by the popular bands, reddit made a hall of fame for these bands. Where, basically posting threads of their song links isn't allowed. All bands in the hall of fame have their own sub reddits. You can find this hall of fame on the front page of this sub reddit, on the right side. 




 I'm goin to see them Sept 6th in Pitt, I'm so excited 




 As a Chelsea fan, this parallel hurts my heart 




 Twenty One Pilots live at Newport Music Hall 




 You just can't post music links of RHCP songs as new threads, if that's what you're referring to 









 This Torres story better not end up in /r/yesyesyesno 




 Dear lord, this has become one of my favorite Sage Francis songs. So personal... So human 




 Hey everyone I appreciate the honest feedback! I will definitely be listening to the suggestions. Thanks again. 




 I've always been into rock from the 60's-80's era, even though I wasn't alive in those eras. But it wasn't until this past summer where I really started to listening to a bunch of Pink Floyd material and I have been bumping a few of their albums (Wish You Were Here, Dark Side of the Moon, and The Wall) a lot. I first listened to WYWH because I always loved the song even though I never heard the album. So I listened to the album and then from there on I kept listening to more and more. I have also listened to The Final Cut, Meddle, Division Bell, and Animals. I know thats not all of their material, but I was just curious as to what other bands have a similar sound or were heavily influenced by Pink Floyd. I think PF's sound is amazing, I love the amazing guitar-work, the lyricism, the ambiance about the tunes too. 

**TL;DR I recently have been listening to more and more Pink Floyd. Now I'm curious as to what other bands sound like them, or were heavily influenced by them. It can be from any era.**

Thanks! 




 The Q is backwards! Veigar doesn't play by the rules of mainstream alphabetical conventions. 




 I like the extended metaphor you used with comparing to reddit, interesting and valid observation. I'm more alarmed, not surprised, but definitely alarmed that the masses like this song by this artist that has 1 song on spotify. Not that spotify is the god of determining musical catalogues, but they usually have a great selection. So I'm just assuming that she is just a pretty face with a voice and will have Disney write her songs. 




 So yesterday was my 21st birthday, and 2 nights ago (night of Aug. 22 going into the 23rd) I was having a birthday party and had the gnarliest moment ever. I then thought it would be awesome at 11:55 to queue up Wet Sand by Red Hot Chili Peppers so at midnight as I turned 21, John Frusciante's guitar solo was absolutely kicking my ass and it was amazing. Beautiful, gnarly, awesome, it was just the way it had to be done.[Wet Sand, solo around 4:22ish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWNDW5KtiKk)

Much love everyone, have a good day 




 O.A.R. -- Crazy Game Of Poker
 




 I've been thinking about the recent players who have left our club like Mata, de Bruyne, Lukaku and Luiz, etc. But one thing I've noticed, that when players leave the club, there doesn't seem to be any bitterness to the player from the fans. Hell, Juan was a club favorite and got pushed out by Mou, but he went to Man U of all clubs and Chelsea fans still love him (including me) and Luiz didn't really have a place in Mou's squad, but he was a fan favorite. I think there's a lot that can be said about Chelsea's fanbase as well as the quality of human beings that we bring in. Players with high character and commitment to the club. Arsenal burns players jerseys when they leave, which have been all their best ones, tbh.

**TL;DR Chelsea fans are great and don't hate players after they leave like Arsenal fans do** 




 RHCP babyyyyyyy 




 Shine on you crazy diamond by Pink Floyd 




 You sir, this what it's all about. This is the mission. Great Wallpapers, keep it up. 




 Fernando is that you? 
























 Pink Floyd, baby, best band ever :)

EDIT: Considering that I got downvoted in less than a minute, makes me think otherwise :'( 




 My favorite song hands down off Dark Side, no question about it. Listening to that solo in the right environment is a border line religious experience. Also the lyricism in this song is so superb, and it's genius for them to do the Breathe Reprise, I absolutely love this tune. 




 cheers mate 




 Do you know of any site or anything that can give me a guide or anything like that? 




 And that is sick, how much would a fella have to pay you to make another one? 




 Interesting, It seems like if you wanted to know about the real details of the band, you'd have to be already involved in reading music articles and such. I'm sure a lot of people were unaware of the falling out. 




 It's definitely easy for me to forget and overlook how much the Internet has really revolutionized media and information gathering in our world and that it wasn't to the scale that it is today. 




 Brandon Flowers, Radiohead, Modest Mouse 




 As you can see, less than half my artists have had an album come out in 2014, but thats all good. I finally listened to artists that I never really listened to before and I loved them. I might also add youtube links to some songs from these artists :) 

* 1) Pink Floyd - knew about them of course, really delved into their material and was blow away, I consider them one of my favorite bands of all-time. I even enjoyed The Endless River, to a certain extent, even though a lot of people didn't as much. I think that album has a time and place, and can't be listened to at any moment like some of their albums


* 2) The Killers - liked them when I was younger, got back into them and I think Sam's Town has aged realllllly well


* 3) Sage Francis - Man did this dude's new album swing hard, wooooo I love his venom


* 4) Modest Mouse - always knew the "hits" but listened to them a bunch more, I really dig the song, "Bankrupt On Selling"

* 5) Gorillaz - listened to the entire Demon Dayz album, and holllly shiiiit, it was gnarly


* 6) Twenty One Pilots - These two dudes have become one of my favorite bands, I think after their 3rd album these guys are gonna explode more than they already have, I'm super looking forward to their next project

* 7) Marina and the Diamonds - I was debating on not putting her on here, primarily because her lyrics aren't great and all that negative connotations that pop music brings, but I'll be damned if I didn't find her so catchy. She's my guilty pleasure - come hate me haha


*  8) St. Vincent - Digital Witnesses is my favorite song off her latest album, it's a fun album for me


* 9) The Naked   Famous - first heard them in FIFA, I totally dig their style and the female singer is something I totally dig

* 10) Atmosphere - Southsiders had it's moments, not the greatest album, I think I enjoyed it more than most Atmosphere fans. Flicker is my favorite song because I'm an Eyedea fan, so I thought it was a great song. I also started listening to his older discog a bit more, and I think Slug can straight spit fire

 




 I was born in '93, well after the PF break-up, and from what it seems, the PF break-up was popular news and shown in the media. (This could be wrong, I'm not sure how well covered it was by media outlets.) I was just wondering if there was anyone on here that had first hand accounts of watching this legendary band slowly and publicly fall out with each other (I know all the members weren't on the forefront). Basically I want to know how heartbreaking it was to watch Waters and Gilmour fight over something so revered. 




 thanks man, I'll pm ya next time instead of making a post, thanks for taking care of things though, much appreciated  




 I use it as my quick reference for the game times and future matches, I'm sorry if I'm unaware of any system that goes into updating (like updated every 2 weeks or such) 




 Team Baby-Afros!!! Let's fucking gooooo 




 You're right, that's why I do listen to the entire album when I study, it just flies right on by 









 Frusciante's guitar in Central is also wicked, that's my favorite song from his solo work 




 I think they've also used RHCP songs, I can't remember exactly which ones. But I remember Flea was pretty upset for obvious reasons, his music is meant to make people happy and inspire them, not make them go insane. ( Even though the song Easily makes me go insane( in a good way though)) Could anyone be so kind to fact check me on this? I'm on my phone and can't really navigate as easily. 




 Wet sand for Frusciante,and Alive for McCready are amazing  




 I'm a mess 




 No order

* David Gilmour (Never heard anyone manipulate a guitar and sounds quite like him)

* Jimi Hendrix (obvious, also he played a right-handed guitar upside down, need I say more)

* Pete Townshend (One of my favorite older rockers with some iconic moves that I love)

* Mike McCready (Pearl Jam's guitarist, I think he's very underrated, probably not top 5 all time, but he's in my list because I just love his solos)

* Jimmy Page (Double neck motha fuckaaaaassssss)

* John Frusciante ( I can't believe I forgot him in my original group :( ... He's literally one of my favorite people on the face of the planet)

EDIT: Woops I only did 5, so I added the 6th and messed up a bunch of spelling  




 I like this album more than piper, I still need to give it more listens, but I do find it enjoyable. OBC in my opinion is PFs most underrated album though 




 Sounds good 




 Is it Day 56? 




 Ahhh yes it's an American bookstore actually, I'm not sure how original they are though, I doubt they are original pressings. And good luck mate 




 You can get Dark side of the moon from barns and noble lol 




 Ughhh this conversation has come up once or twice already in the past week, please use the search on this subreddit 

EDIT: okay, downvote me because I wish for a variety of conversations... 




 *eating of popcorn intensifies* 




 ZING! 




 Word, we're all floydians here, much love homie 




 Cocks out lads! 




 I mean, I didn't downvote him, so I assume people are because he just kind of disagreed in a short manner without much of an explanation. Thats not good conversation 101 amigo 




 Yeah I found this so compelling, I try to share it with people whenever I can 




 Eddie Vedder is one of my most respected artist's, this 6 minute condensed version of an interview has swelled tears in my eyes so many times. What a great human being.

[Pearl Jam interview with Steve Gleason (former NFL player suffering from ALS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLHPm_8_Yis)
 




 Every verse is so potent 









 That's like... your opinion man... 




 Can't forget Poles Apart, or Wearing the inside out, or coming back to life.. shit... the whole album is great 




 Actually, Another Brick in the Wall pt. 2 doesn't really do much for me. I agree that TDB beats The Wall as a whole. And I also agree that Comfortably Numb absolutely outclasses anything on TDB. My favorite part on The Wall is Nobody Home through Comfortably Numb, other than that, I only revisit the album for Hey You, and sometimes Young Lust. 




 I think it's true about music companies wanting to slap old rock bands names onto an album to make nostalgia money.... but I love The Division Bell, it'd make more sense if it was about The Endless River, but it's not. The Division Bell is a fantastic album that I like more than The Wall. SO YEAH. 




 Spongebob bubble bowl band anyone? This list is egregious! 




 I will take you out to Ruth crists steakhouse  




 LET ME RUB YOUR ASS, GOD DAMMIT 




 Can I get a trial? It's only fair  




 Can I rub your ass then? 




 It seems that both albums are necessary as a precept for Dark Side, however, I'm not sure how OBC would have changed things if released before meddle. It's weird to think that OBC should have been released beforehand, as it has more of the psychedelic feel like ASoS or AHM. Meddle seems almost out of place because it's harder rock feel with One of these days and Echoes. I think if meddle wasn't released then OBC would be looked at with greater regard but I think echoes completely overshadows it. It's too much of a powerhouse song for the pre-dark side era. 




 I think I just cried for you, the disappointment :( 




 I haven't delved into their discography yet, any recommendations? 




 Fizzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz 




 My friend just showed me this song the other, and I love it!!!

I knew I loved it when he said, "and don't fucking move" 

I love nothing more than a good use of the word, "fuck" in a passionate song
 




 and yet you don't even give me an upvote -.- 




 Is this real? I spot a couple footballers in Giggs and Cambiasso. Bertrand del is a bit of a stretch for a footballer, but come on laddie! I also spot a Ramos and Ruiz and oh fuck there's Rambo. AND THERES COSTA (CFC) 




 FUCK! I GUESSED SHMELLOW 




 I don't know how else to ask this, so I'm gonna be rather blunt, and excuse my french. But... what exactly is your favorite color?
 




 Quite frankly I think it's way too early to predict the longevity of this album... It's been out for a month. Sure it probably won't be one of the most influential albums ever or ever stand toe-to-toe with other PF classics, but I think pretty much every PF has a time and place for the most part. I think Obscured by Clouds is one of PF's most underrated albums by far, that doesn't mean it's not a timeless and important album in the PF story. I feel like this is a good ending to the historic career of PF, few words are needed and the music speaks for itself.


EDIT: this isn't meant to sound confrontational, I just think its a bit premature to predict what people will be listening to in 2049. Heaven knows I'll be old as shit blasting PF as the 'young thugs' play their beeps and boops 




 This song needs to be 35 minutes long! 




 :( b-b-b-but (pun intended) I'll be your substitute 




 This. This is what I meant to put. 




 I think I enjoy more than most people on this sub to be honest, I think this album has great moments on each 'side'.  It's what we do is great, sum and skins go so well together, I absolutely love anisina. I also love allons-y 1 through allons-y 2, and then I thought side 4 was really good top, perhaps the best (3 and 4 are tied) however I did find that it's more of a situational album for me than their other albums. I can usually only pop TER while doing hw or studying, but for those situations I think it's a great album. 




 If we play that kind of D all year, we can make some ripples in the big 12, make some things interesting and get a good bid for the tourney

 That comfortably numb solo has been known to impregnate woman who even just listen to the full thing (Snapple fact, I'm sure of it) 




 Really really, Blues really isn't a very familiar genre of mine, but I enjoy SVR 




 Poor David is always stuck with asshole frontmen :/ haha how about we give him someone nice for once? 




 * David Gilmour - Guitar/Vocals
* Roger Waters - bassist/Vocals
* Richard Wright - keyboardist
* Nick Mason - drums


No... no they would not get along, at least not all of them. 




 I can dig it, I haven't heard of him. Seems like a great suggestion thus far. Thanks! 




 A-ha! I love telling people how I go into rock (specifically classic rock). The short answer School of Rock... now hear me out. I was in like 7th grade at the time, probably younger when I first watched it to be honest. But the scene where "My Brain is Hanging Upsidedown" by the Ramones is playing and Jack Black did that montage with teaching all the kids about the history of rock and how to play. I don't know... as a young kid learning about music, I realized, "holy shit, there's a lot more complexity to music and influences than I realized." So I began with just a lot of classic rock for many and many years, now I branched out a great deal since then. But Pink Floyd is still the greatest band ever :P 




 Copper Gone by Sage Francis, underrated angry rapper that used to be a slam poet, this guy's lyricism is next to none. 




 Okay I have two questions that are pretty short, sweet and to the point. They are also unrelated so don't assume I'm gonna try to make any observations about these fellas.

* Can anyone recommend some really strong electrically driven blues music like Stevie Ray Vaughan? I've heard some other blues, but I don't really attack onto them like I do SVR's, I like guitar that just rips through songs.


* Also, I've only listened to Tom Waits very briefly and saw on here his Rain Dogs album mentioned. I'm listening to it and I'm about halfway through. What should I be listening for in particular. Usually when I listen to new stuff I have it on in the background and just listen to the music, and not necessarily the lyrics. But this seems like an album that I need to listen to the narrative that he generates. So should I give this album more attention, or is there another reason that people have recommended it? 




 Pink Floyd: Us and Them (as mentioned below), Gunner's Dream, Two Suns in the Sunset, Wearing the Inside Out, Shine on you Crazy Diamond, Dogs of War (not particularly fond of this song, but there's no denying the groovy saxiness at about the 4 min mark), Anisina (off The Endless River, one of my favorite tracks from that album)


CHECK DEEZ OUT HOMIE!


EDIT: Forgot Money  




 RES"ERECTION" 




 Nothing says I love jesus while raving with a girls ass grinding on my pork sword 




 * Roger Waters

* Sage Francis

* Thom Yorke 




 Most of the Pink Floyd albums would be adequate, but I'm gonna have to recommend Wish You Were Here 




 Which transitions into another phenomenal vocal moment by Roger, when he screams "this dream is driving me insaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaane" he screams insane for at least 15 seconds 




 Gunners Dream by Pink Floyd. When Roger Waters screams, "but hold on to the dreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeam!" And how seamlessly it transitions into a saxophone is incredible. 




 Gnarly opening and peaceful track to open up a gnarly album. I think this song is a good preface for TDB 




 This one is all too true 




 Ha, I haven't played him yet, what's it like?
 




 I've been playing a lot of ARAMs lately, and there have been champs that I get the option to level my ultimate with and debate whether it's worth it or not. Mainly champs with ults that allow for backdoor abilities such as TF or Panth. I'm sure there are plenty of others, so that's why I'm asking. What are some champs that you don't level up their ult at level 6? 




 I have fallen in love with this album over the course of this semester, I think this album is perfect for whenever I study or do homework. The only track that I'm not crazy about is Take It Back, and thats because I don't like the chorus that much. 




 Those are the two highlights for me as well, and then Fearless is the next best song IMO 




 I'm still delving into their live material, I'm eager to listen to Pulse, I've heard how good it was 




 Lost For Words 4:00-5:00. Not the best technical solo, but in the context of the song a very clean and appropriate solo, I love it.

Also /u/MaxCHEATER64 would you be interested in doing a similar thing for good vocal performances e.g. Great Gig In the Sky, Gunner's Dream 




 Come on over to /r/pinkfloyd bud, it's a really great band subreddit I found it out to be 




 One of the best songs in the PF catalog for me 
























 Knowing the value of a dollar. I'm by no means rich, or a trust fund baby. But my family has provided for me, I don't ask for too much to begin with. We live comfortably but I think I still take a lot for granted like education, food, and housing from the parental units.

 I've always personally thought that it would be Leonardo Da Vinci. He had himself immersed in so many different fields and abilities that he would have accomplished a lot. 




 Wots...uh the deal and mudmen are the best moments of the album for me 




 I've had the same exact thought, except with religions. Not too be too antagonizing, just a thought I've had 




 Tom Hanks 




 Concerts, not talking about the thrash metal ones where people are literally throwing themselves at each other on purpose (This is definitely seems harmful). I'm talking about any concert where there is standing room in the front and people just try to crowd to the front. The amount of dehydration that occurs in conjunction with any drugs/alcohol can make people faint and get trampled on. I'm sure this seems pretty harmful, but you'd be surprised.

 Charging me a ridiculous electric bill without having a worker check the meter. Estimates are bull shit. 




 My roommates and I usually run an electric bill of about $120. That's a lot for us, but ya'know being in college up all hours of the night + computers + appliances, it's not hard to believe we spend that much. However, this month, the electric company charged us $240, which truly surprised all of us. So basically, my roommate called up the power company, and after some circular logic and avoiding an answer. Our bill turned out to be a more reasonable $130. How can they over charge $110 without even caring? Should be a law or something in place?


EDIT: is it the style of the meter that's outdated or just the meter? Because our apartment complex is brand new.

 Anyone else experience having their rank reset in H2A? I was about a 12-13. Got reset back to 1 and I've been steadily playing since just to see if it was just bugged on my screen, but it isn't. Im back up to 6 and it was just out of the blue.

EDIT:  sorry computer users, I just want the good Ol days

EDIT 2: I didn't restart the game after the reset 




 Ahhhh, thanks for the clarification. Still awesome in it's own right. 




 Hmm I haven't given Piper it's credit. I've only listened to it a handful and never knew about the literary influences on it. Maybe I'll have to read the book and get back to the album. 




 After the discussion about Amused To Death the other day on here. It got me thinking about what the general fans in /r/pinkfloyd like to read. Because Amused To Death is a nod to [Neil Postman's Book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death) "Amusing Ourselves To Death" which talks about the books "1984" and "A Brave New World" and his conjecture about which is happening to society. Also Pink Floyd's Animals album is largely influenced by [Animal Farm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm) by George Orwell. So there are two distinct albums that are directly influenced by literature. So I'm assuming that since PF is intertwined with literature, so must their fan base. What are some of your guy's favorite books? 




 Listened to this album today actually! Great album, I think my least favorite is What God Wants Pt. 1. I get the full message of the song, I just think he kinda belabors the point, and the song becomes static. 




 I was in middle school when school of Rock came out. Jack Black tells the girl singer to go listen to this song to learn more and appreciate music. My first pink Floyd song I ever heard. The rest is history. 




 The Division Bell is my go-to studying album. Such an effortless album to listen through, I love it. 




 When? 




 Yep I was in a very similar situation, and I was angry too. But I took my menial existence as a freedom to do what I loved. Not freedom to say whatever the hell I want and make people feel like shit. Too much /r/atheism is about pointing out christians in society and getting a hard-on about how pathetic they are. That's not what I am or ever will be about. 




 /r/atheism, I personally would identify as an atheist, but I wouldn't identify as an arrogant ass hole 




 I love this song, gotta give this album another spin 




 I personally like it more than The Wall and Meddle. I like echoes more than anything on obscured by clouds. But I think OBC as a complete project is better than Meddle. 




 This song and mudmen are my favorite from the album. These two songs back to back are so gnarly 




 Some parts of AHMS can definitely compete with Echoes, I love the choir in harmony with Rick's playing. There are some parts I dislike with both songs, but Echoes is easily the more powerhouse song. Echoes's story is just flat out beautiful.

EDIT: I just listened to it again and holy hell... anyone else think 17:50 to 18:00 sounds similar to Echoes?

 Pink Floyd were one of the starters of Prog Rock, along with King Crimson.

 Newspapers and bookstores are in the same boat in my opinion. They'll still be around for years to come, but in decreasing physics copies as the digital age takes over.

 Uhhhhh? But you can? 




 No worries man haha 




 I see where you're coming from and I totally agree. I'm not the first to say this either but we live in a society where everyone gets a gold medal and no one finishes last. We don't have that American grit anymore. There's a difference between grit/toughness and rubbing people the wrong way. Unfortunately people get rubbed the wrong way and everyone has to take sensitivity classes. I've been harassed, not to the scale that many others have, but I've always just taken it on the chin, because they're just words. 




 I mean I'm not particularly offended by it, I just know that this would not be recreated in today's society, and figured it'd give an interesting/almost humorous look into history. It's obviously a caricature of what a stereotypical Japanese citizen/soldier would look like. And it calls them a "Jap" which is considered a racial slur. Again, I'm not personally offended, just explaining. 














 That's awesome! I never noticed that, I love how much detail the writers put into this show. It seems like I could learn something new from an episode each time I watch it. 




 I'm pretty sure that Eddie Van Halen's son, Wolfgang (I think that's his name), is the bassist for the band now. I know he used to be touring with his dad.

* Pink Floyd - Animals

* Radiohead - Kid A

* Eyedea   Abilities - By The Throat

* Red Hot Chili Peppers - Californication 

Sorry to nominate 2 pink Floyd albums but I couldn't pick one and I felt both are worth at least a nomination since this isn't the actual poll. 




 That's a shame, and I'm sorry to hear that. Luckily they haven't had that negative effect on me  




 I haven't run into those people, but that doesn't mean they don't exist. It makes sense though 




 Ok 




 I can see that, I'm one of the people that thought it was stoner wanna-be's that listened to them. Then I gave them a real look and realized that pink Floyd is beyond all that and I don't associate my fandom with drugs at all 
























 How do you feel about the current shit storm happening on /r/all?

 Really? I've never heard anything off TFC, and of all songs why that one? TFC isn't very radio friendly, but theres a couple I'd pick before that haha 




 Oh geez, absolutely this. Impossible to listen to a Spotify/Pandora Pink Floyd radio station for this reason. 




 Definitely fits, is seems like it's just Part IV? If I'm not mistaken, I sometimes blur the parts together. 




 It wasn't preceded or followed with anything else off DSotM. It just felt awkard, but I was pumped when I heard it because I thought Time was gonna follow directly after, but never did. What other songs by PF just seem out of place or awkward when played out of context of the album? 




 Annie Wants A Baby 




 Their new album, I love Coldplay but their new album doesn't do anything for me. 




 As a Huge Pink Floyd fan, I'll have to admit that I really don't care for Money. 




 Their new album kinda grinds my gears. Their first two were immaculate albums, even though I didn't really like Truce as a closer. However, with blurryface, its just mehhhh at most of the times. 




 Holy shit man, Eddie Vedder was made to sing that rendition! 




 5 years ago, probably Phobia by Breaking Benjamin. To be honest my music listening has grown so exponentially over the past 5 years that Breaking Benjamin is just my best guess.

Today, probably Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd. Just an immaculate album.

 




 If Taylor Swift can see it, we can all see it. 




 Google "Band member name poster" I didn't have any issues. 




 21 and WYWH

WYWH was my first favorite "song" by them, and then gradually I got into the album that made me love the band in the first place.

Anyone ever see Lord's of Dogtown? 




 That's awesome! Love hearing PF stories across generations. 




 On An Island! And Amused To Death by Roger Waters is monumental 




 Be a chick with a rack and post a picture of you hugging a cute pet 




 Feynman 




 I would be shocked by Stephen Colbert's death. I wouldn't be shocked by David Hasselhoff's. 




 Pink Floyd. Bands can be a product, and I will forever throw money at whatever they do. Even their solo acts. 




 Great Gig In The Sky by Pink Floyd... shittt that'd be so dramatic 














 The most recent being deflategate. Watergate was name because it was the name of the hotel! The scandal wasn't Watergategate! 




 Christopher Walken lives in a WYWH style 




 Relax, lesbian. 




 Took me until your comment 




 Debatably the best instrumental they ever produced. Debatable, yes, but I think it's my favorite. Even though any colour you like is a great track as well. 




 I'm still a History Teacher fan boy! Can't wait to see him on stage next week! 




 Is there any public outcry about removing Le Graet in France? I'd genuinely like to know. 




 What about referees?  




 But a horse that is allergic to needles, obviously 




 New skin is Aerodactyl. Ya' know, the POKEMANS. Not really with how it looks, but you get the gist. Still missing Zapdos and Moltres. Guess we won't get Moltres until Riot finishes that Lava map that has been thrown away for ever. And Zapdos, here's where it gets real. Maybe if Kennen electricutes a prehistoric Anivia and it kills her, making her go into eggnivia, it will hatch as a beautiful Zapdos.

TL;DR People still think dreamily of Pokemon first generation 




 Two sentences, disqualified. Top notch banter though lad 




 You would be maxcheater if ya didn't haha 




 Awesome! I'll pass the message along to his brother (the way I actually know Chad) and I remember that story about your club! That's awesome! Have a great day. 




 I'm honored to say that I know this glorious man irl, and I've never really devoted my allegiances to any team except for now. Go get 'em Chadders! 




 I thought it was funny how the story has been around for about half the day, and it wasn't posted anywhere on reddit 









 An absolutely beautiful moment from TFC, such a good narrative and story telling 




 Yay someone who holds the title as "first player dismissed by coach K" and refused to be a team player as he pissed and moaned every practice. Take that and all your preseason hype and wait for that shit to crash and burn. 




 Rick Wright was responsible for so much of the Pink Floyd sound. Keyboardists do count! 




 Underwear? Men's or women's? 




 A lot of people on this sub spell his name wrong, so by the misspelling on "More" it seems like they're the same people. It's okay bud, we don't blame ya. 




 I think around the 18 minute mark in AHM 




 I'm not really into Wiz anymore, but a lot of my friends are since I go to school about an hour from Pittsburgh and I have some friends from Pittsburgh. Pitt is where Wiz is from, and this is more of an older Wiz song that I could actually enjoy, I consider this a pretty good Wiz song, but anything he's put out on the past 5 years or so, I won't listen to. 




 Twenty one pilots!! 




 All the conspiracy theorists coming up with theories about how Osama Bin Laden did coordinate 9/11 and not the US government. 









 along with Where Is the Love by Black Eyed Peas 




 I think it's barely about roger at all 




 Yep thats the one I watched! 




 Okayyyyyyyy surprised the nads off of me 




 Thanks! This seems incredible, I'm gonna give it a listen the next chance I get. 




 And I thought it was very well done. Can you guys recommend any other pink Floyd documentaries? Preferably free ones I can access on YouTube or elsewhere. 




 *ADDED: Besides Gold of course, you rascals. And also would you take the trade the item for the gold? 




 just in time

 Yep! That's the song I recommend to people if they never heard of him 




 Badass enough to make women bystanders wet to their knees 




 Sooooo many Sage Francis lines could be posted in this thread, he's amazing 




 "Raped a pregnant bitch and told my friends we had a threesome" - Tyler, the Creator 




 "The virginity scarf" - twitch chat 2k15 




 One of the best PF instrumentals ever 




 Sage Francis, he used to be a slam poet and now is a killing it as a rapper with very angry lyrics. I recommend Slow Down Gandhi. 




 One of the best songs off the album  




 Currently my favorite track off Animals, used to be Dogs, but lately I've really enjoyed singing alongside Roger Waters as Rick so beautifully merges Rogers voice with synthesizers. Such a fun song. 




 Way to represent WVU, you fucko 




 What the fuck is hip hopera, people are just makin shit up anymore 




 You're right, I think while the Final Cut is unfavorable among most PF fans, I think it definitely has some great moments. Post-War Dream, Gunner's Dream, Southampton Dock, Final Cut, and Two Suns in the Sunset are my favorite from the album 




 * Atlantic City by Bruce Springsteen
* Old Man Time and Mr. Moon by O.A.R.
* Gunner's Dream by Pink Floyd
* Air Catcher by Twenty One Pilots
* Dead Sea by The Lumineers
* My Blood by Ellie Goulding
* Bankrupt on Selling by Modest Mouse
 




 That first guitar solo, I think it's around 3:45? Is my favorite solo off Animals 




 I've never listened to it while going to bed. I think that that's is most apt time 




 It's just never been my jam, David Gilmour was still learning how to make a cohesive Pink Floyd album without Roger. On The Turning Away is definitely the highlight off the album for me 




 No problem homie, echoes, fearless, and one of these days are the highlights for sure. I think on vinyl, echoes is the entire second half 




 All Pink Floyd albums except Ummagumma and A momentary lapse of reason 




 Echoes is a song off Meddle :p sorry I couldn't help myself, I'm on /r/pinkfloyd almost daily  




 Echoes is a song off of Meddle 




 Echoes is a song off of Meddle

 Nat Geo Wild is amazing, I wish they would do a full week of animal fight night! You guys need to check that show out, they don't skimp out on blood or anything and show animals and their battles in the wild. Sorry I comma splice and run-on. 




 I mean I like playing League with my friends more than I do solo, but it's not my passion. 




 Still enough money in the sport to be an alternative to anything else where the rewards are immediate 




 Not necessarily, I don't even know how you'd even begin to measure that.  Benoit Assou Ekotto is a professional footballer (soccer player; just for clairification) that doesn't like playing at all. He once showed up to the stadium on game day and asked his coach who they were playing! [Playing for the money excerpt](http://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/may/01/benoit-assou-ekotto-tottenham-hotspur) 




 Damn, I'm living around ATL and I totally missed out. Love listening to some of their morning show stuff on my way to work. 




 You're right, 6 months was more a less arbitrary time I picked to denote that the present sucks. I'm not even a fan of the animals, I'd actually be happy if I didn't have to see them. It's just better than all this drama and misused power 




 /r/retiredgifs  




 God damn I just want the reddit of 6 months ago!! The reddit where I didn't have to see Ellen pap everywhere, or news of how Bernie sanders now manages to have 7 voters instead of 6! I want a reddit where the most infuriating thing I saw on it was an overflow of cute animal pics on the front page. Oh how reddit is pulling out all the stops to fuck themselves over. I feel like /r/pinkfloyd needs a contingency plan for when everything goes tits up. Because this is a really good niche community and it'd be a shame if we lost it. 




 lol nerds dont get hip lingo 




 Instead he kept it exclusively for his own women and people! 




 yeah but who wants to link their facebook? 




 Idk, but I found that to be a major pain in the ass as well. My buddy just got back into League, hes level 23, and we couldn't duo bot at first because he didn't really own an support champs. Until he bought cheap Alistar 




 Ahh I see, it's more or less an interpretation of policies/models that favor or facilitate the more wealthy? That's a general observation, but your definition was good, and makes me look at it in a different light. Thanks. 




 Nien needs to work on those high fives, holy hell 




 POUNDS SCHILLINGS AND PENCE! Perfect Sense is one of the highlights from an already amazing album 




 Can you point me to any papers or readings on supply-side economics and this so-called trickle down economics. I have a very brief knowledge of these ideas and you know your shit. So any recommendations of yours would be appreciated. 




 Short team, because everyone is saying tall, and i'm rooting for the little lads. Although that small of a goalie would be like watching women's world cup 




 Unless there's a point to be made, I'm always interested in learning something new about PF 




 Speak for yourself, you're the one walking along the roadside 




 Pretty much any song by Pearl Jam, and English is my native tongue 




 For me, this song has the 2nd best guitar solo in the whole album, behind Comfortably Numb of course. It can be debated obviously, but I love it. 




 Animals is the beginnings of prog rock, i dont see much if any psychedelics in it, maybe if you could reference a moment that'd be great. And The Wall is in a genre of its own in my opinion. 




 They have like 2/15 albums that could be considered psychedelic idk what he was talking about 




 Psychedelic? Maybe early on, I'd be hard pressed to call OBC, Animals,  DSotM, WYWH, Meddle, AHM, TFC, The Wall, TDB, and TER psychedelic  




 Endless River - Pink Floyd 




 Downvoted after reading #1, take this blatant childishness elsewhere. Not saying there's anything wrong with smoking, but what the hell is this post? 














 Yeah I know exactly what you mean. I get the same feeling too. I think it's getting more attention than it deserves in some respects too. 




 I mean they aren't banning it per se. Just not hanging it in front of the capitol building, which I think is the right call. If some redneck wants to put it on the back of his lifted F-150, so be it. I don't believe in censorship in most cases, and I don't see this as censorship. 




 No reason to believe. This leads me to Occam's Razor. The simplest solution is usually the correct solution. There's nothing I experience day-to-day that leads me to believe that one exists. 




 I understand why people make the argument to keep it. But the current fact is that the confederate flag was a flag of another country. It's like states still hanging the union jack flag. (This point was made by Glenn Beck and I think this is a good analogy) In the flag's current state, for me at least, it holds the connotation of racism, but that could be my misinterpretation. 




 It was on the sidebar of the video. I also saw in another thread that she had a history of manic behavior and was found with 4 different drugs in her system. 














 It freaked me out but then I watched the video explaining what someone thought really happened and it no longer seemed to give me the chills. 




 These are some of the moments that get all of your guys' adrenaline pumping and ready to take on the world. I have no idea what I would have done. Any of you have weapons? 




 What a bunch of idiots 




 That's also very surprising. If the young people of reddit didn't know any better, they'd think Bernie is the front runner. From what I've seen though, it seems like a lot of redditors are helping people wise up to Bernie. 




 Well when there's so many GOP candidates, it's no surprise really. How many voters actually know what half of the candidates stand for? 




 What? It seems like the article is taking the opportunity to turn this tragedy into a political attack.  The overblown title is attention grabbing and biased as well. Fuckin NYT. 




 I apologize, you didn't deserve that response brother. Just the inner Libertarian in me having to read the insatiable bone cone for Bernie Sanders news on reddit gets on my nerves. All your points are fair points and aren't that far fetched at all. Take it easy. 




 Delusional person  that /u/titsalmighty just mentioned

 I like this one even more! I've experienced this multiple times, awesome! 




 Hmm. I've read Lord of the Flies and it didn't seem to have the same profound effect on me that others experience. 




 Very good points. There's a lot of get rich quick or dieting or business books that are meant as cash cows. I've never read Dune, always seemed very daunting.

 My buddy was super smart and had a bunch of honors society medals. So I took them after he walked and wore them. I also had a soccer medal I won in 5th grade and a wrestling medal I got when I was 7. I also managed to get a cord from the Baseball team because they made their own.

EDIT: I forgot to mention that my picture was in the newspaper with all the medals on 




 How has it changed your day-to-day philosophy or lifestyle? What were you like before you read it? 




 Yeah but the moon is so slow that I thought maybe the oxygen bar would be worth it at this point. But you're right :'( 




 Their first two albums are more rock/grunge material. Not sure if you've heard those albums or not. 




 I don't agree with older Muse, but nothing off their 3 most recent albums is all that great. What stuff of theirs have you heard? 




 Don't go for The Wall, if Dark Side isn't your cup of tea, don't go to that album. I'm a huge fan of PF and I think that album isn't very accessible. The Division Bell is very listenable to as a casual fan. 




 Sufjan Stevens 




 Jealousy 




 Someone please take this thread down. No good discussion is going to come from it. Just incessant blabbering that people have heard a million times and are desensitizing the issue. I'm not saying we shouldn't talk about it, just this isn't the right forum. 




 I reset then bought the Oxygen bar upgrade and now I'm left with 330 million investors approx. and I've experience that it actually just set me back. FUCK

 Two of the most impressive vocal PF performances of all time on one song. Roger's voice synthesizing with the saxophone seamlessly, and then the mind-blowing scream. Best song on TFC. 




 Sounds like you're using the voting system correctly 




 Admittedly I have plenty more that I haven't been able to listen to yet like Jaime xx among others. 

So far:

* Joywave - How Do You Feel Now?
* Twentyone Pilots - Blurryface -- probably my fan boy in me talking
* Noel Gallagher - Chasing Yesterday
* Brandon Flowers - The Desired Effect
* Lone Bellow - Then Came The Morning
* Houndmouth - Little Neon Limelight
* The Magic Whip - Blur
* Modest Mouse - Strangers To Ourselves

There may be others that I'm missing. What's your list look like? 




 I'll do the same if Mata scores against us 




 One of the few things I distinctly remember from the book. I had to read it for a critical analysis in HS, and was like WTF did i just read?  




 Spotify does have it's own radio feature akin to Pandora, albeit not as diverse, in my opinion. However, every Tuesday Spotify has most of the albums that are released available to listen to. And you can search through all the new releases and play an album to see if it's something you like. Also when you search a band, there are generally 5 artists on the side bar that are "recommended".


And if you don't like the radio stations. Spotify has entire playlists too that you can listen to. For instance, instead of an alternative rock station like Pandora, you can listen to a playlist instead. In the playlist you can see all the songs included and play them when you want.

Also it's so much easier on spotify to keep track of all the songs you've favorited and add them to playlists to revisit later


Sometimes I ramble and don't get my point across, let me know if I confused ya at all. 




 Our split into a separate faction on the pink Floyd subreddit has been initialized. 




 I don't think I voted for part 3, but I definitely would have before part 2 if that's of any condolence. 









 I was one of the five! *high fives the other four newly crowned best friends of mine* 




 Thanks for the advice with gadgets, also luckily I'm still young enough and in school so I'm still on my parents health insurance which is great. 




 Hmmm... This is very interesting, anywhere I can go to learn more? I don't want to go balls deep into something that I'm extremely nave to. Especially since I'd more than likely have to provide financial information to invest. 




 I would like recommendations with gadgets, modifications to cars, or anything that can pretty much improve my quality of life without costing all that much. Preferably nothing more expensive than $100 or $200. 




 How can you even tell what's not modified by effects? Like is that shit on her head actually there??? No fuckin clue m8 




 Haha best response! 




 Comfortably Numb by Pink Floyd

Or

Danger Zone by Kenny Loggins 




 I appreciate it man 




 Yes this is perfect! Thanks so much! Can you link the thread too? 
 




 I've searched this subreddit but unfortunately could not find it, so this is the only reason I'm making a post like this on here. So sorry if this isn't the most appropriate way to approach this, but I could really use the help.


There was this craft/project done by a fellow redditor that did some type of wood burning onto a blank piece of wood that was the cover of Animals. It was amazing and I was going to have my girlfriend do one for me, but I couldn't find the post. The original post included links to a DIY website as well. 

Thanks to anyone that is album to help me! 




 Russell Crowe baby 




 Coincidentally listened to this today! One of the best songs on the album! 




 And then there are the days that get no comments. I got you track 8, nothin constructive however. 




 We are all witnesses, and I have no idea what I just fuckin witnessed. Holy shit, and then that Shumpert 3, talk about setting the tone.  
























 Top notch post 




 I'm on my phone so maybe I can reference an article later. Essentially, I think Mexico should do something to make their country a more attractive place to live. I also think they benefit from the drug trade as evidenced by helping that drug lord escape. I appreciate your honesty. 




 Yeah I learned about it a bit in my one quantum physics class, we talked about harnessing solar energy. We're just really bad at keeping it and storing it efficiently. The transistors that we use need to be more advanced. Elon Musk is the great innovator of our time. 




 Yeah we need to get off fossil fuels for sure. Pollution like in Beijing is abhorrent. Fossil fuels are nonrenewable. Actually here's one of my favorite facts. The sun creates more energy in one second than mankind has ever used. Just imagine if we could harness that. It'd be amazing. 




 Good. Oil is more efficient and has higher energy density right now. Allow the free market to invent green power, keep the Feds out of it. 




 I might listen to that podcast or read some ridley articles because I'm honesty a neophyte in debating this. Essentially, I believe the climate is changing, I just don't think we know to what extent it's changing. 




 I was just thinking how Obama gave $500m to Solyndra 




 There's phony/deceptive science on both sides. I think the difference here is that the green Movement is state supported, and we live in a generation of activists. 




 CO2 also promotes plant growth, since it is their food.  




 There's nothing glaring really. There's just a lot of money and incentives for scientists to prove their points right. Ridley talks about this one graph (forgive me for forgetting the minutia)  that was influential in climate science. In this graph there was a set of points that were in the graph inappropriately to skew the way people interpreted. They did it knowingly. Ridley found this out and removed the false data and it wasn't as scary as once made to believe. 




 Aright I'm doing this from my phone so bear with me though typos and formatting.

First off, I don't think using Wikipedia as your main source of argument isn't that damning, but I entertained it. Wiki says, "usually by not slowing police or municipal employees to inquire about an individual's immigration status." That's fine, I understand why they wouldn't. 

However, the article referenced in [Ref 1](sfgate.com/bayarea/article/newsom-says-s-f-won-t-help-with-raids-mayor-2600450.php) says Mayor pledges to discourage Feds' immigration sweeps. Essentially, he will do nothing to stop illegals from wanting to come to his city. They are illegal immigrants and actively defying US law by residing here without proper citizenship.

In my eyes when you defend sanctuary cities like this, you are endorsing illegal immigration.

You can begin to cut murder/violent crime rates by removing illegals. Having illegals certainly won't increase the crime rate! It's a crime to even be here. If you think illegals keep the crime rate down because of all the vigilante-like crime reporting they're doing then I'd love to see that source.

You can also argue they want a better life and I empathize with them on that. I think US needs to do something about it with out Mexico relations. Shame on them for turning a blind eye and complete unwillingness to help out their own citizens. The Mexican government is smuggling their drug lords out of jail and refusing to extradite them to America where they can be convicted and proven guilty without a doubt.

In SF, it is a get out of jail free card. It just is. It's not even about inquiring about every single Latino person, it's that they are actively inviting laws to be broken. 

I have nothing against Latinos. I have a problem with breaking US laws whether you be white, black, yellow, green, or any other sort of color.

Deportations have dropped by 35% in SF in the past 3 years and in the USA alone it has been the lowest number in over 40 years. 




 Here's how I feel about the whole climate debate. Matt Ridley actually has a lot of views I like. He's more of a climate lukewarmer. I think humans are affecting the environment negatively, however, I think politicians and powerful people are exaggerating the immediate effects of it. 

Matt Ridley has studied this extensively and has called bullshit on a lot of popular things that climatologists point to as "evidence". I recommend listening to the podcast EconTalk that features him. 




 Common practice for most large cities? Not true. They don't turn you over to immigration in San Francisco. That illegal immigrant that killed that American was arrested twice and released from jail in America. In what world do you live in that you want people illegally invading our country? Liberals preach about the wage gap yet support illegal immigration. It just fuels their arguments and it's bull shit. 




 I wouldn't be shocked if he didn't. John is a weird dude. I think he said when working on Stadium Arcadium he used to listen to 36 chambers by Wu Tang Clan everyday ha 




 So you honestly believe Mexico is doing anything to deter their citizens from leaving? 




 Where is Obama when the sanctuary city issues comes up?  




 Thanks, I'll remember to call Bruce by his proper pronoun next time he comes up in conversation. 




 I couldn't agree with you anymore. 




 It wasn't a typo. 




 True that homie! Life's too short to be anything but happy. Keep riding Spaceship Earth. 




 I'm a huge sports fan as well. No way I'm watching.  




 It's embarrassing that he is winning that ESPY award for bravery. 




 Yeah, no other way I'm gonna be making a million bucks a year

 Hmm. No questions about extinguishing the Jedi. I'm calling bull.

 Thank you for being the voice of reason to all the liberals circle-jerking to conservative bashing.

 Wait for government handouts. 




 RIP Whitney 




 I got Rand Paul, but I'm also a big supporter of his. I think it's decent but shouldn't be used as your definitive response. Lucky for you though, because you have over a year to make an informed decision. Since the primaries haven't begun yet, you're in good shape. Listen to debates as they happen, find positives and negatives about each candidate before you decide. Don't judge the candidates based on their media perspective. Judge them primarily by their actions. Words are usually empty promises. See what they have actually done or tried as a judge of their character. 




 Yeah that's kinda what it is. Basically faking attacks to give you reason to enter war. So it can be tied in with the Military-Industrial Complex

So. My point is. I don't believe in 9/11 conspiracies but that could be viewed as a false flag operation. Basically, we planned the attacks to invade the middle east for oil and $$$. So the people in power were positively effected by this, people could argue. 




 That heaven exists. 




 Huh? I realize it's only a theory... but hop off a cliff, tell me how that works out for ya 




 /r/politics 




 Petered out. Nice. 




 Myself 




 My biggest recommendation is not to get your recommendation from Reddit on a particular candidate. That's not going to help you. Voting history helps and I would also see if they have their platform on their website. This site also works too, (www.isidewith.com), however, I don't know if it gives more options for one party than the other. 




 "Only My Couch Pulls Out" -- We came in 2nd at the Tilted Kilt 




 False Flag Operations? 




 You're right. Not about the right-wing blogger stuff. But I'm not gonna try to keep it going for the sake of the argument when I see your point. Deal 1 is done, onto the next one.

Did the release the specifics of the deal yet? I couldn't find any hard numbers on it. 




 I just want the administration to address the issue in some sense. 




 I would never be a part of occupy Wall Street. I believe in the free market way too much. Why won't Obama or Kerry even acknowledge the hostages? Why won't they assure the Americans that they are even attempting to bring them home? And this deal is being overblown by liberals when it does nothing to prevent Iran from attempting nukes in the future. 




 I'm as upset as you, I can't believe it wasn't even on the table. 




 This is sickening. I can't believe you would actually think that the hostages shouldn't be a part of the deal. They are AMERICANS! How can that not mean anything to you? You can say that these talks are just about nukes, but holy hell, I'll be damned if you ever hear about these hostages for a while. They are AMERICANS being held against their will without committing any crimes as far as I know. This is unjust and I can't believe this isn't even a topic of discussion. Since when does America back down from protecting its citizens? Since when does America not ensure to its people that they won't be prosecuted without reason? Unbelievable, this a joke.


EDIT: Being downvoted for caring about the American people. Suits reddit. Over zealous it may be, but damn, I just want to hear anything from this administration. 




 Eh different guitarists will do that to ya 




 Hmm I wonder if this opens the opportunity for me to start one. Except I have no idea how to run a subreddit or spread the word. 




 They like to crawl into different crevices to get out of the heat as far a I know. They used to come into my house by the AC unit. Since you're not at home I would just continuously throw them out of your car I suppose without killing them. But if you get them in your house, I always would flush them down the toilet. 




 Just another move by the New York Slimes 




 I want to have honest discussion with other redditors without fear of being downvoted into oblivion or condescended to. Also void of any half-witted jokes or memes. 




 I think he nailed it out of the park and left no stone unturned. I think, as a reader, it's really satisfying when an author does that. 




 I loved it. I'm an aero major w/ a minor in physics. So my opinion may be skewed since I have a stronger physics background than most of the general population. I thought it was goo background and introduction to people who aren't that familiar with theoretical physics. To be completely honest, If you're interested in that sort of stuff I wouldn't start with this book. There are hundreds and hundreds of videos that will bring you up to speed quicker, and then you may wanna revisit this. 




 American Gods is a good read, I read it 4 years ago, and want to revisit it when I can. I love mythology though, so that helped. 




 **Taking A Stand, Rand Paul**
 




 Great book. I loved all the modern day mythology in it. Sort of, what would todays gods look like? 




 If there is any republican that I think democrats would respect, it's Rand. However, I don't know how you feel about him. Clinton is way too much of an untrustworthy politician. 




 I'm not saying who I think will win or anything like that. Just wondering who you guys would support.

Would you still vote? Would you vote for whomever gets the democratic nomination? Maybe vote for an independent or a moderate republican? 




 I had to do an english paper on it years ago. I saw it at a bookstore asked my teacher if I could do it, he said yeah. I never heard of the book before, but thought I'd give it a try. Glad I did. 




 Thats the kind of company I want to work for hah 




 Yeah I have a fear of commitment anyway 




 And We Won't GET FOOOOOOOLED AGAIN, since no one else recognized your reference. 




 I support gay marriage and I'm against the ruling. So many liberals look past a major reason for conservative arguments. It gives the federal government more centralized power and chips away at the first amendment for the sake of marriage, which shouldn't be run by the government in the first place. So please take all your easy upvotes from slacktivists on reddit, we all appreciate it. There are dozens of us! Dozens!

 Hmm fucking a giant catfish is on your checklist? To each their own.

 Forget the immense length of The Wall, and no songs had to be taken out in order to have a longer CN. Would you still keep it the same? 




 Yeah I said to my friend once that I wish the solo was longer since I could hear the fade out. He's like dude, go listen to the Pulse version NOW 




 My question can be simplified. Would you rather have Comfortably Numb from The Wall to have that really long emotional solo that features in Pulse or not? I've been listening to the Pulse version a lot lately and wonder how it would sound on The Wall, you could also argue that hearing the long solo version live for the first time was so much more impactful. I don't know. What're your guy's thoughts? 









 Then you're doing it wrong 




 I think this is a simple solution, so I will keep it brief. A lot of people have issues with Riot's transparency or unwillingness to keep us updated on promises made long ago. What if each developer team would produce a weekly update/blurb about what they were working on and how it was going. It wouldn't have to be much. For instance, while working on the death recap (Finally btw) have the team say, ran into issue X, Y, or Z still figuring it out or something. I'm not sure, I just feel like if the community had updates, they wouldn't feel so left out at times. 




 But I loved getting Thresh souls from WAY DOWNTOWN! 




 He should vote for me too! I've never been in national news ever! 




 I realize they are one in the same, but why the sudden change in language? And ISOL doesn't sound as threatening and we're still fear mongerers, no? 




 Whoops! You're right! Haha, I'm keeping it. 




 And what's mine is yours and yours is mine absolutely unmotivates me. 




 I'm a constitutional libertarian and still in college so I don't fall in the old conservative stigmatism. And I can honestly say that reddit being liberal by majority (not sure if that's true; vocal minority effect) is really annoying to me. I'm friends with liberals without much issues, but the anonymity of the Internet gives these people a megaphone and a rooftop. I'm not trying to call everyone out, but it's just the way I perceive it. I'm also a spiteful person so I'm looking forward to all the Bernie Sanders supporters to have their hearts broken at their delusional expectations. However, there are many Sanders supporters with reasonable expectations and are hopeful in a rational way. But when I see everyone vote brigading every time he takes a shit, it's really annoying. I also find solace in knowing that if he's labeled a Socialist (which he is) not many conservatives will vote for him.


Sorry about this bitter post and it felt good to get it off my chest honestly. If anyone is willing to have a normal peaceful conversation/debate that's fine by me. 




 Apes because massively stronger than humans while still being able to use tools  
























 Bite my shiny metal ass 




 I'm a conservative. 




 Oooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Babe! 




 Haha I actually don't retain in books as much as I wish I would. But I think I may do Neverwhere then Cat's Cradle or Sirens of Titan and then Anansi Boys. Awesome. 




 At least it can fit into tight corners that a regular pitchfork cant! 




 Awesome, I thought American Gods was awesome. I vaguely remember Anansi, I think he was the spider guy? I would probably sparknote the book real quick before I read it. 




 I've read American Gods and Graveyard book, but that was 3-4 years ago. I'm looking forward to these books! 




 Alright thanks! I think I'm gonna read Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman, then Cat's Cradle next 




 pitches a fork 




 Shaq is such a likable dude, I listen to his podcast every week. Says he's an entertainer and will never turn kids down for a picture in public. He's hilarious and a great entertainer 




 Yeah I mean it wasn't an excruciating read, only a couple days. But yeah you're right it basically was 150 pages. Maybe I just need to get more used to his style/prose so I can appreciate it more 




 I don't know how long it's been since you read BoC, but is the main character Vonnegut and the real life things he mentions, actually in his life? 




 Thanks! My buddy has Sirens of Titan, so he is gonna lend it out to me when school starts back up! 




 Interesting. Thanks, I'll probably do that in the order you said, does he keep a lot of recurring characters? 




 My friend also recommended Siren of Titan, how does that compare? 




 So I understood all the America satire that Vonnegut was using, but am I wrong to think that it was really long-winded? After reading the 300 page book, I couldn't help but think that it could have been 150 pages. I want to read more Vonnegut, but I don't know if it's going to be more of the same or not. I read a brief description of Cat's Cradle and Slaughterhouse-five and they both sounded like American Satires, PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG.


I would like to know if I should keep on going, or maybe I missed something completely with the book that went over my head. 




 Awesome, yeah that's the extent I know of it haha. Cheers. 




 I really liked the Sonmi-451 story a lot. I love futuristic, sci-fi like that. I liked Sonmi, and I thought Timothy Cavendish's story was hilarious. 




 The Old Man and the Sea had me hooked, fairly short book that I couldn't put down and finished it the same day I started it. 




 Did you like Cat's Cradle? I haven't read it, but only hear positives about it. I just finished Breakfast of Champions today, it's an easy read, took me about 3-4 days to read. Lots of American satire, as usual.  




 Ah! Just the thread I was looking for, I was about to make a separate post. Okay, so I just started reading Neverwhere, what a coincidence. It says that it has similarities to Alice In Wonderland. How pivotal is that to the enjoyment of the story? Because I have never read/watched Alice In Wonderland. I've read Graveyard Book by Neil, even though I never read Jungle Book. Will there be any issues? 




 I saw the guy that runs SETI speak when he came to WVU, I'm stoked! 




 Wow, it seems like yesterday it came out. I like that comment about backing vocalist haha. Actually, in some respects, John has a better voice than Anthony. 




 I think that album has some of John Frusciante's best work, including some of his solo stuff. He's one of the guitarists that is just so in-tune with their sound that you can't separate them. 




 I always love that during Gilmour's solos when he doesn't play a lot of notes I succession, but he has them long and strung out. Most notably in Time and the 2nd solo in Comfortably Numb. He also does it in echoes. I love guitar solos in that fashion, also explains why Wet Sand by RHCP is one of my favorite songs ever. 




 I love it! I feel like more people are against it than like it. There are a few shitty lyrics like "let's go do it" and the parts that sound like that. But the rest is catchy and fun to sing to. The chorus gets stuck in my head like a bug.

Also, I guess this "technically" the first post-Floyd solo album. Obviously the argument could be made and roger and yada yada yada. But it's just a thought. 




 THERE AREN'T OVER 50 PRESIDENTS, PLS 




 Damn shame, Nien has been playing so well in recent weeks after every getting dumpstered in the first few weeks. Shame he made that mistake after a great game. 




 Is that the Haunted Tarmac of Queztocl? It's said that over 100 people have gone onto that tarmac only to be never seen again. Wonder why these spuds managed to live. 




 fair enough, agree to disagree
 




 I don't have to believe wikipedia if I don't want to. Don't be a dick. 




 Is this a real show? That joke blew 




 I sang so hard that it killed my baby... fiction 




 Heaven forbid, I want to fraternize somewhere on reddit, when liberals make up a majority of the community. LOL 




 So 6:30 PM WEST, which translates to 1:30PM East Coast USA, I believe I'm -5 from GMT, but honestly I have no idea if Europe does any Daylight Savings Time 




 time zone? 




 When is the final, and do you know if its streamed? 




 Hmm. I could see why it could be considered one of the most underrated albums. A lot of this consensus on this sub is that Obscured by Clouds is one of the most underrated albums, but that depends on the person. I actually don't listen to this album as much as should, I like all the songs, except I don't really listen to Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast. 




 I'm just bustin your balls buddy 




 Devastating to hear this. Heart goes out to the families and community. 




 This is like the most famous video of lava underwater for some reason. I swear I've seen this shit in like Bill Nye The Science Guy and everywhere since 




 I know right. It's like, "thanks for showing me a subreddit where I won't be harassed." DOWNVOTE HIM FOR BEING APPRECIATIVE AND RUNNING! 




 YOU'RE ONLY POSTING THIS BECAUSE IT WAS ON COMEDY CENTRAL TODAY, AND YOU THOUGHT HEY CAITLYN JENNER FREE LINK KARMA. YOU GOT GOTTED 




 That's not a real thing 




 I'll get right on that 




 Okay, sorry about that, I must've missed that. Thanks for doing that. Appreciate it. 




 Comfortably Numb (Live) - Pink Floyd from their live album Pulse 




 Cheers 




 Also can there be a bit of a heads up? Meaning, "Here's our book club discussion calendar" so that I have time to read and then discuss. So it's not like hey we're talkin about this book, hopefully you've already read it. 




 I'm a conservative as well, is there anywhere we can go to talk about the issues in a different sub? 




 lol what is this? 




 I know the war obviously, dickshit. If I know the year the whitehouse was burnt down, I obviously know the war. You're a jackass 




 USA! USA!

EDIT: Lol Reddit hates America, who would have ever guessed that? Damn commies 




 I stay listening to Pink Floyd
 




 Those Corki rockets in game 2 looked like they were shot by Michael J. Fox 




 Not just in Europe, pretty much everywhere in the world, brochacho 




 Yeah if you wanna look like an ass hat. 




 That awkward moment when it was burnt down in 1814, and not 1812... 




 Fat Stanley 




 Because I'm passionate, I rarely post, I usually just leave the thread before posting. 




 I may be mistaken, but I think his dad was pretty radical too. I also wonder if foreign radicals have any influence in America 




 Just want to bring more attention since I see that it hasn't hit front page since it happened.

"Your dick!" - Charlie 




 Very true my friend, can't win on either side haha but it motivates me to strengthen my arguments and convictions  




 Yep, its tough for me, as a constitutional conservative, I bravely post on /r/politics or /r/news every once in awhile and get shredded. 









 I live in Georgia. Lived in Pennsylvania for my first 18 years and go to school in West Virginia. 




 No worries man 




 Fuuuuuuck that's awesome 




 I'm sorry, I don't know the Rand Paul thing with Rage Against The Machine. What happened?

EDIT: Unless you're talking about Paul Ryan...  




 I've seen lots inside. Hell, me and my roommates had one in our apartment last year. 




 Keep it up. Don't let people give you shit for an American flag. 




 Haha that's an awesome slogan for a leather jacket, I approve! 




 Are you a girl or a boy? 




 DISCLAIMER: THIS ISN'T A POST TO DISCUSS WHETHER YOU LIKE HIM OR NOT. OR WHETHER PF WOULD APPROVE OF HIM. THIS ISN'T THE APPROPRIATE SUBREDDIT FOR THAT. THIS IS JUST TO SHARE A PF QUOTE FROM HIS BOOK.

That being said. As I was reading through Rand Paul's book, "Taking A Stand" he referenced Pink Floyd and I thought it might be cool to share with you guys.

 Pink Floyd understood that genius needs to be left alone. Whether your ideas are politically correct or not, whether you're a painter or self-proclaimed prophet, the exhortation is to shine, to not let conformity dim your light: "Shine on, you crazy diamond."

 




 well my two degrees are very intertwined so it's not as bad as it seems. It would be bad if I were aerospace and civil engineering for instance. 




 We're lifting off severe sanctions on them that equate to around $800 billion, I believe. It opens them to more trade. We're also allowing them to develop nuclear weapons because our restrictions on that are basically nonexistent. 




 Dual major student currently studying aerospace and mechanical engineering, however, my internship is with industrial engineers 




 Cloud Atlas 




 Hershey, PA 
Didn't invent chocolate but we sell a shit ton of it 

EDIT: I could give ya guys a couple more facts about Hershey that you didn't know about if anyone's interested haha 




 I can't connect to the wifi at work since its a private network. I do download podcasts for offline listening, that's how I do it all. I also have a spotify subscription but I don't always remember or have time to download songs offline. Cheers mate 




 I don't want to go over my data limit but I like discovering new music over the work day, I haven't received the 75% message yet and my billing cycle ends the 26th. 




 I'll try to give you the conservative view point since lots and lots of other redditors will give you their view in a flash. It really should be a non-partisan issue but I assume it comes with one party taking credit for the deal rather than the other. Anyway, from my view, this deal does nothing to perturb Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon. They closed down thousands of centrifuges, but they still have 5000 running. It took Pakistan 3000 to develop a bomb. Iran has also funded terrorism in the region. Just early in the week they were burning American flags and saying death to America. The equivalent of lifting their trade restrictions is like a country giving the US $8 Trillion. They also have four american hostages, 1 of whine we know has been tortured. He was running an underground Christian church.


They are radicals and I don't think I see many benefits from this deal.

EDIT: Their places can only be inspected if given 14 days notice. It can also only be inspected by Iran's allies or something similar (I'm blanking, sorry). So US inspectors aren't allowed in. 




 Trying to push out a squeaky fart 




 This is kinda sorta heart breaking 




 I can't see my forehead 




 I want a subreddit where I can discuss various topics with people I a civil manner. Like legitimate discussions with out radicals on either side of the issue down voting everything 




 Hershey PA now living in Georgia 




 Gladiator fights 




 Made me chuckle a lot 




 Excuse me while I go cry 




 Yes, there's actually ways, at least in 4th gen to increase your odds of finding a shiny. A buddy of mine had around 40 shinies, all gained legitimately with the pokeradar and other tactics. 




 Halo series... well 1 through 3. 




 I've seen BWP, I thought it was pretty freaky, and the real footage definitely had an adverse effect. This may actually be one of the freakiest movies I've seen. 




 I love true stories because of how personal they feel. I've heard about Mothman before, out in San Francisco if I'm not mistaken. Any recent develops, wasn't it around the 80's?
 




 I learn about new subs everyday, cheers mate. 




 How do you feel about them? I feel like my expectations for cinematics/production may not really scare me. But as far as movie goes are they top notch?
