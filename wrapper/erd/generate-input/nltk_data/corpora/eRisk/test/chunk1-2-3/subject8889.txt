 origin story

you were born to be a super hero 




 "fear of shitting in public places"

So I can safely assume you're a guy? 




 I have observed many love triangles among my birds throughout the years, involving yelling at each other and fighting over the shared object of affection, but one triangle in particular was especially interesting.

Two male Parakeets (budgies), Jupiter and Misty, were romantically involved with a female parakeet, Aqua, and had also occasionally been romantically involved with each other.  This was an interesting bisexual love triangle, where one day you'd see Aqua (the female) with one of the boys, another day with the other, and another day the boys would be on each other; and the next day they'd be physically fighting over her.

It was crazy and intensely dramatic. 




 People who have multiple pets, breed animals, have farms, etc.  What is the most interesting relationship you've observed your pets/animals getting into? 




 The pen with which he'd sealed his fate; signing away his freedom, and effectively, his sanity.  He had, in his frustration, clicked it three times in quick succession, summoning this eerie visitor in the night. 
 




 I made it to my desk, only to find my computer already logged in, and my emails already answered.  No one else could have done this.  The only explanation was that I'd already been there.  I went to the bathroom, only to find that I no longer felt like I had to go.  I exited the stall just in time to see my back exiting the door.  I rushed out of the bathroom, only to find the figure had been lost in the large office hustle and bustle.  Thoroughly disturbed, I made my way back to my desk.  My coffee had already been drunk, and my report already written, with exactly what I was going to say.  I saw the me-like figure again out of the corner of my eye, a quick flash in the commotion, heading for the door to the stairwell.  I booked it for the door and took the steps two at a time.  Arriving in the parking garage, I heard a car door slam and an engine roar.  I ducked behind a black sedan just in time to see myself, driving my car out into the street, shadows flickering around it with static interference.  I began to suspect that I was seeing myself a few hours into the future; living two timelines simultaneously. 




 I lived with my ex for 2 and a half years.  We got officially engaged in the middle of that.  (To put it short and simply, I left because he stopped appreciating me and it seemed like I was the only one trying to make things work, and I gradually became more of a maid than an girlfriend.)

I'm not saying by any means that this will happen to you.  What I'm saying is that I agree with the others that you should live with him, because otherwise you won't know what it's like to live with him before you commit.  You could be perfect going out and basically being close friends, but you might find that you simply cannot live with him.  Just note, if you are always doing what he wants to do, and never what you want to do, that is a red flag.

To address the family problems.  He was white and I am not.  I was the successful one, he was not. His family loved me though.  My parents never liked him (we had already been together three years before I moved in with him).  They also believe the only acceptable way for a female to leave home is to go to school or get married.  

It took about a year for them to come to terms with the fact that I was not (at the time) going to move back no matter how much they implored me to.  This is around the time my dad accepted him as "part of the family."

This is also around the time that I started going places with my parents, like to church on Sundays and stuff.  They'd pick me up and bring me back.  

About 6 months later they became ok with including my ex.  So we'd all go on family outings.  

Well things at home (with him) had gradually gotten sour (as previously detailed), and so eventually, when I got tired of trying to make it work, one Sunday night, I asked my parents if I could move back in with them, and the rest is history.

TL/DR (Case in Point):  PLEASE DO live with him or you may not know what you're getting into.  Good or bad, you need to find out before you complicate things further legally, emotionally, and with family. 

Edit: replaced some unnecessary details with a generic line of advice. 




 I am in grad school, An American in England, and this is my first time truly on my own (I used to live with my ex).  I have been here for over a month, and I have not felt homesick yet.  I asked a friend if that was weird, and she said it's normal for your first time on your own, presumably because it is so liberating. 

I get lonely sometimes though.  I surround myself with my friends, including skyping with my friends from back home when I am alone in my dorm room.  

So, surround your self with good friends and have fun!

Take full advantage of the experience.
That's my advice. 




 yes, and I kid you not, when I was in my early teens, I looked like I was in my early 20's (the reverse is true now, but I digress).  
I was in the store with my dad and my (then) baby brother; my mom was at work.  An employee approached me trying to "sell" me on a credit card, and she thought my dad was my husband and my brother was my son.  




 I have received nice compliments from both guys and girls at various times, but there is one compliment that I will never forget, because no one else has ever said anything like this about me, and because it happened at an embarrassing time.  
It was freshman year of high school (about 8 years ago now),  in gym class, we were doing free play and a friend (whom I had a crush on) and I were kicking a soccer ball back and forth.  He kicked it to me, and when I went to kick it, I was either too ambitious or it slipped under my foot just right, and I slipped and fell into a seated position flat on my bottom.  I was so embarrassed.  

But do you know what he said to me?
"I've never seen anyone fall so gracefully."
No one else has ever called me "graceful." 
I can be quite clumsy at times, so I will never forget that.  




 well, as long as each time isn't a monumental life-changing event, you should have no problem :p 




 you can be so tied to someone mentally/emotionally so sense when something important or serious happens.  Like when you just *know* something is wrong.   




 it will start happening again if you get adequate sleep 




 yes, all the time.  Everyone has them occasionally.  dreams are metaphors for/ based on the things that we are thinking about or have subconsciously picked up on during the day  / things we don't want to admit. 

To be more specific, my most recent one was, interrupting the middle of a dream's usual craziness, I wound up at WalMart with my mom to return a pack of socks.
When I woke up in the morning, guess what we had to go do?  
now, in the dream, the socks were white.  The real ones were black.  But still. 




 making them do the drug they were up against while hammered could kill them.  that part needs to be taken out 




 concept is good, but I don't agree with your categories.  Why is Islamist up there with political ideologies?  It is a Religion.  If you want to include Theocratic governments, then perhaps your should include more than one type. 




 This may be cheating, but I would have a Perfect mansion, Pretzels, a Porche, Pet birds, Pretty clothes, Pistachio Ice Cream, Pear Cider, and Plenty of chocolate :) 




 that's a cultural thing.  Wet ones / baby wipes.  Use them 




 yes; I am on exchange in England and I tried them and they are so good I bought a jumbo pack.   




 That could be the "secret" she's taking to the grave.   




 I saw that video and read about this a few months ago.  That hotel actually has a whole history of strange events, and in the past was even known as a popular destination for those looking to commit suicide  




 Did anyone else think this was a woman until the "girlfriend" part? 









 I had a sore throat and an interview the next day, so I was concerned.  I was at my parents' house for dinner, so I asked for advice.

Me: what do I do if I wake up tomorrow and my voice is hoarse?

Dad: Just go  "neigh" 




 Don't you mean avian flew? 




 I will upload a picture to photobucket when I get home from work and link it here.  I designed it not around replacing all letters with different characters, but around replacing frequently used words with shorthanded symbols.  I did manage to put it in a chart in Excell, but I could not get the characters to save as a font. 




 I like the idea of another writing system.  I learned dwarvish runes from the hobbitt very easily, but I find American shorthand and the Dotsies to be impractical, because the characters are so similar in nature.  When the Dotsies are bunched up, they are hard to distinguish.
With notecard situations, I usually write really tiny, and abbreviate.  I developed my own system of shorthand as well.  I wrote out charts for it, but I ran into some hiccups trying to program a font so that I can type in it and share it with the world.  Kudos to the Dotsies inventor for being able to do that so well. 




 a couple of years ago I found a tiny frog like this once.  I tried to take it home with me.  I have an insect container that would have made a great home for him.  When we arrived, he was just fine.  I washed the container out and put water and grass in it.  I went to put him in it, and he was dead.  I looked it up and I guess his skin got too dry.  :( 




 I just found out that the secretary at the office downstairs is pregnant and had an ultrasound yesterday.  It's a boy.  She came up here and showed us the pictures.

That is so freaky. 




 I'd had a baby and he was smaller than my pinky (about as tall as the first two pieces of the pinky, and slightly skinnier than it).  I don't remember much about the middle of the dream except that I sort of ignored him and just fed him and gave him occasional attention at different points of the day (like you would a pet bird for instance).  Then at one point, in the evening, I thought, "it's been a couple of hours, he's probably hungry."  So I picked the baby up.  He was wrapped up in a gum wrapper with a tiny tortilla inside, as if he was a trident-sized taco bell burrito.  I was intending to breastfeed him, but nothing was coming.  Suddenly, my mom was sitting next to me and she said to let her do it (and I saw her dripping milk - agh!).  At that point mine started working, so I fed the baby.  It was really weird with him being so tiny.  He looked darker than he did before at this point in the dream.

Then I woke up.

Bit of bg for the curious: I am engaged, but not pregnant.  I have no children.

Might be because we recently got two new lovebirds. 




 this was my reaction to this thread )posted on tumblr b/c I hadn't joined reddit yet.  Just thought I'd share them here without going back through the whole thread and finding each comment that I was referring to. http://kineticpassion.tumblr.com/post/49332764629/peridexis-ocdplayer-sunwillswallow-dont 




 there's no telling if it was him or now; we can't verify who this guy really is, and who really cares?  It would matter if he was taking credit for something of at least a small importance, but this means nothing. 




 what an injustice.  Rape is rape.  Be it man or woman, done with body, objects, or mind.  Someone attempted to mind rape me once, but I mind kicked his ass.

I know this sounds like a joke, but I am serious. 




 it's just that you got used to it.  If you left for a few days and came back, you would smell it again. 




 I had the same thing happen with a vaccum cleaner that smelled like cat.  I spraed a Hawaian febreeze in it, and it never stopped smelling like a sickly sweet refuse.  
Fruity febreeze is just bad period.
Now there is a febreeze that smells like laundry detergent; that one is good on anything.

 I also thought Vogel would be the villan, because she was manipulative and appeared to be using Dexter as her next gimick.  
That "flat, dull, unrelatable" ness is also how I perceived Hannah when she first appeared.  Bringing her back in this season, as Dexter's supposed "true love," and having him leave Harrison with her, was just completely wrong.  Hannah had proved herself to be dangerous and untrustworthy.  Not just with the poisoning, but she was also obviously ill prepared to raise a child.  It feels like that story line was thrown in as a means of slashing all of the other loose ends and wrapping it up.

As far as the other characters are concerned, most of them were fabricated for the show; based on what you said, you'd probabl appreciate the books better.  I have yet to read them myself, but I hear that they are much darker, and that Deb dies in the first one, and Dexter keeps Brian alive.

The ending is completely illogical.  "I don't have a life in Miami anymore, and I'm depressed about Deb.  I could go overseas and be with my girlfriend and son, and have a fulfilling future, but I'm afraid I'll screw it up, so I'll just abandon them and rot in this cabin."  Like I said before, it feels like they rushed to tie it together.  They definitely did not stay true to the series or its characters. 




 A lot, frankly, but I want to focus on the last few episodes.  He made so many little mistakes that had huge consequences, because he started thinking with his heart more than his head, both of which are flawed to begin with.  The ending would have worked out so much better if...

...he let Hannah leave in that helicopter; he could have taken care of Daniel Vogel, and then decided, with a clearer head, if he really wanted to follow her, and once the heat died down, he would be free and clear to move on and have a life.  Debra would likely have lived as well, if Dexter was focused on Vogel (Saxon) and not distracted by being with Hannah and protecting her; he would have dealt with him sooner and Dr. Vogel could have lived also.

This one is not exactly Dexter's mistake, but had Hannah walked over and stopped Harrison from using the treadmill instead of just telling him and expecting him to listen, she would not have been seen with him at the ER and identified to the marshall.

If Dexter had not told Batista that he was leaving as early as he did, the marshall would have left Miami, as he had been about to do, and then he would not have heard about Dexter leaving and suspected that he was harboring Hannah.

Had Debra thought to move Hannah's purse out of sight before opening the door for the marshall, that would be one less suspison.

Had Dexter killed Saxon while he had him strapped down, Debra would be alive.

Once all of those poor choices were made, and Hannah had sedated the marshall and escaped, Dexter had no options.  The marshall would awake, and he had seen with his own eyes that Hannah was with Harrison, so Dexter would go down at the very least, as an accomplice.  Debra as dead; even if he could escape, he had very little will to do so.  I would have thought he'd want to live and be there for Harrison, but from the moment he brought Deb onto the Slice of Life, I suspected he wanted to kill himself.
I'm glad that it didn't end on that variation of him riding into the sunset (in this case, hurricane), but him being alive, and his son and love being out there somewhere, is probably much worse.

Also, do you think Dexter the lumberjack (or lumber-yard-worker) is a killer, or just some empty shell wasting away? 




 it is also partially b/c of him that the confrontation after Hank's death went so badly; he added more and more heat to the situation. 




 good to know that there are professionals who are paid serious money and devote years of study to miniscule household pests.  
not sure how specifically studying albino flies would benefit humans, but I guess people can get paid to study anything.  How do you land a job like that?
"Hey, I was wondering how the genes that make fruit flies albino affect their healing."
"Here's a grant, and some more money; go do tests to find out." 




 this happens regularly in my house.  enough said 
























 no, actually, but thanks for offering :)  I've been writing songs since middle school.  I'm in grad school now, though not for music.  I write   sing pop rock / alternative. 




 and I'm always happy to help a fellow student.  btw, I was curious, did you write the poem/lyrics?   If so, do you write songs too? 




 no problem; I was a little bashful to record it here in my dorm, even though I sing in here everyday :) 




 ok; here it is; I hope it helps! https://soundcloud.com/test_subject8889/sets/poem-recording-for-vocoder-in-5-parts 




 ok, I'm singing it btw.  I've recorded the first three parts, but in the last part, on the 4th and 5th lines, you have the repeated "the" at the end of the 4th line and the beginning of the 5th line.  So would you like it on the 4th or 5th line, because that affects the rhythm also.  thanks :) 




 oh, wow; I didn't notice it was two links.  sorry about that :) 




 Idk if you're still looking for recordings, but if so, where is the text of the poem? 




 I actually pulled it up yesterday.   I just opened more threads in more tabs than I could read yesterday. 




 Didn't find out about this until starting Grad school.  Used to do all the searching myself. :/

 thanks for the reminder.  My AP Music Theory teacher in HS told us about it, but I had since forgotten 




 Do you mean New York blended with North Carolina? 




 Raised in south by parents from the north.  so I would say my accent is neutrally American.  




 I grew up in the south, but my whole family is from NY (deets here http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2yft7m/what_accent_do_you_have/cpc5zf7)

So, in the south they say I have a neutral accent, but in the north they say its southern.

But I do not say y'all.  I have always said "you guys" 




 same, just within America, and with Spanish  http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2yft7m/what_accent_do_you_have/cpc5zf7 




 Yeah, sometimes accents are clearcut and sometimes they are not so strong and are percieved differently by different groups; I would assume that is based on the comparison with their own accents.  I have a similar situation http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2yft7m/what_accent_do_you_have/cpc5zf7 




 I was raised bilingual (English and Spanish).  I learned French in HS, but apparently I speak French with a Spanish accent.   




 I don't live on a border, but I know exactly what that's like: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2yft7m/what_accent_do_you_have/cpc5zf7 




 This is actually a complicated question for me.

I grew up in the American South (North Carolina to be specific), but my parents grew up in New York (and we regularly visited the rest of the family up there).  So I learned to talk around ex New Yorkers.

So, in NC anyways, everyone says I have a neutral accent; after I give speeches, sometimes people tell me they like the sound of my voice.  So yeah.

One time though, my cousin, from Brooklyn, while in Brooklyn, said that I have a "thick southern accent;" and I told her that she has no idea what that is.  There are people in my town that I cannot understand a word they say, but I digress.

So to my relatives in NY, I have some degree of a southern accent.
In the actual south, where I am from, I have a neutral accent. 

I am currently studying in the UK.  I have a clearly American accent.  

Also, to complicate it more, I am hispanic; my parents are fluent, but given ESL, I have been gradually learning that I have been pronouncing some words in a spanish way. (like Acetominophen (Tylenol) is, in English, pronounced Ah See Toe Min Uh Fen, and I had been saying, Ah Ceh Toh Mean Oh Fen, as that was the only way I'd ever head it said, by my parents).

TL; DR:  Raised in NC by ex NY-ers; accent sounds neutral to southerners but sounds southern to northerners, with some spanish elements mixed in

 I don't read romance novels on principle, but I have a high amount of respect for John Green as a writer.  These are certainly more than just romance stories, tackling lots of complex issues.

Given that, I still have not read TFIOS because I am avoiding the disappointment I felt after reading Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants when it was so popular and I was in middle school. 

I had jumped on that bandwagon, and the ending just rubbed me the wrong way so much.  I would have rathered she dated the counselor or never slept with him at all.  

I know the gist of TFIOS, and have read the first chapter or so as an excerpt somewhere, but I don't think I want to read it and be disappointed by the inevitable tragedy or "oblivion" within.   




 I've never seen any of that either...maybe I'm just lucky too. 




 That some colleges have math course requirements to get in if you're transferring from community college.  So if you took AP's, make sure to follow up that admissions received your AP score report, because it gets delivered to a different record keeping department by default, so if admissions never sees it, you will not be shown as meeting the course requirements to get in, so you will be denied.   And if you go to the school to point out your APs and ask them to fix it, they will say its too late and just tell you to come back next year.

Sorry about the run-on; its past midnight and idc

Source: this happened to me, so I went to a school online (Southern New Hampshire University) and finished in just one more year.  I am now in grad school studying abroad. 




 here's the thing though; we were told this so much in high school.  BUT, if you're taking AP courses and dual-enrolled in college courses while in high school, and participating in clubs as well, when you do go to college it will be so much easier. 

They drilled into us how college is so much harder, and I am in grad school now and have only had one course that was in any way harder than my high school courses, and not really, I just didn't try.  

The pressure to succeed and the workload is triple for a high school junior or senior with APs and Extra Curriculars than it is for a college student.

Disclosure: My degrees are in Criminal Justice and Forensic Psychology; and the graduate program I am in is Political Science.
(These majors involve more essays than tests).

Second disclosure: I am the kind of person who doesn't study.  But I take extensive notes.  The act of writing something down makes me remember it.  




 Well I made it to the end of the first semester of Grad school before that happened to me... 




 some schools have a policy that you cannot check out a book from the library if it is a required textbook for a course you are enrolled in. 




 I was raised bilingual (english and spanish) , and I just realized this last year 




 I heard the same story from my French teacher in high school. 




 well we already know you're against it :)

But in all seriousness, neither Israel nor Palestine would want to give up territory to Hamas and allow them to form a "legitimate" state.

Palestine might be more willing to compromise on that, given that Hamas is already involved in their government, but I don't think Israel would be willing to make that concession.

 I've never physically gone somewhere for a random investigation, but I would advise you to do your homework.

a shield is the most basic and most important thing you need to know, so I'm glad you do.  That's the first thing anyone should teach anyone (learned that the hard way).

maybe bring a thermometer or something which has heat vision (maybe there's an app for that?)  You want to be able to detect and document sudden dips and spikes in temperature.

Bring matches.

But, by do your homework, I mean read into where you are going.  What sort of events have been reported from there.  Get a good idea of what you should be prepared for.  Do not go in over your head.  If a place is famous for people disappearing, and there is nothing out there on how or why or anything, don't be stupid and go out there alone to solve the mystery.

I wish I could offer more, but that's all I've got atm.  

Work on getting stronger.  Work on expanding your shield, hardening it, feeding more energy to it, etc.  try to heat water; try to diffuse a headache.  Simple things to focus your energy for a purpose.

 I think we can take a page from Europe on this one, just the general concept though: Have campaigns be state funded.  

We don't have to give them much.  It can be just a base amount which allows you to run a couple of ads and such.  Everyone, even corporations, would still be allowed to donate, but the donations would be to political parties rather than to individual candidates.  This would alleviate clientellism.  The political parties would then distribute these funds to their candidates according to need/the scope of the campaign.

For example, if you donate $1,000 to the North Carolina Democratic Party, they might distribute $175 to the Gubernatorial candidate, $175 to the Senate candidate, $80 each to 5 House candidates, and  $2.50 to each of the 100 counties' local Democratic Parties.  (This distribution is completely hypothetical; I am not saying that should be the ratio).  You could also donate to the local party organization in your county, if you want the money to specifically go there. 




 it is affectionately referred to as pork, and that's simply corruption and bribery.  It's all about the money to many, even when it shouldn't be; even when our health and our future is at stake.  We have to have a livable planet and a functional society for money to even matter.  Priorities get twisted with power and greed.  People who have never seen poverty, who have never walked in anything other than designer shoes, can't relate or fully comprehend the effects of their actions, which adversely affect so many.

Spin is another big issue.  Some people (*losely defined*) are so good at putting a spin on things such that people think something will help them when it will only hurt them, and vice versa.  Like the estate tax. 




 I plan to run for office in an effort to effect as much positive change I can in policy areas including, but not limited to: healthcare, housing, criminal justice, and environmental policy.

For someone who seeks to write and pass legislation, given your in-depth analyses, do you think I would have better chances in the House or the Senate?  Are there any tips from your observations as to what makes a bill more likely to pass if the other party (*Republicans*) don't want to see it happen?

Thank you 




 oh, sorry; forgot to mention, as far as what it means, if there was something there, could be a ghost, could be being watched by a guardian angel, anything really.  it depends on the specifics, which, if you are in a public place, you may never know, as it could be something tied to you, or the place.   




 I feel that way sometimes just out of nervousness/paranoia like others said; like if I've watched or read something, or it's dark, or if I happen to think of something which psychs me out into that state. 

Also, if you've had a small amount to drink, it is way easy to freak yourself out in this way.  like full on sweaty palms for no reason other than the thought crossed your mind "what if there's something behind me?"

I'm talking about feeling like there's something behind you, or just out of your line of sight.

Feeling like you're being watched is technically a little different.  

And there is a definite difference from these feelings caused by nervousness and when they have a legitimate cause.  

The former is just a nagging/irking suspicion.  The latter is when you can feel the stare boring into you; like they're burning holes in you from looking/glaring so hard.  

are you familiar with Kundalini and Chakras (I apologize for spelling if that's wrong)?  they are energy centers in your back.  The strongest one is in your lower back.  Aka the small of your back.

That's where you feel it when someone is behind you.

If there is really something present, you will feel it there.  no question.

Side note: If you take note of those feelings, then you will start to notice when people are behind you, you feel different people in different ways.  This could be because of their aura at the time (mood they are in; vibe they are giving off), their personality, their intentions, or their relationship to you.

When you trust someone with your life, and are fully familiar with them and in tune almost to the point that you are one person, you may not feel them coming at all. 
Some people you may feel coming before they even get close to you.  you may even lean back from the feeling, which is your body trying to balance the pull of energy in your lower back.  (Happened to me right now just thinking about it; because, when I remember things, I remember and re-experience the emotions I experienced at the time). 

Anyway, I hope this helps! 




 So it was hoarding the bottles.  But I wonder what the gate was originally built for, in front of a small area before a dead end...

I guess it's a good thing you (and presumably OBE girl) are not Hispanic.  It probably turned up that time and not the others thanks to the presence of your Portuguese friend of friend. 

The strangest part of this story to me is that you're a European in like, your 30's give or take, and the most you've ever drank is 2 shots of whiskey and a beer :p (or some beer, not clear but irrelevant). 

One could argue that maybe El Tio, if that's what it was, was summoned by the miners' belief in him, or alternatively, the more likely scenario, which concerns me, is that, since he is supposedly, according to your notes, a guardian, then he showed up to protect his people from something worse that was lurking, which would explain the deaths (if he is a guardian, as you said).  

The idea of accepting offerings of cigarettes and alcohol points to the pile as being his hoard, but I don't know whether to think what you saw is El Tio or not.  Since it disappeared when you said its' services (protection) are no longer needed, then maybe.  But, perhaps its services were still needed?  depends on what it was protecting people from.  Although, if so many people died, maybe it wasn't doing a good job. 

Or maybe the miners weren't leaving behind as much booze as the teenagers :)  , so it didn't stick around as much.  Who knows? 




 no; it's not pointless at all.  I don't agree with some of the things you said about existence and identity, but I do agree with what you said about ideas; so, I guess I need to clarify as well.

There aren't really any "original" ideas.  Everything has already been thought of.  You can see that in the progression of technology in the "modern"/"developed" world, where our modern conveniences such as plumbing/running water already existed in ancient Rome, for instance.  

We tune into / pick up the idea, and, as is psychologically necessary, it passes though our frame of reference, and we perceive/interpret it as our own, original, idea.  




 you might have a sleep disorder; but I don't see how sleepwalking and such would enable you to rip the sheets; then again, people can beat people up in such a state.  I have torn Pj's at the seams from moving too much, but that's a whole other animal.  

It sounds like you're thinking werewolf or something.  Real life "werewolves" is simply a genetic trait of having too much hair.  I'm thinking you have no comments yet because no one is taking you seriously.  I don't really either, but I am giving you the benefit of the doubt, or rather, belief.

You may also have unwanted visitors.  Mice, Raccoon, squirrel, ghost?

Any signs of any of those unwanted visitors?   




 actually to address the lucid dreaming more, I have a slightly different take on that than the literature you'll find online.  I've doing it since before I knew about it, and I have a different approach.

Here's what I recommend doing, /u/ShyhiemDragon , :
 - first, you need to develop an awareness of when you are dreaming.  I don't have a particular method I use for this, I just generally can tell from context clues/ rationality.  But, to do this deliberately, it would help to come up with a system.  Like a totem (if you've seen Inception).  Think of an action, maybe, that you can't do irl but can in a dream (flying is an example, but may be too dramatic to work at first; letting go of mental barriers and making yourself fly can be hard if you have no experience controlling your dreams, as you have to be really sure of yourself to just leap up and fly.  I've done it but lost my self assurance and plummeted several feet before picking back up; not a good feeling).  So something like that, but milder.  Maybe try to jump over something big or tall. (I can't jump more than a couple inches irl.)  Or, more like the totem, go to sleep with something in your pocket or something. 

Taking a step back; you say you have a nightmare problem.  I had so many nightmares as a kid, but I could, most of the time, tell it was a dream.  I learned how to wake myself up.  
- close your eyes
- focus on the fact that it's a dream
- relax as if to meditate; control your breathing
- count backwards from whatever number feels natural to you (I used 10; usually would wake up by the time I got to 3 or 4). 

I had a horrible literal end of the world nightmare once when I was like 12 or so, and I woke myself up, went back to sleep, and it continued, so after I came aware (didn't take long as it was a continuation), I ran to safety and woke myself up again.  It continued one more time I think.  That was the worst nightmare I ever had, until the sleep paralysis one I just mentioned in another comment above.  They're tied for worst I guess, in different ways.

So, back to the lucid dreaming,
- once you have mastered, to a reasonable extent, knowing when you are dreaming, then it is just a matter of taking the wheel.  Being yourself; taking control of yourself, if you get what I mean.  Once you are aware its a dream, just be you, in your body there
- start maybe by asking questions.  My favorite I did once was I was in my elementary/primary school, and I saw a janitor; I asked him what year it was, and he said "can't you read the calendar?"  lol
- Investigate; walk around; explore; be bold.  
- try to fly if you want, but the time I did that, besides dropping myself as I mentioned before, I also felt like it took the magic out of the dream. I like to explore the naturally developed environment of the dream; if you change everything up, then it's just a sandbox and that takes the magic out of it for me.

hope this is helpful 




 yes, just be careful not to fall into sleep paralysis.  I've never experienced it, but I dreamed that I had one time; a quite vivid dream.  It was easily the most terrifying dream I've ever had. 




 "T-minues 5 to tea time! We're casting off into Boston Harbor; I hope George likes it salty!" 




 yeah, like I said, only helps a tiny bit.  

Must be combined with good music and tea or hot cocoa, as well as a phone call or chat in order to be of measurable help 




 High school senior by any chance?  or in community college? here's a list of unconventional and controversial persuasive speech topics:

- we should have 13 months with 28 days each, instead of the 12 months we have. 

- High school graduates who are under 18 should be allowed to vote.

- High school graduates who are under 18 should receive full legal rights upon graduation (age of majority law).  (I did this one for my senior thesis/ speech)

- one should have to pass a test of common sense in order to gain the right to vote

- we should require one to pass a psychiatric evaluation in order to purchase firearms.

- we should, like some European nations, have a quota for women in the government

- Daylight savings time is unnecessary.

- Rather than charging students more for things on campus (paying for the convenience), they should instead be subsidized, to help students with cost of living.  (This is how it's done in the UK where I am currently studying abroad, so yeah...) 

- Universal Healthcare

(If you are not American, I am sorry, as many of these will not be applicable.)

**DISCLAIMER: these are controversial topic ideas and do not necessarily reflect the views and opinions of the poster.  Thank you. ** 




 there is a word for that actually.  it is commonly referred to as "the oversoul". 

I am not a believer in the oversoul, but I do believe in a sort of, what you might call, universal consciousness, just not in that form.

See, /u/TheAlienDude , when we think, speak, or act, we use energy.  These words and ideas are usually in the form of waves.  Sound waves, radio waves, waves of energy from our thoughts, physical shockwaves from our actions, etc.  

These waves do not cease to exist when we cease to see or hear them.  They travel throughout the universe.  This is how we pick up on things we could not "possibly" know, and how we come up with seemingly random ideas.  When you get a random idea, google it.  Chances are, someone has already thought of it recently somewhere halfway around the world, and that's just how long the waves took to reach you.

Some people are more receptive to it than others.  Like having stronger antennae.

If I had to guess, I'd say you picked up on their thoughts or conversations about the food they had bought, and interpreted it as your own craving.  However, it is also possible that they picked up on your thoughts about what you wanted to eat, and interpreted it as their own idea of what to buy. 




 yeah, the "crew" that I sometimes worked with was already in it, we just kind of joined up for some cases, although there was too much drama as I kind of had a secret thing with one of them (also via OBE, (chilling on a cloud over New York City is a great way to spend an afternoon) although we acknowledged it privately in person a couple of times/ways, to assure each other we didn't make it up in our heads).

and like I said, I learned my lesson the hard way about endangering people, with my friend who turned out to be a frenemy, which is why I backed off when I got with my ex, although I've come to regret that decision sometimes.  That rather than backing away, I should have taught him how to defend himself even more than I did, and if I had kept teaching him, we could have eventually fought together, as a power couple.  But that's a moot point now. 




 this is a story from high school, about the pressure to succeed and the value of life.  (I've told it once before in a public speaking course in undergrad.)

I was dual-enrolled in the community college, and I had AP courses.  I was in a multitude of extra-curriculars.  I handled it well, and I enjoyed it.  

I also had a pet fish.  A koi fish named Reggie.

I took care of him all my own; I didn't leave any of the responsibility to my parents.  He was my child; he lived in my room.  

Koi are quite intelligent.  He definitely felt a strong attachment to me.  I knew this because, one time, my dad came in the room, and Reggie literally flipped out; thrashing/ spazzing in the bowl, until I said "It's ok, relax; this is my dad."  Then, much to my dad's surprise, and somewhat to mine, Reggie immediately calmed down.  He also spazzed out when I had another visitor, but that's a private tale; although, I should have known to cover the tank.

Reggie was also a nicer fish than I've ever had or known: he let me pet him when I cleaned his bowl.

Later in the school year, my life got insanely busy.  I was doing homework each night from after dinner until about 1 am. He was due for a cleaning, but it was far too late, so I told him I would get to it the next day.  This proceeded for a few days (not really sure how many), until one evening, I came back to my room from dinner to find Reggie floating, very wrong.  His bowl was filthy.  And it was all my fault.  I was in shock/disbelief at first.  I had to poke him a couple of times before I accepted that he was gone.  I took him in a papertowel to the kitchen to announce the news, and I cried over him.  I told him how sorry I was that I let this happen.  I felt like the worst mother in the world, and that I could never be trusted with a life.  

I'm crying a little now just remembering that night.

**So, I learned a valuable lesson.  When you are responsible for someone's life, that comes first, before anything.**

It wouldn't have taken too long to clean him.  I could have done it one of those nights before settling down to homework/projects.  
I was just too naive.  

(I also didn't learn until later that Koi really need a tank, but he was doing fine in his bowl as I had kept it super clean up until then.)

I have looked in the pet stores, but have yet to see another koi with blue eyes like Reggie.  

One day, when I have my own permanent place, I will get a koi pond, and a couple of blue-eyed koi fish.
 




 you are not useless.  although its too late for your ferberizing parents to realize the importance of physical affection in raising a mentally and emotionally stable person, it's not too late for you.  Don't be afraid to show affection.  

I have been hugged plenty, but lately I get this "really need a hug" feeling too sometimes, and I hug my pillow, which helps a tiny bit. 




 she made you emotionally damaged and unavailable and that is really fucking sad.  I'm so sorry that happened to you, man.

I broke up with my ex a few months ago (also HSSH); he was all of my firsts, and I was many of his.  But, there were a lot of legitimate issues behind that, and we are still good friends; we are a support system for eachother I guess you could say.  

I would never abandon someone like that.

I can only imagine your pain, but just know that there are better, more mature and loving people out there.  Don't put up a wall; that wall will only keep you from finding happiness.  

Good luck!  be strong 




 I have many stories about predictive dreams, but everyone has those and they are abundant.

I have, however, a weird story involving poetry that I wrote.  I have written a lot of serious poetry, but at that particular point in my life, I was in a humor poetry phase, particularly humor at others' expense.  (I know, I was immature in school; so was everyone else). 

Our English teacher had been on leave long-term because she had had a baby.  We had a long-term sub who was actually a retired teacher, from the "old school" if you will.  She made us diagram sentences and other tedious, outdated, unnecessary, nit-picky grammatical things.   She also assigned far more homework than we were accustomed to.  We all abhorred that class under her (a word I learned independently that year).  After a few weeks of this, even our parents had complained to the school about the amount of work Mrs.Substy* would assign.  We had no idea when our normal teacher would be coming back.

One day, in homeroom, in the morning, I wrote a poem about her going away.  It was wishful thinking at its' finest.  It started with: 
"today's the day, today's the day, the day Mrs. Substy* goes away!..." and ended with a simple "...good riddance!".
(I still have the hard, hand-written copy of the poem back at home).  I showed it to my friends and we had a good laugh.

That afternoon, when we went to English class, SURPRISE!  Our regular teacher was back!  Mrs. Substy* really was gone!  At the time, I wondered if this meant I could make things happen by writing poetry, but I realize now, of course, that it meant I subconsciously picked up on the vibe somehow and predicted it. 

TL;DR: I wrote a poem about a strict long-term substitute teacher going away that day, and then she actually did. 




 and it's funny that you reference knowledge and truth.  at one point, I referred to myself as "the bearer of truth" . 

I am currently in graduate school, and always an independent student of many more disciplines; life is a long pursuit of knowledge.  

Most people don't pay attention to the truth, only what they are told.  I focus my online posting, in all mediums, to do everything I can to raise the public awareness of the lies and injustice in our world.

My whole life's mission (including my career goals), the reason I believe I am here on this earth, is to fight for truth and justice.   




 I see this account has also only been around for a few days like our friends here, so I take it you made it for these discussions?  Thus, does "iwasthesword" mean that you have a personal experience you aren't sharing?  Calling yourself a sword....so you feel used?

I don't know what your experience is, but I have never felt used by fighting for life and light, only empowered.  

If you felt used, I'm afraid you may have been dealing with something different entirely.  Unnatural is not quite the right word.  Untoward may be better.  

Perhaps you were conned into working for the dark side? 




 May I please have "Eclectic Catholic Warrior" as my flair? 




 when you would heal, did you just focus the energy on making them better?  or did you focus on the healing process of the specific ailment internally (for example, visualizing white blood cells in action, working in hyper speed).  I do the latter.  




 *thanks*

I firmly believe that if something needs to be done, for the good of the world, in one way or another, the powers that be will make that energy available to you.  It is lent, yes, but in that, you are a warrior in what I take you would call *their battle* , but it's our battle.  

We are not puppets; we are active participants.  Puppets simply do as they are told.  By definition, we are far from that.  

I am aware of hard effort it takes to become powerful; I am nowhere near where I would like to be.  But in a pinch, the energy from your adrenaline and urgency heightens your power dramatically, as do any other forces who want to see you succeed at the particular mission.  
And I don't have to wonder; I know, my friend.  Faith is a powerful thing.  I am not a puppet.  I am a warrior.  (well, I was, and I would like to be again).  




 I've heard this story before, and I thought I remembered reading that they made an agreement to trade places (a la mode de Parent Trap), but I could just be misremembering that because it's what I would have wanted to hear. 




 yes, this is one of my favorites 




 wow; ok.  I don't even know where to start.
I guess I'll just go down through the order you went in, and elaborate on things as I go.

Although I was already sort of interested, I was 12 when I formally began studying this stuff independently, so around the same age.  
I can't speak to your experience with the mirror specifically, as I know nothing about that other than my dad told me that if you stare into the mirror long enough you will see who you were in a past life.
I too have some really vague early memories, like the taking of my first portraits (as a baby).  One's vision is not fully developed at that point; all I know from the memory is that it was done by what I can determine was an old lady (although I certainly didn't know the meaning or vocabulary to interpret that at the time).
I'm so sorry to hear about your childhood trauma.

Becoming empowered, if you will, had the opposite effect on me.  It's like I became a new person.  I had suffered from some anxiety issues in childhood, and, at that point, I learned to overcome them, with mental fortitude, and it's like my childhood before that was sealed off like a past life.  I remember major things and the general format of regular occurrences, like going to the mall with my mom, but not a lot of specific mundane memories.  Those are somehow locked away.  

Dreams with premonitions are a perfectly normal part of life; some people just have them a lot more than others, if you are receptive to it, and if you sleep well enough to remember it.  Lately I haven't been sleeping well, but when I do, I remember my dreams every night, and have *psychic* ones at least once a week.  My most recent one predicted that I would have to go to the store with my mom to return a pack of socks.  But in the dream they were white socks; the real ones, the next day, were black socks.  So yes, of course, the signals you are subconsciously picking up on are never exact, because although, theoretically, the signal your mind is receiving and reading ought to be exact, it must pass though our mind and perceptual set (our lens of understanding), and be interpreted into language.  And I am totally familiar with the "THIS IS IT" moment.  I wouldn't describe it in quite the same way, but it feels great. 

I am quite good at getting a feel for people's intentions/emotions, and I can complete sentences and such for people.  I don't have a deep empathic link like you described though; that is intense.

I have no connection to Buddhism, but meditating to channel energy is basically the first thing I learned how to do in this field.  As you surely already know, but may or may not have realized, the first thing one must be able to do is clear one's mind; think of absolutely nothing. 

In my mind's eye, my energy is electric blue and sparkly.  My favorite color tbh.  I guess it resonates with me.  so greenish yellow (which is one of the colors that only a percentage of the population can see, thanks to having extra cones in the cornea) is evidently a color which resonate with you. 

It's really cool that you met someone like Dakota.  I wish I had.  I taught some people some skills; my dad is into this stuff but I never could really talk to him about these things in more than a theoretical sense.  the director for a theater play I was in once, after I had read someone's mind and freaked them out because they somehow knew (I didn't do it as a parlor trick, I did it to guess a number to get a part in the intro scene we were adding), so she, the director, calmly talked about aborigine mental communication until he calmed down (like two minutes).  

Enchanting objects is quite easy to do.  As with any "spell", if you will, it is all about channeling energy for intentions; simple as that.  One of the persons I was teaching was my ex, before we got together.  I'd taught him to do make a shield (like you described sealing the room sort of), and I could feel him extend it around me as he practiced it.  I didnt say anything, because, as we were just friends at the time, I didn't know how to react to such a personal trust; because that's almost like giving someone access to your soul; like, I'm protecting myself from any potential negative influences, but I feel no need to protect my mind and my soul from you.  I didnt say anything, but then he asked if I knew what he did, and I let him tell me before I said I knew, because, at the back of my mind, I didnt want to be wrong.  

I hadn't been teaching him long when he enchanted an object, a hairbow, and gave it to me.  I didn't have to ask though; I knew exactly what he did.  It was a love spell.  The "legal" kind; the reminder/make you think of me kind.  I knew and I wore it anyways because it was sweet. I told him "I know what you did to this", and he just smiled.

your friend's ability to visibly see the energy and not just sense it is very special.  I had one friend who could visibly see auras (I think, or she could feel the color; one or the other).  I have yet to visibly see such things, but I can feel them, and visualize them in my mind's eye.  so, on that note, could Dakota see the color of the energy?  or just sense it?

People are socialized to not believe though.  I had an ex friend who I had started teaching, whom me enemies turned against me (yes mind control spells are a thing; she was the first I taught, and from then on, I learned to teach defense first, as I was describing about my ex).  Even if they've witnessed things, like how Dakota accurately described what you did, they can be convinced it wasn't real.  So watch out for that.  Do you still speak to Dakota?

Earth is my element; there's a story about how I know that as 100% fact (but I dont like dirt?, so it's strange).  I am quite impatient.  I have done "work" that involved a meditative state for more than 20 minutes, but to just focus energy for 20 minutes solid?  That I've never done.  I would like to though.  who knows what I could accomplish.

That being said; to make anything big happen, it is a fact I have found, and that a powerful wiccan I know (who I didn't find out was a wiccan until later) also happened to say, is that: *you have to need it* .
One of the biggest things I've ever done, I did without waiting for a buildup of energy, because the energy came from the sheer force of dire need. (I can share that story too if you want).  The need however, lies with the person.  What is a dire need for you may not be a dire need for others.  If you can make yourself feel a dire need, then the power is yours.  That is hard to fake though.  I am still working on it (though not as much as I'd like to).

Energy manipulation has a young prime.  Once life responsibilities take over your mental energy, it is hard to do, unless you've kept it up continuously.  The biggest tip I can give you, especially to get the dreams back, is to get adequate sleep.

I have been staying up late lately, because I am studying abroad and have major FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) with my night owl friends.  But prior to that, I had been getting more sleep and thus, having more lucid and *psychic* dreams.

That last experience you mentioned though, specifically, I don't think that's earth energy.  That's electric, or weather.  Just pure energy really.  That's what lightning and thunder are.  Electricity.  Sheer force.  A force of nature. :)

So yeah; I could probably go on and on, but I hope this is helpful/ comforting, and feel free to AMA.  




 hmm.  that's kind of an iffy answer, but I think it confirms a ghost or presence of some sort if they're not going there as frequently but still going to that room, specifically to the window where one of the incidents occurred.
I've never had a dog though, so I can't attest to the normality of such behavior, and individuals are different, so only you can make that judgement if this behavior is normal for your dogs.  It could be attributed to the stress of moving, and they may simply be doing it less because they got used to it. 




 there's no need to be "terrified".  To be honest, you and live with a ghost like that with no problem.  But, if you want to try and help it, then what you suggested is a good way to star; but don't ask for a name.  Go to one of the places you encountered it, and sit, relax, as if you were meditating, then try to get a feel for the presence.  If you can sense it there, try to reach out to it, by thinking really loud/hard "I mean you no harm.  Maybe I can help you.  who are you?  what do you need?"  If you can get any kind of response out of it, maybe you can figure out how to persuade it to move on.  But don't be pushy about it; that may just upset it.

Not 100% sure that you have a ghost though.  It could be electrical, as dogs can sense that too.  So, to clarify, when you say the things stopped happening after you asked, did the dogs also stop barking at the unseen?  that is the determining factor here. 




 As you and /u/EmpathyistheEnemy may be able to infer from the conversation in /r/paranormal earlier today, I too have a similar experience.

I was recruited at the age of 12 by my "guardian angel", who had been an attached spirit to me for as long as I could remember.  
I had had experiences with malicious spirits in the past, most notably that one tried to kill me when I was about 5 years old; it was no accident.  Without having thought too much about it, I had managed to trap that spirit in a household item some time later.  My recruitment happened after I, 7 years later, accidentally released it because I had forgotten it was there.  

The recruitment happened at night in my bedroom; the spirit, in the form of a scarlet macaw with the posture of a vulture, was glaring at me from atop my bookcase, and issued me a challenge.  With bravery I didn't yet know I had, I accepted the challenge, and it went away, for the time being.  Then my guardian angel told me that I didn't have to do it if I didn't want to; I accepted the responsibility.  

So, I was recruited and my first mission was to defeat that spirit. 

I never did any fighting irl that I didn't organize with ppl I recruited.

All other fighting was, as I said in my other post, with *psychic force* if you will.

I worked both alone and with a group, which were people I knew from school, but we didn't really talk in school, only outside of school.

I wouldn't call the battles OBE, but rather mind travel or something, which is achieved kind of like a deep meditation.

As far as doing things while "hunting", you are more powerful in a group because you can pool your energy and stretch it, but other than that, no not really.  

Did you guys have rivals?  half of my fights were with rivals (also from school).  The other half were with entities.  I have faced off on ghosts, demons, something in between, and human rivals.

I gradually stepped back when I got with my ex, because my rivals, users of dark arts as they were, had befallen one of the people I recruited. I had started teaching my ex how to use his energy, starting with protection of course, and he had mastered things like shields.  But, I feared for his sanity, and compromising of my missions, should anything go after him while he was still not trained.  So, I stopped teaching him and stepped back from my duties, age of 15.

As such, my power greatly decreased.  But it is not gone.  I still have psychic dreams, and can feel auras when they're strong enough.  I can still do protection and healing spells. 

I have full faith that if I needed to step up to the plate for something, that God would lend me the power necessary to do so.  I believe that I will be able to tap into it if necessary.  I want to rejoin the fight though; I am still young. I would also like to teach, if not to fight, at least teach people to be, as I call it, "masters of their own minds".   

I've never recited anything in a language other than English.  Anything I need to know was simply made available to me.  I think of it as tapping into the knowledge that's out there; you could call it a universal consciousness, and ancient power source, or the energy of all the world's knowledge flowing in waves (sound, radio, etc), to which one can tune in.  As far as "spells" are concerned, it is simply a matter of intentions and directed energy.  There can be words, or not; you can use other's words, or your own.  That part doesn't matter.  There may be some high-level deep stuff that requires specific things, but I haven't come to that.

(did you use the term "hunting" because of Supernatural, btw?  one of the best shows ever.  I call them "battles" though.  Battles in the eternal fight of good vs. evil.)

As far as being confused about the intentions of the entities, as you mentioned in a reply above, where did you think your power was coming from?  Sure there's the base power you naturally have inside you, as a human being in God's image, functioning through electrical impulses, but the power used in battle is much stronger than that, particularly in spiritual battles.  So where did you think it came from?  (I apologize for my use of "God" if you're not Christian, but I, and I would think you also, given your experiences, believe that we all believe in the same God and just call him/her/it/the entity different things.)

Another question, besides the above asking if you had rivals, did you ever mange to do anything physical with your powers?  I know you said you had battles irl too (and the use of "irl" is not a good term; as Dumbledore famously put it "of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real"?  so I prefer to say mental and physical)
So, I know you had battles in the physical world/realm, but did you ever, in or out of battle, do anything physical with psychic energy?  like move things? My ex did when he was a kid, which is why I had started teaching him.  I, a year after recruitment, managed a great feat of this type, but it was electrical-physical, not actually moving anything, but a power-surge if you will.  (I can tell the story if you're interested)  But, so did you? 




 anyone else notice that the capital letters in the last set of usernames say "Kill Bye"
 




 I am not a skeptic, but it's clear to me that this is muckracking (gathering sparse examples into a weak case).  the chairs flipping can be wind, stray dogs, anything really.  The fridge opening by itself happens, as does with cabinets.  Pressure from the contents, the temperature, etc (especially if its an older fridge they don't close well).  Lights also act wierdly on their own, both incadesents and CFLs.  Noises like something fell but finding nothing happen in my house all the time.  I joke that there's a ghost, but I mean, it happens.  The tapping on your headboard is the creepiest, but I'm inclined to think nothing of it because the picture looks faked.  I mean, they say real blood looks fake to us because our mental concept of what blood looks like is based on fake tv blood.  So if its a real pic then, I'm sorry. 

Giving you the benefit of the doubt, if it is real, sit calmly on your bed, relax and settle in as if to meditate, reach your mind out around the house, try to get a feel for the presense.  If you can sense it, try to contact it.  Just sense for it and think really hard/ loudly "I mean you no harm; I want to help you; what do you need?"  Try to find out what the issue is.

hope this helps.

edit: typos 




 and you can lift your spirit though meditation to a higher plane and travel as the spirits do (OBE), but that's a conversation for another day 




 yes, exactly.  In my case, it was personal, so it was most appropriate to personally show her the door.  In op's case, if it does turn out to be something like a racist great grandparent or something, it may come down to her bf talking the spirit down.  It will depend on the details of the situation.  




 define exorcism; because if you mean old church stuff, that won't necessarily fly.  
If you loosely use "exorcism" to mean methods of getting rid of / vanquishing spirits, then yes that would be wise. 




 depending on how you look at it, everyone has "psychic powers", or you could say there is no such thing because it is normal, not a power.  We can all pick up on energy from eachother and things.  We all have the ability to sense each other's feelings or when something is amiss. Like antennae picking up on signals.  Some people just have stronger reception than others.  Knowing about it and being open to it helps you tune in more.

My experience with entities you can physically see is limited, but I have experience both with attached spirits and getting rid of negative spirits, but I accomplished that with brute (*psychic*) force.  

I don't know if op is strong enough for that.  If she hasn't deliberately channeled the energy, then likely she isn't.  

Ms.Medium sounds like she could help you /u/Brutally_honesttt .  Although I understand how she could sense the attached spirit and the aura, because that is just sensing and reading signals radiating from you, I dont know if she could help you fight off a nasty spirit.  

I would offer to help, as you don't have to be physically present to get rid of a spirit, for obvious reasons, but you do have to know what you're dealing with.  

In any case, you can try ignoring it as demonslayer suggested, but in case it doesnt stop/ gets worse, you need to try to find out what it is and what its deal is.  I don't think it'll try to hurt you with your *familiars* around, so keep them close.  Your bf may be vulnerable though, especially if he does have sleep problems; it would leave him in the vulnerability of sleep with the mobility of someone who is awake.  Worse case scenario with that: you wake up to him wearing that sadistic face choking you.  I don't mean to frighten you worse, but that is the worst case scenario as far as I can see.  Knowing that should help in the sense that you have less to fear if you know the worst you can expect.  Although, given that it probably let the dogs out, it can clearly do small movements of physical objects on its own.  If it wanted to hurt you though, at this point, it wouldn't do so by letting the dogs, who protect you, out.  It is just toying with you at this point. 

The last spirit I got rid of for someone toyed with me before I even found out about its existence; she visited me in a dream and glared at me.  I later found out her story, realized that was her, and knowing who she was and what her beef was, which was personal (dead ex of my then bf), I was able to take her out. 

If its some random spirit toying with you, it will get bored if you ignore it, yes.
If it is someone who has a beef with you living in that house for any reason (there could be *any* reason), then it will work harder to drive you out.  

So find out if there are any old stories related to the house, or any dead relatives who may have beef.

Hope this helps.  sorry I went on for so long... 




 The cat seems to be a good guy, in any case.  Although the bf most likely has a sleep issue, on the off chance that something worse is amiss, the last thing she'd want to do is remove the watchful alarm 




 I have false awakenings every now and then, but when I wake up for real, I have no trouble knowing the difference, that the first awakening was false.  In the dream, I only know its a false awakening about 50% of the time.  I dont have a particular test; I can usually just tell when something is a dream 




 I was thinking of that cat virus as soon as I read this headline.  This is yet another zombie-like infection IRL. 
























 ah; well in any case, "this guy" indicates that they're not exactly buddies 




 the same way that we all have the ability to sense when something is wrong with a friend or family member, or when you get that feeling that something is not right....you could call it picking up on the vibes, or feeling/reading auras from people, but we all do it; just some people have honed it as a skill and can do it better, or are more aware of doing it.

He must have really really needed to pass gas, and you were just receptive enough at the moment to sense that vibe and urgency radiating from him.

It's a perfectly simple and logical explanation.  

Still a funny story though. 




 they said it was a random guy that did it; the friend was just there with them 




  indigo children

first time I hear that term.  And actually, I wouldn't say so.
Every human being has the potential, it's just a matter of finding out, awakening, and honing it. 

Everyone has dreams occasionally which predict the future;  everyone can sense when something is wrong with a friend of family member, and so forth and so on. 

Doing more than that is just a matter of learning to harness and focus your energy for a purpose.  

IF we are born differently in any way, then its a genetic predisposition to be more open-minded. 




 I was also into it from a younger age too, like spirits, knowing when I was dreaming and being able to wake myself up and such; but I didn't awaken my potential and get actually into into it, as in more actively doing things and participating, until age 12. 




 that's why they typically start you so young I think (usually between 12-16); it is easier to tap into your potential before you've been weighted down by adult responsibilities. 




 well, like I said, really powerful.  I'm assuming the numbers were drawn out of a hat or jar or something, manually?  that may just be really good luck (or a wiccan or Magick spell for luck, as some others said she may have been in that branch/brand of, um, energy manipulation if you will).
If the drawing was done electronically, then that has a much simpler explanation, as thoughts are electrical impulses.  It is not too difficult to manipulate electronics. 




 oh wow; yeah I would say it is.  Although, the statue itself doesn't provide protection (that would be idolatry).  Believing in it does.  So you believed your protection was compromised, opening you up to the continuation of the dreams.  

I was going to say that if that's the case, if the statue kept the dreams at bay, that maybe I never had a dream quite like that because of all the religious symbols my parents had put up in my bedroom.  Then again, I'd had malicious spirits in my room, at least once, so that can't be right.   




 the age doesn't surprise me one bit.  One can be at the height of his or her power at that age; both those working for good and for bad. 




 this is exactly what I was going to say, pretty much.  I practiced "reading minds" too.  One time I freaked this guy out in theater because I knew what number he was thinking, and he was like "She closed her eyes and leaned towards me and........" so the director went into a tale about how aborigines communicate with their minds.

But yeah, in middle school, I was also good at getting my way, with words.  I could talk my way out of anything.  In high school one time, I even talked a teacher into doing an assignment for something else for me on the board, without him even knowing it.  

I don't try to manipulate people anymore though; that was immature.

You can subconsciously manipulate people as well.   Like one time, back in middle school, we were doing a fund-raiser, selling candles and stuff, and several of us had approached my English teacher to buy some from us.  She said she would after our assignment.  I made sure I was the last one to speak to her/ make an impression before sitting down.  Sure enough, she called me up first.  The others were like "that's not fair; I asked first."  It's just psychology.

now, some of the things you describe sound like more than that.  I was also quite lucky, but this is more than that. 

She was probably just really powerful at manipulating her energy, and she was clearly at least somewhat darkside.

I encountered people who were darkside too.  It's a good thing your mom knew to tell you to wall up your mind.  You have a very open-minded mom.  Did you ever learn any more about protecting yourself?  like how to do an aura shield or anything?  every try to learn to read minds yourself?

Feel free to PM me if you want to talk about this more.  I'm always happy to help. 




 (I'm 21 too! :) )
predictive dreams are normal and quite common, but reoccurring dreams are a strange thing.  I've always thought of reoccurring dreams to mean that the same exact dream repeats over and over on different occasions.  If, using your definition, you take it to mean the same family of dreams, then I've had a few. 
I've had some nightmares that I had a handful of times as a child, but I am not talking about that.

The most recent reoccurring dream I've had (by your definition), was last year; on a few occasions, I dreamed about a secret upstairs to my parents' house, which is accessed through a hidden door in their bedroom closet.  (the physics of the whole thing are physically impossible for the structure, so no, it's not actually secretly there).  The first one was an epic adventure involving aliens and the end of the world and whatnot, but the other dreams I've had there were your average everyday dream that just took place there at least part of the time.  Same place, same layout, same decor.

Now, this second example is a whole different animal.  It's a reoccurring dream and a predictive (or rather, indicative, dream).

Surely you are familiar with the classic "I Love Lucy" sketch with the chocolates on a conveyor belt?  Well, that concept of an assembly line type situation, where things are moving and I am unable to do my tasks on time to keep up and it all goes to hell. I have a dream like that every time I get a stomach virus.  It occurs right before I "get sick" for the first time of the virus.  It's a slightly different scenario every time, but it's always an assembly line type of task that I can't keep up with, and it always ends with me waking up in the middle of the night to run to the bathroom. 

I only have those dreams when I am getting a stomach virus, and I have them every time.  

It's not that useful as a predictor as I only have the dream when It's already about to happen.   




  working with the angels, but for the most part demons and dark energies either don't exist to me or I just completely ignore them.

if you're not fighting dark entities, then what do you do working with the angels exactly?   Healing?  like your name says? 




 you say you were going through some rough stuff, so maybe it was a demon trying to take advantage of your situation, or it could, of course, just be a manifestation of your concerns into a dream.  Fighting your inner demons.  
It is weird that it asked for your soul though.  Never had anything like that happen.  Probably because they know not to bother asking, lol. 




 One day, God beckons to you from above.  "Come with me, my loyal follower, and I will show you the great things you long for."

You find yourself in awe that, having heard your prayers, among all others, he called for you.

You answer the calling, and in a flash, find yourself in Heaven.  Angels assure you that you will go home, that your life won't end here, but they offer you to stay the day.  They give you the grand tour of all the joy and bounty of Heaven bathed in the knowledge, wisdom, and love of God's glory.  

You soak it all up, and are filled with wonder, comfort, and joy.  This could one day be your new home.  You enjoy the splendor of the afternoon; come to love the transcendent way of life.

Then, the angels tell you they must close the gates.  It is time for you to go. You knew it was coming, and it's all well and good.  You want to live out your life, afterall.  It would be nice to assure others of the powerful joy that awaits, to spread the word of the love and tranquility, but the Angels tell you that you mustn't tell a soul.  Unsure of what to say when leaving heaven, you simply thank the Angels and bid them farewell.  

You find yourself back on the street corner at which you were called.  The corner is the same; but, you have changed.  You carry with you knowledge of a most beautiful existence, which you had the pleasure and privilege to briefly live.  You sleep soundly in bliss.

As you awaken, and return to the weekly grind, you realize how dry and tumultuous life can be.  You long to return to heaven.  But you have duties to fulfill here.  We must all do our time.  

You, knowing what joy can be, having experienced the splendor, can feel tortured by its absence.  But you at least know that one day, you will return to Heaven; maybe in a different time, a different way, a different place.  One day, you will bask in the glory again, and live in peace forever.  




 This kind of thing happens to me all the time.  Sometimes things just fall between thing and I find them before too long.  BUT, Sometimes things turn up again months later, in completely random places.  It's very strange 




 life is?  no, you mean studying abroad is. lol 




 logical fallacies ftw 




 or, to be somewhat silly for a change (as the more serious answers have already been said), maybe the seagull was hosting the spirit of the person who drowned, and was desperately looking to share it with anyone who would be receptive.

the fact that it flew off right after is suspicious...

It could also just be a vivid hallucination.  I've never even dreamed my own death in any scenario.  If a dream gets to the point that I might die, I always wake up.  So, I can't speak to that at all. 




 you should post some of these stories on /r/Thetruthishere , if you haven't already 




 I'm glad Ms. Medium was able to help you.  
I'm also pleased to see that you knew your attached spirit's name. 
I knew mine as well.  He's been distant the past couple years.  Actually, I think it's probably I who have been distant, but that's another matter entirely.

Most spirits are harmless (physically); your descriptions before of the basement spirit sounded rather gnarly though.  I'm glad Ms.Medium was able to come and help you assess the situation. 

The camera probably won't be able to pick up on anything you might be able to see (or you might see it in the video but others don't ?  not sure how that works exactly, as I can't see them in the traditional sense myself); not sure about the audio either, as your bf could hear a man but you couldn't.  

Whether or not Steve is your guardian angel, I would think he'd want you to  get stronger rather than rely on him to stand up for you.  Feel free to message me with any questions you might have in that regard, and I'll give you any advice that I can. 




 HELLO; THERE IS SO MUCH PRESSURE IN HERE; I CAN'T HEAR MYSELF THINK OVER THE POUNDING OF THE BLOOD RUSHING IN HERE. 
CAN YOU TRY TO RELAX? TAKE A BREAK?  MAYBE TAKE SOMETHING TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE?  AND THE TENSION?
THAT CONGESTION DOESN'T HELP; YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.  YOUR BRAIN NEEDS MORE OXYGEN! 




 [about the topic choice] by the way, did you know that Mr.Rogers spoke to congress? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXEuEUQIP3Q  




 It is important in life to be a good neighbor.  You may not always agree with your neighbor, but he has just as much right to disagree with you.

Cutting off heads isn't going to solve anything.  If you really want to convince people that you are right, that does not come from violence.  Violence turns people away from you.  If you really believe in your cause, then people will follow you for the cause.  

Words are more powerful than you can imagine.  Use words to show your neighbor why you are so passionate about your mission, and maybe they will see things your way.  Be a movement which inspires people.

If you really want to build an Islamic state, then talk, preach.  Then, maybe, some people will listen.  

If you try to force your neighbor to do something, he will just find a new neighbor. 




 ugh, horns are arbitrary.  Red and impish is devil enough for me 




 Ok, sir, I have completed my inspection, and I have concluded that you are either going to have to do some serious renovations, or I will have to condemn the property. 

For starters, you CANNOT have a lava pool in your basement.  It's a safety hazard, a fire hazard, and every other hazard in the book. 

Also, your home is too tall.  The building code states that no structure built within 30 blocks of the beach can be over 12 blocks high....yours is 100....

Additionally, having a trapdoor outside the entrance to your house, which leads to a dungeon, is highly, highly illegalllllllllllll----------------------------------------------------------
*thud*

 




 yes, of course.  you'd need to figure out why it is there; what it's issue is.  Not necessarily who it is, but that may go hand in hand with why it's there.  

What it is would also be good to know. 

How to deal with the spirit depends entirely on what it is and why its there.  

Using your former home as an example:

If, for example, it's a murder victim, he or she may want to avenge the murder.  Ways to help could be to talk it down to move on, or, if communication is possible, and he or she gives the name of a killer, to bring the truth to light.  Worst case scenario, in a murder victim example, would be that their body is hidden and was never found; if they reveal the location of it, then going with an authority of some sort to exhume it and properly bury it would solve the problem.

Again, that is just a murder victim example; but, even with that one case, as you can see, there can be multiple ways to address it, depending on the specifics.

So, how, might you find out who it is and what its' unfinished business is?  I would look into the history of the house for starters.  Find out who lived there before and if anyone died in the house, or if any of the people who lived there died in suspicious circumstances.

As I said before, the spirit may or may not be related to the other, nice spirits.  Trying to identify them may help identify it.

If those searches turn up nothing unusual, then the entity may have nothing to do with the house, but you, the current inhabitants.  Like I said, it could have been a negative force keeping an eye on you and your brother as you have demonstrated ability to see and sense spirits.  

That was a hypothetical example using your description of your experience at home, but the methodology is applicable to other, similar situations.

-------
Regardless, work on getting stronger, and don't provoke negative spirits, especially if you don't know what they're capable of or what they want. 




 ah; "devil god"; so that explains his appearance. 




 real-life duplication glitch; cool!
worm hole termporarily opened in the space between your bed and nightstand?

I've had things disappear and come back before, but that could easily just be misplacing or someone else moving them.

I remember reading another story on here recently involving finding something and then losing its' twin in the future (so it had glitched into the past).

Maybe it glitched in from somewhere else, and will glitch away again for its real owner to find it...
or maybe its' yours from the future (you like the belt so much you end up getting another when it wears down, but then it goes missing (to the past here) and then you'll find it again and think nothing of it, unless you remember this incident at that time. )

It is documented now, my friend, so if it disappears as mysteriously as it came, and that future thing happens, you'll know.

Better yet, mark it.  Mark it in some indelible unusual way.  Carve your initials inside the buckle where no one would think to look but you.  

so, if, in the future, you do buy another one and it disappears, when it comes back, check for the mark.

Cheers! 




 yes; I was thinking the same thing about the amnesia; everything in this story is medically explainable.  she's lucky she didn't end up permanently paralyzed though.  Epidural gone wrong can do that 




 no problem; I will draw a couple of these as soon as I can 




 I just found this sub today, but there is another sub, which I also found today, /r/DrawForMe which is exactly like this one, so you may want to cross post this there as well.  

Would you want these to be drawn as best as possible, or as if a 4th grader drew it?   




 you did a decent job; that is actually good concept art.  Just take your drawing, and the pics of the individual items, to the tattoo shop, and the tattoo artist will draw it better for you.  That's what I did with mine.  (By better, I mean a better-looking Pikachu for one, and a pointier style butterfly wings on another.)  Their improvements to your concept art can be major or minor, depending on the level of detail and the style you are going for.   




 it's perfectly normal.   Just, ditto everything I just said here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/3008ya/dreams_of_future_events/cpoh780 




 well, if a tree falls in the forest, and no one is there to hear it, it definitely still makes a sound; what changes is whether or not that sound is of consequence to anyone.  

so whether you film yourself or not, you're still going to do whatever you're going to do.  although, subconsciously, knowing that you're filming it, your mind may exercise more control, to make you behave, or the opposite, to make you show off.   




 by vengeful spirit I meant something seeking violent revenge, so likely not.  

An unhappy spirit, certainly.  It may also have been some other entity entirely, keeping an eye on you / keeping tabs on you because you could see the others. 

Or, alternatively, this negative spirit may have a problem with the other spirits, or the house itself.  Murder victim perhaps?  victim of some sort. 




 yeah, like I said on the original post; it sounds like this is a spirit you can peacefully co-exist with.  Just try not to think about it, and when things happen, don't worry about it; just dismiss it, unless it's really bothering you or causing some sort of inconvenience or discomfort that must be addressed; then, just nicely ask it to stop. 




 This is quite common and normal.  Some people are more receptive to it than others; some people remember their dreams better than others; but, it happens to all kinds of people, all the time.

My most recent one was in January.  I've mentioned it in other comments, but basically, in the middle of a normal, random dream, I had to go to the store with my mom to return some socks.  The next morning, guess what my mom tells me we have to do?  But the socks in the dream were white.  The irl ones were black.  But so what?

Some possible explanations (there is not necessarily one right explanation; these may all be valid and true, with some applying to some cases, and others to other cases):

- overheard something in your sleep
- **picked up on the vibes/ wavelengths (vocal, radio, thoughts, etc)**
- self-fulfilling prophecies
- etc. (those are the main three)

another, more far-fetched explanation just occurred to me; this could apply to the ones that occur with longer spans of time in between, and is a perfect illustration by what I mean by "etc."; one could speculate this forever. : maybe your future self was thinking "I wish I knew about this sooner", and that wishful thought transfers the thought energy back in time through your dreams.  

Point is, who knows.  We can sit here and think of plausible theories all day, but the bold one is most often the culprit and has the most logical support.  (I can expand upon this if you like). 




 ah ok; yeah; I just got that impression from what your mom said couple with your incredulous wondering if you did it, lol.  I think others may have got the same impression.

this may be an episode of somnambulism, or it could be someone else (living or dead) messing with you; if so, that could almost be taken as a threat.  But if it's been a while and nothing else has come of it, I wouldn't be concerned.  Particularly, given your mom's statements, it is likely sleepwalking/sleepmoving.  you may have used scissors or a knife on the sheets in your sleep, but if you did that, then that's scary in and of itself. 




 Whoa, ok guys; I just happened to come back here today, browsing, and I see how small this sub is.  I used to keep a blog about my dream adventures here: http://epicdreamadventures.blogspot.com/

Now, I don't sleep enough currently to have as many adventure dreams, but I do still have interesting ones, and predictive/psychic or what have you ones as well.  

I've noticed people posting the latter kind on /r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix 

Anyhow, let's expand, and document our dreams more.

Remember guys, dreams are our subconscious's way of making sense of things.

Sometimes they're really random and silly neuron firing that is vaguely related to the day's media and events.  Sometimes they reveal (metaphorically, like a fable) things we subconsciously picked up on but didn't realize, or things that we don't want to admit to ourselves.

In the case of predictive dreams, time-stamped documentation can help serve as proof that you did indeed dream the event before it occurred.

Lastly, a tip for remembering your dreams.  
1. get enough sleep (obvious)
2. (less obvious) take notes (just an outline/ bullet points) when you first wake up, if you dont have time to write/type it out right then.  This will allow you to come back later and remember enough to tell the story.  Within a few minutes of waking, you forget most of it, but not if you take bullet point notes.  That's how I was able to do that blog so well.  I never added to or embellished anything in those dream stories.  Lots of them were great for that though; full of potential.  I can turn some of them into nice short stories if I wanted to.

Anyhow, let's get back into the dream-story-sharing; what do you say? 




   harmless poltergeisting

I'm skeptical of that statement.  I mean, I understand what you mean (moving stuff), but...that can escalate/ go south quickly; but, again, that depends on the nature of the spirit.  So, again, look up the history.

A friend of mine has a ghost on her property which I did not find out about (having never stayed there long enough) until like the 8th time I'd been there.  we were standing talking.  there was no one behind me, and something thunked/flicked my purse.  I felt the tap, but there was nothing there to have done it.  I expressed my surprise, and then she told me about the boy who was killed in a fire there, and who sometimes messes around in the house. 

he's been around for many many years, and is clearly harmless, not a vengeful spirit.  

Just make sure you look into the history, ok?  can't stress that enough.

edit: to clarify, I was getting ready to leave, and thus, I was wearing the purse (handbag) when he thunked it, which is how come I felt it. 




 just this I guess: https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/301jdo/ghost_hunting/cpoeitn 
























 I posted part one of this story last night; you should read it here: [Part 1 - Invisibility] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/31p11q/part_1_invisibility/) before continuing, so you can understand, at least, as vaguely as I do, what happened.
It has become more urgent for me to get the rest of this story out there, before I completely forget how I got backor that I had even left
*************************
As Diana and Kate attempted to ignore what happened with the phone, and have a normal conversation, I frantically explored the room, trying to figure out what happened.  

I was still in the kitchen, thats for sure.  I could see the phones and other accessories which were left behind as the others vanished, and I could see Diana and Kate carrying on as if the falling phone were the only strange thing to happen that night.  But they could not see me.  

This could not be happening. I wasnt drunk I wasnt crazy Was I?  

*What happened to the others?* I wondered.  *Ive just disappeared as well then, as far as Diana and Kate are concerned.*  I had disappeared from their vision, and presumably, from their memories, as I had witnessed happen to the others who had been in the kitchen after I had returned from the bathroom.  

But, if the same thing had happened to all of us, then where were they?  Why was I, effectively, alone?

Then, it hit me.  This all started after I returned from the bathroom, and had seen the profound darkness seeping in from the window.  I looked up at the glass to see the same starless depths; but this time, I could see the rooftops, as lighter shadows in the darkness.  When I had re-entered the kitchen, it had seemed different to me.  It also seemed that I was the only one who had noticed, and that I was the only one who still remembered the others as they disappeared.  Having held the phone up to Dianas face before dropping it in surprise, I realized that they could not see the personal effects left behind either.  Until I had moved one and made a sound.

I concluded two things: the people disappearing must have gone into another dimension, or reality, thus erasing themselves from this one, and I was in between the two, in some strange fog of an existence.  That would explain why I could see some things from both and could witness and remember the disappearances from this dimension into the unknown.  

But, how did I end up between the dimensions?  Did the whole room shift to another dimension while I was in the bathroom, or, more logically, as I was passing through the door?  Were the people who disappeared also here, in the room, between dimensions, all alone, unable to see each other?  Or could they actually have gone back to our real, or home, dimension?  If thats the case, why didnt I go back too when I disappeared from here?  Wherever here is...   Was I worried about the wrong people?  Were Diana and Kate the ones in danger then?  

*Well if people left behind objects when they disappeared, I wonder if they left behind anything else*

I shook the thought, as it was useless to wonder about the worst case scenarios.  

So what determined when someone would phase out of this dimension?  I needed to try and get Diana and Kate out of there.  I didnt know for sure if the others had gone back to our home dimension, or if they had ended up somewhere elsebut in any case, what I knew for sure was that none of us belonged here, in this detached reality.  

I hadnt actually seen anyone disappear; I only saw the things they left behind.  I wish I had paid more attention sooner.  Maybe I could have seen how it was happening.  I had phased out, although I was only half-way in to begin with, after I had gone under the table.  Chris clearly also disappeared while he was under that table.  

But that didnt make any sense, as  the others had disappeared on the other side of the room.  Could it be from touching the phone?   I had already touched my phone before that.  Maybe my phone was between dimensions with me, so it didnt count.  Maybe Chris took the phone out to light the space under the table.  Do did everyone disappear when they checked their phones?  Can phones not technically exist in this dimension?  Is it like dividing by zero in ours?  

Only one way to find out, I thought.  I had to get Diana and Kate to check their phones.  

I turned towards them.  

Wow; how long have we been here talking?  I thought we were going to a party. Kate seemed a little disappointed.

Diana reached into her coat pocket.  *well that was easy* I thought.  I didnt have to do anything.

She clicked the side button and looked at Kate.  Well, its almost 7:30, so were half an hour early apparently.  

I sank down to the floor.  Not only was my theory out the window into the darkness beyond, but, as inexplicable as it seemed, time was still going backwards.  

Well what else could it be?  I thought, leaning on the table for support to stand up.  As I did, my fingertips brushed against a keychain on the table.  Suddenly, I felt dizzy again.  I thought maybe I stood up too fast, but no, I hadnt.  I had written it off as crouching and standing too fast when I felt dizzy after coming out from under the table with the phone, but that had not been the case this time.  I had touched something someone left behind.  Like Chriss phone, touching that keychain had made me dizzy.  Was I back in this dimension?  

I walked up to Diana.  Kate had gone to the bathroom.  Hey. I said, hopefully.  

There was no answer.

Knowing that the others cannot see the artifacts left-behind, I was sure that touching them is what had made them randomly phase out.  Clearly it only works once, or only in one direction.  In any case, I needed to get them to touch something that was left behind.  But how could I do that if they cant see the things?

I crossed the room and grabbed the lighter off of the floor by the sink.  Holding it made the floor seem to rotate and lean beneath me, but I took careful baby steps, using the table to steady myself.  As I reached the table on which Diana sat, legs dangling, Kate returned to the room from the bathroom.  She looked right at me and said Hey!  Im glad youre here.  What are you doing with that lighter?  I thought you didnt smoke.

Diana looked towards me and back at Kate.  Who are you talking to? she asked, perplexed.

Kate looked confused.  I realized what was going on.  

Its ok Kate; I tried to calm her.  Just come over here and Ill try and explain what Ive seen so far.  

She suddenly looked afraid of me.  Are you a..are you  Her eyes grew wider.  Am I.?

What are you rambling about?  asked Diana, looking concerned.

You cant see her? 

See who?  What are you talking about?

I interjected.  Kate, were in between dimensions.  When I got back from the bathroom, I saw that things had changed in here, and people were disappearing.

What? Kate didnt seem to get what I was saying, until she saw the empty shoes and choker necklace to her left on the floor.  EElizabeth?  She choked out.

Who? said Diana.

Kate looked up and gasped at the site of all the random objects strewn about the room, abandoned where there owners had stood.

Although I had made some sort of sense out of what had happened to us, I was left with more questions than answers.  Not just the obvious where did everyone go? question, but

If I wound up between the dimensions because I was not in the room when the shift occurred, how did Kate get in between them?  Just by leaving the room?

Also, if people phased out of this dimension by touching the objects left behind by others who had phased out, how did the first person phase out?

**************

I still dont know the answers to some of those questions, and the answers I do have are quite vague.  Although it didnt make a lot of sense, at least I wasnt alone anymore at that point.  

The rest of what happened goes way beyond the character limit, so I guess this is a good stopping point to break it up.  I will post the last part tomorrow.  Its already typed up, so I know I wont forget it.
 




 its when you put so much mental energy into something that you sort of make it real.  See, as you probably know, your energy and intentions have an impact on the world around you, so a tulpa happens when you focus your thought energy on a concept and that energy forms into a manifestation of the concept.   




 I am normally an advice-giver, but I just wanted to share the experience I had around noon as I was in the kitchen, washing a plate on which to put my brunch.  

Now, I have mentioned in comments that I have never been one to "see" spirits and such in the physical/traditional sense. I feel things, I sense things, I know things, I see things in my mind's eye, but I don't physically see them.

I have on occasion seen a bug wander off out the corner of my eye, only to turn and see nothing, but that I have learned is a simple optical illusion/ hallucination from stress and is quite common.  I accepted that explanation just fine, and do not really have a reason to be concerned for that even if it's not.

But, what I saw in the kitchen this morning was different.  It was a black shadow, about the size of a kitten.  I was facing the sink, and the shadow came from behind me.  It had leapt up.  I saw it pass by over my shoulder, by my head, and over the countertop.  

The sink and counter-top is not up against the wall; there is a few feet of space behind the counter before the window.  So, this shadow leapt over me and the counter.

Although it was surprising, as I normally cannot see such things, I kept my composure and finished washing the plate, not taking my eyes off of the small portion of floor I could see over the countertop.  I didn't see anything there.  It could have been up against the countertop, or not there anymore. In any case, I was concerned, because, having lived in this building for two months at this point, I had not gotten any impression of any presences here.  I have not sensed anything.  Granted, I have been quite preoccupied with numerous things, but this was completely unexpected.  I wasn't sure what to do, if anything, so I just cooked my brunch and went about my day.

By the way, there are no pets allowed here.  It was like a small chubby kitten in size, but the shape was more like a brush-stroke of black paint, trailing off behind, with tiny nubs at the bottom like feet, but nothing that looked like a head; the top was just a flat contour.

And, I have black hair, which at first instant I thought could have tricked me from the corner of my eye, with the movement over my shoulder, but when it continued over the countertop, I knew that wasn't the case. 


I thought I'd share this with you guys and see if anyone who normally can see such things has any ideas about what they may be exactly?


Edit: tl/dr: I saw a dark shadow leap over my shoulder and the counter top in the kitchen this afternoon.


edit 2: I just realized it's probably a tulpa.  I started writing a fictional multi-part story on /r/nosleep last night, and it took place in a kitchen and involved inter-dimensional phasing shrouded in darkness.  So I think I'm responsible for the shadow.  I don't mean I made myself see it; I saw what I saw; I mean, I have this theory now that maybe I generated or attracted it.  Especially given my writing history [see here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/2zuzkb/predictive_poetry/ )


Is that theory plausible? 




 After reading many of your stories, I have been inspired to share my own.  I was reluctant at first, partially for having to re-live it all in my mind, and partially because, should anything positive come of it, I might have it all stripped away from me.


Anyway, I'm not even sure where to begin.  I guess chronologically would be the best way, or at least, the least nonsensical way to approach it.  

*******************

It was 8:35 pm on Friday, February 27th.  I was at a simple party with some friends, acquaintances, and unfamiliar students in a kitchen in my own apartment building but on a different floor.  It was a normal, chill Friday evening with my favorite cider in hand and my ears buzzing with humor and camaraderie.  


I'm not sure when I lost touch with reality.  Perhaps chronologically is not the best way to go, since I'm not really sure what that is anymore.  By "lost touch with reality," I don't by any means mean drunk.  Although I have never been drunk, and thus cannot relate or compare, I can assure you that I was not drunk at all.  I mean I  physically lost touch.  It's as if one minute, I was in the kitchen talking to my friends, surrounded by others mingling, and, when I returned from "breaking the seal", as I learned to call it, I had shifted into another existence.  


I was still in the building, as far as I could tell.  I entered the kitchen from the same door I had left to use the bathroom, and everything appeared to be normal; the room was still abuzz with chatter, but no one seemed to notice the deep blackness outside the partly-opened window.  Where there had been stars in the sky, rooftops, the glow of light posts, and the shadows thereof, there was now only blackness.  A void so profound, that "black" cannot begin to describe its inky depths.  This was no power outage, as the lights were still on in our building.  There also seemed to be a general haze over the party, like a wispy grey cloud of smoke; although there were no cigarettes lit indoors; it was against our housing agreement.  Perhaps it had filtered in through the window from the depths beyond.  It's as if we were no longer in our city anymore, or even the same dimension.  


No one else seemed to notice though, and I was startled from my reverie by my friend Diana.  

Checking out the view, huh? she said with a smirk.


I realized that, in my contemplation of the eerie vibe of the room, I had been unwittingly staring in the direction of a mutual friend, as he was bent over looking for something.


I must have looked surprised, because Diana began to giggle and slap my shoulder with one hand and her knee with the other.  She was already quite drunk it seemed.  I smiled, shrugged it off, and walked over to our mutual friend.  


Hey Chris.

Oh.  Hey he replied, not looking up from under the corner table.

I had shrugged Dianas comment off so easily because I am not particularly concerned with butts.  Backs, on the other hand

Is everything ok? I said as his back and the rest of him disappeared under the table.

yeah, Im just looking for mah msudfhsdjf ssfkjd.

what?

Im just loodsljflkjsfd msuhdfshduo.

I wasnt sure if it was because of the table or because he was facing away from me, but his voice was getting harder to distinguish from the dull roar of the party.  


I turned around to see that half of the others, the people I didnt really know, had disappeared.  I walked back over to Diana; she was now talking and laughing with our classmate Kate, the only person in our group who was shorter than me.  I asked them where the others went.  
Diana laughed.  What are you talking about? she asked with a scoff; everyones still here.  As she giggled at my perceived silliness, I realized that, in her state, it just wasnt registering.  Kate, on the other hand, was just as sober as I was; so, I was quite disturbed when she said that she didnt remember there being more people in the kitchen, but if anyone had left, theyd probably gone to the club, since she vaguely remembered someone mention dancing.  Although it was strange that they didnt remember seeing other people, the explanation was at least somewhat satisfactory at the time, although I wish now that Id paid more attention.


I turned around to address my other friend, Elizabeth, who was chatting with a guy I didnt know.  She introduced him as Bradley.  We chattered about our courses and other general topics for a while, and when I finally turned around again, and walked to the other side of the center table, I saw something that made me wish I had gone that way sooner.  Finding a phone left on the table is nothing unsual on its own, but finding a phone on the table, a lighter on the floor, earrings on the counter, keys by the fridge, and an odd assortment of other personal effects strewn around where at least fifteen other people had stood just minutes before.that is pure terror.  I whipped around and made for my coat.  When I pulled out my phone and unlocked it, the screen said 8:30 pm.  But I was certain I had arrived at 8:35, and that had to be at least an hour ago.


Elizabeth, Bradley, Diana, Kate, and about 6 other people were still in the room.  Then, I thought of Chris.  From where I stood, across the room, I had a clear view under the corner table.  The only thing there was a cellphone.


I darted over to Diana and Kate.  Not knowing any of the others names, and in light of her previous refusal to acknowledge that anyone else had even been in the room, also in my mounting hysteria, I grabbed Diana by the shoulders and demanded Wheres Chris?


Who? She asked.

I took a step back.  Chris.our friend?  You were just making fun of me for looking at him five minutes ago.

Youre funny. Diana gurgled as she spoke; she was beyond intoxicated; I was surprised she hadnt passed out.  I dont know what youre talking about.

I turned to Kate, and she was just watching this exchange with a curious expression, still holding the same small glass of soda.
I needed to know I wasnt crazy.  Against my better judgement, with a sense of dread and morbid curiosity, I lunged under the table and grabbed the phone.  


When I stood up, I felt dizzy.  I must have dove under the table and back up far too quickly.  I waited a moment for the haze to steady before clicking the side button of the phone.  The screen lit up reading 7:55 pm.  Although I was disturbed by this, I was relieved to see the background was a picture of Chris, Diana, and some other classmates at some sort of event.  I rushed over to Diana and Kate to show them.  I saw them talking and laughing like normal.  Diana did not seem to be drunk at all.  


See? I said, holding the phone up to their faces.  Right there; thats Chris, and you, and Elizabeth.


But Diana didnt seem to hear me.  She looked sober, but was too busy laughing to even acknowledge what Id said.  I turned to my right, where Elizabeth and Bradley had been standing, only to find a pair of shoes and a choker necklace there instead.


I dropped the phone.


The resulting shatter echoed like a deafening roar on the tile floor, and finally got Dianas attention.  She looked down at the phone.  There was an expression of shock and disbelief in her eyes, as she turned to Kate, who looked equally perturbed.  


*Yes*, I thought.  Theyve seen the picture and they know Im not crazy now.  


They looked up from the phone to the ceiling, and then looked right through me at the opposite wall.


...maybe it fell off the table. Kate offered sheepishly, looking at Diana with a hopeful expression, wanting to make herself believe it too.
yeahthat must be it Diana trailed off.


I realized then that they were visibly creeped out, but not because they realized everyone was disappearing, one by one, but because the phone had just inexplicably fallen at their feetbecause they couldnt see me.

*********************

I am feeling really drained, so I will have to continue this tomorrow

edit: fixed some spacing issues

edit: here is the link to [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/31tekm/part_2_just_a_phase/) 




 that's interesting; I haven't heard about people having higher charges before.  I've only heard of/ been concerned with auras, energy, and sensitivities.  I've screwed up several overhead projectors in one sitting, but that was on purpose, so I don't think overcharging on purpose is quite the same thing as having a higher resting charge.... 




 this is an old thread from here, but it shows how a lot of kids have talked about past lives, so you're far from alone on that http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1d2v7i/parents_of_reddit_what_is_the_creepiest_thing/  




 dreams offer insight into our subconscious; things that have been bothering us, things we don't want to admit to ourselves, and things that we've picked up on but haven't given much thought to.

It sounds like you have been shaken up by recent events in your life, and facing these events has made you contemplate your own mortality.

It is interesting that you chose to attack the train rather than find out what was wrong and try to better the situation.  Perhaps this means that you are approaching this life event from the wrong angle and it is tearing you apart; you see others carrying on and you on a whole different level, unable to carry on as they do.  

Perhaps this dream serves as a sign that you need to approach the situation differently, so that you may come out better/ in one piece. 




 dreams provide insights into our subconscious; things we are worried about, things we don't want to admit, and things we picked up on but haven't actively thought about.  

I don't think it's just about your emotions.

I don't know what you're going through personally, so only you can make this determination, but it seems like you are worried about expectations or decisions you have to make, like everyone is looking to you to come through on that, and that scares you and makes you feel like your world is either falling apart or changing around you.  

Perhaps its a big decision which will shape your future? 




 I second this; /u/friend-killer , if you are sensitive /open to that sort of thing, then things that want attention seek you out more because they know they can get it.  They can sense it (just like how some predatory animals can smell fear). Although these occurrences seem harmless.  

I'm not sure what /u/smeefeltz means by getting your charge checked.  I would imagine he or she means getting someone who can feel/sense auras and energies to get a feel for you and see what kind of and how much energy and vibes they can sense from you.

Not sure how you go about finding legit people in person though. 




 I realized after reading this that the demon (or other thing) was fucking with them the whole time, since it knew they thought the room next door was the suicide room.  The whispers and whatnot that they heard from that shared wall were only coming from there to make them continue to believe that was the room rather than the room they were in. 

I also, like others have said, thought Beth could be a ghost or something.  Given now that they never saw her out of the room, I'm thinking Beth may have been a manifestation of the thing, or a shared hallucination caused by the thing.  It's kind of a stretch, but it's possible.  If not, then the thing heard her tell them the room next door was the suicide room, and proceeded to fuck with them like so.  

It's just another layer of fucked-up ness about the whole thing.   




 knowing that you're dreaming is one thing, controlling it is quite another.  When I get consistently adequate sleep, becoming self-aware in my dreams is automatic.  Taking control is another story.  I don't deliberately try to do that much, because it takes some of the fun out of a dream for me; the random adventure is what makes dreams great.  Also, you can't gain insights into your subconscious thoughts, or things you've perceived but didn't consciously acknowledge or admit, if you control the dream. 

I have taken control a couple of notable times.  The speaking thing is definitely important.  The best dream I took control of started with my appearing in my old school, recognizing it was a dream, and asking a janitor what year it was.  From there I went on to explore, and gained some insight into what made some of my classmates tick.  I was in control of myself, but I did not try to manipulate the dream itself.  I just explored around as an observer.  

The other notable time I took control, I took off flying through a massive library on a griffon, and I lost confidence and began to plummet for a while before I picked up altitude again, but everything felt fake and it was no longer fun or magical.

now, if you are having a bad dream, you need to know how to wake yourself up.  Once you know you are dreaming, the only thing you need to do to wake yourself up is to get off to an area where no one will disturb you, close your eyes, take deep breaths, and count backwards from whatever number feels natural to you.  I use 10, but that may be because figured that technique out around that age.  Use whatever number works best for you.  With 10, I was usually awake by 3 or 4.  Some people say to wake up from a dream, you need to fall asleep, so that may work for you as well.

I hope you can gain some insight and/or ideas from this 




 The waters were rougher than ever before; I remember that night like it was yesterday.  The water level had risen quickly, and unseen forces lifted me up from behind and tossed me around the waves.  I could see a pirate ship in the distance, battered by the stormy seas, and bearing a large bite-mark on the port flank, perhaps from a run-in with the great white on the horizon.  I could faintly hear the sailors screaming at each other in a panic. IT WAS LARGER THAN ANY CREATURE I HAVE EVER SEEN one pirate yelled.  

The unseen force lifted me again, but this time, it poked me in the eye.  Its digits must have been enormous, as just one of them obscured my whole face as it lifted me from the tumultuous waves, placing me right next to the ship.  However, the pirates did not seem to notice me, as they were absorbed in a panic over the thing which had just placed me there, passing closely over the mast. STEADY NOW, SHES COMING BACK AROUND Shouted the captain as he gripped tightly to the wheel, trying to maintain control of the ship. FIRE THE CANNON he screamed as loud as he could, in an attempt to be heard over the thunderous thrashing of the waves. The captains face paled with terror when, instead of cannonballs, water started flowing from the cannons. WEVE SPRUNG A LEAK CAPN one of the crew members shouted. WE AVNT GOT MUCH TIME the captain shouted. To my horror, the ship was quickly swallowed into the shadowy depths.  I wondered if I would be next.  

As I tried to swim away against the current, to no avail, I heard a rumble.  Sputtering and gurgling, the ship rose once again from beneath the waves, just as quickly as it had gone down.  The crew, though thoroughly soaked, seemed otherwise unharmed.  They gasped with shock as the massive limb pulled away from the ship loosening its grip.  They had been in its grasp the whole time.  As the water shrank away beneath me, and began to spiral in a whirlpool, I realized I had been picked up by the creature too.  It squeezed me with such force that it knocked the wind out of me with a shrill squeak.  I gasped for air as it relaxed its grip.  Although my back was to the creature, I realized it was bigger than I had first thought, as it rose up to its full height, towering over the waves and the seemingly tiny pirate ship.  Then, I felt it; a sharp, stabbing pain in my rear.  IT WAS GOING TO EAT ME!  Then there was a harsh booming sound, startling the creature to release me.  

I landed upside down, head first, onto the green, fuzzy ground.  My heart was racing; but then, I felt a gentle touch cradle me and wrap me in something soft.  It seemed to massage the pain and fear right out of me.  When I emerged, I was completely dried.  Then it picked me up and dropped me into a brown room, with the great white and the pirate ship. Through a crack in the wall, I could see the backs of the smaller and larger creatures as they walked away.  Then the lights went out, there was a loud thud, and we were left to ourselves until the next night. 




 funny dream; made me laugh out loud. 

my ex told me about a weird dream he had last week which ended with my mom hopping onto my back and me running off like a horse into the sunset.  That was freakin hilarious. 




 Another possibility is that we all just mis-read it/ mis-pronounced it as children, and remember our incorrect pronunciation rather than the real spelling.

It's also possible there are some kids out there who perceive it as Berenstein like we used to... 




 well she was too drunk at that point to think clearly 




 well, now, I've actually come to no sleep because most of the stories here are of far better quality than those in /r/creepypasta 




 truly amazing; the general premise of a roller coaster with secret split tracks to unknown fates reminds me of a Goosebumps book called Horrorland which I read as a child.  Your interpretation of the concept though is much better I think, because it is more true to life (Horrorland involved monsters of the imaginary kind rather than the real, human kind).

I'm sure you've heard of H.H. Holmes and his world's fair hotel? 




 not necessarily.  

The idea that it was a shift in reality implies, as some people in the other linked threads pointed out, that those who always remembered Stain were either moved into this reality with the spelling, or we were all moved into theirs.  

If it is about our perception of reality, then those who always remembered Stain didn't experience the shift in perception that the rest of us did, meaning they already perceived the world this way before the event that caused the rest of us to shift to this perspective.

We all perceive things differently, so it stands to reason that some people already perceived it in the Stain way 




 as far as the second 2 are concerned, read this and maybe get your eyes checked https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/31bkpi/meta_psa_see_something_out_of_the_corner_of_your/

Although I have had things disappear and come back, as have we all. 

The beiber thing is interesting.  In relation to the first one, someone else recently posted about having seen a movie before it came out so maybe talk to them? http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/31cev8/i_saw_a_movie_before_it_even_came_out/ 




 This is mind-blowing.  I used to pronounce it BerenstEEn, and there is no way I would say steen with an a in it.  

This is incredibly disturbing.  But I have a theory.  I read about the shifting realities idea, and I think it is much simpler than that. 

Reality did not shift; our perception of it did.

(the following theory comes from my experiences studying Criminal Justice and Psychology formally, and science informally, as well as my personal thoughts)

It is a well-known fact that everyone perceives and experiences things differently.  This is why 10 people could witness an event and have experienced it and remembered it in 10 different ways.  This is due to one's perceptual set, or frame of reference.  We all perceive and understand the world differently, in our own unique ways, based upon our experiences and understanding.  (for a clear and simple example, someone from the developing world would experience DisneyWorld fireworks differently than a Los Angeles native). 

Although each individual's experiences shape his or her perceptual set, large portions of it are shaped by culture.  So, let's consider our western young-adult demographic as a culture for this situation.  

Something caused a sharp shift in our culture's collective frame of reference.  We now perceive the world differently than we did as children (not necessarily just from becoming adults, although that is possible), and thus the shift from Stein to Stain is not a shift in reality, but rather a shift in our perception of reality.  We can find no record of Stein because no matter what we look at, we will perceive it as Stain.

The cause of the shift could be adulthood, 9/11, or anything else which has greatly altered all of our perceptual sets.

Thoughts? 




 I used to blog mine, back when I consistently got enough sleep to have and vividly recall interesting dreams (meaning High School). From August 2009 to September 2011 I posted 113 dreams.  Many of the ones I posted could easily be adapted into stories, but I didn't edit or embellish them for the blog.  you can check it out here if you want: http://epicdreamadventures.blogspot.co.uk/2009/12/scb-dream-7-haunted-house.html   (the link is to one of the more memorable ones) 




 I've had lots of things like that happen, but the most notable was one time when my family and I were coming back from a road trip.  We had gotten souvenirs for friends and such, and the bag continaing them just disappeared in the car.  It was well in there, so it didn't just fall out.  And even when we cleaned the car out to trade it in, we never found it.  At one point before trading it in, my dad even found a gap/secret compartment under the seat, and the bag wasn't there either.  They just disappeared. 




 hi; sorry I took so long to get to this; I had an essay due before Spring Break.  Anyhow, here is one for the first story, where the dragon burns down the boat.  http://imgur.com/2bordiM

I noticed the other you've recieved is in black and white, so I left it as such.  Would you prefer they be in color?  

It just occured to me that, if this is going to be printed out and distributed to the class, that they could treat them like coloring books :) 




 it's just the standard human level of psychicness :) 




 I actually just last week had something like that happen, where my ex and I both, the same night, had dreams which involved me being at his house.  It was weird.  




 that happens to me too with facebook.  I'll have it up in the background while I'm doing something else, and then I'll randomly un-minimize it just in time to see a message come in.  It's like I could sense I was about to get a message.  Happens almost every day. 




 Actually I have this all the time; I call it my mental alarm clock. 

I always wake up around 5 minutes before my alarm, every day that I have somewhere to be.   I think I adapted this way because being awakened by an alarm is unpleasant and jarring, so I guess this is my subconscious's way of helping me avoid that and wake more gently. 

It works even if I forget to set the alarm though, or flip it on.  I still wake up 5 minutes before the alarm time.

I am studying abroad now, and I was afraid at first that I would lose  my mental alarm clock to the time change/ jet lag, but I didn't.

It's not just about waking up though.  I think this works for me because I tend to remember things if I write them down.  Like, if I make a shopping list, then I remember what I need without actually having to look at it.  Same with class notes.  The act of writing things down makes me memorize them.  

So, I think the mental alarm clock is related to that, in a general sense, seeing as I don't write down the time I need to wake up...

Do you also remember things just by writing them down? 




 *sipping the lemonade I just bought*
So, how's business going?  Oh, you've made $60?  Good for you.
Oh, no I am happy for you, it's just not as much as you think it is.  See, when you grow up, and have bills to pay, $60 doesn't go as far as it does when you're just buying candy and toys. 

Time works the same way; it's all relative.

When you've only been alive for 5 years, one year is a fifth of your life, so it feels longer to you.  But when you're 10, like yourself, a year is only a tenth of your life, so it should feel half as long as it did when you were 5.  As you get older and that fraction gets smaller, days, months, and years feel even shorter, because the more you live, the smaller that year is in comparison to the rest of your life.

Thanks for the lemonade 









 I've never heard of a lighter melting though.  I don't smoke and neither does my family, so that may be why.  It still strikes me as bizarre.  

If Olivia is a thing, and not just a series of freaky co-incidences, she seemed to be harmless up until seeking revenge for the insult.

Perhaps, to settle this, attempt to contact her again (sans-Ouija), and see if you get any kind of response.

To contact her without the Ouija (and please never use that thing again;  it invites evil spirits), gather everyone who has seen these events or been part in contacting her before (as best as you can; not necessarily the childhood friends, but the recent ones.), sit in a circle, relax as if to meditate together, then ask if she is there.  and take it from there.  IF she responds, then tell her you are sorry for insulting her (that should come from the friend who said the FU), and then maybe ask what she wants (but in a nice helpful way, do not say "WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM US?" ; say something like "Is there anything we can help you with so that you can rest in peace?"

I hope this is helpful; Let me know how it goes. 




 Coincidence or not, the gas and lighter is a dangerous situation. 




 I believe by vertical and horizontal op was talking about the way the bed was facing in the room, not that it was upright. 




 thank you :) 




 I love birds; I have pet birds.  

However, I have seen a negative entity once that presented itself to me as a dark bird.  So it's possible.

How high up is it?  Can you see it well?  Can you tell if it is just sitting there or if its looking at you specifically?  You said power-line, so I'm assuming you can't see its' features?  IF it were an entity of some sort, it would not have normal features.

the fact that your parents see it too may indicate that it is not a spirit, but then again, it could also indicate that whatever it is doing there involves all of you. 




 independent of your dad's experience in particular, to address the issue of sleep paralysis, it is very real, you can induce it on yourself, and it is fucking terrifying.  I have never done it myself, but I know people who have, and I once, last year, had a nightmare in which I was in sleep paralysis;  I was fully aware but couldn't move a muscle or speak.  That was the most terrifying dream I have ever had.  To experience that for real though must be so much worse.  The person I know who has done it was horrified by it as well. 




  not very exciting
um, you were pushed; I'd say that's pretty exciting.

The fact that your mom saw and experienced some of these things too is quite interesting. 




 well, difficulty communicating and adhering to societal norms is a disability for sure, although many other things lead people to the same problems.  Speech impediments, which are entirely physical, and shyness or even psychological disorders, like agoraphobia, which are entirely mental/chemical.  Its' classification as a disability makes it easier to get the therapy and assistance one needs to improve his or her ability to function in society.  Just like how Jewish became classified as a race despite being a religion; it helps legally with prevention of discrimination, making more laws applicable.  

So yes, it is an impediment; the symptoms, when isolated, are not necessarily pathological; the syndrome as a whole is though.  The degree of impediment is what varies.

That's just my perspective from my personal experience.  
My brother has grown out of a lot of his behavior/conformity to norms issues (by societal norms I mean understanding that you're supposed to be quiet in some situations, that he should tell an adult if he's going somewhere, that you say hello when someone comes in or you come in, and say goodbye when leaving and so forth).  Those are things that, delayed though it may be, you eventually learn (except in the extreme cases where the person is completely retreated into his or her own world).  

Learning to use speech to communicate also came with some maturity I think; to realize that he must put in the effort to train his vocal and oral muscles to make sounds properly in order to communicate to live life.  As a smaller child though, the importance of working on verbal communication is not fully graspable to someone who doesn't fully understand how social interactions work. 




 that's a good point; I never thought about it in practical terms, like applying it to the so called autism epidemic.  (I'm not saying there isn't one; I'm just saying I don't think it should be called an epidemic). 
My brother is autistic; but I never really tried to mind communicate with him much because I didn't want to run the risk of establishing a strong mind link, as I don't want him to be listening in on my thoughts randomly picking up on them, nor do I want to hear his. Especially now that he's getting older. 




 well now.  I think telepathy is also something we are all capable of, in terms of mind reading and mind communication.  Surely you've tried it at some point? 




 Pinky: "So what are we doing today?"

Brain: "The same thing we do everyday; try to take over the world!  I've figured out how we can actually do it.....*money*."

Pinky: "What do you mean?"

Brain: "Well the people in power get there by spending enough money, and once they're in power, corporations and interest groups pay them money to see things their way."

Pinky: "oh....what?  How does that help us?"

Brain: "we can use money to spread our message.  See, Net Neutrality laws have finally passed, which at first, I thought was great, because people will be able to see what we post on the web; we won't be censored or throttled into oblivion because big companies paid to have their sites load faster, or because other evil masterminds paid to have their page load faster than ours. "

Pinky: "..so how-"

Brain: "LET ME FINISH!  But, then I realized that, if there was no Net Neutrality, then *we* could use money to make our site the fastest most prominent site on the web.  We'll get all the attention we deserve.  SO WE CAN BRAINWASH THE WORLD!"

Pinky: "so how do we reverse net neutrality?"

Brain: "real simple: by getting people to vote *Republican*."

Pinky: "that's so crazy, it just might work!"

Brain: "we must also convince everyone that Net Neutrality is bad for them; that having the FCC regulating the internet will lead to restrictions and censorship."

Pinky: "so...you want to end Net Neutrality so that we can pay to be internet famous, with money we don't have, so that we can brainwash people; but to get there, we have to brainwash people?"

Brain: "PRECICELY!"

 ah ok; I got a more "born different/ with abilities" notion from the brief definition I read.  

Then, I agree with the term; seeing things differently with a more open mind.

 the silent treatment is much worse than grounding, buddy

(especially when there isn't much to ground when you're kept on a tight leash) 




 People laughing in your face man.  The one time I ever got suspended, I was in 10th grade (year 11 for any Brits reading), I was scared and devastated, kind of internally losing my shit.  The particular assistant principle who was asking me questions and filling out the paperwork was a real jerk to me.  I'm not saying I deserved to be treated specially or anything like that, but I believe I deserved a basic level of human respect, you know? 
In my fear and anxiety I asked a kind of silly question, which he could have just answered matter-of-factly or maybe, maybe chuckled at, but instead he more than guffawed; he outright laughed out loud to my face when he answered me.  
This of course only served to make my fear and anxiety (about what awaited me at home) much worse.

I was in trouble though, so that's one thing.

Last semester, I am in Grad school btw, during a meeting about our theses (dissertation in other nations), just to go over general guidelines, I asked a serious question about the scope of the topic area (trans-atlantic comparative policy as opposed to a purely European focus), and the professor leading the meeting did the same obnoxious laugh in my face and rather than saying "yes, people have done that; it fits the program name well." he said " *guffawing laughter* well it has to have some European element to it; otherwise, why are you in [this] program?"

Thanks; thanks a lot.  Made me want to leave the room at the time, but it was a mandatory meeting.
He made it clear that he didn't think I belonged there when it came to my assignments too, but it's ok.  I'm not the one with a problem, so I don't let these things get to me. 




 I graduated in 2011, and I consider it quite a while ago because so much has changed in the world and everyone's lives.  We, and the world, were all so different it seems. 




 that and the unauthorized breaks just show she was spoiled too much as a child and cannot fathom not getting whatever she wants /  having her way.  




 could also be a creeper using that line as an excuse to blatently photograph pretty people 




 that is disturbing.  *shudders* 




 love the quote; I googled it and couldn't find an author though.  Probably because it's worded slightly differently.  Great nonetheless 




 That's an interesting angle, comparing it to physical motion, and it makes perfect sense.  Although functionally, telling your arm to move and using your mind to move it as it is done normally, do not really seem different, your arm doesn't move if you just think it, you have to physically get in there and make it move.  

So based on your analogy there, and my experience, perhaps the "mental theater" really is necessary....

Seeing as the thought that is used to move the arm is not in the form of words.  I guess it is in the form of energy. 




 OK, I got an opportunity to test this hypothesis this morning.  It could be a mental block, so others must try it to give the results more validity.


So , my nose started bleeding at 8:17.  (I am prone to that as you may have inferred.). Just as I was about to leave.  I covered it with tissue but used no pressure.  It was going quite heavy.  I tried twice to just concentrate on willing it/ mentally asking it to stop, with words.  It was still going strong.  At 8:18 I tried it the usual way, visualising the energy and the physical healing.  It stopped immediately.

For reference, prior to realizing I could do this for myself, my nosebleeds would typically last upwards of 5 minutes with the help of a cold compress, longer and slower without.  So yeah, its a major blessing. Point is though that, even though it theoretically should work without the visualization, this proves that, at least for me, it is definitely quicker andeasier with. 




 I think that's more of a mind trick, but what a neat way to be opened to the possibilities 




 I love that episode. 




 neo-imperialism FTW! 




 not so weird at all; I noticed this about myself, and I googled it and its common.  I thus included it in a fictional story I wrote on /r/nosleep : https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/31p11q/part_1_invisibility/ 




 It's nice to be taught by a parent in the home.  My dad is heavily into all martial arts and the mystical concepts which stem from that interest.  He studied meditation, and has books on all sorts of related things.  However, he never really got into any of these things with me, only vaguely maybe.  He is fascinated with levitation through meditation.  Other than that.... 




 I would have upvoted you, but your points seem to go well with the Darwin Award concept IMO 




 Worst Case Scenario: that person is disturbed because your "Fartglare" looked sexual. 




 telekinesis; that is very ambitious.  When you've been practicing with that for long enough, does the time and effort it takes for it to work decrease, as I have always suspected? 




 in my experience; telepathy is a very personal connection.  Opening those lines with people you don't know well is quite dangerous.  If you are not mentally strong, they can easily plant ideas and affect what you think you think.  Watch out for that if you're even remotely serious. 




 "healing service"; learning "from a master"  ; that sounds impressive.  Ancient, formal arts; I think it's fascinating how different cultures and traditions use such different means to accomplish the same goals (and also have a variety of different goals in some cases...) 




 smart teachers make you swap papers twice.  two graders. 




 It depends on how exactly this was all measured.  There is narcissism, and people who come across as self-righteous jerks. 

Then, there are people who have confidence, who can be kind of know-it-alls, and other such traits, but that is not the center of one's character.  It is possible to be confident and believe you are right about things but also know you are not the center of the universe and be a kind individual.

I completely understand the attraction to confidence for a number of reasons.

The particular statement about manipulation is concerning, but I don't think such a questionnaire can truly evaluate these intricate, elusive components of a personality.  




 yes; although blind people can do things without seeing it, it is undeniably easier when you can see what you are doing. 




 wow; well kudos for picking it back up!  I never fully dropped it, but I have been somewhat inactive the past 5 years as well.  (Which was mainly to protect someone and because of a relationship I was putting all my energy into.  But that's irrelevant.)

I too have the dreams, quite frequently when I get enough sleep.

Getting adequate sleep will help you have more of the dreams. 

You can remember dreams better if you make a note of it right away.  Keep a notepad and pen on your nightstand.

and thanks for the welcome :) 




 well, as mentioned above, I always remembered "Stein" too.  At least you have something more stable/concrete to tie it to.  That confirms that we didn't just collectively mis-pronounce then.

now I can feel uncomfortable again.... 




 ah, ok, so that's a little different from what I understood you to mean. 

So the issue is not whether or not the energy is behind the effect, but whether that energy is simply the intent and we are just attempting to process it by visualizing it.

In general, the energy is not physical, it is electrical.

The visualizing I guess is a method which allows us to channel and control the energy.

The intention and the energy are two separate things though.  

You need the energy; things don't happen with intention alone, not really. For example, I intended to go to the store today, but I didn't put in the energy to get up and go do it.

The "sensory theater" of visualizing things is a method of using your mind to channel it, although you're right, it's not truly necessary for the effect.  The energy itself is though.  (In my humble understanding). 




 well clearly your upbringing has had a lasting effect, seeing as you eat bunnys 




 i've come to the same taking chances conclusion.

I was only single for three days in high school; I started HS in an LTR and finished it an in LTR which just ended last year.  I am now in grad school with a deplorably limited amount of expierience in this confusing "game" if you will.  

Depending on how you look at it, you could say the taking chances has worked out ok so far, but I've learned that you should still be careful when taking chances, so as not to ruin anything along the way.  So, I'm still holding the taking chances philosophy, but I'm being cautious.  Perhaps too cautious, but I honestly don't know what to do in any situation I am faced with in this regard, as I have practically 0 experience in being single. 




 I'm in grad school.  I hate to redo anything.  I hate to even retype something if the backspace accidentally makes the browser goes back.

I would be super super pissed.

I would try to figure out how to come back, and if I couldn't, I'd focus on not making the same mistakes and go about things in better more respectful ways. 




 and mine was 100% covered by my existing insurance!
Thanks Obama :)   (in a 100% non-sarcastic way) 




 you're welcome!  I hope this gives you some ideas for experiments to use that excess energy 




 Great!  feeling your energy is a good first step.

You need to be able to clear you mind to control it well.  The best exercise starting out is to meditate and think of nothing.  It doesn't have to be for long, just start small and go longer as you get better at it. I mean absolutely nothing.  Not your breathing, not your heartrate, not the fact that you're thinking of nothing.  **nothing**

Separately from that, if you're not already doing so, visualize your energy.  Visualize it moving through your body and to your hands.  Focus on your breathing as you do so.  Visualize it flowing as you breathe out, but don't release it.  Visualize it flowing into a ball between your hands.  

As far as actually using it is concerned, you have to have an intention with a need or desire behind it which drives you; you focus on harnessing your energy as described above, and you use your intentions to direct it to a purpose. 

That is my attempt at a vague description of the process.  If you have any specific questions, please feel free to ask 




 yes, people do; I personally don't have the patience for it.  I'm sure it gets faster and more effective with practice, but starting out it takes an insanely long period of intense concentration and I'm just not up to the task.  

A friend of mine did it in class when he was little and freaked people out.  

now, something marginally easier which I have accomplished is using energy to manipulate electronic devices.  It has a visible physical result, but the energy doesnt have to be converted into physical kinetic energy; it remains as an electrical impulse just as it started in your mind, which is my understanding of why this is easier to do.  

My most successful experience occurred, in 8th grade, out of necessity, which is key actually; unless you are really practiced in these things, for it to work, you have to **need** it.  There is great power and energy in desperation.  With which I incapacitated 7 overhead projectors in various ways (as I did not specify a method in my intention).  The great necessity felt by my 13 year old mind?  I had trouble reading from those antiquated projectors and I did not want to be made to get glasses.  My desire to not have to get glasses was a really intense need to me.  

The point of adding that last detail is that, **need** is relative.  It's the energy created from the need that fuels this.  

Being full of energy as you are, you probably don't *need* the **need**. 




 this is quite rare for me.  I usually just know things are going to happen, or that someone will call or whatever, maybe see them in my mind. 

I do regularly, at least a couple of times a month, smell something randomly that isn't there.  Like, I randomly smelled chocolate chip cookies burning in an oven one night last week.  These smells usually last a minute or two.  Sometimes less.  But they are quite distinct, and are not the result of a strong craving, as I have no desire for burnt cookies.  

Now that you've made me think about it, the first explanation that occurred to me just now is that maybe someone I have a connection to was smelling these things and the sensory perception transferred to or was picked up by me.

In any case, seeing as you have experienced Clairalience, pay more attention to what you smell.  Then test yourself by focusing on something you couldnt possibly know or have smelled yet (like, what your mother or neighbor, or grandmother in another state, is going to cook for dinner tonight).  Don't try too hard or you'll disappoint yourself with a mental block.  Just relax and focus on imagining them (in this case cooking).  Then, if you do smell something, check later (by calling, going next door, whichever is applicable) to see if what you smelled did in deed turn out to be the case.  Don't be discouraged if it wasn't.  

Trying to harness abilities such as these is an issue of trial and error usually fraught by high expectations and fear of failure.  When you're first trying to do it on purpose, you may smell something at first because you really want to and not because you actually picked up on it.  So don't be disappointed, just keep trying.

Again, the key is not to try too hard.  Just relax and tap into it.

Although I don't have experience with *psychic smells* , I have simply taken the model I have for honing any such ability and applied it to your situation. 

I hope this helps!   




 your wording is a bit convoluted, but I understood the question to mean, are we really influencing things with our energy, or is it more of a self-fulfilling prophecy in which we use our will to lead us to/ give ourselves "permission" do things which make it happen.

Did I understand you correctly?

If so, then, yes and no.  It depends on what you're talking about.  

The giving permission idea can be similar to what happens when one prays for strength or courage to do something.  You give yourself confidence to follow through.

But, that is not how everything works; that is only in those cases which involve personal action on your part.


If you are directing your energy to, say, short-circuit or otherwise overcharge or break a light bulb, that is a matter of physical electricity/energy.  It is a more concrete physical process and outcome which occurs, so it is certainly a result of the targeted energy itself and not the notion of giving it permission to break. 

Living things which can process the intent-guided energy in more than just a physical way is where you question becomes pertinent. 

If you are directing your energy to heal something, for instance, your friend's nosebleed.  When the bleeding stops, it is not because you gave it permission to do so, but because you contributed energy to accelerate the process.  Your energy served as a catalyst.

If its your own nosebleed, then you could argue both ways.  The brain controls the body.  So, yes, you fed energy in to catalyze the process, but, you also, with your mind, ordered your nose to stop bleeding.  You can control your breath, and your heart rate (via adrenaline and nor epinephrine) with your mind; when we tap into a few extra percent of our capabilities to do these things, one could certainly argue we are just using our mind's natural ability, through whatever neurological processes, to control the body.   




 not so clearly for me; my intuition works more like, say I'm planning to go out for a walk soon.  Suddenly I'll feel all throughout me the impulse to "go, go right now" because it'll be beneficial to me.  So I do, and then I run into people with seemingly perfect timing.  It's more vague than what you describe. 




 I'm so glad I came across this thread.  I have been excitedly running into people with whom to discuss these things on /r/paranormal and /r/Glitch_In_The_Matrix , and I had been thinking there should be a sub dedicated to this.  

Anyhow, I wanted to hear from others how you got started working with energy.

Did you read something?  Did someone expose you to it?  Did you have an experience which inspired you to learn?  or Did you simply start without any particular stimulus that you're aware of?  

How old were you when you began?  or Have you been doing it as long as you can remember?

I thought this might be an interesting discussion to have; to compare "origin story"  notes :)

My answers, for example: I have been doing it as long as I can remember, to a lesser extent.  I really awakened my potential at age 12, after having read a book which empowered me to take control of my life and helped me to overcome the social adversities I faced, as well as to explore my full potential (from the theoretical food for thought proposed therein, not the specific content itself). 




 eh, well idk either; that was just my attempt to dismiss it and not dwell on it.  As long as nothing else happens, it's nothing to worry about regardless of what it actually is. 
























 it's interesting that I stumbled across this sub and post today, as I just wrote something, [this actually,] (https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/32b6v3/wp_a_prolific_serial_killer_active_for_many_years/cq9yfny) in which I did not name the character at all, in order to avoid losing any of my readers to a poor (in their opinion) choice of character name.

In the one novel I have written (although it isn't published yet), I used some interesting names (Joster, anyone?), so I can definitely identify with the struggle... 




 thanks so much; I'm glad you did!  I was actually most concerned about the ending, afraid I may have ruined it with my impulsive twist.  Glad that was not the case :)

edit (clarification): I mean only the last detail of the reveal was on impulse 




 took me a minute to get that one 




 ooh!  I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought to go the government mind-control route.  You could develop this with more back story.

edit: figured I'd add a link in case anyone wants to see mine, as it's probably buried. https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/32b6v3/wp_a_prolific_serial_killer_active_for_many_years/cq9yfny 




 I don't think the epilogue was superfluous.  Some of that information was necessary/ helpful (the motivation behind the program), but I agree that it could have been conveyed a different way, within the main text.  Otherwise, good story. 




 nice short response.  I wrote about a chip too, but in an entirely different way. 




  if enough people upvote my post.

really?  That almost as crass as "Upvote if..." 




 your protectors?  
Seeing a shadow figure is interesting.  I usually don't *see* things, so I think that's more of a special gift (though it can probably be a practiced skill if one dedicates oneself); though I can see how it would be both a gift and a curse.  

There are some similar experiences to yours here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/324naz/me_strange_occurrences_throughout_my_life/ 




 wait.  Deja vu.  I read this last week.  I'm serious; I swear.  I'm not sure if I commented on it but I upvoted it and comments for sure.  

Just realized....so this must be a cross post from /r/paranormal then... 




 [meta] I'm sorry I had to make it three comments.  I thought I read somewhere that the limit was 10,000 but you can edit in more up to 40,000.  That didn't work.  It really technically only had to be two, as, according to Word, it was 20K char, but I broke it where it seemed logical.  Anyway, I hope you guys like it! 




 
"ARGHHHHH!!!!!!"  He woke up screaming from the skull-splitting pain.  What was going on?  Who was doing this to him?  Someone was doing this to him.  He did not, and never had believed in the supernatural.  Someone was giving him these names.  Someone wanted these people dead and knew he needed to kill.  Someone was showing him these people.  The same someone planted Pickett's suicide note and caused the media blackout on the case.  The same someone had probably made sure that he never got caught this whole time.

In the 15 years since his first kill, he had never seen any reason why the media and authorities had never picked up on anything.  He didn't know how he had come to accept the dream names as routine.  Now, as the memories were flooding back to him in spite of the pain, he realized he had been better off not knowing.  

In spite of every blast of pain, he remembered the trauma of his arrest.  They had made him for the murder in the woods.  He remembered the suits talking behind closed doors while he was left to stew in a dark room.  He remembered his mother agreeing to sign over his medical power of attorney and parental rights to the state, in exchange for his freedom.  He'd had to sign a paper too, and freedom was all he'd needed to hear.  He remembered talk of an experimental treatment to cure his need to kill.  The promises they made to her to rehabilitate him into a productive member of society.  He had never seen his mother again.  He'd thought he remembered having a falling out with her after he switched careers, but no.  She just dropped off the map.   He remembered the bright lights and antiseptic from the hospital room.

These headaches were not from a tumor.  The government had done something to his brain.  They had been feeding him these names.  They hadn't cured him of anything.  They had turned him into their unwilling assassin.  And they had done everything possible to keep him from finding out about the notes.  How many notes had there been?  

The pain wasn't causing brain damage; it was just an electrical signal.  Still, it got to be so much that he finally passed out on the bedroom rug.  *Or perhaps they could send electrical signals to make him pass out.*  He awoke what seemed like immediately, in a hospital bed.  He had the same characteristic headache in the back of his head.  He reached his hand up there and felt....bandages.

A man in a suit stepped into the room.

"You may not remember much," the agent began, "but you had one of our implants.  It was no longer of use to us in you, so we have removed it."

He blinked several times.  Digesting what the agent had said.

"This terminates the contract you signed.  You will serve the rest of your life sentence for the murder of Nathan Grier in a federal sanitorium, as you are not mentally competent to go to prison.  You suffer from severe delusions, and will be medicated as such so that you may peacefully co-exist with the other patients.  Take solace that you will likely remember nothing."

The suit turned to leave.

"Wait." He managed to croak out through his drugged-up stupor.  The suit stopped and turned towards the hospital bed.  "What happened to my mother?"

"She was a test of the programming, and the implant's ability to short-circuit memory." the agent replied.  "She was your first target."

-------------

TL/DR / Theme Synopsis: The government has basically been inceptioning him to take out targets for them.  He has been an unwilling/unknowing political/convenient assassin.  They took advantage of his mental states and psychopathic needs.  That's why the killings have been hushed and why nothing has happened to him.  He slowly discovers that he's been manipulated this whole time. 




 He awoke to the sound of sirens.  He sat bolt right up in bed, only to find that it was just coming from the TV.  It was 3am.  He'd never kept the TV on so late, or if he had, it certainly wasn't on this alarming channel.   The images on the screen seemed to send him into a trance.  He was sucked into to a horrible flashback.  He could see, first person, a tall female officer leading him by the crook of the elbow, his hands cuffed behind his back.  Images rushed through his mind of interrogation or meeting rooms, board offices, and dark corridors.  Then, in a flash, he could see a bright round light over his head, beaming straight into his face, and smelled the suffocating fumes of antiseptic, then, merely darkness.   He awoke/snapped out of it with a start.  He fumbled for the remote and shut the TV off.  He rolled over and attempted to get some sleep, although he could not shake those images out of his mind.

Had he been arrested?  Had he ever been treated for a mental disorder?  He vaguely remembered taking pills for something as a teen, but these memories, if that's indeed what they were, seemed more recent than that.  

*ARGH!*

He was suddenly accosted by a blasting headache as the sunlight streamed onto his face.  He had not had enough sleep the night before to dream of a victim, or even just a chase.  It was not a restorative sleep at all.  Two kills in one weekend though was more than enough though; he'd just hoped to let off some steam and anxiety.  His memories of the night before were rather vague, which is normal when one wakes for many short periods throughout the night.  

As he poured some cereal and sat down in front of his eggs and spam, he pulled up a search on his laptop.  He wanted to re-watch the news report from the night before, to see if it offered any clues as to who wanted Pickett dead.  No results.

*That's odd* he thought.  He tried rephrasing his search several ways, but still turned up nothing.  The only thing he saw was a quick mention of Pickett's name on the school website.  The blog was gone as well.

This looked like a thorough and hasty cover-up.  It was downright disturbing.  

A paranoid sweat began to build.  He wondered if the cover-up was all for him.

*That's ridiculous.* He thought.  *It's just the nagging paranoia that my day may be coming.*

He could not shake the feeling, however, that someone was watching him.  He decided to settle this by going to the public library, an looking it up there on a different computer.  

He brought only his keys, wallet, and phone into the old musty building; the juxtaposition of 2000's technology with 70's carpeting was a pleasantly jarring atmosphere.  He settled down into a computer and logged on as a guest.  

He surfed the web randomly for a bit, and then conducted the same searches he had done on his laptop.

No Results.

He began to feel light-headed.  Had he dreamed the whole news report?  Was there no letter?

Maybe he should ask someone.  It was risky, yes, but, working as a telemarketer has its advantages, and he felt confident in his ability to pass it off as a casual concerned interest.  

He approached the circulation desk with what he hoped was a look of concerned confusion.  

"Excuse me?"  he attracted the attention of the middle-aged brunette on a computer behind the counter.

"May I help you?"  She asked curtly, but not impolitely.

"Yes, well, I hope so." He began.  "My sister up in Bedford e-mailed me about a teacher who disappeared yesterday.  She said she heard it on the news.  I was trying to look up the news report, but I couldn't find anything."

"Oh, yes.  That poor man.  I saw it on the news last night."  She lowered her voice such that her whisper was now barely audible.  "They say he may have killed himself."

He felt the color drain from his face.

"I saw the report last night, online."  She continued.  "They took it down this morning though, probably at the family's request."  

He swallowed hard.  "Oh, well, thank you for your time."

"You best find something nicer to think about." She offered.  But he was already back at the computer screen collecting his things and his thoughts.

*So I didn't dream it.  It is a cover-up.*  Then, it dawned on him.  *Perhaps his sister planted the note.  Maybe she wanted him dead.*  But that didn't make any sense either.  She had cried on the news report, and her shock and horror had truly seemed genuine.  He knew fake tears.  Those were the real deal.  She had also said that their parents would roll over in their grave if they knew what he'd done.  So there was no other family to retract the story.

*What is going on?* he wondered.  Then, the headache returned, but so much worse.  

He had suffered from these headaches since his early 30's.  Since around the time he'd left manual labor for various positions in legal con-artistry.  

There was someone on a sofa chair to his left, reading a newspaper.  He walked around the magazine rack towards the bathroom, and happened to glance back.  The pages inside the newspaper were blank.

He ducked into the bathroom in a cold sweat.  Was he being followed?  It didn't make sense.  Had he left behind some sort of clue which led the police to a media blackout so he wouldn't know there were on his tail?

*No, you're just being paranoid.*  He told himself.  *This is like the Tell-Tale Heart.  or The Imp of the Perverse.  You are not going to give yourself away!*

And with that, he stormed out of the bathroom, too energized with adrenaline to pee.

He marched right past the magazine rack and made a beeline for the door.  He paused with his hand on the door frame.  Newspaper man was gone.  As he stepped out into the afternoon sun, he heard a helicopter overhead.  This time, it was low enough as it passed over the library for him to make out the labeling on it, or rather, the fact that it had none.  Not a single mark.  Just a solid, jet-black finish.  This was not your standard army chopper.

*I'm being watched.*  He thought.  *I'm being followed.*  He frantically looked left and right as he walked to his car.  *They wanted to make sure I didn't find out the truth.  They're onto me.* 

*My phone.*  he thought.  He dropped it deliberately behind his tires, and rushed into the car and locked the door.  He breathed a sigh.  *Good thing I couldn't afford the model with GPS*

He started it up and wandered around a few blocks before heading home.  *That was silly.* he realized.  *If the police are following me, then they know where I live.*

He turned the key and was dead-bolted inside before a second had passed.

He was nervous the rest of the day, but even so, having not slept the night before, he was out the minute his head hit the pillow.

His sleep was disturbed by the images he'd forgotten from the previous night.  The police station, the cuffs, the dark rooms, the bright light.  But this time, they were followed by bandages, and paperwork.  His mother was there.  Thanks to the medications he'd been on in the past, she'd always had his healthcare power of attorney.  But what were the suits doing there, in his hospital room?  What was he doing in a hospital?  This all felt like a vivid memory clouded in the depths of his mind. If only he could make sense of it all.  

Suddenly, everything was on fire.

He woke due to the searing pain in his skull.  It was strongest on the same spot in the back of his head from which the headaches always originated.  He could swear he had a tumor.  He'd been to the doctors to try and get help for it, but they always drew the same conclusion: that it was nothing and it would go away on its own.  *It's been almost 15 years.* he thought through the anguish.  *It's not going away.*

As he finally drifted back to sleep from exhaustion, and a jungle began to materialize around him, he heard a voice *His name is Richard Leery.*  As he seeped into the dream world, his pain grew silent, replaced instead by images of a man, his next victim.  As he stalked him through the wild, he felt a sense of relief.  But it was short-lived.  As his lucidity increased, he began to draw a damning conclusion.  He slowed his run to a jog.  *What if I don't chase him?* 

***again, last part is another reply because character limit*** 




 He saw a rustle in the woods behind his home, as he was finishing the body disposal process in his shed out back behind his quaint, rural residence.  There was a quick crunching of leaves as if someone had darted away.

*Why did I keep the shed door open?*  He thought.  It was because it was hot and he was all alone, or so he'd thought.

He quickly ran outside, only to find absolutely nothing there.  He stood there confused and unnerved for a minute.  He did a quick search of the area, finding no trace that anyone had been there.  *It must have been an animal* he thought.  

Just then, he heard helicopter blades overhead.  He ducked back inside the shed just in time to see the chopper pass over his property and into the starry dusk.

Helicopters passed over rural areas all the time.  Especially since there was a military base only a couple hours away.  This was nothing unusual.

As he made the final disposal of the aspiring senator's now indistinguishable remains, (*the filthy liar*), and made his way towards the back door, he began to wonder why he had never been caught.  Sure, he knew he was good, and careful, but even the best get caught eventually.  Someone sees something; they get too comfortable and slip up; people start to notice a pattern.  What is stranger is, other than the odd mention of a victim's sudden disappearance, there has been no media coverage speculating that any of these people had been murdered.  Not even a story covering why the crows and other scavengers in this country are extremely fat.

He chuckled to himself at that last one, as he sharpened his Bowie knife in the rustic kitchen.  

His first kill, at the age of 27, had been somewhat sloppy, and he'd really thought he'd be caught as a result.  But now, as a 42 year old veteran of the trade, he had the confidence and experience to pull it off seamlessly every time.  Life had trained him well.  So had his dreams.  In his dreams, he is like hunter; a predator stalking its' prey.  He even felt lucid in these dreams, using them as a training ground to perfect his techniques.  

At first, he had picked his victims based on opportunity, but he gradually began to seek out victims resembling those he had unconsciously stalked in the night.

As any trace evidence of his crimes went down the shower drain, he considered the strangeness of it all.  Starting back with his first kill.  Well, his first human kill.

He had chopped the body into pieces, and buried each one in separate areas in the woods on the other side of town, far back from the road, perpendicular to the river.  

That weekend, a family went camping by the river, and their dog had found the one closest to the riverbank.

Police had sent canine units to scour the area, and were able to uncover 5 more pieces of the body.  They had identified the victim as a missing person.  He only found this out through word of mouth though, as the police had taken caution to keep this story from going national.  The town was suffering as it was, and the last thing they needed was for commuters passing through to find another route or cease stopping there for gas and supplies, or for people to stop camping there.

So the story of 12 year-old Nathan Grier was kept under-wraps, relegated to hearsay and local legend.  


He assumed they never found the rest of the body because animals had beat them to it.  Scavengers.

He had done it with the same Bowie knife he just sharpened.  It had been a gift from his father, a veteran of the Vietnam War.  His old man had committed suicide after decades of suffering with intense PTSD flashbacks; he'd used that same Bowie knife, which the loyal son had carelessly left on a stump out back after skinning a rat.  He was 14 at the time.  By the time the body was found in the morning, the old man had no eyes.  He had seen the crows take off with pieces of his father in the rising sun, leaving behind an empty husk with a soulless stare.  

He set his Bowie knife on his bedside table and turned off the lamp, settling into the covers for his nightly adventure.

----------------------

*His name is Jeremy Pickett.* 

*So it's one of those nights...* he thought.  Sometimes, his dreams were more lucid than usual.  He had long been pursuing victims resembling the prey in his dreams, but occasionally, the prey had names, names which were stated like a voice-over in his mind.  He would usually wake from these dreams to get on his computer and find that these people were real, and really looked as they did in his dream.  

He did not believe in the supernatural.  He knew there had to be a logical explanation for this; he just didn't know what.  He sat up on the edge of his bed and put his slippers on, the sun making stripes through the blinds.  

He laid the knife on the kitchen counter as he set about making his breakfast.  It was a Saturday morning, and he was gearing up for a short road trip.  Jeremy Pickett was a public school teacher two hours north.  What he had done didn't matter.  He grabbed his keys.  Pickett was real, he was in the dream, and he was going to die.  

As the trees wooshed past behind him, he thought about these specified victims.  Perhaps he was simply an agent of divine justice.  He had ruminated over this many times, and throughout his prolific career, he had yet to come up with a better answer.  

It was high noon; he pulled off into a gas station to refuel himself and the Explorer.  

He expertly handled the mountain roads with a BLT in hand.  Before long, he arrived at the address.  The school directory had listed Pickett's home telephone, a quick look-up of which had provided his home address.  

Fully-covered from leaving evidence, despite the heat, he parked in the woods out back, and slinked his way towards the back door of the house.  It was unlocked.  *Simple mountain folk.*

--------------
It was dusk once again by the time he turned off the meat grinder and exited his shed.  Pickett had been a skinny fellow, but the woodland creatures swarmed excitedly for a free meal nonetheless. 

He was inside in time to watch the evening news with his dinner.  He had a terrible feeling in the pit of his stomach.  It was not the venison he was having trouble digesting.  There was a news report about the teacher's disappearance, as, although he wouldn't have been missed at the school until Monday, his sister was coming to visit him and had arrived that evening to find an empty house. She had found a note on the nightstand, that Pickett had written, which came across as lost and suicidal.  

"Police are searching the forest surrounding the tiny mountain community, in the hopes, that secluded though his home may be, they may find Jeremy Pickett still alive.  Back to you, Tom."

He switched off the TV.  This had never happened before.  Of two things he was certain:  Pickett had not been suicidal, and *he* did not plant that note.

*So who did...*

He was filled with questions, and fear.  Someone knew he had been there and killed Jeremy Pickett, and they were trying to cover it up.

*Why?*

Maybe it was someone who had wanted Pickett dead, was coming to kill him, and finding him already gone, was paranoid they would be charged with the murder.

That was the logical explanation.

*But who?*   He couldn't just accept that without any evidence to back it up.  He opened his laptop and began to reasearch.  Pickett had been on the news, so it would not cause any suspicion to look him up now.  

Pickett had taught History; most notably, Ancient Civilizations, and Security in Modern Government since the Cold War.  There was a blog.  He scrolled through the posts, when something posted two days ago caught his eye.  Pickett had, linking to past posts and various news articles, claimed that he had pieced together evidence of a secret organization behind several assassinations and world events.  Most insanely, he claimed the organization was secretly an arm of the government.

*This guy was a nutcase...* He thought, closing the laptop.  

*You're one to talk.*

He sat up straight and shook his head, attempting to shake off the delusions of the half-sleep into which he must have fallen on that couch.  

*I've overstepped my boundaries.*   He thought.

*What am I talking about?*  He wondered.  What boundaries?  *I must be really tired.  random neural firings.  I'm ready to dream.*

As he crawled into bed, he picked up the remote and turned on the TV.  Tonight, he felt like having some background noise, which was entirely unusual for him, but he really just wanted to drown out the confusing thoughts nagging at his mind.  

***the rest is in a comment below because of character limit*** 




 I'm not a scientist, but I will explain to you my understanding/beliefs about these types of events in the most scientific and simple/agreeable way possible.

Thoughts are electrical impulses.  You know how people reference being on the same wavelength?  Well, just like radio waves and sound waves (like from when you speak), your thought energy/waves are not necessarily confined within your skull. When people finish each other's sentences or get what you mean without having to say anything, it can be partially knowing someone well, and partially picking up on their general ideas of thoughts, the wavelengths which have made their way out from the mind.

You know how sometimes you can sense when someone is angry or upset, or you can feel excited energy radiating from people?  When someone just exudes happiness or fear?  These excessive emotions radiate off them as waves of energy, and although we cannot see them, we can pick up on it and feel it.

People who have closer connections to people tend to "read" them better because they are more receptive to these signals.

Also, some people who realize this actively feel for it and are more open to these signals.  


Think of it this way:  the waves and signals are all around us to pick up, some people just have stronger antennae than others.


Still with me?


So, all of that is just natural part of being human, and although I don't know the extent of scientific study of these concepts, it is a simple fact that we are run by electrical impulses, and it is clear to anyone who has felt that emotion radiating from a person, or who has just known something was up with grandma and had the urge to call her, we can pick up on the electrical signals of other people.  


Side note: Once you speak, or once a TV broadcast is made, for instance, those sound/radio waves travel forever (which is how we pick up on ideas others have already done and whatnot). 


About predicting stuff, I think this happens either one of two ways (either way, you're picking up on signals, the difference is how the signals get to you).  

1. Most likely: you (subconsicouly) pick up on things which will lead to the event, and your mind draws the conclusions from there.


2. Less likely, but still a possibility: These thought waves and similar energies involved in the question at hand, however may not travel unidirectionally through time.  Like ripples in a pond, they may travel round, or they may travel outward from the point of origin in both directions of time, like a number line.  Meaning, the event, even though it happens in the future (I'm still operating under the assumption that time is linear), may produce waves of energy or a ripple effect, which the perceptive can pick up on.


Either way, I am 100% certain (until/unless something happens to prove this wrong) that: precognition, in the form of sudden thoughts or through dreams, is the result of picking up on waves/signals passing through the universe around us.


I have precognitive dreams frequently enough to know it's not a coincidence.  And, unlike some of the other commenters, I don't just remember after the real event has taken place.  I make note of my dreams when I awake.  Most of the time, dreams are metaphorical, so that can be subjective to interpretation.  Sometimes, however, it is more direct.  The most recent one I had was in January.  In the middle of a perfectly wacky hodgepodge of randomness which is a dream, I suddenly had to go to the store with my mom to return a pack of socks.  And when I got up in the morning, guess what my mom said we had to go do?  Except, the socks in the dream were white, like what I wear, and the ones in real life were black, and had been for my brother.  That is just a result of how the information is filtered through my perceptual set; my brain's interpretation of the signals based upon my expectation/perspective of what a sock is.

I think that case in particular shows support for option 1 of how these signals reach us.  While I was sleeping, my mom was probably already thinking about the need to return the socks, and I simply picked up on those thought waves.  

It is a logical explanation.  Judge for yourself how scientific it is.  But, I believe you were using scientific/logical interchangeably insofar as finding a reasonable explanation.  

So I hope this is helpful to you.  I apologize for writing you a book, but I wanted to provide as much background and examples as I could, since this is starting from square one for you.  I wanted to leave nothing to assumption. 




 "willing or wishing things to happen" you mean like /r/energy_work ?

Knowing you're dreaming and taking control of it (to whatever degree you can manage) occurs all within your own mind.

Exerting influence over your surroundings in waking life is a different process/concept entirely, as the energy and intentions do not stay just within your mind.

I certainly don't think that consciousness is just another form of dreaming.  

Dreaming, however, is another state of consciousness.

So I guess that's really a matter of our frame of reference.  

If we were dreaming more than we were awake, we would probably refer to being awake as a clearer dream-like state.

Still, the mechanics of real life do not match up with the mechanics of dreaming.  You can use your energy to try and make a headache go away, or to make/encourage people [to] leave your office, but you can't will yourself to fly like you can in a dream.

So, no, we are not all dreaming.   




 so the killer's ghost may be in the kitchen....
But who is Rachel? 




 /r/shortscarystories 




 so you consented to be possessed by some unknown spirit with unknown intentions, and didn't make it go away?

He could still be possessing you, you know.  Just being quiet, watchful, waiting. 

He likes to prank he said.  sounds like a trickster.  He may be pranking *you*, my friend.  He will rear his ugly head again when you go to see your friend.  Sorry to spoil that for you, if you were waiting to be surprised.

Sooner you know, the better though, because the "pranks" will only get uglier, and more dangerous. 




 making glitches; that is interesting.
The only thing I can point you to is /r/energy_work , but that is not really a glitch; it's about directing your energy and intentions (which are electrical impulses) to a purpose.  The same way you can move your arm with your mind, you can try to exert influence on other things around you.


Instigating a glitch, like for example, making objects disappear from one place and reappear in another, is a whole other animal.

Now, people have certainly tried to do this with themselves and others.  I don't know if anyone other than Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka has succeeded in that. 




 maybe you are connecting with spirits when you are half asleep, in an altered state of consciousness.  The only reason I really think that is the girl.  It could also explain the other incidents.  

I want to call the last one sleep paralysis, really, I do.  But did you really open your eyes twice?  Could you have dreamed that you did?

I also have no idea what to make of the rocking, except your grandpa theory is plausible.  but I don't see why he would continue to rock you into adulthood.  

More questions than answers. 




 yeah; I wasn't expecting anything like that, so I made the mistake of reading this at 3 am right before intending to go to bed. 




 my thoughts exactly 




 nice to see mention of a tulpa.  I mentioned tulpas in [a post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/31rzm7/darting_shadow/) on /r/paranormal and they'd never heard of it.  




 hmm, well I certainly wasn't talking about "other emotions", but rather physical healing processes.  Such as illnesses and bleeding for instance.  like, when my nose is bleeding (I keep bringing this up in comments, but it's the most common healing occurrence for me and thus an easy example), to stop it, I picture blocking the blood flow to the injured area, sealing it off, and then the wound closing into solid skin again.  Of course, I am, while picturing this, breathing out slowly and feeding the energy to it.  Although, with things like this, unlike pain, the visualization for me is focused on the healing itself more than the energy.  I don't really see my energy in that; just my visualization of the injured area.

For more internal issues, it is much more vague and involves more picturing of the energy itself.  

That may just be a reflection of my level of biological knowledge though.

With a nosebleed, it stops immediately once I've done that.  Other things, not as effective.  So maybe it is more effective if you specifically know what to direct it to do.  who knows?

Either way, regardless of the specificness of your visualizations, ultimately, you are feeding energy in as a catalyst to the healing process.  So it certainly doesn't have to be so specific, as the body already knows what to do with it.  Just thought I'd clarify in case it's of any help or interest to you. 




 it could also just be part of the urge to write it off as a coincidence or trick of the mind.  If you think its silly to share or you might be making a fool of yourself or something out of nothing, you're likely not to say anything. 




 yes, please; other events.

and you did an amazing job holding down the fort.  That was incredibly brave. 




 yet to be exposed to this; now I will definitely check it out, but not tonight....

edit: nevermind; I googled it and yes I have read it.  I really liked it actually.  I didn't think the creatures themselves were that impressive though.

Maybe watching it is creepier.  But from what I just saw, the movie was described as "so bad its good", so... 




 perhaps weird neural-firings such as this were the inspiration for the slenderman story, because tall, humanoid, black, and spidery makes me think of that. 




 I've put things in my wallet or another very specific place, and have it disappear with no explanation.  At least you found the check. 




 I also thought of VAT when I read this (since I am currently in the UK), but I didn't know there was more of a connection than it being a three letter acronym.  Good to know 




 If that made it too the cover I can only just imagine how bad its' inside on the inside

I'm sorry.  I had to.  you're are picture is just asking for it.

Your probably getting fired up reading this, so why not take the energy and learn to are cook some Pizza?
 




 what's with the use of levels?   Is that a d d reference?

Anyway, good job!  I also visualize removing the pain or problem, though I tend to see it more as red than black.  And my energy I always see as blue, regardless of what I'm doing with it. 

But those are personal differences and irrelevant to the process.  You did well; the only thing is, as someone else mentioned, to be careful to toss it aside and not take it in.  Also, with different types of things you're trying to heal, you may find different visualizations more effective.  Pain is quite straightforward, but for other things, you may find you need to visualize more of the process inside (not on an advanced, technical level, but on a basic functional one).  I do; some others I've spoken to do not though, they just contribute the positive energy to the healing process.  

Just try things and see what works for you.

Good luck! 




 don't know much about seeing auras first hand.  I have a friend from HS who could (she said mine was big and blue at the time).

I can feel them though.  Aura color and size is a reflection of emotion (and, at a resting position, personality) from my understanding (correct me anyone if I'm wrong).  

What I can feel is the emotions and energies radiating off of people.  When someone is angry or nervous very much so, it radiates off of them and I can feel it deep inside.  This is an enlarging of the aura.

When someone closes themselves up like a wall, I can feel the wall.  

I can't visibly see them though.  

I would say seeing and feeling them are entirely different things.

To hone any ability though, you exercise it and push yourself a little more each time; but the key is to not try too hard; don't over-think anything.  Just relax and do.  Trying too hard and over-thinking causes things to tense up and not work.  That seems to be universal for all abilities.  So, just bear that in mind.  

Good luck! 




 this reminds me of [Her Name Was Emma](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/29z7j8/her_name_was_emma/)

Really freaky.

There are people on facebook who I have a ton of mutuals with and went to the same school with but legitimately never met.  It wasn't a big school by any means, but big enough that, with the variety of classes and tracks one can be in, you pretty much end up meeting just over half of your grade from your various classes.  I could maybe have had gym with them at some point (since that involves congregating a lot of people from different academic backgrounds and grades) but otherwise, I didn't really meet them.

That is not unusual.  What is unusual is how close your close friends said they were to this person while you were close to them.  It's bizarre.  As long as you don't find a picture of you and J, then you're ok. 




 Not terribly obscure, but I've yet to meet another person irl who's heard of it.

The Young Wizards Series by Diane Duane.  It is YA SciFi Fantasy Coming of Age story which will empower and inspire you to live up to your full potential.

It is my favorite book series of all time.

The books go as follows:

So You Want To Be a Wizard
Deep Wizardry 
High Wizardry
A Wizard Abroad
The Wizard's Dilemma
A Wizard Alone
Wizard's Holiday
Wizards at War
A Wizard of Mars

10 is currently in the works

My favorite individual book of all time is not obscure at all.  It's : The Count of Monte Cristo .

Fundamentally though, I recommend that everyone read The Barcode Rebellion by Suzanne Wyrn (sorry if I mispelled the name).  It is a warning about what can happen in the world with technology and discrimination... 




 one of my favorite quotes is by Solzhenitsyn, and I think it *might* be from this book, but it's been years since I last read it.

The quote is (as I remember):

"There is a fine line between good and evil.  That line is drawn not between principalities and powers, but through every human heart.  ....[something about discerning the evil within one's self and doing good. (I dont remember the rest of the wording)]." 




 oh, ha ha.  I mean that was dangerous for the theif, not for you 




 um, even if his intention was to distance you so you dont get too attached and no one gets heartbroken, kissing another girl in front of you to nip it in the bud is the wrong way to do it.  That just makes the heartbreak happen now rather than later.  He could have just started spending a little less time with you and made it clear that you guys maybe shouldn't be too too close if you're FWB.

It sucks that he did that to you and threw away the friendship.  That was entirely unnecessary.

And being good close friends and FWB do not have to be mutually exclusive.  See this vids I shared to see an example of that: http://kineticpassion.tumblr.com/post/114937322020/full-benefits

Good luck salvaging the friendship if you really still think he's worth it after what he did. 




 3 goes out to you, man.  watch these that I've linked here http://kineticpassion.tumblr.com/post/114937322020/full-benefits

idk if it helps any, but that shows us inexperienced people that this kind of thing can be healthy, caring relationship.
I guess what I'm trying to say is don't let one bad apple spoil the bunch. 




  the WPP

this? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WPP_plc

or am I /r/outoftheloop ? 




 wait, but he stood there long enough for you both to get a good look at him and the cameras sure did too...

that strikes me as really risky 
























 yeah, my brother and I are 10 years and 5 months apart (I only mention the months bc for half the year it makes it seem like its 11 years difference), and our baby pictures are identical.  Based on photographs, we looked identical and grew at an identical rate based on our wall growth charts (mine is still on the wall; they're side by side).  It wasn't until about 8 or so that he started to differentiate more and grow at a faster rate than I did.
I'm a woman, btw.  My little brother looked pretty much identical to me at the same age throughout his younger childhood. 




 I sometimes hear my mom or dad say things when they're actually not even in that part of the house.  It freaks them out more than it does me, because they believe it means they're going to die or something, kind of like what you're saying. 




 good; I was going to link to the same 




 because you were a child and believed you could do it.  Now that capacity is blocked by the constraints you have learned since then.

yours is a very extreme case, but I firmly believe that we seriously limit our own mental capacity by accepting explanations of the world that are truly just theoretical and can't be concretely proven.

 maybe he's a ghost of a magician who didn't get recognition in life and just wants to put smiles on people's faces and make an impression 




 well reading minds in that sense (numbers and specific items of information that the person is actively thinking about) is not particularly difficult or uncommon.  

What you talk about reading people, as in picking up on emotions and stuff, it's just like a more practiced form of the same sort of sense.  I've freaked people out with it too.  However, this card guy was far better at it I'm sure.  His track record was probably so good/ he had such an easy time "reading" the cards from your minds, because he got plenty of practice by hanging around the college kids.  

Thanks for the idea for a skill-builder exercise.  That is much better than just asking a friend to think of a number. 




 your title made it sound like the building had disappeared :) 




 If my homework were based on my reddit,

 thanks for the tip! 




 We just made a google doc and were in a video call so we could talk verbally, and we just wrote it together.

you can work with people by writing a paragraph each, back and forth, like /r/passtheparagraph
or you can just talk it out and add things, or write until a logical stopping point/ you run out of ideas, and then let the other person take over.  
It's a nice thing to do when you're both bored 




 I am American as well.   




 I don't say it to people a whole lot, but this is one of my favorites:

"Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?"
- Dumbledore in the Deathly Hallows.  




 I studied Criminal Justice in undergrad (working towards being an attorney), so I've heard plenty about the disturbing things inmates will do, especially those harboring the infections you mentioned and who feel they have nothing to lose.

However, those people do not make all of the inmates "human garbage". There are inmates who really are  "legit" "victims of circumstance".  

In the women's prison in my state, there is one lady in particular that we got to meet and speak to, who is serving a life sentence because, while she was asleep, her ex took her car to commit a murder and when he told her about it the next day, as he was already abusive, she was too afraid to come forward.  This makes her an accessory after the fact.  However, in my state, there is no legal distinction for "accessory".  All those involved in any way get charged with murder.  
They say she got life (the max) because the judge wanted to make an example of her, but that is neither here nor there.

If you want to argue about her being in an abusive relationship in the first place, people end up there by being too trusting and forgiving; that's the only fault that makes someone end up there, and you don't realize you're in that situation until it actually gets ugly, at which point, it is dangerous to try to leave.  People in those situations feel trapped, and if they don't have a support system to reach out to or a method to contact authorities without being stopped and beaten for it, then they kind of are trapped to an extent.

She is not garbage. 

The thousands of people serving life (or several decades) sentences for possession of marijuana are not garbage either.  Regardless of your views on marijuana, in moderate amounts it has been scientifically proven to be far less harmful than cigarettes or alcohol to say the least, and the extracts from it (cannabis oil) can stop seizures and help cancer patients (I can source this if you take issue with data).  People in the marijuana scene for the most part are not bad people.  At the very least, they are not garbage.

I would argue against calling any person garbage, but it would be acceptable for the nutcases who try to give people incurable diseases just for spite.

Anyhow, now that I'm done cross-examining your rant, the paranormal experience:

A vengeful spirit coming after their murderer is not too surprising from a psychological standpoint; given this person's history of an abusive personality, revenge surely fits the profile.  If she killed her abuser, it would most likely have been a self-defense situation or a crime of passion, meaning he could also either feel he has unfinished business in the beating she stopped him from delivering (trying to get in his twisted mind here (applying the Forensic Psychology I studied as well; not just pulling from the air)), or, if it was the latter, a crime of passion, then he may feel betrayed (from her being his to dominate) and thus feels the need to assert his dominance.

As cited above, it can be incredibly hard for someone to get away from an abuser though normal means.  If it came down to the last resort, killing them, and then you still weren't safe from them, that would be some kind of hell; she may feel like it was all for nothing and she'll never be free of him.  

It's interesting that you could see him though, before hand, but couldn't see him when he was behind your partner; same with how you saw a shadow in some cameras but only moving objects in others.  Maybe he wanted you to see him at those points.  The other possibility is that for some reason you were more receptive/perceptive of his presence at those points in time, possibly in relation to situational factors (lighting? presence of other people in the room?), or it could be in relation to physical actions taken by the poltergeist.  Maybe, since you said you didn't see the shadow when objects were moved, poltergeists are less visible when taking or preparing to take physical action.  That possibility just makes the fact that you couldn't see him behind your friend even scarier. 

Definitely want to try to get rid of a dangerous spirit like that, although it is not your problem, and he probably won't move on until she's dead, either because that's what he wants, or because he will torment her until the say of her natural death, as his revenge.  

Either way, you may see more of him until she is gone/moved or you are. 




 ha ha; the held back is probably partially going for a softer style and partially psychological from being in a dorm room!  

No, I have never had singing lessons, but I have been singing on my own my whole life really, and in my church's choir for a handful of years.  I have noted drastic improvements from when I first started recording (six years ago *shudders*) to now, but I know there's a lot more I can improve on.   

As far as the mic goes, yeah, I actually did three takes of this because I got too into it the first two times and got intimate with the mic, causing distortion; that may also be why I was holding back.

Anyway, thank you for pointing that out; it helped me realize I am still holding back sometimes in here, and that I still haven't found the sweet spot to sit from the mic in this new setup.

thanks for listening! 




 Nice work overall; I think, however, you could use more variety in the bass and tone down the treble.  You really only have a steady boom going for the bass.  You need to have the base move along with the chords of the main tune; this will give the track more life/depth.

I hope that is helpful! 




 excellent!  you had me tapping along within the first 30 seconds.  Only thing I can recommend is to maybe end with the same sounds from the beginning, so that it comes full circle, and ends maybe with one of those tones going up; just think it would be a nice touch. 




 very nice!  I am not familiar with the original, but I would recommend toning down the noise (by which I mean the fuzz/overblow) around the 1:20 and 2:00 marks for example, if possible.  It may be nicer on the ears with at least somewhat clearer tones. 




 I wrote this and recorded it today.  I normally do pop rock / alternative, so this is somewhat softer than my usual style, so I am looking for constructive criticism please I would really appreciate it.  

The song is called [Therapy] (https://soundcloud.com/test_subject8889/therapy)

(for reference I use a USB studio condenser mic if that means anything to you.)

Thank you in advance! 




 no, but you can patent an invention or copyright a screenplay 




 yes; I found out about wordle when I was writing my first novel back in 2008.  It was in two parts, so I made a wordle from each part; I thought of maybe including the result as a page in the published book, at the beginning of the respective parts.

It is a great visual aid and quite pretty to look at. 




 hi; I've only read excerpts of your books and seen some of your videos (all of which were excellent, btw; I love the way they are organized), and (as I write, blog, and make music) I was wondering:

**What did you find most surprising about 'making it' as a writer and as a youtuber?  as in, things that were much easier or harder than expected, or unexpected obstacles which you faced in the process?   ** 




 I saw the title and thought of him too, sneaking in through someone's window, so don't worry 




 given that it was tiny and detailed, and her writing was large and floppy, I assumed the killer drew her in the park. 




 I would think that as long as it is different enough, or only a slight preview, it doesn't matter, but I don't really know. 

I'm just basing that off of PenPal from /r/nosleep .  The author took the series, fleshed it out, exapnded upon it, and then published the result as a full-fledged Amazon book.  However, the original stories are still online on nosleep 




 get it copyrighted first.   




 well you can read kindle books on pc, and nook (for one) can use the kindle app as can any other android device, be it a phone, tablet, etc.  Even windows mobile devices can use the kindle app.   




 there is also an amazing comic that fits this prompt, which I discovered from someone linking it in a comment somewhere....found it: https://imgur.com/gallery/h2my0 




 Drama: He bided his time before asking her out.  Even once they were together, he carefully observed her actions and words; he was the attentive listener women say they want to find.  He made sure to be there for her whenever she might need him.  Although she led a busy life, he would always clear his schedule for her.  He had come to love her favorite restaurant almost as much as she did.  He could see them growing old together, and going to that cozy restaurant by the pier for every anniversary.  Then, he got a phone call which made his whole world shatter.

Comedy: She thought he was a nice guy, and he seemed to be really interested, so she figured she could give it a shot; it's whatever.  She lied about having to work late sometimes so that she could hang out with her superficial friends instead.  He always seemed to give her even more attention after such nights.  It's funny how a little distance can make people want you more.  She chuckled at the thought of him chasing after her like a confused puppy. He made some of the silliest, and to her mind, stupidest faces sometimes, especially when he just looked at her.  He was a real clown.  She kept going with him to the same restaurant on the pier; she could think of nothing else to do with him other than have good food and good fun.  Although it was her favorite restaurant, she was getting tired of going there; they had worn it out.  So she picked up the phone.

-----------

[I know that's not really funny, but when I read the prompt, I thought of this sort of relationship, and how to him its serious (drama) but to her its just a game (comedy).  hope you like it anyways ] 




 thank you for the quick reply! 




 the issue here being, although it is my writing, the idea would have originated from a prompt thought of by someone else.  So, it would be prompt inspired.  

So, I think it would be ok to publish as long as I credited the prompt idea, but that only applies to publishing on a personal webpage or something similar.

What if I wanted to expand upon the idea and publish the resulting longer, more developed story in a publication which pays for submissions?  Is it ok to do that? 









 I read your previous post and this one.  I have no experience with entities inflicting physical damage to a person, only mental and emotional.  drawing blood is serious, obviously.  

If you're looking for a logical explanation, (well even not, I think that's the starting point if for nothing else to rule it out):  there's the possibility it was the cat, and there's the possibility that you sleepwalk/other sleep actions.  To that end, you mentioned in your comments linked to in the previous post, that you have done hallucinogens.  Did those, by any chance include LSD?  If so, it is possible for you to experience a random acid trip.  I'm not saying the scratches aren't real.  Not at all.  I'm just mentioning, in case you didn't know, that you are subject to that.

Ok, logical bases covered, the next is the usual suspects:
poltergeist.  This is what you seemed to be describing for the post part in Chicago.  For this incident, if an entity of some sort caused these scratches, it would have to be either a poltergeist or a demonic entity.  

If, given your history, you don't sense anything, I don't think there's really a risk that it's anything demonic.  It may be a poltergeist who has taken issue with your bf and thus has not presented anything to you.  

Someone mentioned something following you; that would be an attached spirit.  Ususally attached spirits are benign or benevolent.  A malevolent spirit would only attach to a person if they had specific beef with them and were looking for revenge or to torment them.  Normally, malevolent/vengeful spirits are tied to places, such as where they died.  So I don't think an attached spirit is possible in this case.  Unless they'd have a reason to want to drive your bf away to protect you, although your ex sounds like more of a person from which you'd need protection, so that idea has no traction either.

Speaking of Liam, I had a thought while reading the previous post.  Did he use heroin before moving into that house?  Did they move into that house not too long before?  or when he was younger?  if it was a more recent move, its possible the ghost of the heroin addict drove him to try it.  You mentioned using hallucinogens.  Did you ever do that before living in that house with Liam?  Clearly he was a bad influence regardless, but I wonder if he had been negatively influenced by the spirits in the home as well.

Just my thoughts.  Hope something in here is helpful to you.   Sorry for rambling. 




 made me tear up.  thanks for sharing! 




 she is really open to it/ perceptive of it I guess.  I assume you mean physically see with her eyes?  or do you mean in her mind's eye that she can feel them and visualizes them as dots? 




 oh, then you are missing out.  I personally liked his Words Words Words special (it was on Comedy Central) a little better than What.  That was how I first found out about him.   









 no the rule is to have more than one account; one for normal things using your usual un, and one for other things 




 thanks! :) 




 I, not realizing I'd read your posts before, was one of the "dome people", lol 





























 it is actually in human nature to try to rationalize things.  But after a certain point, it becomes self-delusion really 




 same 




 I just checked your profile /u/beastley325 (not being creepy or anything, I was just curious if this was a throwaway/ if you were new to reddit), and if you ever need someone to anonymously talk to about something when you feel like you have nowhere to turn, feel free to PM me.  I know what that feels like.

Given that background, I'm pretty sure your heart is in the right place.  You will get stronger and stronger, and you can be a great force for good in this world 3 




 You must take it seriously.  You must have an open mind.  You must, above all else, have control of your own mind before you try to mess with anything, so that you can tell if anything is trying to mess with you, and be able to fight back.

The first step to gaining control of your own mind, is to learn to be able to silence it.  To not think.  To think of nothing.  
Go ahead; try to clear your mind.  At first, it'll be difficult, because you'll think of either your breathing or the fact that you're not thinking of anything.  Practice a little each day until you get past that.  

Once you've got that down, you're ready to learn to defend yourself.    This is of utmost importance.  

If you're serious, I will be happy to continue this lesson or whatever you'd call it.  Once you're able to clear your mind. 

edit: and I agree with /u/CelticBull : EVP is at best not reliable, and at worst, may be bull.  Your own senses in your body and mind (the same with which you can sense when someone is behind you, or when something is wrong with a friend or family member) is a much more reliable indicator if you know what to look for 




 That's not a glitch, actually.  Sensing things, particularly with people close to us, is just a natural part of the human experience, the same way you can tell when something is wrong or when someone is upset, or sense that someone is behind you.  Some people are just more sensitive/receptive to these signals than others.

Something new I've noticed lately is that I've been sensing when people go offline on facebook.  I'll randomly click to the tab just in time to see them go offline.  All of the time.   









 I just saw this:  it was like this but not repeatedly : https://33.media.tumblr.com/a9b38183a1fd5d6aa82f0d88daac49c4/tumblr_mfocgyxEPY1rczhxyo1_500.gif 




 thanks; I will definitely bring it up next chance I get 




 no problem!  I just need the courage to say things like that to people in person whom I know need to hear it, without them breaking down in front of me first.  I have no problem saying those things when its clearly wanted, but I'm afraid to say them without the other person bringing it up first, which they don't always do... 




 how were you guys still friends?  that is evil! 




 that was beautiful 3 




 no please share details 




 the only fault you may have is a bad taste in girls, man.  easy come easy go.  easy fix: dont date anyone without being friends with them first. 




 "friend'd dad who" in that last sentence implies that you're the dad.  it should be "friend whose dad" 




 soy sauce 




 they call it "picking up the pieces" for a reason.  You gave them pieces of your heart and they threw you away.  The piece of your heart is not permanently gone.  You are not left heartless.  you have to pick the pieces back up from where they've been abandoned by these people who didn't see their value as a gift.  Those pieces you've left behind are emotional investments.  If you dont collect them back, you'll have nothing left to invest in a new relationship.   you've got to pick those pieces up from where they dropped them and put yourself back together.  Don't leave pieces of your heart dwelling on the past where they aren't appreciated or wanted.  Bring them back with you to the present so that you can heal and be whole.   




 In gym class one time in elementary school I was bouncing a basketball and I bounced it too hard so it came back up and hit me in the face; gave myself a bloody nose 




 my favorite part of this is "box of ducklings" 




 One time, while making the drive up to New York to visit relatives with my family, there was a traffic jam on the highway (as usual), so we were moving pretty slowly.  For whatever reason, there was a line of safety cones in between the lanes.  


The road curved a bit, so we could see ahead, and I saw, in the lane to our right, a rogue traffic cone bouncing around.  Someone must have knocked it down, and it was rolling, lengthwise, down the line, under each car (the rolling under the slowly moving cars must have maintained its motion).  So as we moved forward, it was coming closer to our position (but again, in the lane to our right).  


So directly to our right was a woman driving a minivan.  Due to the curve of the road, we could see the cone coming, but she could not.  So just as we were all inching forward again, the cone sprang up from beneath the car in front of her.  Having been oblivious to its approach, her reaction was priceless.  I wish I had been filming the whole thing but it happened so fast.


I will never forget the look of absolute shock on her face as, to her, the orange traffic one suddenly jumped up in front of her car.  (Thankfully, since we were barely moving, this was a funny incident rather than a tragic one. ) 




 I would have said  "well I don't think I want that" 




 yelling for your mom and her answering clearly broke, or fixed rather, the glitch.  Very interesting though .  It's weird that you did it twice, but was it dark?  I have walked into bedroom doors on a few occasions at night in my parents' house because I really thought I was seeing into the hallway but the door was actually closed and it was just so dark I couldn't tell until my nose hit it.


Granted, you're talking about the morning, but if its early enough, it can be dark too.


that is my best attempt at a logical explanation, but the fact that it happened twice in a row and your hand was behind you is intriguing. 


do you generally turn the light in a room off before or after you step through the doorway?

(In the above example, the light was off to begin with, but) I've been hitting the switch prior to leaving the doorway since many years ago, as I figured the few seconds each time I exit a room, over the course of my lifetime would add up to a substantial energy savings.   The point of that though, is, if you also flip the switch prior to or while passing through a doorway, was the light still on when you were "back" in the room, as if you'd never left, or was the light suddenly off, showing you indeed passed through the doorway? 




 true; I studied psychology in undergrad and I am aware of how that happens.  It could explain the letter changing from rejecting the time off to accepting it (particularly in the context of getting drunk), but it fails imo as an explanation for the medical history, as that is an aspect of her entire life up to that point.

It is easy to misremember details of how exactly something happened, but that generally occurs as more time passes between the event.

to misremember an entire aspect of your life (like, for example, being allergic to peanuts) would be absurd.  




 this is a good idea.  Getting drunk would make it easier to confuse such a thought with reality.  

however, no one remembers the party.  

Op, you may have just got drunk at home, dreamed/imagined all that party stuff, and then decided you don't want to live like like.

But, the letter and medical history changing seriously challenges that logical explanation. 




 Holy shit; I was just thinking you got a second chance up until this point.  I'm not really a believer in jumping dimensions, but damn if you didn't just make me reconsider.

To have all *history* of the problems erased is something else enitrely 




 Wait; I didn't realize there were more besides Berenstain/stein.
It's supposed to be Interview with **A** Vampire, right?! 




 yes, NC; I was about to ask how did you know, thinking maybe it was related to a southern stereotype I was unaware of, but then I realized you must be combining the image of polite antebellum society (ha ha) with the lifestyles of rural communities or something like that? 




 well, I really hope I can help you, because the parent of half of the big problems which lead to me leaving/moving out from my ex fiance, can be traced back to what you just described.  I was going to say it was one of the big problems, but actually, half of them can be connected to it.  You are absolutely right.  She won't be happy. 

you say it takes a long time for you to feel like dealing with it?  well that long time is likely longer than she can stand waiting for you to deal with it.  The result?  she will be the one always trudging through those messes, only to have them reappear far too quickly.  This contributes to (in conjunction with other things of course), feelings of hopelessness; that things are pointless.

you say she is "mess-phobic"; I assume this means her home is organized?  

Do you have a proper place for your clothes?  like a dresser or a closet?  If not, get one.

As far as your habits are concerned, just remember that it won't pile up into an unmanageable mess if you pick up each individual thing when you use it.  Putting a shirt in the hamper when you take it off literally takes two seconds.  Two seconds each day is so easy compared to dealing with the massive mess which ensues otherwise.

Washing one dish after dinner each night is so much quicker, easier, and cleaner than washing a sink full of dirty mess every two weeks.  The latter will get you bugs.

You create these problems for yourself.

You will also feel so much better about yourself, and your house will stay cleaner, if you just pick up after yourself as you go about your day.

your motivation is your girlfriend.  think of it however works for you: do it for her, do it for your relationship, and/or do it to take control of your life.

good luck!

edit: P.S: at least you say you know where your things are.  Pro tip: don't ever wake her up and refuse to let her go back to sleep until she helps you find this thing you need that is buried in your mess somewhere, especially if she has to go to work in the morning and you don't 




 because the word came up in conversation yesterday, as part of the horrifically humorous translation for a name, I was reminded of the likely uncommon circumstances in which I first heard it:

The first time I ever heard or read the C word, I was 19, and I saw it on tumblr.  I don't remember if I googled it, urban dictionaried it, or walked into the next room to ask my (then) fiance what it meant.

But yeah, just thought someone might find it interesting how and how late I first heard that word. 




 well, from my understanding, the million dollar challenge (which it's one of my goals to tackle) is about demonstrating abilities in a controlled environment, not about showing proof of the existence of ghosts. 




 something really wanted you to pay cash for lunch today 




 I like to say that "everyone is a little psychic".

Sensing things is a perfectly normal part of being human; some people are just more receptive to it than others.  What you described is an everyday thing for me and I think it's great.

I don't get bad vibes like that though; I get positive vibes (not necessarily positive as in YAY! GOOD, but as in YES DO THIS), like Go Now, or Go at X time, or Go to X place, or take X way to get there. 




 actually, I'm in graduate school, and that I know of, I've only met one other classmate who reddits.  Even among friends from high school, I haven't heard of any of them redditing.  I haven't asked everyone, mind you, I only asked one person, and someone else volunteered the information in a class discussion, so more of them probably do and I just don't know about it.  Though some definitely don't, as they assume the entire site is full of f'd up trolls...you just have to know which subs to avoid... 




 thank you!  yes that is it.   I googled shockmount and the third result was one specifically made to fit my mic! 




 hi, I have a USB studio condenser mic, and a mic stand which came with no attachment at the top to hold mics (and if it did, it would probably have been designed for a stage mic/ too thin for mine).  


(I have a tiny desk stand that came with the mic, but I would like to record standing up as well without having to hold it.)


I have seen in videos a type of mic holder for the top of a mic stand which I think is exactly what I need.  Here are some images.

I have tried googling it, but I can't seem to find what they are called.  I need to know so I can get one.


Also, would it work with a generic mic stand or does it have to be a specific kind of stand?  (The stand I got didn't even come with a boom, but it doesn't look like I need one for this.  It has a screw top). 

Thanks! 




 sounds like a good idea, since a lot of us music makers can certainly draw, but digital art is a whole other animal 




 thanks! I was about to say the same.  "things out human minds can't conceive" indeed 




 definitely don't actually physicall hear it in my ear, but I play instruments and stuff, so I am familiar with music, so when I listen to music, I don't just listen to it as a whole; I listen to the individual parts and how they fit together.

As a result, when I have a song in my head, I hear it all in my head, complete with each instrument/element coming in when it should and what not.

The purpose of the background info was to demonstrate my explanation for this, which is about encoding.  I think I encode more details of the music by having listened for an appreciated them in the first place, and that results in my being able to play music back in my head as vividly as if I had earbuds in.  So /u/Jelith , it is possible to have the music be "quite as good as the real thing" while it's in your head. 




 I'm glad someone said it, because I was thinking the same thing.  I wouldn't call the difference "childish," but there is a difference.  The voice in my head, while undeniably my voice, sounds different than the voice I hear when I speak.  

However, while I can't explain why we hear the voice in the first place, this difference is one I can explain:

You know how your voice sounds different on the phone and in recordings than it does to your ear when you speak?  (There have been studies about this phenomenon, and apparently, we all hear our own voices clearer and better than they actually are, and what we hear in recordings is what others really hear when we speak.)

Well, although you hear it different, it seems that the brain captures it in its true form.  The voice you hear of yourself in your head is the voice others hear when you speak.  

source: I've heard enough recordings of myself to realize that the voice in my head, although sounding different to me than my speaking voice, really is my voice.

So, per your description, I hate to break it to you, but you must sound "a fair bit more childish and feminine" than you thought. 




 God help me.

I just posted about a glitch which involved not being able to post something to my facebook timeline, and the post itself seems to only exist on my profile but does not show up here in the sub.  I knew it wouldn't be on "hot", but it is supposed to be on recent.  It's not here at all.  But it exists, because it is on my profile and I can click on it.

Here are screencaps showing the post on my profile but not here in the sub http://imgur.com/a/Qmxiq

Here is a link to the post, since you can't find it on the sub: https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/33ykbo/the_universe_does_not_want_me_to_share_this_on_my/

Whatever force of the universe that doesn't want me to post the video doesn't want me to tell about the glitch either.  

Well I'm telling.  I hope you guys can actually see this post. 

If this doesn't work, I will just make more glitchception posts until it gives up.

If there is a logical explanation for any of this please, for the love of reddit, tell me, before I lose my mind.


update: as you can see, I just checked and this post did indeed appear in the sub, immediately: http://imgur.com/YXgchV9   but the original post is still not appearing.  It's clearly not some delay because this post is only 2 minutes old and already on the list, but my post from over half an hour ago is still not there.   




 This just happened and is technically still happening.  
It's not a matter of video sharing in general, just this one in particular.  Here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcZFr3lHXh0 feature=youtu.be

It's a Louis CK comedy video.

I was going to post it on my fb timeline (for friends minus acquaintances and a couple specific people, so it shouldn't be like a guardian angel stopping me from making some reputation fuck up or something like that) 

I tried about a dozen times to post it to my timeline (I tried refreshing, typing different captions, closing and re-opening the tab) and each time got this error: http://imgur.com/a/lHQaa  (first image)

I tried sharing it directly from the youtube page (instead of pasting the link in my status, and I got this error: http://imgur.com/a/lHQaa (same link, second image)

Then, I tried sharing it to my like page, just by pasting the link in a status, and it worked!  So I was thinking the problem, whatever it was, was fixed.  Then, I tried to share it from my page to my timeline, and this happened: http://imgur.com/a/lHQaa (same link, third image)  .  Weird letters all over the screen.  You can even see I was telling my friend about this as it happened.

So what the actual fuck?!

As I said to my friend, either God, Facebook, or the universe really didn't want me to post that video to my timeline, but my like page is apparently ok.

The fact that I was able to post it to my like page with no problem means that it's not a technical issue with the video, youtube, or facebook.  

It's completely bizzare. 




 yeah, they're usually after at least a small sum, about three fifty 
























 I apologize for any formatting issues because I am on mobile and in the dark, but I wanted to share this with the world before my phone dies, or I do.  I lived in an old house, but I was still surprised when yesterday, rearranging my room while going through things in preparation for college, I found a slit in the wall behind my dresser.  Although I had rearranged things in my room before, I had actually never moved that dresser.  


Since it just looked like a dark, solid line, I ran my finger along the slit to make sure it wasnt just a stain or a mark from the dresser being in one spot for so long.  But no, although it felt rather smooth, there was definitely a crack.  I took out my phone and shined the flashlight in there to see if I could see anything.  I could only distinguish vague beams and shapes of what appeared to be an attic-like space.


This was on the wall which faced the hallway, so I went out my bedroom door to investigate.  My room was at the very end of the hallway, with two of my other walls having windows to the outside.  In the hall, directly adjacent to my room, coinciding with where the slit would be, was the hall closet.  I was aware of this, but I opened the hall closet to see about how deep it was.  I went back into my room to compare this with the distance from my doorframe to the slit.  It was pretty close, so it was possible that I was seeing, from the slit, into the space behind the closet, or perhaps just the interior of the wall.  


No, I thought.  If it was just the interior of the wall, then the flashlight would have lit it up better, as the backing of the wall would be right there.  In any case, if there was such a space behind the closet, it would have to be quite narrow, as my bedroom closet, with my clothes in it, began about a foot to the left of this slit, and extended to about half the depth of the hall closet.  The closet in my parents bedroom, across the hall, mirrored this, and I presumed that they meet in the middle, behind the closet.  So, there could be no more than a foot of space in between.  


I ran my fingers over the slit again, wondering what might have made it, when I felt something at the top.  I had only tentatively touched it before, to see if it was real.  This time, running the length of the slit, I felt a corner at the top.  Shining my light on it, I could barely make out a thin line running to the right for about two and half feet.  It was a door.


This was extremely puzzling, since the hall closet should have occupied half of the space which this doorway would open up to.  


Although it was creepy, and mysterious, I was not afraid.  I had read and watched enough horror stories to know that, in any case, I should not open this alone, so I called for my mom. 


She came and I showed her the door.  She had to touch it herself to believe it, although, she had never moved that dresser either, since this was the most logical spot along the wall for it to sit, we had never had the need to.  Apparently it, along with a couple of other pieces of furniture had come along with the house.  She had tried to tell the previous owner to keep them, since we had our own bedroom sets, but they had insisted.  Now, she speculated, that this hidden damage to the wall may be the reason.  She wasnt as convinced as I was that it was a door, but decided there was no harm in pulling on it to see if it opens.  


Together, we grabbed it from the slit.  Our fingers didnt even fit into the slit, so with what little grip we could get on the door, we had to lean and use our feet for leverage.  Pulling on it like that, there actually seemed to be pressure on the right side, holding it back.  So then, we tried pushing it to the right.  Slowly, but surely, it opened, sliding like a closet door behind the rest of the wall, which was, as we could now see, much thinner than we had realized.  We stepped back and peered into the bare wood and beams of the large, dark, attic-like room.  I shined my flashlight inside.   In the far, left corner, there was an old rocking chair, covered in dust.  The space was only about four feet wide, which was about two feet wider than should have been possible.  Although that could be chocked up to misestimation on my part as to where the hall closet ended in relation to my wall, the depth of the room could not.  It seemed to extend far beyond the hallway, into space which should have been occupied by my parents room.   There also seemed to be a break in the wall to the left.


We werent quite sure what to do.  I had already taken a picture of the doorway and the room, with its impossible proportions.  The next logical step was to go in and investigate.  My mom didnt want me to go in alone, but I knew better than for both of us to go in at once.  The door could close on us and trap us inside.  Thats when I got my brilliant idea.  I could go in with my flashlight, and she could stand in the doorway to make sure it doesnt close, and to watch my back.


Although she didnt feel good about it at first, she reluctantly agreed, and leaned against the right edge of the doorframe, where she could hold the door back if it did, somehow, try to close.  


I stepped in with my phone held high, illuminating the floor and room before me.  I felt a rippling draft as I passed through the doorway, but inside, the room, unfinished and exposed though it was, was actually quite warm.   


As I stepped in further, I gathered that the heat was coming from an unknown source in the back left corner, where the old, dusty, and empty rocking chair lay.  It was made of an amber colored wood, carved in a simple pattern, and with a dingy navy blue foam cushion sitting on the seat.


I got to the halfway point, and saw, to my left, a gap in the wall about one foot wide.  This was, I presumed, the space between my and my parents bedroom closets.  Although, again, this room seemed deeper than it ought to be, so, although I was halfway across it, I really ought to have been well into my parents room, so it could not have been the space between the closets.  But there it was.  Pitch black.  I shined my flashlight down the narrow way, but the air there was so thick with dust that all the beam did was illuminate the floating particles of dust, and lines of cobwebs, for a few feet, with only dark, vague shapes outlined in the distance. 


I turned to the left.  My mom was still in the doorway.  I could see into the light of my room.  Everything was still ok.  


I should have left the exploring for later.  We could have put a stopper in the doorway and waited for my dad to get home.    But Id had no reason so far to think anything was wrong.  So far, just heading straight down into the room, I could see my room and my mom, and she could see the old room and me.  If I wanted to check out the narrow gap to my left, however, that would have to change.  But, as long as she was still holding the door, it would be alright.  I was just going to go in a little ways to try and get an idea of how deep it is or if theres anything in there.  I told her so and she nodded ok and just told me to be careful.  I held up my flashlight.  At one foot wide, I had to walk sideways into the gap.  I kept my gaze fixed to the left and the light pointing my way, swatting down cobwebs as I went, slowly.  I had only taken about six steps when I heard an enormous WOOSH and a blood-curdling scream which was cut short by a loud thud.  


I backed out of the tiny corridor as quickly as I could while going sideways, and turned to face the door.  Except, it wasnt there.  


With the flashlight around eye-level, as Id kept it, I could see only the solid wooden inside of the wall.  I quickly panned the light down the center of the wall.  There was no slit to be seen.


Mom? Incredulously, I stepped closer to where the door should have been.  Mom? There was still no answer.  I continued to call to her in an increasingly louder and more panicked voice as I walked, jogged, then ran the last bit to the wall.  Mom! I screamed as I pounded on the wall.  


It had waited until we were separated, until we couldnt see each other, to close the door.  And she had screamed.  Whatever it was must have pushed her out of the way.  I had thought that, if the door were to close on me, it would be by some unseen force, but then, it occurred to me, that it could be some unseen creature.  Did it push her out of the way and leave the confines of this room when she screamed?  Or had it locked itself in here with me?


I was already breathing hard with panic at this point, but when my foot brushed against an object laying against the wall where there previously was none, I jumped back, startled, tripping on the wide-gapped bare floorboards, and landing with my bottom on my leg, facing the opposite corner from whatever Id encountered.  I knew this was bad.  My leg wasnt broken, of that I was fairly certain, but I had to get up slowly because it hurt to move it.  My phone had landed upside down by my feet, shining its narrow beam up at me.  As I picked it up and reflexively flipped it right side up, my eyes widened as the light hit the wet, red, tip of my shoe.


I brought my hand to my forehead to make sure I hadnt cut it.  Being right handed, and having the flashlight in that hand as well, this made the flashlight beam quickly pass over the wall and back to eye-level.  In that quick pass, I had seen hair.  I had not bumped into some invisible thing or unseen object.


I hobbled forward quickly.  My mom must have been unconscious, and she was clearly bleeding.  I needed to wrap something around her head. I had to lean and use my hands on the wall for support, so I could only see the floor and wall right by my feet.  Although I had seen the right side of my mom from the other side of the room, when I got to the corner by the door, I did not see her left, but rather her middle.  The door, in closing, had sliced her clean in half, vertically.  I collapsed in shock, landing on my knees in a pool of blood.  I had asked her to stand in the doorway, and now the right half of her was sealed in this room with me, and the left half of her was in my bedroom outside.  The exact measure that I thought would keep us both safe instead had her cut in half.  


After crying there in this agonizing irony of horror and guilt, I started to snap out of the shock and realized that I was locked in this mysterious, physically impossible room, with half the corpse of my mother, and I was kneeling in a pool of her blood.  What if they never find me.  Worst of all, finding half of her, no sign of a break-in, and no me, they might even think I killed her.  


I jumped up then, with the adrenaline kicking in helping to work against the pain in my leg, because I also remembered that I had no idea what had closed the door which did kill her, and that I had had my back turned to the rest of the room since it had happened.  I turned around and shined my light into the darkness.  The room, of course, was still empty.  The narrow hall to the left was still dark.  I could still make out the empty rocking chair in the back left corner of the room.  This time, however, the dust had been disturbed into a cloud around it, and it was swinging.
 




 I hope this does not get deleted like /u/M59Gar 's amazing sci-fi story.

This is just my un-edited flow of conclusions in terms of the Multiverse Theory with an afterlife focus, but I wrote it with this community in mind, so....

If this: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3duieo/quantum_lottery/   doesn't get deleted, then this here shouldn't either IMO.  Similar subject and slant... 









 unless you are employed by the state, which would include the prosecuting attorneys, as well as court-appointed defense attorneys, so at least 50% of the time, this may actually be an over-estimate.  It depends on the size of the city.   




 *spirit.  I am on the mobile site so there is no edit button 




 The "leave me alone" thing most people have mentioned works most of the time, provided the spirit is not interested in you personally.  It depends on the purpose/nature of the spirit.  

Take for example, the situation with my ex.  Shortly after we met, I found out about his ex who had died in a car crash.  This came up after I told him about the lovely dream I had in which at one point a woman I didn't know glared at me and stared me down.  I described her to him, and then he told me about her and that he was worried that would happen, as she had harassed the two girlfriends he'd had since her passing.  I later came to find out that she had been actively haunting him as well.  

I'm not going to go into my history or anything beyond the scope of this story, but when I told him I was going to get rid of her, he said his exes had tried and it didn't work.  I don't know what they tried, and there's no need to go over the altercation in detail, because there wasn't much of a confrontation or laughing at her or telling off like you alluded to in your question.  It was more like we both know what we're here for and I'm here to kick your *** out.  On both sides.  The next day when I saw him, he was shocked BC he hadn't seen or heard from her, and apparently didn't think I could get rid of her.  

It was then that I realized I had fallen in love with him, because I knew that I wouldn't have had the strength to win that fight otherwise.  

That being said, that was a personal matter.

To address your question in a more generic and appropriate way, you cannot just confront a sport, you have to be prepared both in terms of knowing exactly what you're dealing with and in terms of strength and resistance to the challenges and risks the spirit may bring your way.

So, with regards to personal strength, you must first have control of your own thoughts, both so that you can channel your strengths and so that you can tell when someone's trying to mess with your mind.  The basic starting exercise for this is to clear your mind and think of nothing.  The challenge here is control over the urge to fill the silence with "I'm thinking of nothing!" Or thoughts about your breathing.  Once you manage to work past that to where you can clear your mind for a good minute, establishing control over your thoughts (if you're squeamish or weak stomached, this will help you a lot to that end),  You must also, once you have mastered the first, learn how to protect yourself.  If you want to pursue that once you've become master of your own mind, feel free to pm me, or you could post in /r/energywork and ask perhaps about a basic aura shield, although no two people may tell you the same thing.   

To recap, to confront a spirit or entity of any kind, you must know exactly what you are up against, as much as possible, have control of your own mind so you can be sharp and know when someone is messing with you, and know most importantly how to defend and protect yourself (to which clearing your mind is a precursor).  

Only then, can you prepare the appropriate offensive strategy for the specific encounter. 




 I also have had recurring dreams about secret rooms.  Usually it was in the back of the closet of my parents bedroom, through a hidden door, and it went up (even though my house is one story).  Orinally, the first time I had a dream involving that place, like 10 years ago, it was just a small simple playroom.  The most recent one I had, in November or December, it was a complicated structure.  It had already become a two-story hideout in previous installments, but this time, during an alien invasion no less, it was incredibly spacious, with an extra secret backroom in the upstairs, behind a dining room, which even contained a closet, and I was hiding there, treating it as a bunker.  

If you look at it like any other dream, dreams are generally metaphors which reveal things we either subconsciously observed or picked up on but didn't consciously register, or things we've been thinking about subconsciously but don't want to admit.  

Not sure how this applies to recurring dreams about non existent, physically impossible, secret places though.  It depends on the specifics of the dream and your life.  For the ones about your home, it probably signified a desire for something more than your apartment life.

 I stand corrected, this is the original link https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1compp/6302967536/ 




 the voices are the souls of the souless staring people, the bald man is the devil or some sort of demon, and someone put a hit on you, probably losing their own soul in the process, and that's why you were hired via being contacted for an interview at 4am

 when I first saw the title I got kind of mad because I was thinking it'd be something along the lines of a non-verbal autistic person speaking and turning out to be possessed or something.

This was actually a good story, and I love the way you started it because I can relate, because I am 10 years older than my brother, but he is on the mild end of the spectrum.  I completely relate to the third parent thing, although now that he's older and talking more, I can actually be more of a sister too. 




 This January, I had a dream, of the usual menagerie of fantastical nonsense, but then, towards the end, my mom told me we needed to go to WalMart to return a pack of socks.  We went and waited in line and everything.  

When I woke up in the morning, guess what my mom told me we needed to do?

Except, in the dream, the socks were white.  In real life, the socks were black.  But that's irrelevant.



That was the most direct precognitive dream I've ever had.  I've had many, but its always not exactly the same thing, more metaphorical, or similar but not identical. 

This is the first and only time so far that I've dreamed something and had it happen *exactly* that way.  And it was also about socks......


Maybe socks are some sort of key to the future. :) 




 sounding like your father could either make it a dead relative or something malicious trying to trick you.  There's also the question of whether the thing making the voices and the blue man are one in the same.  If not, then the first, talking spirit, may be attached to a family object that you moved with, and the second, blue spirit, may be attached to the new house, since it didn't appear until you moved.  If they are one in the same, it highlights the question of why did they leave you alone until your brother grew old enough to walk and talk and be understood?  If its a dead relative, maybe it wants to send a message to your father by scaring his young children?  maybe someone who didn't approve of the marriage?

other than that, I have no idea.  

did you take anything from the first house when you moved that was not yours before then, meaning that you found in the house (and you as in the whole family).  because if its not attached to a family item, the other explanation for following you would be that you happened to take the item it is attached to from the other house.  

Scratching the center of the basement made me think something was buried under the old house, but if that were the case, the spirit wouldn't have followed you to a new house.  so that is not likely the case. 




 that's good to know.   I'm American and I've only ever had frozen ones, and I thought they were amazing. 




 ouch, yeah at least the only thing I lost was some money.  That was a costly enough mistake that I'll be certain not to make it again. 




 well if he was in a collage (and thus, presumably in a magazine), that would not be as much of a fuckup maybe 




 when I read the title I was thinking what kind of hole puncher can go through earphones, but then I realized you meant the cord

 America.  racial profiling is rampant. 




 am I the only one who thinks its weird that the excuse he gave his grandma was that he had girls in there?  I mean, I'm assuming op's a grown man, but normally that's what you try for your grandma not to think. 




 I dont bike so I didnt know what a kickstand for a bike looks like, so I made the mistake of googling it https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=bike+kickstand rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS600US600 source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ei=8MFuVeCRHq6M7AbC7YGICw ved=0CAgQ_AUoAg biw=1366 bih=643 




 it's not your fuck up, it's your mom's.  It's a good thing that everyone found out, really.  They say ignorance is bliss, and it could have been, but for one, your lives would be a lie, two, your dad needed to know the truth, three, even though she did a really bad thing, your mom is also no longer under the pain and strain of keeping that secret.  

In the long run, you did everyone a favor. 

The fact that she broke down like that over a simple genetics conversation means that she was having trouble holding it together in the first place.

Also, better now while you're all still fairly young instead of finding out later in life and possibly destroying the entire family irreperably (as there'd be no obligation to stick together, and also more years of lies).

edit: oh, and also your sister deserves to know her true identity.  Your father raised her and is still her dad to her and hopefully always will be on his end.  But it's a good thing for her to find out who her biological father is if she wants to; at least she has the opportunity. 




 yess! I was thinking the same thing 




 no don't wish more on him 




 so I spent the semester here in the UK, and I was supposed to be going home to the states today, but I woke up 45 minutes after my bus to the airport had left, and there was no way for me to get to the airport in time for my flight.

I overslept because I didn't remember until late last night that I had to print my ticket for said bus to the airport, so I had to go up to the uni to do so, and got back around 2:15am.  I shouldn't have gone to sleep at all.

As a result, I had to have the ticket changed for Friday, and I paid more to change the ticket than I did for the ticket originally.

Pretty costly fuckup. 




 parts of this installment, the prisoner's story, remind me of John Dies At the End.  With the bugs... 




 to an extent: Pumped up Kicks

 




 apparently it will take me about 4 hours to read hitchhiker's, although that, again, may be slowed by scifi terminology and worldbuilding 




 I stand corrected; it is working when you search by ISBN, but not by title, so one must google the title to get the isbn first.  This may be an easier and more important feature to integrate into your code, to google the isbn first and then plug it into amazon. 




 the tool you linked to for measuring reading speed and comprehension was good to know (even if it just wants to sell software in the end).  (I got 242 wpm and 100% accuracy, for the curious).

Anyway, the amazon results are definitely not working on your site, as per your notice.  They are not working at all.  

I hope you get it fixed soon. Although, I realize now that it's really just a calculator which does the searching and calculation in one step.  

Reading speed varies though with each book.  Especially the next novel on my list, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  Scifi terminology and names slow reading down a bit, not as much as academic writing, but enough to matter over the course of an entire book.

That being said, your tool can be improved beyond being just a calculator if you measure the reading speed in house (rather than through someone else's link).  

This would be the same sort of division, with a start and stop timer button.  Coding for that should actually be simpler than what you have set up (as you're not pulling info from another site).

But there's no point in re-inventing the wheel, unless you can improve it. 

To make your reading speed calculator better than that on readingsoft, you can have a couple different samples of text, for different genres, which the user would select based on the book they intend to read.  

You can have a generic info one like the one on reading soft, a scifi/fantasy passage, a historical/biographical passage, and an academic passage.  (or a slightly different assortment if you have a better ideas).

These should produce different speeds, which would make for more accurate time estimates depending upon the material.

Another option would be to pull a preview passage from Amazon for the books for which such is available.  Using a passage from the actual book would be really cool, and would be a perfect measurement.   That would be some complex code, but people would really like it.  If you're not making money on it though, that would be too much trouble.  Which is why I suggested a small selection of stock passages instead.

Good luck! 




 I think it's cool that this is happening to so many of you guys.  Just so long as it doesn't start happening *with* people; that could be problematic... 




 continuity error in your brain. 

When we develop mentally, as children, we gain the ability to understand that the world continues without us.  That things will not always be in the last place we left them, that the teacher did not stand in the classroom doorway from when school let out to the next morning coming back in.

Prior to achieving that understanding, however, a child is easily baffled by such continuity errors which occur when things are not as he or she left them.

Nothing to do with intelligence, but rather, perception and theory of mind, perhaps your sleep addled brain experienced such a continuity error, having fallen asleep with your arm like that, and truly believed it still should have been like that.  Especially if, like /u/spreggo suggested, if your arm was asleep, then you didn't get the sensory cues that it was laying flat, so your mind (as it is apt to do) filled in the missing information of your arm's location with the assumption that it should be where it last was.

Basis: my psychology education 




 they probably don't.....
if you subscribe to that theory, we are one of many, so they probably don't all come here... 




 well universes aren't empty.  I don't believe in the swtiching universes thing personally, but the idea is that the person avoided their death by moving into an alternate reality.  The reality isnt populated entirely by people who experienced that.  The realities exist adjacent to eachother.  We were already here, as may have been another version of /u/Stadamus . 




 That's England for you I guess.  I'm not in London, but my first day of class this term, on my way back home from the bus stop, I fell and scraped myself up pretty bad.  I thought I would probably get robbed since my things were all over the floor, but on the contrary.  Someone driving by *pulled over* to see if I was ok and help me up.  That was just so unexpected.  




 when I saw the flairs in the sidebar before I read this, I thought they were added for the poster to mark whether it was a small, medium, large, or xtra large fuck up :) 




 I kind of agree.  If it seems to be loving (although you can't be 100% sure), you don't want to be the one to escalate it to violence (although stalkers usually do so on their own).  The best thing to do with a spirit or entity of any kind is to attempt to be nice to it (and maybe kindly ask it to back down) until it shows other intentions. 




 the title is wrong though, she is missing... 




 hmm, then I would say you're just more sensitive to it or actively aware of sensing it.  The someone behind you thing, and things like the facebook thing, are subtle things that just subconsciously register.  The difference then is that you're consciously noticing the signals.  

Just my inference 




 the first one to actually keep me up was room 733, because I read it at 2am in my dorm room.  I stayed up until 5 that night 




 The hearing things fall but nothing being on the floor or anything happens with some regularity at my house as well.  Also usually in the kitchen, when no one is in there.   




 the fact that its usually mischevious stuff, and happened as well in your own home as a child, makes it sound like its not a doppleganger so much as a spirit playing practical jokes. I wouldn't be concered about it being sinister, since its been happening for so long with no danger. But the part for a machine is a bit concerning. As well as the computer doing things in your name that it should not be able to. If it escalates into more dangerous territory (edited medical records, someone seeing you tinkering with the engine on a forklift, etc) then it may be time to get some kind of help (and I don't mean mental help). Although, you might have blackouts, as a more "rational" explanation. Can you account for your entire day on your floor? Are you sure? 




 the "coffin" is definitely the head of the figure, drawn out from the motion of the shot.  As for the figures themselves, \_()_/ 




 of course; trying too hard with anything of this nature ultimately sets you up for failure or self-delusion.
