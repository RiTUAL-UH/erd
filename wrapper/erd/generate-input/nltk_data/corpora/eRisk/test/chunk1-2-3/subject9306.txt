 Anal sex with a virgin girl and a guy with an above-average penis size cannot end well.  




 Do you have a source for the size of Philadelphia? Surely there were larger Indian or Chinese cities.  




 But surely the people causing the conditions leading to the Serbians feeling the need to revolt were at fault? 




 Aren't all wars a competition of imperial powers masquerading as good vs evil? 




 I think you're a) onto a winner of a girl and b) going to need to take it slow. She's been hurt badly before, wants to trust you, but can't - YET. Also, I know from personal experience that depression will only magnify this, and she will perceive all of these problems as being her fault. All you can do is not pressure her but continue to be loving and caring, and she will do the rest in time. 

To use a convenient metaphor from your own story, you need to slowly lead her into the water and carefully help her relearn to swim, despite her fear and apprehension.  




 I'm pretty sure you do share that opinion with everyone.  




 I hate to break it to you, bro, but that kind of attitude is exactly what women (or anyone) finds LEAST attractive. Comparatively, no one gives a fuck if you're ugly/hot smart/dumb so on and so forth, and they'll put up with a bit of self depreciation and lack of self esteem, but when you've let it turn into (what comes across as) bitterness and anger at everything around you that you perceive as better than you, NO ONE will want to spend time with you in any capacity. You have to force yourself to believe in yourself - not even that you're the best or the most outstanding at something, but at least that you're AS GOOD AS EVERYBODY ELSE.

For example, you mentioned that there's a chick who swam across Lake Ontario. So you're not capable of doing that. Well, neither am I. Neither are 6.9 BILLION of the other people in the world. Neither is the guy above me who is a QUALIFIED OLYMPIC SWIMMER. But I can guarantee you're better at swimming across that lake than 1 billion (yes, one billion) people in the world. Chances are you're still better than 3 billion people.

The other thing you need to remind yourself is that depression and low self-esteem is the easy way out. By telling yourself that you suck and that you can't even try, you ARE worse than everybody else at the one thing we all compete in - LIFE. Life itself. It's a race to the finish line, and you're walking dejectedly in the opposite direction. By turning that around and bring determined to win life, you are instantly superior to everybody in the skill that matters more than anything. 

And it'll make you sexy. 

Source: low self esteem, clinical depression, and discovering the hard way that - despite how hard my friends try, and despite anything that anyone ever does - the only person who will get change any of that is ME. 

EDIT: And dude, linking me to an entire thread of people who have completely changed their lives with a bit of exercise and fashion sense, and telling me you're still ugly, is like beating me around the face with the solutions to all of your problems while saying a solution doesn't exist. Seriously. Just go read what you just freaking showed me.  




 Props for putting the TL;DR at the top. I can't understand why one would have to read everything else before finding it.  




 Sounds like the witch hunt seen in Monty Python/Holy Grail.  




 The fact that he had to withdraw a further $300 to cover his actions probably didn't help this.  




 To be fair, the same goes for women not being men without penises. 




 TIL there's a Taken 2 




 This is the appropriate response to a good 50% of /r/datingadvice.  




 Go find a girl, any girl, preferably a hot one. Look at her. Realise the fact that she - it - is nothing but a squishy bag of water and organs. This bag of meat moves around and noises come out of its mouth. Random impulses of electricity cause this to happen. This object is nothing more, and nothing less, than a sack of fluids and bones. 

Look at anyone like that for even a moment and they will never intimidate you again.  




 It sounds like you're doing pretty well, and that you just needed to egg it out and have some people reassure you (and there's nothing wrong with that).

Stay strong! 




 Exactly my point.  




 This is one of those things that you really want to read, but really really shouldn't, because it sends you right back to square one.

And so we come to love the damage we do to ourselves with the absence of that other person, cling to it as much as we clung to them, and use loneliness itself to get through the day.

Thank god I deleted her phone number, because I don't think I'd be able to restrain myself at the moment otherwise.

EDIT: Also, if you're a deviantart person, I highly suggest you submit this. It was beautiful. 




 Classical music is hardly music for the masses either. 




 At my uni's music program I find it completely the opposite - classical musicians are superior, and god help you if you're playing Jazz Bazz. Snobbery everywhere.

Of course, I'm just a lowly Musical Theatre actor (incidentally by far the most competitive course to get into) so I get it from all sides. 




 I like to say "tell me the most awesome thing about yourself." Shows I'm interested in her, usually reveals something they're passionate about, and boosts their self esteem by allowing them to brag for a second. Also, if they come out with something shallow or stupid without thinking about their answer at all, it shows that they probably have very little maturity or self-introspection, and I know that they wouldn't be well suited to me. 




 Tbh it sounds like there's a problem with her, not you, that she doesn't want to tell you. Especially if she contacted you later to make you not feel bad - if you'd pissed her off she wouldn't give a fuck.

Has she broken up with anyone recently, and can't relate to a new guy yet? A self esteem issue where she feels like she doesn't deserve you? (Unlikely I know, but I've seen a girl with depression remain convinced that no one could ever love her even after being asked out by a guy) 




 Too put it nicely, /r/seduction (not /r/seddit, which is the same with just 300 subs) is... geared towards sex and nothing else. It also encourages people to look at the opposite sex as an opportunity and target of manipulation, not a person with emotions.

In short, it's not for everybody. 




 As fun as these threads are to read, they're all essentially pointless - you could wear a little pink tutu and still be sexy if you're attractive, and if you're not, even a $40 000 suit won't save you.

Rule 1: Be attractive. Rule 2: Don't be unattractive. 




 Girls don't emotionally mature faster. They're just as fucking stupid at 17, they just don't display it in the 'let's do stuff that might get us killed' way. 




 Majority of SOCIAL risks. Girls do have pregnancy. But I agree with you. 




 If it gets buried then no one is going to see or read it anyway. So why point it out? 




 Firstly, I suggest you xpost to /r/singing. They get these kind of requests on a daily basis.

Also, your audition song doesn't have to be about the same thing as the show - especially with a character this specific. If it's a funny show, go a character song. If it's more serious, likewise.

For your range (which I suggest you edit into the original post, along with your age), I suggest [I'm Not That Smart](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2M93eivYXr4) from The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee  as a lighthearted character song, and [Valjean's Soliloquy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GrJeP9FKN0) as a more serious alternative. 




 He's saying your penis is 5'3". 




 Surely if she's mentally unstable, something would have happened like this before? That's a long time! 




 It ripped the arms off a droid? What a woman. 




 Dammit Jesus, you fuck everything up. 




 /r/depression. They are friendly people going through the same thing as you, and I find they can help a lot. 




 When you need to make a decision with a group, and everyone's doing the 'I don't mind, you pick' thing (such as where shall we get dinner etc.), don't be all considerate and ask them what they want to do. Make a decision right there and then, and stick to it. Major confidence points. 




 I hope the pizza man delivered.  




 That's absolutely awful. I'm sorry you had to go through that. If you ever need someone to talk to, please PM me. 




 I think overall he means the same as you - to own yourself, everything about you, and any situation you might be in.  




 So basically - be attractive and confident, and don't complain when a girl who you have displayed neither to isn't interested, just because you're 'nice'? 




 The teacher too has acted inappropriately and unprofessionally. Is there a higher authority you can go to? 




 That's completely out of line. You should have told him to fuck off in no uncertain terms. It's sexual assault, ANYONE would be uncomfortable with that.  




 Well, this is r/sex. 




 Fascist clues?! 




 Musos can be very huggy. You might want to be careful there.  




 Swimsuit? Where are you waking up, in a creek? 




 Similar situation and similar end result, except I only realized the change in myself a few days ago. Great relationship with an amazing and unique person, brutal breakup, depression and the ability to talk to any girl because what the hell, they're not HER, they will never be as good as her.

Finally get over her - now I have the confidence and communication skills without the baggage. 




 Presumably somewhere where people don't talk to them much. 




 Exactly.  




 As someone who is in their first year of college, and had exactly the same situation as you in high school - IT GETS SO MUCH FUCKING BETTER. 




 This is going to sound terribly specific, but I suggest you try to get into some Music/Performing Arts circles. All of my best friends are musicians, and (with obvious exceptions) they are the kindest, most generous, most fun and by far the most outgoing people you will ever meet. They make friends very quickly and easily, and never have too many, so you'll be welcomed into a group within minutes.

While these types of people obviously are not perfect (can be very egotistical, competitive, and bitchy if you get on their bad side, eccentric as hell), they seem to me to be the best option for getting out of the situation you're in quickly. Giving up on my more conventional 'friends' and increasing my socializing with these guys single-handedly solved my loneliness, found all of my best friends and my first (  subsequent) girlfriend(s), and gave me plenty of things to get out and do/see.

So maybe join a local community choir or theatre company. Join a band/orchestra if you can play an instrument. Trust me, good times will be had. 




 So why comment? 




 When you've told him subtly you don't want him arond, and he asks why, you need to tell him EXACTLY why. Meaning he's being creepy and overly attached.

It's part of the 'nice guy' phenonemon - there's a great thread about it over [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/lncn2/compiled_a_kill_nice_guy_with_fire_guide_for_men/) - wherein he just does not understand all of the social signals you have sent him to say back off. You have no other option but to tell him in no uncertain terms he's not wanted. He be a bit unhappy, but he will learn from the experience and do much better with interpersonal interactions in the future.

If you aren't brutally honest about what he's doing wrong, he'll be one of the sorry creatures that rants about how they are in the 'friendzone' and 'she keeps going out with guys who aren't as nice and dedicated as I am,' etc etc. You can save him the long term agony now with one frank conversation. 




 The fact that you're being so aggressive in return, when she has clearly stated she was just trying to be helpful, is far worse. 




 I think the only place they don't have them is above the tree line on our biggest mountains in snow season. Even then, I'd take precautions. 




 Brisbane and 18 here, I assume you guys have Coffee Club? Fairly classy, waited tables, decent food, but still pretty chilled. Usually in central locations. I take people there all the time. 




 Can I suggest you crosspost this to /r/relationship_advice or something similar? You hardly need help seducing her, which is what this subreddit is really for. Also, edit out most of the sex, they won't be interested unless it's r/gonewildstories.

As far as suggestions, I'd say that 7 months is plenty of time to have a lot of fun. Tell her you want to be casual, that she can take her time and make up her own mind about whether she trusts you once she knows you better. Don't push her, just enjoy her company. 




 So give everyone money? 




 Add this to "I don't think I'm ever going to find someone better" 




 Hopefully they'll have kids. Then there will be. 




 To be fair, though, clothes are designed to accent the body of the person wearing them. They don't do the seducing all by themselves. 




 So do guys.  




 If only we ever got off reddit and went outside... 




 It was probably diagnosed and/or medicated. 




 Because of the twist ending I didn't realise he didn't actually write that for a while. 




 Lawyered 




 I'm expecting a full Harvard bibliographical reference directly under the tattoo. 




 Gonna rock some Jane Austen/Anna Karenina. 




 The irony is that you need more full stops because you have too many. 




 A common theme seems to be books - what kind of books? I have shitloads and there's no way I can get them all in my room at once.  
























 The whole concept of a neg doesn't fucking work. If someone told me I was ugly, would you seriously expect me to start taking off my clothes and exposing myself? No, I'd run and hide and never have sex again.  




 I think there are a huge number of men who are attracted to shy women.  




 Would people in this thread like to answer their own questions? It could make things quite interesting. 




 "What are the signs that a girl likes a guy?"

Bi-weekly at least. 




 Can we sidebar something like this? I see these threads at least once a week, from both genders in both subreddits, and the answers are always the same - followed by 'just go for it and ask him/her already.' 




 Can someone translate this please? 




 I tend to find that the 'spark' doesn't appear until you are comfortable with the person - particularly when you're actually going out. If you asked him out (I assume he'll say yes) and both of you relax, you will have a lot more fun together. The awkwardness will disappear when he doesn't feel he constantly has to impress you (which he does if he likes you).

Also, the 'chemistry' mentioned in movies can be exaggerated, and is better labelled as 'having fun in their company.' Expecting some strange and magical feeling of love at first sight to suddenly strike you down is quite simply not going to happen. 




 Maybe he's one of the 64 




 bend over backwards for them

Well there's your problem. Sorry mate, but you're about to hear some harsh truths. 

You're a *nice guy* - otherwise referred to as the most unattractive object in the world. Sorry. There's an excellent guide to helping you in r/askwomen or something, and I'll link you to it when I'm not on my phone, unless somebody helpful will do it for me. 

Basically you're coming across totally wrong - in your desire to not be a loser, you're making yourself even more so. Rather than conveying 'a sensitive, caring guy who just wants love,' you're putting across 'needy, possibly obsessive, and high maintenance with very low self-esteem.'

they say I'll find somebody

Can you please elaborate more on the conversation leading up to this? It will help us dissect what you're saying wrong. 

I have no doubt that you're a great guy with a lot to offer a girl - and you *need* to believe this too - but the way you're conveying yourself is unfortunately of a weak, needy... loser.  




 I would hope so, seeing as they're married.  




 /r/malefashionadvice 




 - Rob Thomas 




 The fuck? Since when was violin less cool than flute? And I'm pretty sure even professional musicians who are male flautists still get ridiculed. 

I played Trombone in high school. If I hadn't also been able to sing my dorkness would have been over 9000.  




 Well, the person who stole it does.  




 If you want him, you need to put in some effort and step outside your comfort zone. It's as simple as that.  




 r/seduction would have an apoplexy if the guy gave a girl his number. But I think it builds a bit of trust and makes you look less like yore just trying to get in her pants. Opinions, anybody? 




 There's such an emphasis on males upholding this side of a relationship - he must always tell you you're beautiful, that you look nice, etc. etc. or he's not worth being with - but it never goes both ways. 




 Well laaa di dah  




 Or that something has gone wrong.  




 Dolce et decorum est 




 I don't think there should be conscription for anyone, but I think we can have gender equality long before we have world peace, so I'm working on achievable goals.  




 I didn't say I was *right*. 




 While I am all for feminism, this has always irritated me. You can't seriously expect women to have an equal place to men in society when we can be forced to kill and to die, and you can't.  




 So by that maths, Afghanistan has -1 health care systems? 




 I'm a historian, and I don't agree.  




 If you did the cover a long time ago, how can you be a new player/singer? 




 I suppose at 18 I'm not really old enough to say 'I know how you feel,' but I'm going to anyway.

I don't know what's wrong with me. I always try to be outgoing, happy and fun, I have numerous friends (mostly female, in fact) in several circles who think I'm funny and good company, I go well out of my way to ensure people around me are happy. I dress as well as I can afford (thank you MFA), I always try to be polite, and I don't think I'm stupid. I'm a paid, professional singer, and I can play guitar. I have no problems approaching girls and talking to them, and I don't think I'm boring - even so, I've studied r/socialskills intently. Sounds good on paper, right?

Wrong. 

I have always been the third wheel, for my entire life. I had one girlfriend for two months, who seriously fucked me over emotionally and then cheated on me with some sixteen year old cunt. My friends and hers (who are no longer her friends) all agree that I did everything perfectly - was understanding, supportive, romantic; in one girl's words "the perfect boyfriend." Besides her, not a single girl has ever shown interest in me, and whenever I try to initiate - which I do on a DAILY basis - they always make it more than clear that they're not interested. I've joined clubs and pursued hobbies, I've taken ballroom dancing classes, am involved in more musical ensembles than is healthy for my sanity. I go out drinking/dancing/clubbing; every person in the group will hook up with someone - except me. It doesn't matter. I meet so many people, and I'm friends with most of them almost instantly, but NONE of them ever display any interest in me beyond that. 

I've concluded that I'm ugly, which makes me a little sad, because there's nothing I can do about it (besides plastic surgery - fuck that shit), so I'm stuck being lonely for the rest of my life. 

P.S. I don't whinge about the 'friendzone' because that attitude is pathetic, but when a girl you really like refers to you as her Gay Best Friend it stings.  




 Am I the only person in the world that finds something to talk about, and doesn't just say 'hey'? 




 Quiet... drama girl? Quiet drama people exist? 




 Or where he fits in Kara! 




 SIMBA 




 Don't feel like you should *have* to kiss etc, as if it's not a real relationship without it. If you're comfortable just being with each other, so much the better.  




 Being in a relationship is just like being really good friends, but with sex. If you're not having sex yet (totally understandable at her age, and it's important not to pressure her) then you don't even need to worry about that. Hang out, go to movies and shit, do whatever you would normally with other friends. Don't have sexual contact with anyone besides her. There is an implicit emotional connection; you will probably be her go-to person for emotional support, and likewise. 

The bottom line: have fun. It should be about opportunities, not duties.  




 Shirts three sizes too big on girls are EXTREMELY flattering.  




 Wait, so the baby had down's syndrome, was fathered by an ex boyfriend, who was the daddy?

Or the girl had down's syndrome and her dad, who was not only her ex but also a baby, was wailing in the car? 




 Dude. She's talking about sex stories with you. Clear sign that (to quote Superbad) she wants your dick, in and around her mouth. 

All you have to do now is make a move and go get some! 




 If you approach him, it will make his day. His week. His life. 

He's probably beating himself up about not having the confidence to approach you, but if you give him a lead in he'll most likely gain a ton of it. And it'll put a smile on his face for a month. 

EDIT: if what you're saying about the looking and looking away is true, then he likes you. No doubt. This is a classic for shy guys.  




 Can I ask why he is being downvoted? I make these kind of jokes all the time - especially when girls are talking about girl things, like waxing their legs etc - and they're great for a quick laugh.

And the bottom line of social skills is that once you've shared a joke with someone your relationship with them will never be the same. It's the oldest form of connection (besides probably sex) in human history.  




 By 'went back to his place' I'm assuming you mean you slept with him - in which case, if he doesn't contact you and does a hit  amp; quit, then he's a dickhead and not worth being with anyway. If he's not, he will!

EDIT: I have absolutely no problems with her sleeping with anyone, it just affects the situation.  




 I think she's using 'stalk' lightheartedly. I certainly do when talking about Facebook, and I hear it constantly from other people.  




 With notable exceptions on both sides, I find particularly attractive people to be less giving in all walks of life. Not that they're unkind, but less attractive people are more likely to go well out of their way for other people, because unfortunately they have to.  




 I DON'T CARE WHERE YOU ARE OR WHAT YOU'RE DOING. SIT THE FUCK DOWN AND WRITE PART 2. NOW.

AND PART 3, AND PART 4, AND PART 5. 




 You said that everybody has left and there is nobody in your town like you - this is a bit of a defeatist attitude and not be done lightly, but have you considered leaving too?

EDIT: As an artsy person who found great happiness in the big smoke 




 I really loved this comment, but how does it relate to kissing? 




 I've need seen it used in a sentence, so perhaps the Supine is just the 'dictionary' form of the Participle? 




 What if another rocket fails and they don't want us to know? 




 I'm currently doing Latin at University, and we learned (just last week actually) that the Participle is derived from the Supine form, but the Supine is still used as the Principal Part. That's from the Cambridge Latin textbook.  




 That's the next line of the song.  




 Coz papa's gonna be bringing' home the... gingerbread! 




 Latin verbs have four principle parts - the Present Indicative Active, Present Infinitive, Perfect Indicative Active, and Supine. 

I can see how this relates to English, but I've never heard our words organized in this way. Is it used in teaching the language? 




 I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with the term 'Venetian Blonde.' This may because Venice is on the other side of the world from Australia.  




 Can you imagine the world before that song? CHAOS.  




 Aussies unite. Our chicks are by far the best. 

Which is my excuse for why I still miss her.  




 Gingers are orange.  




 Yeah the PM gives them all a bad name 




 ... the pub? 




 
Running their fingers through my ginger beard? 




 As someone who is familiar with Principal Parts in other languages but not English, can you please explain how they function in this language? I am fascinated. I didn't know we had them.  




 Yeah, this thread was not a good move.  




 I waltz over and talk to girls all the time, and they do think it's weird. They think I'm eccentric as hell. Which is probably true. 

But they also think I'm fun, outgoing, and confident - which equals attractive.  




 We are making some progress. 

I said a bang, bang, bangity bang, I said a bang bang bangity bang.  




 I can only assume this is what they did. 




 Getting called gay when you're clearly not is a compliment? ... this changes everything.  




 To be fair, Romans were always in sex mode. 

One of the duties of the Censors (an elected position) was to prevent celibacy. Yes, conservative Christians and Texan sexual educators, you heard that right. PREVENT.  




 I would like to point out that not all guys find confidence attractive. It doesn't change a single thing for me, and I would almost prefer a quiet shy girl (albeit one who is still attractive) to an overtly confident girl.  




 Yes, bikinis are major factor. But the whole salty hair, warm   tanned skin, and general fun atmosphere of the beach makes it a particularly sexy place.  




 Here's the secret: you actually look really sexy at the beach, just in a totally different way.  
























 Is it just me or does tiled floor + socks + chasing cat seem like a bad idea? 




 Elaborate? 




 Please enlighten me on the correct wording of the joke as it would please you. 

And I live with several engineering students, all of whom never shut up about it.  




 Yeah, of course it's in the USA.  




 How do you know someone is an engineer?

They'll tell you.  




 So really you're not like any of them.  




 The accident being that western society developed in the way that you described, and not in some other way.  




 No. INDIVIDUALS run the world. The fact that most of these happen to be men is an accident of western history. There are just as many men who need help for various things as women.  




 I've been told in the past that being called cute is actually a bad thing - it means you're passable but don't have the confidence that women find truly attractive to be 'hot/sexy.' Any women care to clarify? 




 Dude. Normal-shaped girl with just a leeeetle bit of belly = HOT. So much more than a flat stomach.  




 Amazon's amazing for posters. I got some massive and good quality musical theatre posters for like $7 (AUD) each.  




 I think it's supposed to be 'barefooted,' but people have a habit of dropping past tenses when they talk about concepts. 

r/linguistics can probably explain these things with much more accuracy.  




 That's a harsh school if you got in trouble for being 37 seconds late.  




 How exactly did that happen? Did she force you to have vaginal sex with her? 




 Apparently sounding intelligent is very attractive. You should keep doing whatever you were doing.  




 That's absolutely awful. But since you mentioned the babysitter was female, what is your gender? 




 Like any scientific study, regardless of the language used to describe it.  




 Neither of those were really directed at you - the first obviously because you're not hideous and gross. The second means that the man in question is backing off and not displaying his (still ever-present) interest because he is getting none from the girl in return. Most guys are interested in all females they know (that meet the attractiveness of point one) all the time, and are simply hedging their bets by showing only their interest in those who respond the most. There is no 'friend zone' or non-attractiveness-related reasons for lack of interest, as there often is from the female perspective. As you're displaying a lot of interest (I certainly hope you are) you don't have this problem.  




 There's really no such thing as a male initiated friendzone. It's either a) I don't want to bang her because she's unattractive or b) she displays little interest in banging me right now, so I'm shelving the project until further budget of interest is acquired.  




 I'm agreeing with now that you've specified your answer to mean in the realms of sexuality and attractiveness. Your first was a little too broad - and, honestly, came off as very sexist - which is why I think people were offended.  




 Well laa di daah 




 It is so much vastly easier for women to be attractive than men.  




 Please elaborate on how this could be possible? 




 most men do a better job with children

Can you elaborate on this for my curiosity please? 




 That being said, don't let sex become your only goal - regardless of your morality, I've seen plenty of advice on here that aiming for sex alone in a night (and not just to have fun) will ruin your game long-term 




 Which means the only direction is up.  




 TEN POINTS FROM GRYFFINDOR 




 As Achilles, I can confirm this. 




 Implying sex is the only goal and the only worthy conclusion 




 Or unless laws make the risk outweigh the reward.  




 Which would be like teaching that green shells are the only shells, and scientists developing blue shells are demons trying to corrupt you.  




 In all seriousness, who has such self confidence that they don't compare themselves to anyone else, or are ever jealous of somebody's looks or abilities? It's not possible, and a little bit of self introspection and humility can be healthy.  




 Four of my five roommates happen to be female with boyfriends, and the one dude is out right now. So I'm no sure that would go down too well. But thanks for the suggestion.  




 I'm naked right now, so thank you 




 Some places have preschool before kindergarten.  




 No, you were already downvoted.  




 He's just jealous because he's a 13 year old that won't have sex for a loooong time.  




 By the number of perfectly acceptable posts I saw on 0 at the bottom of the thread, I'm guessing some prudish prick is downvoting everything involving underage sex.  




 Wait wait wait... you say you were a *virgin* the first time you had sex? Wtf? 




 I hate to sound like Skittles11, but could you elaborate on how oral sex happened at 7?! 




 I'm gonna go ahead and guess that happens because it's funny.  




 Does this extent to all substantial facial hair, or just the bushy variety? 




 Shy people and introverts don't 'hate' people. They occasionally need some space, and don't like loud, hyper-social environments. 

This does not mean that they are sociopaths.  




 That is the stupidest fucking thing I've ever heard. 

Please, do explain how do you came to this conclusion.  




 Are you saying that shy people are mentally unstable? 




 I saved the comment, just so I never forget 




 Thank you! 




 Like you? 




 And you're really fixing that with your mature and constructive response.  




 Confident people can have self-doubt. Self-introspection is often the difference between confidence and arrogance.  




 I'm going to dispute you on unattractive girls being able to win men with confidence. I personally don't find confidence as a positive or a negative, and I know plenty of men who prefer shy girls. I would have no problems 'finding a reason to say yes' to an unattractive girl who approached me.  




 Post-orgasm, after we've laid there and chilled for thirty seconds, I always flip her over and give her a back massage. She says it's incredible. I'm pretty sure she now has sex with me just for the backrub.  




 If he has that little confidence in himself, of course she's going to look for better options. It's just unattractive.  




 The guy just sounds jaded that he is no longer attractive or putting enough effort into a relationship to keep her attention. Not only is this his fault, but it also goes both ways - women should thus be equally worried about men using their smartphones to find better options. So, as always, what it comes down to is not becoming complacent and taking your significant other for granted. Regardless of whether it's the 2nd century or the 20th.

 Do you know what 'delenda est' means?

 Hah, GAAAAY 




 This is what I struggle with the most about r/seduction - the ideal presented, and what women seem to find attractive, is frankly repulsive to me. I actually want to be a nice guy. I want to help people. I want to be friends with them. I DON'T want to spend every second of my life being superior, or a 'leader,' or the most aggressive caveman. I sure as hell don't want to treat women like objects. 

I've spent a fair bit of time here trying to reconcile the two philosophies, without much success. If I remain celibate for life and not a repulsive douchebag, so be it.  




 After the open-ended question, ask more questions to uncover specific details. Then share something related about yourself/your viewpoint on the subject. Rinse and repeat. 

E.g: what did you do this weekend? I went skiing.
- I didn't know you like skiing. How long have you been doing that for?
- was it fun? Any exciting stories? (moderate effectiveness depending on what you're actually asking about)
-  where did you go? What was it like there?
- is skiing hard?

Then:

- the last time I went skiing, I nearly got eaten by a carp. Crazy, right?
- I've heard a lot about skiing but never tried it. What about it is so fun? (great question if the person is really passionate about the given topic)
- my wife loves skiing. You should go together sometime.
- have you tried (skiing place)?

These all vary according to your level of knowledge of the subject, but a good rule of thumb is that if you don't know what they're talking about, encourage them to explain and teach you. If you do, share expertise/viewpoints/stories etc. Learn further. Note that it is **very** important not to talk too much about your own perspectives, especially when talking about something like politics.  




 This is about as erotic as the American Idol auditions.

Which brings me nicely to **VIII**: Thou shalt critique the spelling of others in a 19th Century German Facist manner 




 Does she ignore you or not talk to you? The difference is very important. 

If you're trying to talk to her and she is being noncommittal, one word answers, trying to get away etc - ignoring you - then she is clearly not into you at all, and asking her out will only lead to great embarrassment. 

If she just doesn't come up and talk to you because you're not that good friends, or because she has higher priorities (other friends that you mentioned) then there's nothing wrong. She just doesn't know you well enough to have a reason to talk to you. While a lot of people are advocating to straight up ask her out, and this attitude is definitely what you need, I'd still advise testing the waters a little bit - find some reason to make conversation with her and see how she reacts (ask her to help you with some schoolwork etc). If she responds in a friendly manner - and not in the way I described in the first paragraph - all signals go. Balls to the wind, ask her out, and hopefully she says yes. 

If she politely turns you down, don't be offended. You're not right for each other and she knows it. The same applies for if she is properly ignoring you as above. If she rejects you nastily, then she's a Class A bitch that you definitely don't want to be with, and you've just dodged a bullet. 

Good luck! 
























 As a genuinely curious male who doesn't know: what are the struggles of females in the dating world? 




 Classic Schmosby 




 Only 9 hours? You didn't watch the extended edition. For shame.  




 While any situation like this can absolutely be regarded as rape, I would like to tentatively suggest that he may not have considered it a negative experience had she been very attractive. 




 I doubt it.  




 Every suggestion in this thread is absolutely valid, but I've always found the best cure is to find someone else to think about. Not necessarily go out with etc, though that's great for you if you're ready for it, but find someone else to occupy your mind, wish you were with , want to talk to and so on.  




 Go for it! :) 




 despite the fact that I usually dress very well

I'm going to be a little skeptical, because this can be subjective. Perhaps she meant dress a little more *convemtionally* well? 




 Tbh, the dating system is MUCH easier for women than for men.  




 I literally cannot ever scratch anything in my mother's presence, because it means I must be sick or having an allergic reaction to something somehow. Apparently people don't just get itchy sometimes.  




 I decided something had to be done when my self esteem was so low and I was so worried what everybody thought of me that I started having severe panic attacks in public.  




 I'd be happier for people to be here than to have no community at all. 




 Seven years? I find optimism helps. 




 Comments like this are what give this subreddit a reputation for being breakup trigger-happy. 




 Gorgeous! I know it's totally up to you and your goals, but based on how much your face has changed, I reckon you're fine where you are :) 




 I'm glad you're recovering - things *will* get better for you. PM me if you ever need to talk.  




 Mate, that's amazing progress! Congratulations, you should be really proud of yourself!

I'm doing ok. Starting losing some weight - only two kilos down, but that's not so bad, as I only want to lose about fifteen. I was actually feeling on the way up for the first time in years before I got diagnosed - like I'd started the medication before getting the illness.  




 Thanks, you too! 




 I'm glad you feel better, and I hope it stays that way! I know the parents are just worried, which is why I'm trying to put up with it as much as possible. It's just awkward because if there's any reason I'm like this in the first place, it's probably them.

With regards to therapy, I'm actually being taught medical hypnosis at the moment - which sounds whacked, but you do it to yourself, and it's basically a kind of meditation where you combat low self esteem by convincing yourself that you're actually worthwhile and things like that. So far it's working.  




 It will get better. Trust me. No matter what happens, you will get through these exams and shit and into a brighter place. PM me if you need to talk it out any more, any time. Really. 

And I hadn't intended it to be, but I love that band and I love that song! Cheers brother! 




 It took me a while to realize they don't want help, they want the emotional support to enable them to help themselves.  




 Exactly right. Even though I'm relatively new here (been lurking for a bit), I think this subbreddit would benefit from a mentality of being a team where we can beat our problems together - *more* than just a place where we can talk it out (though that's great too). 




 I'm glad you're out of the relationship, and I'm glad you're washing the memories away with something tasty. Though whether you feel fine in the morning is yet to be seen :P

PM me if you ever need to talk.  




 Cheers! Good luck to you bud :) 




 It's weird how you take a kind of perverse pleasure in being depressed. It's one of the reasons I took so long to get diagnosed - you feel like its one of the few things you really enjoy. 

But you'll get back on your feet, and enjoying things the conventional way. Feel free to PM me any time :) 




 I struggled for a long time with the possibility that I might just have a severe case of Whiny Little Bitch Disorder, so to know that I'm not just an attention whore is nice. 

It also took a *long* time and the constant encouraging of some very helpful friends to get me to therapy at all. I just didn't want to take a step forward (though I didn't see it like that at the time). So I guess I have achieved something.  




 I'm glad you're making progress! The only way is up!

Ironically, I've been diagnosed at a point when I also actually feel on the uphill at last, as opposed to the usual low point when people finally see a doctor. It's quite weird, having almost received the medication a few months before the illness.  




 It's absolutely not your fault. At all. 

What I'd meant was that I had unwittingly been an example of how men see an emotionally strong and confident male, and the benefit that such an attitude of emotional self-reliance brings them, and instantly try to emulate it - or believe that they are inferior for not being able to do so. It's a knee-jerk reaction to someone you perceive to be 'better' than you.  




 Bro, you're just at one those temporary low points that happen to everyone. The only way from here is up, and I'm sure you'll be right on top of it next week.  




 If he wants to fix things, it means he is concerned and he cares.  




 Actually, I would say shoulders first (if that) and waist a very close second. Compare the attractiveness of a man in a loose dress shirt and a slim fit dress shirt of the same size - equal shoulders, but one looks like a tent.  




 So basically, you want clothes that fit without actually changing what clothes you wear?

And it's male *fashion.* So it's going to be clothes that are fashionable. Like not tshirts.  




 How else is anyone supposed to address the gender as a whole? 

On that note, should we expect... that non-man gender to not use the word 'male?' 




 And this is precisely where the social pressure comes from. It's not your fault, but as soon as I read your comment I criticized myself for not having the moral strength and conviction that you do, and decided I should try to be more like it in the future, before realising I was perpetuating the stereotype.  




 What girls say they want a man to do with his emotions and what they *actually* want are two very different things. 

They want a man to open up about himself an expose his vulnerabilities. But they also want him to be a towering pillar of strength and self-confidence, because that's what's attractive. Lo and behold, when I try to express the fact that I'm actually not this ridiculously self-confident and completely emotionally self-reliant thing, they are gone in a flash.  




 Can you imagine it without the u and g?

 I was actually expecting 'listen when I'm upset and don't try to fix the problem' 




 everyone hates having me around them

As someone who used to think the same thing, I can assure you that they don't. I have atrocious self-esteem (it's getting better, and I'll tell you why), and frequently would go out with my friends and return home feeling like shit because of all the stupid things I've said or done. Focus in every tiny little thing that indicates that someone hated me, even though they'd been friends with me for years. I was utterly convinced that all these people despised me. This was because I deliberately sought out *excuses* to hate myself - evidence to support the warped view I had of myself. I would focus on every little thing I had done, and either blow it way out of proportion (like a joke that wasn't THAT funny, but could have been worse, becoming the most stupid fucking thing I've ever said) or come up with reasons why they actually hate me for it - which are completely unreasonable. I focused on every little bad thing I'd done and completely ignored everything good, or rationalised the good things to actually be a way to hate myself. So all I saw were bad things, all the time. You, I think, are doing the same. My friends, not being severely depressed, only saw the many good things - good jokes, kind gestures, insightful statements, general friend things - and none of the bad, because I hadn't actually done anything wrong. They thought I was cool. But I just couldn't see it, because I was so determined to prove them all wrong and took such pleasure in destroying myself. 

In summary, I can assure you that people love to be around you. You either don't notice the signs or are deliberately telling yourself they're wrong. If they didn't like you, they'd tell you to fuck off to your face.  




 What are dad jeans? 




 I find that the fairly standard (as in not too experimental) outfits from /r/malefashionadvice go over well.  




 Apple in the mouth? 




 It is, because advise is a different word.  




 Do males who don't have a no-nonsense exterior still get points for being sensitive? I feel that I don't because I'm not all "manly man" and that being capable of communicating my emotions without being forced at gunpoint has made me unattractive.  




 Also centre. 

Are you sure about colourise? 




 I don't even know what she was trying to imply. That you actually molested the babysitter? 




 I %100 agree with what you just said, but how is it relevant to women being encouraged to compare their bodies to media figures more than men? 




 Yes, but males are taught to compare their ACTIONS to role models - being manly, successful, and rich - whereas women focus on their bodies. 

You rarely hear a woman say 'omg, I wish I had her personality.' 




 You're quite right. If you're attractive enough and you make an approach, a woman is very likely to succeed. 

It seems to me that women have the dating world much easier than men.  




 Women are very, very strongly encouraged by media and society to compare themselves to supermodels. Not so much for men.  




 This comment makes me sad.  




 I think it is much easier for women to be attractive than men.

 As much as I agree with you, please elaborate on why these things are incorrect. It is a thread for newbies, after all.  




 It's half advice and half bragging about how he's a "master seducer" with "over a hundred lays," "always hanging girls" etc etc. If there wasn't some fairly solid (if distastefully presented) advice in the post I'd suspect he was a fourteen year old virgin  




 Severely. I hate to say it, but to some people this community has picked up quite a bad reputation in other parts of reddit, and posts like this are what give it that reputation.  




 The extra room in the head creates more movement, friction with the glans, and thus pleasure.

 Also: magnum condoms are are wider, not longer. Most people do fit them, and they can increase pleasure quite a lot.

edit: to be precise, they are wider at the head. 




 Why shouldn't you do it with just anyone? It's not that special - as a matter of fact, it tends to suck for all parties involved - and is best gotten over with quickly so you can practice and actually make it enjoyable.

 Here's your hat and coat 




 I don't think I was ever a truly horrific 'nice guy,' but I struggled (and still do) with the idea that some selfishness or at least putting self-interest first in a relationship is not only healthy but almost required.  




 I'm from Australia, it's basically required 




 I think you're going to get downvoted for this because your wording is a little aggressive, but it would be worth noting that this is the impression the comment's OP receives from reddit, not necessarily her opinion on the world.  




 Yeah I did, OP clarified it for me.  




 I said it in the other thread and I'll say it again: I think that /r/seduction, despite its flaws, actually teaches men to treat women better and be less misogynistic by dispelling the myth of the friendzone and showing them how to be genuinely attractive. 

Perhaps a better example is /r/faimprovement.  




 My mistake. It's a little different then, but I still think it would be a shocking idea to say I love you regardless of how he feels about you. On one hand, even if he does feel the same, I'd say you haven't been back together for long enough for it to withstand that level of serious commitment. If he doesn't feel that way about you, sheer and utter disaster.  




 EDIT: I derped and missed the fact that they're back together now. Keep that in mind. 

I think the fact that he's not your boyfriend and hasn't been in a year would have been a nice inclusion in the title. 

I'm actually not going to go back and read it all because this question is very, very easy:

1) does he feel the same about you? Do you know this for certain? If yes to both, get back together and be happy. If no to either, proceed to step 2. 
2) he no longer wishes to be in a relationship and has moved on. There is *absolutely nothing* you can do about this, and you need to move on as well. It was good while it lasted, and now you need to pack up the memories and think about someone else. Continuing to dwell on this guy will only hurt you, and telling him you LOVE him will stir up all kinds of trouble (even if he still has genuine affection for you). 




 When you phrase them in a way that makes men feel manipulated by the big bad nasty women, of course they will.  




 PSA: 'whoosh' has been so used and abused that it is now downvoted regardless of context and usage. Please stop trying, for your own karma. 




 I think you're the female version of the 'nice guy.' 




 I find it incredibly ironic that (it seems to me) the type of people who think that the best way to be attractive is to be nauseatingly nice to women are usually the most casually misogynistic. 

In this way, as someone who regularly reads /r/seduction with their doucheometer primed and their salt shaker at the ready (just in case, it's usually a fairly nice place), that subreddit actually teaches and encourages BETTER treatment of women - usually by turning jaded and misogynistic 'nice guys' into people who are accepting of their own flaws and of everyone around them, regardless of gender.  




 ... yeah that's a bit messed up. 




 Let's hang on a second. From what I've read (and please correct me) we have no indication of whether this Cheyenne KNOWS the man is taken, let alone married. 

She might think this is a perfectly legitimate relationship. Yeah, a 16 year old going out with a 25 year old is weird (and seemingly illegal in OP's area of the world). But I've seen weirder, and young girls have a serious boner for older guys. This isn't going to change. Let's not crucify her as a manipulative, husband-stealing bitch just yet.

EDIT: for some perspective - and I know this isn't quite the same nor the same level of magnitude, but I'm currently 19. When I had just turned 18,  my first kiss was with a 23 year old girl. It didn't go further than that and we're now friends. I don't consider it a negative experience at all, and though it's a little different because I was legal everywhere and male - and thus completely impervious to all forms of manipulation or sexual abuse (sarcasm) - I think OP's case could be viewed in a similarly more generous way. Teenagers will be teenagers. 

The 25 year old man, though, is just a cunt.  




 how to make friends better than normal people do 




 Her: I have a boyfriend
You: I have a maths test tomorrow
Her: what?
You: oh, I thought we were talking about stuff we can cheat on

EDIT: Not seriously suggesting using this, it's just a joke I heard.   




 I suppose that if everybody is equal in value there are a lot more options, and an increased chance of securing another partner. Interesting idea.  




 I might add that relationships at your age usually last for a few months at best, so the whole dramatic declaration of undying love is probably going to be moot a few years later.  




 Bro, there are many, many people in the world who didn't 'get a girlfriend' until 18 (like me) or even 21. 

If you tick off the years on your calendar and worry that you are x age with no relationship, then you're treating it like external validation of your self-worth, and as a status symbol. That's quite unhealthy, and when you do find a girl at whatever age, that's the only way you will see her. As an achievement, something you get points for on Xbox live. 

Relax, wait for someone you are comfortable with and genuinely wants to be with you - more importantly, someone that YOU genuinely want to  be with - and then go for it. Not before.  




 It's also fairly evident from all the threads about men receiving compliments - there was a good one last night - that even for the attractive ones, it's basically impossible for them to think someone might be interested in them or find them attractive. I think men purposefully ignore a lot of hints and put them down to accidents or vagaries of behaviour. 

There's also the fact that it's much more risky for men to act on a hint than it is for women. The terms 'creepy' and 'potential rapist' spring to mind.  




 I'm 19, and believe me, people change at the end of school. They get tossed out of their established social circles and comfort zones into the big wide world, and they grow up real fast. 

As far as the dating world goes, I've noticed people become more mature and less selfish in their relationships - less likely to dump someone because they know they can get another due to their social status (as the quarterback, cheerleader etc).  




 Or we don't know that we are because no one ever tells us 




 Pretty sure singing that song actually makes you more manly 




 I'm a big hit with female octopi? 




 Squishy and round? Like the rest of me? 




 I don't know why people would bother trying to pass fake off as real when we have /r/eroticliterature. Plenty of good stuff over there.  




 You're not forever alone. You're not ugly. You're awesome, and everyone here thinks so. 

Don't let me hear you say any bullshit in return, because a) every 'forever alone' I've known usually finds great happiness as soon as they stop using that as their identity, and b) self-confidence and assurance are the most important qualities in being attractive to females. Bottom line, if you label yourself as forever single, YOU WILL BE. 

But I highly doubt that at 27 you've gone through life with no female attention whatsoever - even some that you haven't noticed, probably because you're busy convincing yourself that you're not awesome. 

So go be awesome.  




 This doesn't mean at all that we don't FEEL this excitement. With my ex, I couldn't get over the fact that she was a concert violinist and incredibly intelligent and into all the same books as me and blah blah blah.

But I'm not allowed to tell anyone, because let's face it, guys aren't socially allowed to feel those things about ourselves or each other, let alone another human being that I'm only allowed to publicly view as a piece of meat I have sex with. So for most of us, if the only thing we care allowed to say is how good the sex is or something equally demeaning to her, we'd rather say nothing at all.  




 Yeah, you don't want to scare him off. Especially if it accidentally all goes south and his response is a solid no (for whatever reason) - you can come back from a 'let's go out some time,' but you can't recover from 'I've loved you since I was seven.'  




 Dicks can be as wide as coke cans?

Well now I feel self confident 




 Most people shame Size Queens because a guy who says "I won't sleep with a woman unless she has large breasts" would be drawn and quartered. It's only fair.  




 Moooooo 




 If a relationship is essentially being really great friends plus sex, then you'd think the majority of the personality qualities you look for in a relationship are also found in your friends.  




 That's absolutely fascinating. Thank you.  




 If the female masturbation thread over in /r/sex is anything to go on, my friends (who are mostly female) aren't attracted to me (nor do I want them to be). How could they judge? 




 Trouble is, we have no frame of reference for comparison. I *think* I'm really into my hobbies, I *think* I put a lot of effort into being well presented and fun to be around, I *think* I work really hard at my career - but what if I don't? How will I know? 




 Soon there will be a reddit financial crisis from all the lost upvotes.  




 ... does this mean that males have or are willing to have a great deal more imagination in these things? 




 Extremely. 

I think this is also fairly well known in the gender subreddits. Probably not worth a thread on.  




 Sex with slenderman? 




 Not all of them do. That's a huge generalization. I'd actually say quite a lot don't, and that reddit is a biased statistic to draw on. 

Both of my best friends are female and I will never sleep with them. This is my *own choice* (as well as presumably theirs) because I value their friendship.  




 This is actually a very interesting comment. I know the 'friendzone' is an utter load of shit - basically Nice Guys who are emotionally and in personality unattractive whining about how they don't get laid - but the counter argument to it is usually that "it's the same for both genders, of you're not attractive you're just not attractive" etc - which is some merit. 

Here, however, we have direct evidence that the genders do actually have different potential-sexual relationships with their friends. 




 Dude, you have so much self-confidence, self respect, determination and charisma. When you lose a bit more, you're going to be beating the girls of with a stick. Seriously. Hell, you probably do now.  




 A further point to take from this - you know that guy over there at the bus stop, who looks really serious and intimidating and unapproachable? He's just as afraid of you as you are of him. 

This also applies to approaching the opposite sex. At the end of the day, past all the seduction techniques and the game and the self confidence and the blah blah blah, the girls and boys you talk to have just as many insecurities and fears as you do. They're trying to hide them and put on a brave face just like you - but they still really just want someone to love them just like you do. They're not so terrifying after all.  




 Congratulations. I'm really happy you're still with us. PM me if you ever need to talk - if you feel that way again.  




 concerned for my physical safety

I'm sorry, but don't you think that's jumping the gun a bit? So he comes off as rude and immature. He doesn't pick up social clues. I'm hardly an expert, but that all sounds like he's on the autistic spectrum to me. To be assuming he's a physical threat to your well being because of some sarcasm is a bit offensive - and that behaviour and attitude is, in fact, dangerous to him. 

If all of this behaviour was coming from a female, would you label them as a potential murderer or rapist? 




 Damn right man. That's the correct attitude. 

I lost mine when I was 18, and while it was fun and I've done it again since (... a fair bit), you're not missing out on anything vitally important.  




 Jesus loves you more than you could know, wow wow wow 




 How was that an issue?! 




 I wish everyone has this kind of tolerance. I got dumped by my ex girlfriend because - I quote - "I wasn't enough of a dickhead to her."

I know exactly what I did wrong, I was a bit too nice and not 'exciting' enough - too easy to be in a relationship with - but it still seemed pretty unfair to me.  




 Noob question, how are you achieving that particular look with your cuffs and that jumper? 




 Would you please elaborate for the noob on Barney's anti-PUA? 




 Hi mate. I broke my laptop a few days ago, and I've just realized AlienBlue doesn't receive PMs. So I won't be able to read what you've sent me until I've got access to another computer, which shouldn't be too long, but please don't think I'm ignoring you or that I don't care.  




 That's no problem. I'm sure I'd be equally offended if someone said that men don't have body image issues or a damaging media stereotype to live up to like women do.  




 Thank you. However, somebody evidently disagrees with you.  




 I'd say the reason for this is almost exclusively a focus in media on chivalrous and kind, door-opening, dinner-paying men, with a lot less representation of the dominant aspects that make them attractive, so as not to appear superior to women and offend the vocal and relatively new feminist community.  




 You're absolutely right. If they're not attractive, it's just not going to work. I think it really should come down to *awareness* of the exact things females find attractive (as opposed to the things that males think females find attractive) - ironically enough, I had no idea until I ventured into these parts of reddit.

I actually think a discussion of what both genders typically find attractive should actually be a core part of sexual education classes.  




 The first one at least is something they just to man up and deal with to get past, just like we do.  




 I never said women don't have dating struggles. I just don't know what they are, probably due to the fact that I'm 19 and reasonably inexperienced.  




 The reaction to a female showing her vagina would most likely be much less legative than that to a male displaying his penis.  
























 The only person in the world who compliments me is the gay local baker who gives me free bread. I'm straight, but I'm perfectly ok with him hitting on me. Everyone else should be the same.  




 I'm more concerned that they didn't just ask YOU.  




 He looked down. I saw him.

The bastard.  




 While it's really nice to have some people saying we look attractive for once, I can't help but notice that all of the attributes described are of men that are basically models. That's fine - models are attractive for a reason - but I think it's interesting that females are born with their most attractive sexual features (breasts, hips, etc) and improve upon these by building various muscle groups/maintaining a certain level of body fat, but men are largely born without the muscles and more importantly the substantial self-confidence that is critical to the perception of an attractive male. These things need to be worked for. I wonder if that has contributed to the current dating system of men approaching women, who then appraise their value and accept them - being undeniably in control as the gatekeepers of sexual intercourse in our society - rather than the other way around.  




 While that's all very true, I personally would categorise makeup and clothing as (albeit very important) external modifications which are to some extent masks, whereas exercise and building muscle is changing your actual body. 

This is important because a man with a sexually attractive body is attractive all the time, and knows he is - whereas women who feel that they are only attractive with makeup (despite the fact that they're probably fine without it) can become very dependent on it for their self esteem and feel uncomfortable or exposed without it.  




 Well that's a poor attitude  




 I think it should be pointed out that no one should now refer to men as 'males.' 




 I think it's interesting that women are largely born with their looks, and other than staying skinny, can't do that much to change them. Men, however, can all physically (aside from their face) be attractive or hideous based on muscle mass, body fat etc.

Furthermore, as girls are born with their looks, if they've been skinny all their lives they haven't really worked for it at all. They are just innately attractive, and I think that must affect their self-esteem and -perception quite a bit. Men, however, must work hard to be attractive. This also extensively applies to their attitudes and their confidence - women's personalities usually come as at least passable with no effort at all.

 The worst is trying to slim down and bulk up. I hate being overweight but (or so I've been told by several females) my body will be worse as a stick than a bit fat, so I can either bulk now and put on muscle while still having a poor body and a terrible opinion of myself, or I can slim down to a point where I'm happy with myself but no one else is, and then start the long process of improving while taking the unattractiveness hit.  




 I get the impression you're not really a fan of anything. Maybe that's why you have no success with women.

 Hey man. I'm in the same place as you and currently working on it, and I'm much happier for it. Have a read through /r/confidence, /r/faimprovment, and /r/seduction and see if there's anything that encourages you to work on your confidence - unfortunately the only person who can improve that is you, but I know you'll feel better about the whole world if you do. Just my two cents.

 If you don't define 2.5 to 7.5 as 'much larger,' I think you need to reconsider some statistics. Such as the fact that the average penis is between 5-5.5 inches in length.

 It's also showing that you have value to other women (I forget the exact term), which instantly gives you much greater value, because if you dodge that question then you're either sleeping with lots of other people or you're an AFC. And she can't get the AFC impression from the 'alpha' personality he has displayed so far.  




 What in hell have you the impression that social interaction was fair for both genders? 




 2-3 times bigger is still a lot. For a guy that's 2.5 inches flaccid - pretty small - he'll be 7.5 in no time.  




 Ok, thanks for clarifying. I had meant that exchange to be via text when planning the date - perhaps as a reply to "let's meet tomorrow at (bar)" for example - does this change anything? 




 This may be a really dumb idea, but after attempting to make plans with a girl, if she responds with 'is this a date?' could you say something like 'do you want it to be?' - to indicate both that you want it to be a date and gauge her level of enthusiasm/attraction to you? Or would a more direct approach like a straight up 'yes' be a little more... alpha (for want of a better word?) 




 And then link them to it every time it's the only appropriate answer to the question.

 How old are you? It could be an age/maturity thing (their fault, probably age related) or you could be becoming complacent, unexciting, or unattractive in the relationship. 




 I would think that using dishonest or sleazy to describe 'nice guys' is probably a bit over the top. Perhaps misguided or misunderstanding what women actually want/find attractive.

ASSASSIN IN THE BUILDING 




 I thought the point of this thread was that the perfect pickup artist didn't exist. Then you go and show up.  




 Absolutely. 'You should be wearing makeup,' therefore if you're not wearing makeup you're not good enough, so wearing makeup makes you innately acceptable and comfortable.  




 I think women use makeup as a social and self-esteem prop - it makes them feel better, and they feel exposed without it - just the same as many men do with alcohol or hair gel. They feel lacking or less than their average selves without it as a shield.

 Civilian here. You're ready a lot braver than 99% of your country, please stop fighting each other and focus on coming home.  




 Relevant noob question: if there is a girl who I am not interested in initially for whatever hypothetical reason, and I become friends with her instead but then become interested later on as I get to know her - having displayed no attraction and made no moves up to this point, and assuming she has displayed none of the same - could I then display interest, escalate, etc etc and her actually be interested? Assuming I did everything right and that she hypothetically found me attractive enough when we first met that if I had put the moves on it would have worked, would a few months of friendship forever close that door? 




 In all seriousness, have you considered depression? (Do you have any reasons to consider depression?) 




 What could possibly go wrong? 




 Not sure if sarcastic... 
























 Kids, this is the story of how I met your mother.  




 Well, unfortunately, that's the way life is. I know several people who lost considerable amounts of weight, became 'attractive,' and noticed how much nicer people of both genders were to them. It's sad but true.  




 I always included hygiene, clothing, and most importantly *personality* in my definition of attractive - don't you? 




 Why? Honest question, as it applies to both genders.  




 I think most men have much lower standards for at least a one night stand than most women.  




 You do? When does that kick in? 




 I saw a paper a while back that said thirty minutes of fairly active (not missionary) sex a day was enough exercise for an adult to maintain weight on a reasonably healthy diet. 




 I think part of the issue should be that, in many countries, any 17yo having sex with a 15yo is statutory rape, regardless of consent given by both parties.  




 It's not so much underdressing as ridiculous overdressing that irritates me. 




 I think that firstly, there should be a difference between promiscuity and genuinely being a *slut*, and that some criticism of proper sluts has some justification - but most importantly, should applied to MEN AS WELL.

It's fine with me for a person (regardless of gender) to go out and have a one night stand. I'm fine with two or maybe three different partners a week. Sex is great and should be encouraged. But someone who has sex with a different partner *every single day* (casually, not as a job etc) or even multiple partners in one twenty-four hour period (and I know girls who do this) are going a bit far. 

There are obvious reasons like the ridiculous risk of STDs with that many partners - protection isn't foolproof and you're vastly increasing your statistical chances - but, and this is probably where people will disagree, I think that having sex with *that many* different partners reduces the value of the emotional connection inherent in the act, and sex goes from positive to degrading. 

And I think some 'slut shaming' of men is fairly obvious - if women don't like being sexually objectified (and who would) and the way that affects them in society, then stop treating every one of them like an achievement, and your life like you have a pokedex of vaginas you need to complete. In short: men shouldn't be congratulated for having sex just because they were 'able' to get in a woman's pants.

 I think it would be their combined incomes that would drop the panties. 

There's be billions just from the movie stars alone.  




 Well, let's think about it. You're displaying attraction to her, being confident, showing your sexual intention, and implying that you know in great detail *exactly* what women are attracted to.

 I said 'about five.' I'd meant it to be a rough indication.  




 *slow clap* 




 It was 145 over 139. 




 It does happen, though. (Without bragging, for the purposes of the discussion, as it doesn't necessarily mean that we're actually intelligent) both myself and my ex have very high IQs, but hers was about five points higher than mine, and because she was doing a science degree and I a music degree it led to competition, comparison, jealousy and bitterness on my behalf, and some considerable condescension on hers. It was a major factor in our breakup.  




 Answers to the first two would be great. And how to counter any potential resistance.

 Explain? 




 I'm reading The Game at the moment, is it good/worth following in terms of self improvement? I'm not sure if I agree with things like peacocking.

 Wow. You must be pretty hot for someone to genuinely compliment you after paying yourself out. That doesn't usually happen.  




 Also prepared to reach ultimate friendzone level: the shoulder she cries on about how much of a dick guys are to her while ignoring you as an option.

(I say this with the intent of being critical of guys who complain about the friendzone, not as a 'nice guy')

 




 Am I the only one who thinks it's a dick move to break up any relationship, no matter the 'level of seriousness?'

Sure, I could probably steal stuff from a lot of shops. It shows I'm 'better' than the shop owner because he's not protecting his 'merchandise' effectively enough. So if I'm good enough to get hold of it then maybe I deserve it more than him. Doesn't change the fact that stealing is wrong.  




 At least you get compliments. 90% of men don't.  




 Colby. Never forget 




 Just FYI, the greater majority of /r/seduction frowns upon 'negging' (basically backhanded compliments) and most things that involve destroying someone's self esteem to complement your own.

 It's well-established that what women *think* they want and what they *actually* want are seldom the same thing.

Example: wanting men to open up emotionally in relationships. They think they want to hear about all your insecurities etc. But now you've lost all of the self-confidence that made you attractive to her in the first place, and before you know it, she's cheating on you or dumping you for someone else.  




 Almost tempted to fly down from Brisbane. If the weather is lower than 36, I'm sold.  




 /r/askwomen is unfortunately a brilliant example of a larger male population upcoming what they want to hear.  




 I think you're onto something there. There is definitely a correlation between the common opinion of a subreddit and its general demographic - for example, /r/sex features a LOT of very sex-positive women. This is great, but it provides a slightly biased view of women the world over (IMO), because someone who is ashamed of religiously disposed against their sexuality won't exactly be posting about it on the Internet.  




 I understand this. There's no need to be aggressive. However I, as a male, in /r/askmen, in a thread about what males find attractive, think I can question what my fellow gender thinks to further that discussion.  




 Is this because you're so used to men in /r/askwomen asking about attractive features, what signs indicate they like someone etc? 




 how can I love someone who doesn't love themselves

Ok, what is seriously wrong with loving someone who has low self esteem? I see this constantly.  




 snipers and shotguns

These are not actual firearms, right... 




 Can I tentatively suggest that, due to the fact that men are (let's face it) generally emotionally repressed in our society, the Internet and these subreddits might be the only place where they feel comfortable talking about their emotions? 




 You have a great point. If you ask women what they find attractive, and it isn't you, is that really their fault? It ties into the idea that the most upvoted response in either subreddit is usually the one that pleases the males the most. 

I say this as an unattractive and unconfident male who feels worse when reading these types of threads - but I wouldn't expect anyone to change them just to suit my fantasies.  




 Or "I already know what I want to do, please tell me that I'm right" 




 You're welcome. Now go get some.  




 Can you link me to a description/how-to of the 5 questions game? 




 You need to tell her everything you just said about not being old enough and not being ready, and above all, about *not wanting to be romantically involved with her in any way again.*

Do not, under any circumstances, have sex with her or be physical with her in any way. If she says it's casual, trust me, it's not. You will only hurt her more.  




 I can't do this

- Confidence in your own abilities and *knowing your limits and inabilities* - the difference between ego and self confidence.  




 /r/confidence, /r/faimprovement and even /r/seduction may help you out.

 "One bite could feed a man for a week."
"Pippin, how many did you eat?"

 Yeah, this is probably going to be an unpopular opinion but I'm getting tired of hearing about how introverts are all super special snowflakes that deserve vast amounts of love and care and attention. Especially in the description that extroverts 'take' energy while introverts 'give' it - funnily enough, we're actually people too, not vicious social predators. We also have specific needs and dislike being treated in certain ways. And we give far more energy than introverts - who makes a social event fun, the friendly, talkative person who wants to connect to people and bring them together, or the awkward person sitting silently in the corner trying not to "waste" his precious energy on people who are beneath him?

 This isn't true. There do exist, unfortunately, truly unattractive women in the world (below the minimum standard of the vast majority of men). While this isn't necessarily their fault, they would have difficulty simply taking any man home.  




 Maybe not aggressive. I would personally be offended by that. But each to their own.  




 Musical theatre is a completely different art form to opera. It's much more accessible for someone who isn't a hardcore theatre fan, and the repertoire is considerably more well known by the public (e.g I Go To Rio from The Boy From Oz, *everyone* has heard that song)

OP, if you tell me what city you live in I can give you recommendations of productions.

EDIT: I might add that the timeframe in which something was composed is hardly an indication of its quality. I know hilarious and highly inappropriate operas with brilliant music, that can easily be compared in entertainment style to a modern comedy movie. Just because the accompaniment is a violin and not a guitar doesn't make it stuffy and awkward like most people seem to think.  




 Well, yes. You know what I mean.  




 I have a feeling that reddit has a higher concentration of these assholes than regular society, simply because they're the kind of dickheads who don't socially fit in anywhere else and retreat to anonymity.

 What's wrong with tshirts? Assuming it's not the only thing they're wearing.  




 Men pretty much never get complimented on anything. So telling him all of these things is far from vanity - it's likely that he hasn't heard someone else say them in a while, if at all. He will be very pleasantly surprised.  




 AFAIK Asperger's isn't something you treat. It's a mental 'disability' (I don't know if that's the proper term and I don't believe it really disables you, so take it with a grain of salt) on the autistic spectrum, which just means that his brain is wired a little differently to that of most 'normal' people. He will have trouble innately understanding a lot of social stuff and human interaction, particularly sarcasm and body language, and may have trouble empathising. As far as being passive or having no goals goes, I think that's something he will have to consciously work to defeat. There's no reason why he can't (but I'm far from an expert so do your research) but he needs to understand first that these are not really healthy traits when taken to that extreme.  




 Yet more proof that everyone's different. So long as it didn't take up time that I needed for something else, I would adore a surprise date.  




 Wow, none of those are symptoms of depression. I would really, seriously look into Asberger's - I know nothing about it but I have a friend with it and he fits most of that criteria.  




 Before we met, he had absolutely no goals whatsoever, no interests or hobbies other than watching TV and playing computer games. He would just go to work at a grocery store (where he still works 8 years later), come home and play games/watch TV until it was time to go to work again.

As someone who has had it since the age of 12, this is *not* the result of depression. Sure it can (and not always) affect your motivation and your ability to focus, but nowhere near to this extent. 

His mental illness is possibly contributing to some serious issues that he already has, not causing them. This guy (I'm sorry, but honestly) sounds like an apathetic loser, who is either using depression as a get-out-of-life-free card or is just completely unmotivated to do anything. There is no reason why he can't have goals and ambitions with depression.

EDIT: Or he has some other additional, possibly undiagnosed, mental illness. Is he medicated for depression at the moment, and if so, how heavily? 




 No one opens by grabbing a girl around the waist. That's not 'attempting kino,' that's suicide. 




 What women want, and what women *think* they want, are two very different things.  




 This kind of discussion comes up in this subreddit on a weekly basis, if not more. Every single time, a guy explains in detail about why we can't share our emotions. Then some chick comes sweeping in with "oh, but I personally just *love* it when guys open up to me! And I'm sure lots of other women do too!"

If they actually did, the problem wouldn't exist. For precisely the reasons you outlined above.  




 must hate Miranda

Am I the only person who doesn't like Miranda? Sure she's a cow sometimes, but so are most people.  




 from romantic partners

- girlfriend is, like most women, attracted to you because you appear confident and self-reliant
- as you become comfortable in the relationship you tell her some of the horrible shit that has happened to you which gets you down, and you seek some emotional support
- girlfriend completely loses all respect for you because you're not 100% made of steel, and leaves you for some brofag with 'more confidence' who actually just has the emotional capacity of a brick

 IMO masturbating to the thought of someone real is infinitely better than some chick on the internet.  




 You'd think it would be, though. It's not a professional that gets paid vast amounts, so most of the people there are probably the ones who have always wanted to be, and it's creative and in constant communication with new people. Sounds like avert happy job to me.

 Before he edited his comment, it said "this guy needs to grow some self esteem balls" 




 Reddit seems to be strongly biased against people with low self esteem, and loves to tell them to 'just respect yourself more.' Holy shit Sherlock, is that what I've been doing wrong all along? Especially when the esteem issue is medical and from a legitimate mental illness like depression, you can't just decide to like yourself overnight, and more importantly - *it's not their fault that they are depressed in the first place.*

It'a like telling someone with cancer to just harden up and get better already, and that if they die then they didn't try hard enough.

 I think about 10% of people - the really popular and attractive ones - had an amazing time in school. They were the ones telling other people that they weren't so desperate and so on. The other 90% thought it sucked.

 For me, in the episode after Bastogne (I think) when the choir is singing and they fade out all the men who died. Heartbreaking.  




 What's worse is when she's attracted to you because you're confident, you begin to trust her and share some of your troubles, and then she no longer finds you attractive and dumps you for not being confident enough. This has happened to me on several occasions. 

Ever since I've believed that women don't actually want men to share their feelings - they *think* they want to because they think that's what a good person should do. They want men to be strong and silent, because that is attractive. 
























 I think you need more pictures, and they need to be bigger. Hard to see much from just that. 




 I thought pic 3 was BY FAR your best - IMHO ditch the beard and never bring it back, and keep your hair short. Other than that, you're doing well man. 




 I opened the second picture and literally said "oh fuck off, he's way too good looking for this sub." Keep up with the weight loss and maybe try a more mature haircut, and you'll be beating them off with a stick.

P.S. do you get told you look like Martin Freeman? 




 Honestly dude... you've got skills. I wish I could flip a situation like that and create so much attraction. Once you get past this, you're going to be one hell of a PUA.

 




 Thanks man. 




 1) look for positives in everything that you do. The more you practice finding something good about something, the easier it will be. Get on a bus? Appreciate the air conditioning. Go into a shop? Compliment the service.

2) When you are with another person, be it friend, date or otherwise, think about things about them that you like. If something strikes you, just tell them. Straight up. All you have to do is smile and be honest.

3) Once this comes easily to you, you can start putting some more thought into what people *want* to be told. What are they like? What do they want from their life? If they're a driven career person, for example, tell them you admire their drive and dedication. In a similar vein, there's a great quote that goes "tell smart girls they are pretty, and pretty girls they are smart." 




 Thanks for the resources man, I'm really appreciating this other side of the PUA community that I hadn't seen before. The more I read about it, the more it helps with the rest of the stuff on /r/seduction, like filtering through TRP and 'alpha' stuff to only take in advice that I want to use. 




 Excellent point. If it works, it works. There can obviously be pleasure in the art of pickup for the sake of itself - developing newer, more subtle strategies for the fun of doing so - but if you're not into that and you have something that works, who cares? 




 I've tried getting into pickup several times, and I'm currently on my fourth attempt. What always killed it for me before is what seemed to be the cunning and manipulative aspect - get as many girls as possible to have sex with you, never tell them they're pretty because it's so beta, never listen when a girl tells you about a problem and needs emotional support because it's so AFC. I hated it, and I consciously decided every single time that I'd rather be lonely, single, and still a kind and loving person than a manipulative, selfish prick who has no time for people who won't give him sex or social proof to get sex from other people.

This post is an amazing breath of fresh air. It's exactly what I needed to hear, thank you. 




 sources or videos than can teach me this? I'm incredibly interested. 




 Dude, she's blowing up your phone. She clearly wants you. What are you worried about?

 I'm attractive

 I work out

She's probably texting her friends right now saying "this really attractive guy messaged me online and even asked me on a date, what am I going to do? He probably messaged five girls as attractive as I am, how can I show him I'm better?"

Stop thinking about whether you deserve her and think about whether she deserves you. 'Leagues' are only determined by the people who end up out of them. Enjoy your date, have fun, see what happens.

P.S. many of the most ridiculously attractive girls are actually quite lonely, because everyone is too intimidated to approach them. You may be one of the few who has even shown interest in her and that's why she's blowing up your phone. So to reiterate, she wants you just as much as you want her. Best case scenario. 




 Tell smart girls that they are pretty, and pretty girls that they are smart. 




 You're out on a date, it's going fine, you're getting IOIs etc, and you kiss her to show your interest (rather than tell her, as I've been informed). Then maybe you kiss her again. 

What do you then do in the immediate seconds after kissing her? Continue with whatever activity the date was? Go somewhere else? Say something? Assuming the time is not right to invite her back to your place.  




 You've got a point, and I respect that. But at the end of the day, the whole Pascal's Wager thing isn't even why I'm there. It's to be a better person and hang out with a great group of people.

There are people who say that atheist organisations are capable of following similar morals to the bible (etc, blah blah blah) and having the same effect, and as I've said, I don't know a single atheist who is as good a person as a GOOD christian. That, also, is besides the point - I think it's a bit like gym routines, where everyone has one that works well for them and doesn't necessarily work well for others. This one works for me. What more can I ask for? 




 It doesn't work like that.  




 Now it's a huge part in her.  




 If you don't like small talk, then don't do it. 

Steer the conversation towards something more meaningful and with more substance. This comment is hardly the place to explain that full process but there's plenty on /r/seduction about it - but basically, get them talking about something they are passionate about and that you can have an interesting dialogue about where you both learn something. Politics and religion are probably not the best topics for obvious reasons, but once you've gotten through the basics of a meeting (who are you, what do you do etc) you should be able to either find something you have in common which you can discuss, or if you have nothing in common, ask them to explain a topic for you. For example: "so you're a biochemist? I honestly know nothing about biochemistry, can you explain what makes it so interesting to you?" People love to talk about what they are interested in, and it's the best way to a) make them feel like they've had a great conversation and b) learn something new for yourself.  




 I find this dodgy. No field report, no conversation starters for pairs of people, no evidence at all other than "it's easier than one person." 




 Nope, ballet dancer. 




 Even the bandies have their jocks and their nerds. I was a nerd bandie for years, I felt like I was on the same social level as an amoeba. 




 Doing it with a big grin helps a lot. Also, be 100% confident right through the activity. If you falter or think "I'm being annoying," somehow, that's when it is annoying. But if you just keep going like it's a hilarious joke then it is for them as well. 




 Thinking of "pushing your belly button in" for vocal support is a terrible idea. I'm a professional singer, and I've personally suffered from using that mentality - it causes vastly too much airflow below the vocal folds and can cause you severe vocal damage in the long run. It also doesn't help you increase your volume because you are still basically shouting, and it reduces the amount of oxygen that is used by your lungs.

I can''t teach you how to breathe properly here, because that's a serious job for a face-to-face professional. But you *must* not focus on consciously contracting your abdominal muscles (or pulling in your belly button) - you are tensing the rectus abdominus muscles rather than the transverse abdominus groups, which is exactly the opposite of what needs to happen, as the rectus abdominus must stay as loose as possible in order for support to function at all. Your body will use the transverse groups to support speech automatically (this is how any air is moved over the vocal folds at all) and consciously thinking about it is the best way to interrupt this process.

There are plenty of exercises and resources on the internet that can aid you in this, but there is also a lot of bullshit. You want to look for Accent Method Breathing for singers, which is over the top for an everyday speaker, but exactly the right thing for everybody to be doing to some extent. 




 Have you seen a speech pathologist? I'm a professional singer and, believe me, it's so easy to think you're doing the right thing with your breathing and your vocal technique when you're really, really not.

Books and youtube videos can't help you, nor can online courses. Only getting real help from someone face to face who can listen to your sound and give you feedback will be of any benefit. It is of enormous benefit. Depending on what country you live in, this may also be covered by your health insurance.

edit: I've just read the above comment on "pulling your belly button in" - this is a horrible idea and will make your 'shouting' *much* worse rather than any better. Please don't do this. 




 Depending on who writes the love letter or how, it's really the same thing.  




 This definitely, overwhelmingly goes for men as well.  




 Squealing like a Japanese schoolgirl is not recommended.  




 Most of the ones I know still can't do it.  




 Side effects may include jail time 




 Sorry, /r/relationships needs that space 




 This may be just my own personal experience, but the only people I've ever encountered who believe that males cannot be raped have been female. 




 Oops. Well, it was one of the well respected accounts on this subreddit. But I agree with you completely.

I was about to say that the definition of whether a sexual act was rape should always be up to the victim, but that leaves the 'perpetrator' wide open to false accusations, which is a whole other problem. I really wish that people wouldn't make false accusations of rape, it really ruins the legal system for everybody else who is a genuine victim.  




 I thought it was 'female' that people were opposed to? Wtf?

Also, by their logic calling a man a guy, dude or bro is sexist.  




 There's a great statistic (well, horrible in real life, but great for the sake of the argument) that usually stops females who dismiss male rape as impossible - 50% of women orgasm when they are raped. I don't have a source for that but I read it somewhere on /r/sex and I remember there being a very reputable source, it may even have been /u/Maxxters that posted it. 

It's quite obvious when you think about these things that the body's physical reactions are different to what the mind is actually feeling.  




 Which uni are you at? If you're in Queensland I can probably recommend some student clubs to join or places to hang out.  




 You've got a circular process going on here. 

1) you've worked really hard and gotten a great body, haircut etc. However, you believe you have failed because girls still don't like you. 
2) girls don't like you because you're not self confident, despite the great body and so on. 
3) repeat step one, ad infinitum. 

I think you need to spend some time acknowledging the successes you have already made - which a lot of people never achieve - and not focus on the things you haven't quite gotten yet. Give yourself some credit for making a great transformation. And I bet that as soon as you do that you'll be beating the girls off with a stick.  




 I'm willing to bet that he's egotistical, has a very high opinion of his own intelligence, has 'high standards' that his partners must meet - and most importantly, is not really that bright himself.  




 Also, don't use seduction to fix those emotional issues.  




 That was actually the cheesiest porno I've ever watched. 




 I'm not criticising you, I'm judging the guy who criticised you.  




 That's fascinating, why do you think that is? 




 You're not even writing full sentences, what right do you have to judge? 




 finish in her 




 I used to think that I dressed reasonably well. I stumbled across this subreddit completely by accident, realised in about fifteen seconds that jorts and short sleeve button downs does not constitute 'dressing well,' and quickly fell in love with male fashion as a whole.  




 It sounds like she has the female version of death grip.  




 This joke is old, tired, untrue, and not in the least funny.  




 If the commenter was female talking about a male, the comment would not only be accepted but probably encouraged. 

And I bet you wouldn't criticise a girl for noticing an attractive member of the opposite sex.  




 Is a faggot by definition male? Surely there can be female faggotry? 




 I don't know, you said some useful things about a comment of mine yesterday.  




 It seems to me that you're absolutely right, so long as being 'yourself' means being a ripped, well-dressed, ruthlessly confident, socially outgoing alpha male with stacks of social proof. 




 *I'm 14 and have never played beer pong 




 I think it's less sexy if it's your only language.  




 Blunt honesty ahead: my penis, when unerect, is basically a carbon copy of what you described above - about three inches long, mostly squishy, and not terribly thick. That changes dramatically under certain circumstances, and I have no doubt that your guy is the same. I highly doubt that what you've seen was any kind of erection at all.  




 Really, shouldn't all relationships be best friends who have sex? That's how I view them.

Edit: I don't mean you have to be friends with them first, but that your SO should become your friend. I don't know how it would work otherwise.   




 Well, at least he's honest.  




 hard he sleeps

I see what you did there 




 You're absolutely right.  




 tyzorybyAGAIN is *technically* correct in that legally it's considered impossible to give your consent during sleep. But I highly doubt the male in question would be concerned.  




 Does anyone want the Hollywood Marshmallow? 




 I found this subreddit a week after I broke up with someone, nine months ago. Have been single since. Almost unsubscribed several times from sadness that I am missing out on fun things.  




 I last tested myself a few years ago, as a mid teens male with no muscle and enough fat to be solidly chubby. I was apparently so underweight that I should be hospitalised. Never trusted an online calculator since.  




 And while you're bending over backwards to make her happy, what is *she* doing to maintain your attraction to her? 




 This is the problem I have with the term 'natural' meaning 'not man made.' 




 I have depression and have recently started lifting. The gym I signed up for comes with three free sessions with a personal trainer. I met him for the first time an hour ago, and he's built like the fucking hulk. 

Turns out he's had depression for most of his life and has recently started on medication.  




 Especially when the average penis (meaning the majority of men) is 5 to 5.5 inches long when fully erect 




 Anyone who claims that their actions while intoxicated don't count is to me incapable of being responsible for their own actions.  




 But for this exact reason - if you like him and want something to happen, don't just ask him to hang out. *this is a subtle hint that will go way over his head.* 
























 Civilisation is death. Turn based games are usually bad for me, but that one has literally taken weeks of my life.  




 You're either an existing redpiller who is advertising for the sub, or you're very, very naive.  




 So what's your job? You'd better be an astronaut or you are one hell of a cunt.  




 The goal of the conversation is to enjoy the conversation. If you're willing to spend ages having a boring conversation just to get laid, then you're way over invested in sex for the sake of sex, and you need to start expanding some other areas in your life. E.g being more than a walking penis, and treating women like more than a walking vagina. Why would you ever want to be with someone who isn't interesting to talk to? 




 There are only two numbers on the hotness scale. 0 - people you are not attracted to, and 1, people you are. If you desire to have sex with them, do it. If you're worried that other people will say you're not with a girl who is attractive enough, then you need serious work on your inner game and not caring about what other people think of you.  




 You're making the massive assumption that you can't be popular and get laid at the same time. All of the most popular men I know are drowning in the pussy, because women are above all attracted to social status. Far from being totally separate, the person you are describing would be the person who gets laid the *most*. 




 How the fuck do you define a 'WoW 10?' Someone with cooler swords and stuff than the other girls? 




 I am greatly looking forward to this.  




 Yes.  




 Blogspam 




 Well done mate, keep up the good work.  




 she's trying to fit in with her group

That's not a valid reason for anyone outside of preschool. Judge away.  




 Seddit usually has a strong reaction against female-authored posts, with the whole 'fish teaching a fisherman' thing, and I usually disagree and advocate for them because they have merit. 

This one, unfortunately, proves the stereotype. There's a lot of stuff in here that's worthy of tumblr tween relationships and not much else. It breeds insecurity and counterproductive mindsets. Take it with a very large grain of salt.  




 if you walk like a wealthy man, you must be a wealthy man

Are you implying that an arbitrarily larger number of digits in a bank account magically causes peoples' hip rotator muscles to habitually contract? Or is it the massive weight of that credit card that makes them walk like a retard? 




 Since when do all text conversations start out boring? 




 Have you ever actually met someone who threw out clothes because they were 'out of fashion' after a year? Because I never have.  




 I'm pretty sure at least 95% of the people on Tindr downloaded it out of curiosity. 




 ASD 




 Suppressive fire, don't let her outflank you 




 Aragon had serious oneitis. Could have been spinning that HB 8 plate Eowyn the whole time. She's such a feminazi with the whole "I am no man" thing though. /s 




 Best answer: try it yourself and see if it works.  




 Assuming that maths is the only measure of intelligence

Further assuming that someone who is good at maths will make for intelligent conversation - which is what OP is looking for - more so than someone who reads classic literature 




 It may be for you, it isn't for some other people. 

That's not because you're good looking or more muscly or whatever. For some people, 'romantic' behaviour - flirting, interpreting signals, displaying interest in the opposite sex, etc - just doesn't come natural at a base level. These kinds of people need to learn the long and hard way. And often being the kind of person who is very rational, intellectual and analytical, it most suits their natural talents to go about learning how to do these things in this way.  




 Ignore this guy, he's a fucking retard. 




 You're really fixated on this aren't you? You seriously don't believe that women can appreciate someone for anything other than their looks? You have no evidence that people do anything 'in general,' and you've said it yourself - you can think of tons of exceptions to the rule. You know what that means? It's not a rule.

Dude, for your sake, you need to go an read a LOT more inner game stuff, because these beliefs are a) extremely shallow and b) fucking you up.

Edit: you're also fixated on 'opening' my eyes.' Why should I, or anyone? If any male on this planet who is butt ugly is capable of pulling hot girls, why should he 'open his eyes' and give that up for your theory? 




 I can think of three guys off of the top of my head who are dating way outside their physical range. One of them is a real shocker and his girlfriend is fucking hot. So I guess you're the one kidding yourself. 




 Also, as things to be paraded around go, I's much rather models for the sub than something like the Mystery Method or anything advocating negging, which is where the sub gets its false reputation of being all redpill. Which understandably turns people off.  




 It has been repeatedly, endlessly proven that inner attractiveness is more important for men than outer attractiveness. 

Judging by this comment, your inner attractiveness needs some work, because you've got some limiting beliefs.  




 Such advice, many seduction 




 Guise DAE redpill 




 To be honest, I'm not sure that it was ever good advice. It taught you how to get women to have sex with you, yes, but it was by using lines, routines, negs, memorised bullshit; a fake personality to trick women into having a one night stand with you. It *worked* at the time because wholistic, life-appreciative approaches to pickup such as Manson's hadn't been developed yet and there was no alternative. But I still wouldn't recommend it.  




 Mystery method is crap, you want Mark Manson's 'Models.' 




 This might help. It helped me.

 I don't think they would even judge you. It would probably be envy along the lines of "I wish I was the one asking her out/I wish he was asking me out." 




 Or: take said text as an indicator of your success, ignore it, and keep going.  




 unlikely to change

There is no such thing. Nothing about your personality is nailed down. Nothing about is anything other than what you decide it is. Right now you are deciding that your personality sucks, and that's all that will come out in your behaviour. The first step is to decide that you are a good person, and as counterintuitive as it sounds, you will become it.  




 No it's not! I've worked hard and progressed steadily with every workout I've done, with the exception of one or two. I steadily added weight in exactly the way I should have - about 2.5kg per workout. Not 100kg at a time. That's fucking stupid.  




 I should mention that he's tiny and that's almost 3 times his body weight 




 That's like telling someone who wants to be an astronaut to go to space to get some experience.  




 Don't tell me what to do. 

Well done for owning up to not approaching, well done for actively trying to beat your AA (even if you had a little setback), and good luck tomorrow. Let me know how you go. You're awesome.  




 Yeah sorry, I was adding supporting evidence to your case.  




 Thanks man! Good to hear that all this feeds into fitness as well as other things.  




 Congratulations man! Keep up the good work! 




 Noob here. When I started I was deadlifting 20kg (40 pounds) - about a quarter of my bodyweight. After some work and dedication I am now DLing 70kg (140 pounds) - slightly less than my body weight. Now, or at any stage of that process, if someone had told me to try DLing 160kg (320 pounds) I would have very seriously injured myself. That is not a mental blockage or lack of effort. 

Edit: My PTs DL is about 180kg and he's been training for 14 years.  




 Can you explain some of what those changes were to me for my education please? Sincerely, a noob 




 You say you're balding and overweight? I'm moderately overweight (about 28% BF) and, as much as I know that I shouldn't care and be more self confident, I'm struggling with it. I'm lifting four times a week and working with a PT, but that isn't going to show for another four months at least, and in the mean time I'm really struggling to approach and display genuine interest because I don't see how any girl could find me attractive. I'm a university student, and for all of my advantages - fairly smart, high achieving, good sense of humour - there's always other guys who also have them and are ripped. 

What have your experiences been like with women when at less than 'average' physical attractiveness? How old are you? Is it different after uni when less men seem to be in good physical condition? How did you learn to not care about your body or face? Do you find that you need exceptional inner game compared to the men around you to make up for it, or is it more or les equal? How much do girls ACTUALLY care at various ages? I realise that having muscles and a low BF% is always an advantage but that doesn't happen overnight and I'm fucking sick of being single. I want to start working on game now, not in six months, because I feel like I'm wasting time and potential effort/knowledge/advancement. 

I realise that's a lot of questions, don't feel pressured to write me a book. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  




 "This video is not available" 




 I'm not very good looking. Think Matthew Lewis (Neville Longbottom) in 2006

Is having sex with random attractive girl like two hours later 




 now she's unconscious and in my van 




 Was really hoping for you in a car with a bug on the windscreen 




 Have you gained significant muscle mass? That would probably account for the weight similarity. 




 Sweet holy jesus 




 This is extremely well written. The dialogue and description quality matches up with most professional authors, as well as the narrative flow and structure. If this was you, OP, well done.  




 Now that you mention it, is moving out one of the steps too? 




 Source? 




 The question is, where do they go? 




 Precisely. 




 Sidebar please. 




 Maybe it wasn't in the US.  




 the fall of the Greek empire can be attributed to hot showers

As anyone who has ever opened a history book could tell you, this is such A-grade bullshit that I don't even know where to begin. How about the fact that there was no such thing as the 'Greek Empire?' 




 Ah, I see. 




 Are you sure that the non-dominant hand does the holding of the arm? I'm right handed, and I always hold my left arm with my right hand when I cross my arms. I just did it then. 




 I could become as outcome independent as I like, and someone being cold or standoffish to me if I'm being friendly still would strike me as irritating or rude. No, don't be *upset* by the interaction or let it affect your happiness, confidence or sense of self-value, but there's nothing wrong in being irritated by someone being rude to you. 

IMHO the whole point of Models is that you can be an attractive 'alpha' male without sacrificing your morals or being a dick to people, so at the end of the day, as long as whatever you're doing doesn't affect your happiness, confidence, or ability to give value, it really doesn't matter. Be nice to people who don't deserve it if you want to. You're then the bigger person.  




 Aww shucks. No one has ever called me handsome before. Thank you. 




 ... this is both what I want to be and my idea of a perfect day in a relationship. 




 Thank you! 




 Thank you! Looking back on my younger photos, I almost shaved it all this morning before I posted, but now I'm glad I didn't. 




 Thank you so much for this comment and for giving such detailed feedback. I really appreciate it. I've only lost about 8kg and I've probably got another 7-10kg to go, so I guess good things are in store. And that's quite true about my nose, I'd never thought of it that way. 




 You have no idea how much this comment means to me. I don't think anyone's said "you're quite attractive" to me in my life. Thank you.

P.S. I also have always thought that I had ugly eyes the colour of sewerage, there's something new. 




 Public transport, after a long day at work. Headphones on. Stare out the window. Bliss. 




 I'm definitely not an expert, but the folks over at /r/malehairadvice and /r/malegrooming are. 




 Dude... at least rotate them the right way up. 




 Got rejected yesterday. I'm 20 and I've had one girlfriend, which lasted for a month before she cheated on me. I'm trying hard to be confident and outgoing, but I can't help but think it's because it looks like baby me's face got run over by a tractor. Give me tips on things to change? Beard or no beard? Without facial hair it's hard to believe that I actually have a jawbone, so i've been rocking it for about two years now, but I'm not sure. If there was one thing I could change it would definitely be my nose, I want to chop it off. And then replace it with one half its size. Been going to the gym for about a month and a half, no change yet but I'm working on it, still have about 10% body fat to drop and a lot of muscle to gain before that looks decent. 

You're not getting any pictures of me smiling, I have braces at the moment and it's definitely still a work on progress. I know that looks hideous so there's not much point making anyone else endure it.

Me at the moment ([front](http://i.imgur.com/x2oxBE7.jpg), [side](http://i.imgur.com/l7qbxV7.jpg)), just got out of bed, had a pretty average haircut yesterday. 

[Me two years ago, with no beard](http://i.imgur.com/gEkthbW.jpg) - keep in mind that this was a professional photoshoot and it has been touched up, I just don't know in what way.

[Also me two years ago, in desperate need of a haircut.](http://i.imgur.com/O3lQCFW.jpg)

[Much older one of me \(around 16 y.o.\) looking dashing in costume.](http://i.imgur.com/8xk3P1E.jpg) 




 On top of what the others are saying, I think you could use a better haircut. 




 I was thinking a bit of Robert Downey Jr
