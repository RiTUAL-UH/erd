 Best bit of advice my parents have ever taught me was to "just ask", the worst they can say is "no" (I know thats not the worst but that was the general principle) 
I've had this attitude since and its handy, its given me the confidence to approach new employers.. girlfriends.. 




 Confidence to follow through with my plans. 




 try "I'm really confused by this assignment, how about you?" or "Hi, can I borrow a pen? I'm useless at being prepared...." or something along them lines. Then follow it up with "How long have you been in this class for? I've never seen you before?"   




 Oh yeh, like during the olympics 
























 I'm so sorry to hear this, how old were you?  




 Theres an instrumental by Danny Elfman called 'Finale' used in the film Kingdom, gets me everytime. 




 People like to say they hate it because other people say they hate it. Its really quirky! 




 8tracks.com is a great website   app, basically people upload there own playlists and tag them by genre, theme ect 
























 Not to mention how dangerous that can be, literally a hotbox for diseases  




 Yeah, we're going to need to talk about your TPS reports 




 What did you do the first time? Maybe we can help.. 




 I hear you on the coffee broseph

 I still haven't seen anything on the London Riots, I would love to see a film from both the viewpoint of a Rioter   A Policeman. 




 If you haven't seen it yet, check out ["Hitler: The rise of Evil"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0346293/) with Hiter being played by one of my favourite actors, Robert Carlyle. It follows Hitler from childhood right up to the early stages of WW2. 




 Thats fantastic 
























 Great, advice thanks! The SIPPS combined with ISA sounds about what I'm looking for, unfortunately I'm currently in central London so it will be a long time until the house deposit is sorted!  




 Hi all, I've only recently started to think about what my options are, I'm 22 but I figured the sooner you get started the easier it is in the long run right? 

I've already started purchasing premium bonds and have an ISA that I contribute to every month, but I'm confused as to what are the best (flexible) options out there which have a reasonably high gain.

I guess Ideally I'm looking for something I can transfer money too every month and be quite secure. Any help? 




 Just checked out Realplayer for the first time in years, its actually got a lot going for it, especially compared to QT pro X

 This source says NK has 70 submarines, second to US, that can't possibly be right, can it? 




 pls respond 




 Oh god I've been there... I always wonder how I put up with a girl like that... needs constant attention 




 I'll say, 60,000 deposits! gulp. Thanks again! 
























 Fuck it 




 That sucks, but its also brilliant you learned that on the last day. Thats what high schools for right? Not just learning about history, maths ect but learning about yourself and who you want to be. Your lucky your teacher understood how teens express themselves, or rather don't, and you got to take what you learned about yourself that day into the adult world.

 Just google searched NK subs and it all makes sense now!

 Second year, though this was actually cancelled a few days before because the promoters couldn't get insurance. Didn't stop people! 


































 I'm fascinated by the fact that is has an elevator in one of its legs down to the sea floor, how is this possible? And what purpose does it serve?
 









 Also, what was the purpose of the friggin minigun they had with them in space? 




 That was a lot more interesting than I expected! Thank you  




 I guess it was when I was 19, I dropped out of school and decided the thing for me to do was to move, far away, Australia. I was going through a lot of emotional issues at the time and I hoped that moving to another place would help me 'discover' myself in some way. I flew out there on a shoestring budget so I had loads of connections, it was a long trip! I eventually made it to my hostel in Sydney, I remember being completely shellshocked as I lay on my bed, I wasn't the best at speaking to people back then so it took me days before I met anyone, that's the loneliest moment if my life so far. 




 I went to college with this guy who was really into ghost hunting, like it was all he would talk about. Anyway one day after class he invites myself and another classmate to a ghost exploration, thing. So we figured why not might be a laugh. We met up outside this old building in the middle of town, there were a few others there also. The building was the oldest prison in the city, where they used to keep murders ect. 

When we went in, the first thing that happened was the lights were turned off so it was pitch black in there. We then stood in a circle and held hands as he started calling out to the spirits, I'm not sure what was supposed to happen but I found it hilarious how you could still hear the cars ect on the street. Anyway after a bit of that he started throwing marbles into rooms, the idea was that when a marble came back that was it being 'interfered' with in some way - I seen right through this as he was basically chucking them and they would hit the wall at the other side and come back. 

I ended up volunteering to sit in a prison cell on my own upstairs while the others continued to do more hand-circle callouts. Every time someone would ask the spirit to "make itself known" I would make a little noise like "crawww" and they would all shit themselves. Anyway, that was an odd experience but interesting.
