 My vitals are good, no one's freaking out about how thin I am and forcing me in heavy clothing anymore..yet I'm still expected to gain *more*.

I know a BMI of 15 isn't healthy, but any further up, not being able to feel certain bones I'm likely to become depressed and maybe throw myself off a bridge. Don't worry, that's not a real suicide threat, I'm too wimpy and don't know any bridges.

I don't even get to be one of those Instagrammers who get motivation from other recoverers due to circumstances. *I. Have. Nothing.*

I wish this would've never happened, I wish I was still me instead of a beast that wants to destroy every bit of himself.

 
























 For someone's TDEE to be 1200 is a very rare occurrence.

[This calculator](http://iifym.com/tdee-calculator/) says your TDEE is 1,422 calories a day. [This one](http://scoobysworkshop.com/calorie-calculator/) says 1,525. Your dietitian knows what she's talking about, ~~unlike mine who seems to only want me to suffer~~.

 
























 I'm going to admit the bold "fuck off" in this post startled me at first.

I *know* I have more to live for then this, but if I'm functioning just fine right now... 
























 Ensure made my teeth turn all dark and stained and then when I complained about it she said they were simply rotting due to my condition.

Went to my dentist, nope, they're just stained, and they were pissed off the dietitian hadn't said anything about possible staining.

Oh, and she tried to push me to 3,000 calories through the tube. I would have to be hooked up to it for *20 hours* at that amount. Not only did she want to make me hate myself, she wanted to take any form of a life I had at that point. 
























 Ah, you're also a young one. Shame we've been hit with this so young, right?

My heart rate was in the low 40s as I slept when I was admitted, the food also sucked at mine and I had a mental breakdown at the idea of having 'snacks'. (Though that was mainly because I couldn't hold anything down - still can't, in fact - and felt like I'd be spending 24/7 vomiting or trying to hold back vomit.)

I didn't have to be helped to the bathroom but my dad had to be with me while I showered. And I was supposed to sit in the shower but lol, that wasn't happening. 
























 **The Good**

Leave for my 'evaluation' this week.

**The Bad**

Downloaded that *Zombies, Run!* app and tried to run obsessively even though my body can't handle it at my severely underweight BMI. How am I ever going to get to do cross country like I always wanted to do in high school? *sigh*

**The Ugly**

I still have no hobbies except for goofing off of the Internet and crying. Can't even stop long enough to watch anime. But I'll be on a road trip tomorrow so I'll try and force myself to unplug and read my massive pile of library books. 
























  I'm afraid I'll turn into a hambeast.

Also my biggest fear.

But no one is telling you to eat 3,000 calories for the rest of your life. No one is telling you your calories have to come from unhealthy foods. You can own your recovery, get to a healthy weight, and restore your metabolism the best on 2,500+.

I believe you'd still gain on 2,000, but I think PinkPanther4 (if you're reading this nice job on recovery!) had some trouble gaining on around that once her metabolism started speeding up. 
























 When I just turned thirteen I was diagnosed with Merycism, the involuntary regurgitation of food. Slowly I became worse and worse as I was handed off from doctor to doctor, all of them having no idea what to do. I lost 40 pounds from an already-healthy frame and became severely underweight. (Still am in fact.) All my hunger cues disappeared, my enjoyment of anything disappeared and my brain became anorexic before I ended up in the hospital with a feeding tube.

Don't feel better at all since then. I'm coming very close to treatment and I don't even know what the point is anymore. I used to have hobbies, things I was good at, now all I do is browse the Internet all day. I have two people I talk to on a regular basis, only one I know in real life, and the other one thinks I'm someone totally different from who I really am.

I'm also scared to go out in public because my body reacts like an anorexic's to weight gain and makes my stomach distorted (which is the reason I'm avoiding it right now even though I'm still dangerously low).

I'm tired of being sick. I want the old me back. He has to be in there somewhere.

I'm fourteen and I feel like I've gone through all the happiness in my life. 
























  I only do it when I need to

I'm going to be frank here and say that is quite disordered. Non-disordered people don't feel a 'need to' throw up or indulge in self-destructive behaviors when they eat too much. I know, baffles me too. They just, like, live with it. It's weird. 
























 My mom is just getting more and more mad at me as she figures out how messed up I am.

A girl I look up who I thought was 'recovered' and has helped me through certain things is suddenly binge eating (like two whole jars of nut butter in one day, pints of ice cream even though she's weight-restored) and that scares me.

Is giving up an option? I know it's not, I just wish someone would tell me it is. I find it really hard to think people can get truly 'better'. 




 It really is a bad day. Yours truly can't get away with nothin' and is missing out on hibachi :(

Maybe try to scare yourself with how bad IP is? Being monitored on the clock drives me insane.
