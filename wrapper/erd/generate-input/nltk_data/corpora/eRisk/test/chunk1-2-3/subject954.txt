 There was a very similar thing with the forestry mod in the old tekkit. long story short the tekkit people were making money through ads on their sight and the forestry dev didnt like that so he made an update for his mod that only came out in tekkit and it erased the critical 32x32 area of chunks around spawn therefore corrupting the world. the mod was then removed from the pack 2 hours after this was found.

 The moment before death is one of the most terrifying parts of dying. I know this experience first hand. Let me first start off by explaining a few things. I was 16. About to make the biggest mistake of my life. Not Sex. Not Drinking and driving, some thing else. We lived in a very bad neighborhood, the kind your parents warn you about, in a very conservative area, so being openly gay was a huge challenge. Dealing with verbal abuse got through to me very quickly, and within a year, I was diagnosed with depression. It soon turned dark and I decided to commit suicide. I hung the rope, and slipped in. It tugged and tugged. When I lost consciousness, everything went black. I knew I was about to die. I was suddenly faced with extreme regret, anxiety, sadness, happiness, and most of all, fear. Out of the darkness, walked a figure. I was suddenly able to walk around. The figure was an average sized man with a dark grey beard. He asked me if I was ready to go. "Where?" I asked him. "I do not know" he said. 
Just then a hand reached out of the darkness and grabbed my arm. Next thing I know, I woke up in ICU.

 Block update detectors are pretty useful. Its some glitch with the game engine that was discovered a long time ago and was never patched due to its usefulness. its called a block update detector, or BUD switch for short. Its used to detect changes in a block such as stepping on a redstone ore, or opening/closing a door. Its very hard to understand exactly whats going on in the game engine, i just know how it works.  




 I can probably help.
