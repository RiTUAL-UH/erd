 ...would they be injecting the water if they weren't fracking? 

And could they frack as cheaply without injecting the water somewhere? If so, why don't they? 

It just seems arbitrary for the public to make the distinction between the fracking process and the fracking wastewater disposal process causing the quakes. It's not like the latter happens without the former... 




 That's probably the stupidest argument I've ever heard. 

And I've spent a lot of time on reddit, so that's really saying something. 

It's like saying "If smoking causes cancer, why don't terrorists just start giving out cigarettes!? Since they're not, obviously smoking doesn't cause cancer!"  




 From a [comment 10 minutes ago, in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/35l2mw/whats_causing_texas_earthquakes_fracking_most/cr5ro87?context=3): 

When they stop fracking the quakes stop, when they start fracking the quakes start again. It can't be a coincidence. The other day we had a 4.0 the other day and we have had some gas mains explode because of this and people lost their lives and their homes. Our gas mains are old and need replaced before they can handle all the movement.

 Yeah well "Foxes actually make great cock house guards" just didn't have quite the same ring...  




 Oh and [about the 2/3rds number](http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-06-26/climate-change-and-the-two-thirds-imperative): 

The two-thirds imperative was enunciated in the 2012 edition of the IEAs annual World Energy Outlook: No more than one-third of proven reserves of fossil fuels can be consumed prior to 2050 if the world is to achieve the 2 degrees C goal 




 According to the[ Congressional Research Service](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/post/just-how-dirty-are-canadas-oil-sands-anyway/2012/05/23/gJQAGdlkkU_blog.html): 

oil from tar sands produces 14 to 20 percent more carbon emissions than other oil the U.S. imports.

So no, this is not a clean fuel alternative. But please, don't let facts keep you from rationalizing and grasping for straws... 




 Yeah I honestly expected some right-wing outrage about a foreign company using big government to steal private property of ordinary Americans, but by and large it's only the locals who seem to care (on the conservative side anyway.)  




 The point is that the science is telling us we need to leave 2/3rds of known fossil fuel reserves in the ground. 

How, then, does it make sense to build NEW fossil fuel infrastructure? 

It's like your doctor telling you to go on a diet, and instead you sign up for a rewards card at Cinnabon. 

And I don't think anyone (well informed) thinks stopping KXL will have a major effect on the industry. But it's like the divestment campaign, it's meant to revoke their social license to operate. 




 The Jargon-Believability relationship is a strong one. With your formal training, there is great shitty potential. 

I don't know the fancy names for things (and am too lazy to look up), so I just resort to using nature documentary syntax to make them believable. 




 If the pipeline doesn't make it cheaper to transport the oil, why would they build it? 

Do you really think the industry that knows it's destroying the climate but continues anyway is pushing a pipeline on environmental grounds, and not for its profit?

 /r/science has rules against the sort of psuedoscience that breitbart publishes consistently, so it's not just my bias but that pesky liberal bias many claim reality has... 




  Doing that might make fracking non-cost effective

Then no, it's not a different discussion. Fracking is used because it's the cost is just slightly lower than the price they can sell it for. If they can't pump the water underground without treatment, they can't frack. They can't frack, no earthquakes... 




 Yes, why aren't terrorists engaging in incredibly expense oil drilling technology that produces small earthquakes sometimes in some locations? 

Such a good question. You're so very very smart. I'm surprised the CIA hasn't picked you up to be a super-spy-genius-counter-terrorist yet.

 Because it gives the reader the context as to why this is an important study? 

If there weren't a concerted effort to push a false narrative that warming stopped, then a study showing otherwise wouldn't have any relevance.  




 A scientist should hope that people stop saying something that's incorrect. 

Right? Or do you think they should be happy about misinformation and the repetition of debunked myths? 




 ...did you really just use the "it's cold where I am right now, therefore global warming isn't real" argument? 
 




 Yeah maybe just don't be a pedant. 

I work with climate scientists on a daily basis. They use the terms interchangeably unless referring to specific issues. 

And regardless, editors, not scientists, write headlines. 
 




 But then it appears as if someone's been quoted, not that it's just part of the article. Personal opinion isn't ever allowed, so I don't see why people would think it's that and not a quote from the story, which is standard practice... 




 Scientists shouldn't hope that false things aren't repeated?

 I would respond with some stupid shitty response mocking the outrage about FPH's ban, but there's no way I could be ridiculous enough to out-shitty those people... 




 [Here's a pretty scathing rebuttal of Soon's most recent co-authored study.](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/jun/03/research-downplaying-impending-global-warming-is-overturned)  




 Lol I wish it were that easy! 




 I can't think of a single agency that doesn't use the term

That's the point! Southern Company isn't a common, public, or unbiased funding source. They're a company. Their motive isn't uncovering scientific truths, it's making money. (Yes, companies fund lots of perfectly good science. Clearly that is not the case here.) 

And it's not a "we're too stupid" defense, it's a "you're too smart" one. 




 Not to get into a whole thing here, but...uh...[remember Sandy](https://www.google.com/search?site= tbm=isch source=hp biw=1038 bih=893 q=Sandy+NYC+underwater oq=Sandy+NYC+underwater gs_l=img.3...5657.8552.0.8746.20.10.0.9.0.0.303.919.6j2j0j1.9.0....0...1ac.1.64.img..12.8.614.4MvcdDFQvN4)?

Because I do. In fact, I remember seeing the road in front of my apartment so flooded that when the waters finally receded, there was a ~10 lb Atlantic Cod flapping around on a sewer drain.   




 I get what you're saying, I'm not disagreeing. I'm telling you that you're expecting the media to operate as though they're publishing PhD's, and expecting the public to understand things like publishing PhD's. It's just unrealistic. 

The focus on the term is just a heuristic. No, it's not technically 100% accurate. No, it's not the key issue. *It's just a symbol that people can understand.* 

Having the slightest idea what you're reporting on

I hate to tell you, only the most experienced and educated reporters have any clue what they report on. If you'd like to change that, convince more PhDs to stop writing peer-reviewed studies and start writing for the public.

Something that most PhDs don't know and always have a hard time dealing with: mainstream media is written for an 8th grade reading level. 

Let that sink in. 8th grade. 

That's the standard you can to hold them to.  




 the use of the term 'deliverable' in no way implies such a relationship. 

I mean...it kind of does though, if the other option is that there's no relationship at all. It isn't inherently bad, but it does mean that the study was done on the company's behalf. Which means he's not independent, and he should declare the funding. 

What is the purpose of paying attention to their coverage, when they admittedly have absolutely no idea what they are doing?

Then don't. If you demand perfection you'll always be disappointed, and you can go ahead and stop doing anything outside the ivory tower.  




 [Make it happen people!](https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=sloths+are+slowbears)  




 A billion Catholics would beg to differ... 




 Yes. Wouldn't have helped the fact that they've been debunked, but it would at least make him honest.  




 I guess I should have added that he claims to be independent, but if it's a study for a company in exchange for funding, then it's not really independent. Right? 

I just think you're holding the public media to a higher standard than they're ever going to meet. You can't expect the public/media to understand the details of publishing. Of course it'd be nice if they followed science as closely as pop culture, but that's just unrealistic, you know?   




 For the most part whatever public institutions or private universities they work in...  




 Except Gore's not publishing studies without disclosing that funding. 

So you've inadvertently made the opposite point you tried to. This shows that Soon's not a scientist, he's an advocate.  




 I hear you, but that's kind of the point. The fact that he considers them deliverables but *failed to disclose that to the journals* is the problem. 

Though you're right, journalists/editors are going to use that term as a shorthand for the public.  




 Is there any indication his work is biased or fraudulent?

Yes. He's been debunked repeatedly by scientists who aren't being paid by fossil fuel companies.

I DVR'd Bloodsport this weekend, gonna watch that tomorrow methinks... 




 You've seen Kung Fu Hustle, right?! If not, drop what you're doing, build a time machine, travel back far enough to find a Blockbuster, and rent Kung Fu Hustle.  




 Young Jackie Chan is the only person who's more entertaining a fighter. His Drunken Master is [great just by itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8Hf8l_TUaU), but a whole lot of fun to watch [in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74OBuMA2qEk).  




 Me too! Just the right amount of style to his fighting. 

Check your TV and see if you have the El Rey channel. It's a weird channel that's mostly kung fu movies and stuff from the 80s, but branded around Mexican wrestling because that's the only original programming it does. 




 Yus. This is my favorite one yet. Perfect! 

(Helps that I've seen the movie recently.) 




 Tell me about it! I went to Coney Island last Sunday and got a little burned after laying out for just a little bit. Then the next day I went to work without a sweater and about froze!  




 Yes, people who mine and burn the dirtiest fuels will need to find new jobs. Which, as the quote in the title points out, will be outnumbered at least 2 to 1 by the new jobs created. 
 




 More technically, it looks like a shortnose batfish, or Ogcocephalus nasutus.

No idea why that big nose is considered short, but I hope that helps! 




 I would if I could, but this is an old image I had in my imgur, that I probably pulled from Pinterest. 

TBH I only knew it was a batfish because I posted the image here 9 months ago with a different title... 




 Hey, if /u/foieymcfoie can get google to autofill a group of chameleons is a starship, I think I should be able to make slowbears a thing! 




 Really? Because last time I heard it, yomamma was so ugly I had to repress the memory! 




 It's not just for the sake of jobs, it's rebutting the industry talking point that regulations destroy jobs. 

Because yes, what you're referencing is the Broken Window fallacy, and it's not exactly good policy.  




 Oh yes, think of the gas companies! We would hate to put a dent in the profits of the richest companies in the world! Heaven forbid they earn anything less than a bazillion dollars for their product that's polluting the atmosphere!

Privatize profits and socialize losses, that's what I always say! Yay corporate socialism!  




 Right, because businesses just up and quit when the EPA regulated lead in gas. 

Businesses just up and quit when the Montreal Protocol phased out aerosols and coolants. 

Business just up and quit when we ended child labor. 

Oh wait, they didn't? And that's just the fearmongering every industry does every time there's a threat of regulation? Oh, hmm.  




 If Slowbears could get popular enough to catch on in google,

 lol, daily mail 




 Whereas when you look at any group disputing climate change, 100% of the funding is from fossil fuel groups or dark money, aka nonprofit money laundering for the Kochs. And good luck finding their funding info, because they sure don't make it as easy to find as AAAS. 

(And a note, that funding was only for the "What We Know" project, not the AAAS as a whole.)  




 Well if you want to take that path, then it should be pretty obvious-who is more likely to be right, and who is more likely to be bought off, the group that consists of 97% of the scientists in the field, who get public grants for research (meaning they don't get to pocket the money) and who are delivering a message no one wants to hear in peer-reviewed journals for the past 100 years, or the group of just 3%, who get private funding from fossil fuel companies (meaning they do get to pocket money) and are delivering a message that fossil fuel companies want to put out, and whose work rarely appears in peer-reviewed journals and when they do are quickly and thoroughly debunked. 

So you can either believe that nearly every single one the world's climate scientists at every legitimate institution and every university have been bought, or that a small handful of scientists with otherwise dead-end careers have been bought.

That said, I'd recommend you take a look at the science. There are a number of fairly straightforward explainers from what should be credible sources- The A[merican Association for the Advancement of Science](http://whatweknow.aaas.org/), the group that puts out the #1 peer-reviewed journal, Science and is one of the oldest and most prestigious academic institutions ever is a good place to start. Then there's the [National Climate Assessment](http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/), which uses information and scientists from the various government scientific agencies, and was started by Bush to explain the state of climate science.  Then [there's the IPCC](http://ipcc.ch/), which is the international look at the state of the science, and has been approved by delegates from every country (including petrostates like Saudi Arabia. So even Saudis agree that what's there is the truth.)

  And I think that's due to deliberate, cynical distortion, rather than outright ignorance.

Bingo! Talking points on either side of the aisle aren't necessarily tethered to the full facts.  



























































 Nice spin, but as usual factually inaccurate (suggesting that *this* is what sets precedent for EPA to do cost-benefit, lol!)

I'll keep it nice and simple:

EPA was planning on taking costs into account at the next stage of the MATS development. SCOTUS says "Go ahead and do it now."

So this simply rearranges the timeline, doesn't invalidate the MATS and certainly doesn't change anything about CPP.  




 Did you mean CPP? 

Because like I just said, this [kicks out one of the legs of the CPP plaintiff's arguments](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-24/obama-may-win-by-losing-in-quirk-of-supreme-court-epa-review), that since coal plants are regulated under MATS they can't be under CPP. So unless you're seeing some  way for a new lawsuit because of the MATS ruling (which would be novel because IIRC the CPP already did the cost accounting that MATS didn't yet ) then I think you're mistaken.

If you did mean MATS, then it's still not accurate since this ruling just kicked the suit back down to the DC court to make the EPA consider costs now instead of later when designing the enforcement. Doesn't throw out the MATS rule, just says the EPA has to take costs into account. DC court may throw out the rule, but since it upheld the rule last time it's not likely to toss it now, but instead will probably just tell the EPA to go count costs, thereby just delaying enforcement.   




 Re: SCOTUS decision, you're confusing MATS with CPP. MATS ruling has no effect on CPP, except getting rid of one of the CPP critic's arguments (that emissions were already regulated under MATS so they couldn't be under the CPP.)  




 Haha yeah for some reason I didn't have that one saved...

 http://www.thelancet.com/commissions/climate-change-2015 




 It's my paraphrasing of paragraphs 4-6:

"Yet, there is a marked lack of publicly available information and analysis which would help New Zealanders decide on the best course of action."

The government had hurried its consultation process on its a negotiating position in the United Nations Paris meeting on climate change in December last year, to a period less than four weeks.

The NZAS was concerned about the lack of publicly available information, as well as the minimal involvement of key New Zealand state-owned research institutes and universities. 




 No way that 2500+ comment count was accurate. I get every parent level comment in my inbox, and there haven't been that many comments. 

Plus only super-popular posts get that many comments, this one was pretty slow to move up.  




 In this case it's that only the federal-government-dependent research body was given the opportunity to provide input on NZ's position in the UN climate negotiations. Other academic institutions, including state-owned research centers and universities weren't consulted and weren't didn't have access to the data. 

So by shutting them out of the process, they were denied the ability to provide their scientific input, i.e. were gagged.  




 It's both a classic rhetorical tool (accuse someone of your weakness, so that when they then point out that it's your weakness, they look like they're just saying 'no u') and an example of the increasingly common conservative tactic of appropriating the language of the oppressed to create a persecution complex. (Think "War on Christmas" or "Take back our country" or "Men's rights.")  




 ...why the exclusion of Title+Quote? Seems like if title is allowed, and quote is allowed, then the combination should be allowed. I feel like quotes without the context of a title aren't going to make sense, and submissions with the flashiest quote that may or may not represent the full article (as a title would) are going to proliferate. 

Which means that the mods will now have to subjectively decide if a quote is an accurate representation because the title is no longer there to provide an overview of the whole piece.  




 For a second I read that as "lol Apocalypse" and now all I can think is how "Apocalypse Lol" would make a great name for a documentary about climate denial...

You're slippin' Gboob! 




 Really? You don't think vaccine deniers should be dismissed? Flat earthers should be given just as much credence as rounders? Phrenologists and psychologists put on equal footing? 

Scientific debates don't care about your feelings and if you're offended. It cares about evidence. And those who refuse to examine it, and deny the reality of scientific evidence are in denial. Coddling them just devalues the meaning of "skepticism."  




 Banned for being a racist idiot who doesn't realize what sub he's in.  




 And? 

Had they happened in a warmer world, they would have been even worse. The point is that climate change amplifies the impacts, and without it Sandy wouldn't have been as damaging. 

It's pretty simple logic. Just because something happened naturally in the past doesn't mean man can't influence how it happens in the present. 

There were forest fires before humans existed. Does that mean humans can't start forest fires?

If I turn the temperature of my freezer up .55 degrees is my ice cream going to melt?

And if you turn it up .55F again tomorrow? And the next day? And then turn it up .65F the day after? And then .75f? 

Because this warming hasn't ended. And with the CO2 we've already released, won't end for thousands of years.

 Maybe it's because the only ones you're aware of are the ones the deniers crow about. Because in reality the adjustments go both ways.

 We're edging closer and closer to that 2C guardrail.  




 Well there is ice on the poles, so technically yes we're in an ice age. 

But the natural warming that would be taking us out of it takes hundreds of thousands of years to acheive the temperature changes we're experiencing in just decades. So no, it's not natural.  




 Uh, yeah, if you're going to accuse NOAA, NASA, et al of being so bad at science that their corrections to the record are actually not correct at all, nothing I can say will change your mind. 

The fact is in the past things were measured differently (i.e. using buckets scooped from boats vs engine intake suction, or the biggest difference was when in the day measurements were taken. Morning and afternoon temperatures are pretty different, after all, and correcting for that takes no small amount of time or effort.) 

Updating and correcting for those errors is an ongoing process. Science is iterative, not conclusive, after all.  




 For one thing, rising sea levels set the stage for a more damaging storm surge, as Hurricane Sandy broke records with a 13.2-foot (4 meters) storm surge in New York City's Battery Park, said Pennsylvania State University climatologist Michael Mann.

"At least 1 foot of those 13.2 feet was arguably due to sea-level rise," he said. That's because sea levels are 1 foot (30 centimeters) higher than they were a century ago, he continued.

 Probably much too small scale, though that trash island is huge... 




 [No, no it's not.](http://i.imgur.com/Zip5bLN.png)  




 ...They do it to be as accurate as possible. 

And if you stop being accurate for fear of upsetting deniers, you've failed at science for a particularly poor reason. 

The thing about deniers is nothing real scientists do will have any effect on their beliefs. That's why they're called deniers. They've concocted this whole conspiracy theory about how scientists are all evil marxists out to destroy the economy, and anything scientists do is evidence of that sinister plot.

 I didn't say anyone was, just that it's a denier talking point. 

And I use the term because they're different from actual skeptics, [who have made an explicit ask that we stop conflating the two groups](http://www.csicop.org/news/show/deniers_are_not_skeptics).  




 Yeah, there was a study at somepoint that looked at the full record and found just as many downward as upward adjustments, debunking that particular denier talking point. I can't find it now, but here's the next best thing, a researcher who looked into the adjustments (with some Koch funding) and found them to be legit. Even more, without the adjustments, the record would show even MORE warming than with the corrections! http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2015/04/prof-richard-muller-not-adjusting-global-temperature-records-would-be-poor-science/

What an understatement!  




 Well it's got 50 upvotes in 2 hours, so I think it's probably a fine title.  




 Maybe try actually reading the piece? The second 2/3rds of the story don't even mention climate change. 

And sorry, but acknowledging the science on climate change isn't a political agenda.  














 The published title and a subtitle from the first line of the article... 




 How science is handled by politicians isn't relevant to (everything)science? 

And how does it have an agenda? It's just asking experts whether and what kind of science questions should be part of the presidential campaign. 

I'm at a loss as to what your problem with this is.  
































































 Adorable. Looks like an 80's sitcom granny. 




 See /r/shittyanimalfacts for further verification.  




 One of my favorite pics, for sure. Glad the title works with it! 




 The US is one of (and a leader of) the Arctic Nations involved. Figured since the US was involved it was US politics.

 Got to hand it to them, it's a clever plan. Say the government's ineffective, then sabotage it at every turn to ensure it's ineffective.  




 No, it simply said that the EPA should've considered costs when it was determining *whether or not* to regulate mercury emissions from power plants, as opposed to considering costs when it determined *how strictly* to regulate mercury emissions.  




 Don't tell Common Core that, because they used climate change as a basis for science from elementary through high school curriculum. 

But I'm sure you know better than actual teachers.

 Scrooge McDuck style gold coin pool? I'm jelly!  




 lol, if they're worried about me wasting my time they'd probably get rid of the dart board first.  




 I'm confused as to why you think comments determine activity for subs beyond /r/askreddit and other specifically-discussion-based subs. 

9/10 of all posts get zero comments. That was my point when I directed you to /all/new. Most posts die in the new queue, it's a fact of reddit, and part of the upvote-merit system. Judging subs by that is simply ignorant of how reddit works. 

And the nerve you hit is the one concerning false claims with absolutely zero evidence.  




 I have reddit open while I work, and the moderator toolbox notifies me of comments instantly. Doesn't take much time or effort to respond when I'm not in a meeting or crunching on something. 

(And as someone who grew up doing schoolwork while chatting on AIM, I'm used to switching between fun talk and serious work.)  




 Comments are an inherently weak metric for activity, because as this demonstrates, a massive number of comments could be generated by just two users (or one talking to themself) and would give the impression of a large amount of activity when in fact there's not. See /r/counting for a prime example of comments not meaning anything substantial. 

Subreddit growth would probably be the best measurement, since that only includes new, active users (whereas subscribers includes some number of now-inactive subscribers). 

So compare: http://redditmetrics.com/r/climateskeptics

to http://redditmetrics.com/r/climate 

Or don't, and stop with the baseless claim that subreddits you don't like are dead. Just because you don't understand and refuse to acknowledge how reddit works doesn't mean you're right to declare subs dead. 

 




 So a subreddit with one post that, over the course of a month, has gotten 4 comments is more active than a subreddit with 100 posts with only an average of 2 comments apiece? 

Yep, sure sounds like an accurate metric to me. Totally not one you've just made up on the spot to make yourself feel better. Totally.  




 Why are you limiting it to subs that discuss climate? And then why aren't you including /r/everythingscience and /r/oceans and /r/collapse and /r/green and /r/ecology? 

Oh right, because you've chosen based on subs you frequent. Which is totally arbitrary and in no way a scientific approach. 

But please, explain how subreddits with more users, more growth, more submissions and more upvotes than this one are dead... 




 You have been banned from /r/shittyanimalfacts. 

Reason for ban: Disparaging the Slowbear.

Length of ban: Forever. 

(not really) 




 Sadly, you probably *can* learn more here than on those cable "science" channels... 




 ...the biggest cherry pick you can think of is using literally ALL of the data? 

Just let that sink in for a second. You just said that using the MOST comprehensive dataset is cherry picking. And using an arbitrarily defined subset is not cherry picked. 

That's some straight up jiggery-pockery applesauce bro.  




 lol, silly me thinking to look at all the data and not cherrypicking things to suit the narrative.  




 [Subreddits where I have over 1k karma](http://i.imgur.com/1WmU6Gy.png) 




 https://www.reddit.com/r/all/new

Lemme know what % of those submissions get attention.  




 Haha yeah, I read the stories in the morning as I'm eating breakfast and taking the train into work, and then spend the 30 seconds it takes submitting the most relevant/important/interesting ones to reddit. Really not a time-intensive process and in return I get to see what smart or funny people have to say about the content.  




 Hahahaha, no, just go through the subreddit and write them down! 

And be sure to post pictures when you go to the zoo!!  




 And? Most submissions across reddit don't get much attention, it's inherent to the front-page-browsing structure. But I don't see how you can think a sub is dead when it has lengthy discussions on a regular basis.  




 Lol I'm salaried and reddit's got nothing to do with it.  









 Well I guess it would if I had some kind of cool pay-per-karma reward structure. 

But I don't, so no, just means fewer orangereds.  









 How do you figure either of those subs are dead? You have to go back all of a day to find [a substantial discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/3d75ko/how_do_you_deal_with_it/) in /r/climate, and [140+ comments in one thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/3d9dj4/startups_have_figured_out_how_to_remove_carbon/) in /r/environment. Hardly "dead"... 









 Um, maybe try reading the story and following the link [to the peer reviewed study](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150714/ncomms8537/full/ncomms8537.html) it's reporting on.  




 No conspiracy theories necessary. Just that others are regularly beating me to the punch in submitting stories, and in /r/science they only allow one submission per study. 

For example, looking now and there's [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3dda40/new_research_says_human_impact_on_the_oceans_is/) story, [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3dd5hv/climate_change_is_increasing_stress_on_oceans/) one, and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3dd5ne/the_wildfire_season_globally_has_lengthened_by/) one today, so it's just that other folks are submitting things before I get a chance to. 

 






















































 That was more for everyone else than you, sorry! 

(That or I was being super pedantic.)  




 Came here to say this. 

It's my most upvoted comment, ever. For good reason. 

Also, just for the record, when I made the comment it was italicized like a book title, not quoted like something someone said...
