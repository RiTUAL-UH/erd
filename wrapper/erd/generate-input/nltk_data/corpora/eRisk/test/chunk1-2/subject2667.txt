 I didn't see a single mention of the Seattle - Portland game on tonight, despite it being from the same family of networks in the same sport. No promotion, no commercials, nothing. Was this the same for everyone else? I live on the East Coast, so there may not have been any promotion because of that reason. Was it the same on the West Coast?

 I'd rather have Cubo Torres to be honest, although he wouldn't have fit with LA anyway (Keane and Zardes).  




 It's a different Juninho. [He's only in his mid-20s.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitor_Gomes_Pereira_J%C3%BAnior) The one you're thinking of [did have a stint in New York but is now in Brazil.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juninho_Pernambucano) 




  But you're right, I live in LA, don't follow or care about the galaxy

That's a damn shame.  




 I'll be happy if he's the next Cherundolo, personally. 




 That shouldn't be too big of an issue. Our league can pay more, is more competitive and I think has more Japanese expats centralized on the west coast, although I don't think anyone would want him on the Galaxy save for Galaxy fans.  









 Both of you guys need to flair up! 




 If the dead was an Israeli non-Arab, you'd be crying. Why are you pointing out the specs in everyone else's eyes while ignoring the stick in yours?  




 Look in the mirror and take accountability of your own actions. 




 Any journalist who comes and tries to do an objective job immediately finds their life in danger. That's why we have reporting from Beirut and Skype regarding this conflict. [Serena Shim](http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/oct/20/journalist-safety-turkey) is an example of what happens to the ones who try to do their job. 




 [Serena Shim of Press TV is also dead because of this fact.](http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/oct/20/journalist-safety-turkey) 














 Well, people in the U.S. today, whether they are authority figures or not, are more afraid of being called racist that whether their actions are motivated by racism.  




 Actually, [New York does have a Civilian Complaint Review Board.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_Complaint_Review_Board) 




 Well, is he just a temporary expat or has he immigrated for good? 




 The thing is, if you get a large enough, wealthy enough, taxpaying base moving in to an area, you'll get a more professional police force, you'll get more responsive police and you'll have an effect on the municipal government. More dollars coming in via economic activity will translate to more tax revenue.  




 Intelligence as in "mukhabarat" in this case, I think. I'm not sure on the fourth one though.  




 I laughed, although I don't think racial harmony is analogous to a failed romantic relationship.  




 How is completely separating a "let's become friends" approach? It's more like a "let's try to completely ignore each other" approach. It's almost like you're arguing for everyone to move to their native lands and for everyone to just engage in mere diplomacy. 




 Anything is better than "let's stop trying." I like how things are in the U.S. even if there is a long way to go.  




 Just like how Israelis and their apologists argue everywhere.  




 You're saying that people of different races will never get along, so we should stop trying to live near each other and cut ourselves off as soon as possible. This effectively legitimizes racism. This is the argument that white supremacist groups use today and the argument behind the segregation of old. It seems I have more faith in humanity than you do to live together with equality regardless of race. 




 You can't be racist if you don't see the other race. Brilliant!  




 Don't judge a book by its cover; don't judge an article by the headline.  




 Those areas, back then, didn't become affluent until the middle class white families moved in.  




 I don't agree with that for a second. You're effectively arguing that the only way different races can treat each other as equals is if they wall each other off. That's not an end to racism, that's an embrace of it.  




 You're kidding, right? The whole article is about racism in an Eastern European country. I've seen other stories about how people with darker skin in Eastern Europe are very fearful.  




 Buffalo doesn't get Canadian channels? I'd be surprised if they didn't.  




  OK. Let's say Spain was had underwent a complete process of Arabization and Islamization. By the 10th century the majority of people on the Iberian peninsula would be Arabic-speaking Iberian Muslims (Muwalladun), the minority actual Arabs or Berbers. Eventually the Muwalladun could have expelled their Arab overlords, but they would not have been able to reclaim their Romance languages. 

Didn't this actually happen?  




 "My brother and I against my cousin, my cousin and I against the world" 




 I'm pretty sure the Quran says there were Jews in Egypt too.  




  we're just on a break

I wonder how long the "emergency rule" will last this time.  









 Never mind that the site he posted from is actually run by Jewish people. 




 If they're in America, that will change soon on their part. Every recent immigrant takes some time to get out of their shell.  




 In the 1950s and 60s, after Jim Crow laws were repealed and schools were desegregated, many white families left cities with high black populations and left to the suburbs rather than live alongside black people or have their children go to school with black children. This, coupled with discriminatory housing laws on the books until the 1980s in some cases, has led to a de facto segregation in many areas across the United States. 

Good example of this here, if you have a half hour to spare: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp22YlJlfHo

If you look at a racial breakdown on a map of a major metropolitan area, you'll see stark differences in the racial makeup of certain areas.  









 I think America would benefit from people self-segregating less.  




 Well, he didn't even offer any evidence himself, he just made an arbitrary statement, unlike you, who actually post a link.  




 The author writes about the racism he experienced while living in Ukraine, saying that the people overall were aware of racism and eager to learn more, unlike his experiences in the United States.  









 Or if Vince didn't think he looks "ratty." 




 If he is coming here, it's going to be in LA or NY. I'm not sure he would want to come to a small town (maybe he would for the diminished attention), and the league definitely doesn't want a celebrity like that playing in a small media market.  




 No, we played Bayern Munich in Portland, how did you forget?  




 What's wrong with that?

**YO, RED BULL!** 

Glad I got your attention. You might make some of your fans happy again if you got on this. He'd be nice slotted next to Dax McCarty. Sure, your fans will still be bad about the missing Petke, but this will help put to rest the rumors about cost-cutting and shifting all of your resources to Leipzig.

 It's a slur/perjorative not just used by Daesh and Nusra, but also used by those prejudiced against Shi'i, who are also present in Iraq.

 Sometimes it causes it. And I only ever get the fish.  




 Nice backpedaling. When you use words like "savages, shithole countries, pitiful sand covered shithole, and uneducated barbaric savages," you're attacking everybody, not just the extremists, and you alienate everyone else. If someone doesn't feel like their country doesn't accept them, they'll look for acceptance elsewhere. And besides that, don't learn about religion from some news articles about tragedies. There's a billion-plus other people who don't do messed up stuff.  




 Pegida, National Front, British National Party, Party for Freedom or one of the other far-right parties in Europe? Or do you hang out on the right here in the States? Or elsewhere? Whatever the case, there's nothing you can do about immigrants or a Muslim presence. The more you ostracize them, the more you'll push them to the militants. Best to get along with them as best you can and, dare I say it, consider them your fellow citizens and natives. They will have a different color of skin than you and have different names than you. They likely will follow a different religion than you. Deal with it. Because humanity doesn't have a good track record of excluding humans because they "aren't like us."

 I can't see Jurgen being okay with a move to Qatar, or even Greece, the one time haven of Eddie Johnson and Freddy Adu. Even Russia these days is probably unfriendly to American citizens, let alone those who play for the national team.

 This is the best thing to do. While spreading cartoons may make you feel like such a great Free Speech Warrior^TM , these websites are the main recruiting and propaganda tool for these groups. One of the reasons that journalists are executed by them is that they don't see the point when they put out their own videos.  




 Two years ago, [Petke] made a birthday video for my seven year old son wishing him a happy birthday and telling him to keep practicing playing soccer and maybe one day, he would play for him, Ader recalls. Talk about youth development! To have the coach who the kids watch every game say something like that  it really changed his life. Now he is nine and playing soccer everyday, five days a week. I know that role model was key part of it. I am forever grateful to that and for that.


Why did they fire Petke again?

 **Submission Statement:**

The article by Teju Cole looks at some of the underlying issues behind the Charlie Hebdo attacks, including the magazine's history of provocation on ethnic, religious and racial lines. It also points out double standards on the deaths of innocents in other places, as well as on free speech itself.  














   Contrary to outsiders view of Israeli society Israelis actually don't particularly like military campaigns because it means calling on the reserves. 

Does not compute with what you just said.  




 In the first few games called up under Klinsmann, he played really well. Assisted on two goals in two different games against Mexico. Perhaps Klinsmann thinks he can still build on that.  




 Set up the goal in Klinsmann's first game in charge, set up the goal in our first victory in Mexico... yup pretty good track record.

Of the three players involved in that first goal (**EDIT**: changed from game) under Klinsmann (Agudelo, Shea and Rogers), only Shea is left standing, oddly.  




 Andrew Wooten is an American who is playing far better in the 2.Bundesliga.  




 Maybe he's going with a five man backline and wants D-Mid type CBs.  




 What's wrong with him playing for Canada? We've stolen quite a few already (looks like Akindele too) from them, so if they get one or two to switch from the U.S., I'm not going to stress.  




 Why is it that every military campaign has something like 80-90 percent approval among the Israeli public?  




 Nobody ever really had anything bad to say about him from that team.

 At a time when Klinsmann is apparently recommending that young players go overseas, this does not bode well for the league keeping the talent developed in its academies.

 Start with two through four in that order, and don't limit yourself when it comes to Islamic scholars. Sunni, Shia, etc. all should be explored. You'll have some issues if you don't know Arabic and Farsi for this, as translated works aren't as widespread as they should be.  

However, most of the world's Muslims don't speak these languages (part of the reason is a lack of education), yet they still understand many concepts both basic and not so basic. Most of the world's extremists either haven't read up or have merely seen the most extreme of sources.

After you've learned a bit from scholars and scripture, you'll be able to get a better picture of what's wrong with extremists. At least I hope so.  




 That is some of the most severe right wing propaganda that I have ever read. You're taking some kind social media activism as some kind of organized campaign by the radical left, when really it's slacktivism at worst and legitimate activism as best. Your hatred seems to be directed at "social justice," as well as any sort of left leaning ideology. 

They work hand in glove with race-baiters and use ridiculous theories to convince the uneducated that somehow someone else is responsible for their lot in life. They promote debunked Marxist and Communist economics and politics as solutions for the 'injustice' of our society. They erroneously believe confiscation and redistribution of wealth by the government (with special groups like themselves getting a cut) will solve critical fundamental flaws actually caused by poor quality education and the effective dissolution of families, particularly in the black community. And they use every opportunity to shout down anyone who disagrees with them, usually by playing the race card. Assault, defamation, harassment, innuendo, libel and lies, rumor, slander, threats and violence are their tools of the trade - manipulation of the uneducated masses to accede to their wishes (money and power) is their goal.

My God, it's like I'm reading a tea-party manifesto. 

 SJW, race-baiters, and environmentalists are really nothing more than shakedown artists. They vampire ludicrous amounts of resources but contribute nothing positive to society, and are deserving of all the derision and ridicule they get, IMHO.

Yeah, I'm going to just call you a far-right extremist. That's enough internet for me today.  




 You're completely wrong. The majority of Muslims don't act like animals. Just look at the UK, where most Muslims are fine. France has five million Muslims, the most in Europe, and this is the first terrorist attack of its kind. 

I'm just glad I live in the United States. At least the bigots don't make like difficult for us here, and we tend to be successful. In Europe, we're shoved into ghettos and poverty.  




 What's wrong with that?  




 I think the term's use as an insult is idiotic. The irony of someone campaigning for the internet would be a "warrior" coupled with the fact that they are doing so for a good cause (social justice) and the fact that some people think that's worthy of derision.  




 I've seen dozens of names both cultural and religious, from both Pakistanis, Arabs, Iranians, Afghans, etc. Perhaps it's just where you're at.  




 My whole argument is that Islam teaches NOT to kill people just for having different opinions. This isn't berating, this is arguing. I apologize if you think that's what it is. I don't know if I can convince you of that. Perhaps I can't, but I had to try. Please don't hold prejudice or violence in your heart against Islam. Muslims are full of flaws, but the ones responsible for the attack went beyond the bounds of Islam. That's all that I wanted to say.  




 No, you misunderstand. "The entire religion" doesn't subscribe to one belief because there's no central authority. His ideas are perfectly valid, and I agree. But there's a written tradition from one of the Prophet's descendants: "Don't judge the religion by its followers. Judge the followers by the religion."  




  why issue fatwas on everything disagreeable

This doesn't make sense. Avoid rulings on controversial topics?  




 It just basically said making the cartoons depicting his face or insulting him isn't allowed. It didn't come with any kind of penalty.  




 TIL my religion is apparently defined by polls.  




 There's no central leadership in Islam. So that's not valid.  




 Ironically, they are killing Muslims. 




 Reading a few news articles doesn't mean you know my religion.  




 You haven't met that many Muslims, have you? 




 Beliefs based on faith are not irrational, saying stuff like that pisses off the majority of people of faith, normal or extreme, Muslim, Christian or whatever.  




 Ah yes, even when we condemn it, we're lying! I don't care what you think. I know very well what Islam teaches, having been raised in it, and I and most other Muslims know this is wrong, and you don't get to tell me what I "actually" believe. 




 Hey, you used to have Red Bulls flair...

 In Urban areas, racial diversity is normal, so it is a lot less common. That doesn't mean it never happens, but you'll have more people jumping to your defense.  




 The military doesn't realize that serving in a country's military is a big part of Sikh culture, and that the soldier will be extremely professional.  




 Even if he was a Muslim it wouldn't be okay.  









  Muslims are allowed to eat meat from Christians and Jews. 

Sorry, this isn't agreed upon by all Muslims. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhabihah 




 Fun fact: Chilean Sea Bass isn't really ["sea bass."](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patagonian_toothfish) 




 Uhh, you forgot Mickie James. Maryse wasn't bad either.   




 Not Arab, but Muslim. I stick to seafood or vegetarian if meat isn't halal.

 YES, YOU CAN, GET A FLAIR LIKE I HAVE 




 HEY, DO WHAT I DO OR FIND SOME VINTAGE CREST 




 TWO OF DC'S STARTERS WERE HURT YESTERDAY. 




 DORITOS 




 Look at this hipster following the AFC Champions League. /s 




 Does the group plead the FIF?

1,2,3,4, FIF! 




 Their pro-rel is kind of a joke. Rich teams that were relegated were buying the licenses of promoted teams so they could stay up.  




 Ok feud with CM Punk that had Punk creepily singing happy birthday to Rey's adorable daughter.  




 He should've gotten a retirement match or sendoff, though.  




 Where did Styles go?  




  Mysterio vs. Fenix and Mysterio vs. Drago
 

Mysterio vs. Johnny Mundo (Morrison)! A match we never got in WWE (at least not that I remember) that would be amazing.  




 You think Gaddis is better? Maybe defensively, but I don't think you remember the Williams from a couple of years ago.  




 Well, we'll see if RBNY can win any playoff competition anytime soon.  




 Wow, good that he's doing that again! When healthy, he really helps the offense and is one of the top RBs in the league.  




 What are those, comment flairs for ants? They should be like, five times bigger.  




 Who made the cross? Well aimed.  




 Except when the CCL rolls around (at least until an MLS team wins it).  




 For those of you who don't get it, he's talking about the Brooklyn Italians. 




 Not according to the UN and most of international community.  




 How much time do you have? Zack Ryder. Christian. Cesaro. Big E. Kofi Kingston. Titus O'Neill. Tyson Kidd. Sin Cara. Every diva who can wrestle and act convincingly.  




 Uh oh, that sounds like union talk! Better get the scabs!  




 Username is great here.  









 I agree completely. It's why I don't have an MLS team yet. I've never lived anywhere with one, and don't identify with the team closest to my hometown (in MD, close to Baltimore, but the closest MLS team is Philly). 














 There are like eight teams in London though! And Fulham has a reputation for signing Americans, and now has an American owner. 




 Grammar is usually worse when people type from their phones. I have to know correct grammar for my job. I don't correct people, but when you try to call people out for it (even if it is sarcastic), I HAD to do it.  




 Didn't capitalize Man or I, spotlight is one word, grammar is spelled with two A's, shorthand is usually one word.  




 How do I become clear?  









 Who is yersel and why should I be thinking for him? 




 Salaam my Arab brother! Christian? Atheist? Jewish? 




 "You Winchesters are idjits!" 




 Whoever was downvoting this earlier is stupid. That's how you respond to "takbir," for one, so it's not unexpected. Second, every Muslim says Allahu Akbar, not just extremists.  




 But then you'd be rooting for financial groups, mate. 









 OP is whining.  




 Yeah, I think he slipped in that joke.  




 It's been there for eight hours. It's also on /r/videos. 




 Hence why he said "worse-kept secret." 




  Felix Magath's farther 

I take it his closer was German?  




 On  a related note, here's this: http://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/02/17/its-hard-to-prove-any-hate-crime-but-for-muslim-victims-its-especially-tough/?hpid=z10

 Terrorism knows no race or religion.  




 Why can't Muslims be rogue idiots with mental problems? Are they always part of a greater movement?  




 In America and England, those are areas of crime, not "Shariah zones" or some BS.  




 Biden's son Beau served overseas, even though he was Attorney General of Delaware at the time.  




 Neither was a hate crime? Yeah, ok. Who says atheists can't be right wing, anyway? We don't know (**EDIT: changed from now) about his political views. 

And you found one supposed false accusation, never mind that there's no web link. Congratulations. 

We have politicians like Bobby Jindal claiming there are no-go zones when that has been debunked. We have people frothing at the mouth when you don't call terrorism "Islamic" or "Muslim," never mind that most of the victims are Muslims, and we have people claiming that Muslims don't condemn terrorism. As Chris Christie put it, "I'm tired of dealing with the crazies."  




 American Muslims have a rational fear of right wing bigotry and terrorism, like what we just saw in Chapel Hill and Houston. A fear of Muslims and Islam is irrational.  









 You just made some Cosmos official's day. 









 Yes, I think that's how it works. 









 DC's is, or so I've heard. 




 U-20s I believe, and he played in competitive matches.  














 The few that have (I'm talking like three or four) probably have come back to the U.S.  




 That was confirmed actually. He's with Uruguay now.  




 As long as it isn't pay to play. Kids with rich parents in the suburbs won't benefit from this as much as talented kids from the other side of the tracks who can't afford the expensive club teams. 














 Hopefully Ventura Alvarado and Cesar Romero.

 You should use "In Latvia no potato, only pain." 




 He sounds like a keeper. 




 I don't know. Is Bork sensitive about his girl pop love? 




 Bork seems to be into a lot of girl pop for some reason.  




 BORK CAME IN LIKE WREAKING BALLLLLLLLL 




 In the preseason so far, Edu is playing D-Mid, with the Portuguese-Canadian guy on loan and Ethan White holding down the CB spots.  




 **Submission Statement**

The Detroit man who was fortunate enough to get donations after his story of walking 20 miles a day to work went viral now has a host of problems to deal with, as he appears to be wealthy in his impoverished neighborhood and now wears a metaphorical target on  his back.  









 I'm not even a fan of Indy Eleven and I want it.  









 Yeah, I read about it in that article by Brian Sciaretta the other week. Sure, the Armenian league isn't all that great, but if Ibarra can get called up, Romero should too. Mexico also has to be noticing his play at this point as media attention increases.  




 Cesar Romero is running away with the Armenian league golden boot. He needs to get called up too.  




 It was good news for Americans, who make up a majority of this subreddit. It also was the catalyst for the creation of MLS.  




 When the '94 World Cup was announced?  




 So, anybody want an older Rapids jersey. It's 2XL and has been sitting in my closet for a while. I bought it from Ross and it still has the tags. I've been too lazy to post to /r/kitswap (I'll do it eventually). Does anyone here want to save me the trouble?  




 He's a Twellman-Holden hybrid.  




 That's what supporters of Bashar say too.  




 You were hoping he had relations with a corpse?  




 Woo woo woo, you know it! 









 And that's why you're an NYC fan.  




 It's a play on grassroots. Grassroots means an effort that began organically, from the ground up. Astroturf is fake grass, so astroturfing is a fake version of grassroots. 
 




 I'm referring to the previous "reform" candidate Mohammed bin Hammam, who has since been banned from FIFA.  









 Government propaganda can be hazardous to one's mental health.  




 What about that Mecca-Madinah railway?  




 Only in that it is one year afterward... 




 Why are all the reform candidates members of Arab royal families?  




 Autocorrect has ruined me. 




 I always thought a good gimmick would for someone to buy into his philosophy, start Bo-lieving and then suddenly win their matches with Bo's help. Someone like Zack Ryder would be perfect. He could wear a white suit, have a combed haircut and start spouting off how terrible he was before he met Bo and started bolieving. They could do that victory lap holding each other's arms high. 

**EDIT:** Suit not suite. He can't wear a nice hotel room. It's also spelled "bo-lieve."

 In your case, probably Israels.  




 He's an unelected king with near-absolute control. I think that's why he's being denigrated.

 









 On a related note, what happened to Conor Doyle? He got minutes a couple of seasons ago but rode the pine last year.  




 entire political party bigoted is very much a personal attack

I fail to see the logic in this. 

 




 He's a mod for /r/PalsbaraInAction, so JIDF probably isn't far off. **EDIT**:Just checked, he isn't and I got him confused with another user. Still posts too much though.  




 Then hummus is biddah, because the clearly the chickpeas are taken from the plant, mashed, and deliciously flavored...

  If you don't like democracy, YOU can be the one to GTFO. 

Thankfully, there's a first amendment that protects people regardless of their political opinions.  




 /u/sematrix is a bit prejudiced against Jews and Judaism. He posts ok stuff, but discredits those of us who criticize Israel because we are opposed to injustice, not because we don't like Jews or Judaism.  




 I like the post, but I don't like semantics or the poster...oh right, sematrix.  




 I think they're setting up a face Orton - heel Rollins matchup at Wrestlemania, hence the Orton bashing.  




 I'll give you Putin and their laws, but supporting Russia and Russian culture does not make someone a heel, it just makes them proud of their country. Making someone pledge allegiance to another country against their will is a heel move.  



















 Are we sure if this is satire or not? 




 Oh, I wasn't referring to 2003. Back then, Syria was internally ok, relatively speaking.  




 You forgot Bahrain, which brutally crushed its own Arab Spring (all but dead unless you live in Tunisia) uprising.  




 Plenty of Syria refugees are in Jordan as well.  




 Replace the mentions of trolling in the article with harassment, and it's still a good article.  




 Yeah, I noticed that too, hence my comment. 




 /u/Ingens_Testibus's post or mine?  




 Something tells me there is hair on your neck and a fedora on your head.  




 Emegharad! DP! 




 Does that make [Juan Cena](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wKClxSRsg0) El Generico?  




 You mean people can't see him?  




 He must not know much about Intercourse.  




 Up here, /u/mattnox, up here.  




 It was temporary, and I'm back. Terrorism is wrong, everybody, even when it's to advance the game of soccer.  




 Still cringeworthy sometimes. "They wants me to be a good R-Truth!" 




 Should've given him Paul Heyman as a mouthpiece. 




 He forgot all of the Germericans.  




 The more money we come across the more problems we see... 




 YOU MUST BE NEW HERE.  




 Squeeze your nose for a few seconds and then let go. You'll instantly smell the inside of your nose. I'm serious, try it. Usually it's something you recently ate.  




 If terrorists attacked an MLS game it would instantly become the most popular sport in America. 


Ok, I just had an evil thought and should probably take a break from Reddit for a while.  




 You sons of a silly person! 




 And what is your team, unflaired one?  




 He's a returning MLS player, though, so aside from the USMNT he still goes through allocation.  




 I guess everyone's ditching the existing USL Pro teams and making their own? Seems like the Kickers and others are chopped liver.  




 Turmeric, red pepper, and a beaten egg. It tastes very good.  




 He was there when he was called up, and in all honesty he's not likely to be sticking around. 









 Nobody with national team caps should sign with an NASL team, at least not for a while. Freddy is better than that.  




 You're getting Freddy Adu and you will like it!  




 As noted earlier, it would take a DP spot to do that.  




 Crazy, isn't it? I never believed the rumors, as I don't even think he looks that old.  




 I would think so. Although, so many teams would pass on him that it may render the process irrelevant.  




 Freddy Adu?  




 You can't forget tipping the fedora.  




 Also, look at working at the sports department of a mid-sized or small newspaper. Resume building can help out when another media outlet has a soccer reporter opening. Sure, you'll have to cover other stuff, but you'll get experience.  




 You do realize having him last until the final four IS booking him differently, right? Careers can be made out of nowhere with a good rumble showing.  




 I'm a journalist, but not a sports journalist. That being said, freelance and look for a job at the same time. If anything, you'll be building up credibility to help you find a soccer journalism job. 

In the meantime, do a ton of online searching. MLSSoccer.com, journalismjobs.com and even just plain Google will work.  









 You're right and shouldn't be downvoted. There's never been a foreign face WWE champion and I think that's why.  




 Yeah, you're being the bigger man here.  




 He had better options in the fall, with Werder Bremen and apparently some  Eredivisie teams interested. Heck, if he stayed with Utrecht, he'd be playing with Rubin right now, which would be a sick combination.  
























 Also, he tried to cook a turkey with some of his friends for Thanksgiving in Austria. It didn't go well.  









 Kleberson was inexplicably kept on the bench by Hackworth, and was actually pretty good. I recall a game-winning free kick.

 **Submission Statement**

Profanity and Gawker aside, this article points out a popular purveyor of pseudoscience - a food blogger who doesn't seem to understand chemistry and trades in myths and unsourced assertions. The writer herself is the exact opposite of the subject - someone who actually is an expert in chemistry.  









 I agree with everything, but I look at your username and can't stop laughing as it is appropriate (and probably what a right-winger would call you IRL).  




 Ream can even play left back too.  




  Alaska airlines for Portland Etihad for the league

They don't compete, though. Etihad is international and Alaska is pretty much US only.  




 This doesn't lessen or diminish what Russia is doing.  




 The Besler and Omar combo is rock solid, and judging by the latest friendlies, the back line really needs that kind of chemistry. It's far too soon to phase them out.  




 He's married to an American (Sydney LeRoux!), so it shouldn't be long now.  









 I CAME TO PLAY! 




 MLSSoccer.com is the league-run site, but has a lot of news. Bigapplesoccer.com is a great site for following your Red Bulls as well as soccer in New York in general. onceametro.com is also good for keeping up with the Red Bulls.  









 True, but fascism and neo-Nazis are particularly brazen in Eastern Europe.

 To their credit, they tried this with Kharma a few years ago.  









 You didn't read the article. Evidently America cares if other countries wish to boycott Israel because, as the article points out, congressional representatives are working on a bill to take punitive measures against countries that boycott Israel.

 They'd be better off if they picked one Mexican team and copied it, catering to all of the Mexicans in DC. You:d get all of that team's existing fans and you'd never have to worry about attendance again! Heck, you'd have so many fans you'd be able to build your own stadium in no time! 




 Their national team made the World Cup in 1986. Give them a few teams and their national team will be one day be right there with America's. Heck, one of our teams might even beat Mexico one day!

 As a positive stereotype, I'd expect RSL to have the most family-friendly SGs in the league (no idea if this is true or not). Conservative Utah and all that.

You'd be surprised.
 




  much more than KSA in the past 20 years

Yeah, I don't believe this. If you're referring to the war, Iran did not target Iraqi civilians with abandon, whereas many Saudis supported the terrorism in Iraq post-2003.

 Nah, because HHH interrupted that one. This was a couple of RAWs before MITB, because I remember that promo ending with "CM Punk is reinstated and you have your match" from Vince.

 Let me guess, you're atheist.  




  Yeah, I rather lost any respect for this douche after reading the part about his four wives. Sure, AA might save a handful of young and impressionable boys from joining ISIS but nonetheless, guys like him are playing the long-game when it comes to islam and a more global scale...

 This scholar probably has the largest number of followers among Shi'a Muslims.  




 FWIW, in Islam you're not supposed to hit your wife.

You're not supposed to leave a mark, either. Meaning, you'll likely just be pissing your wife off if you try and hit her with that.  




 Oh look, we have the expert on Islam here. Where did you get your theology degree from sir?

 I've never given a dime of my money to WWE, and based on the last few months, I'm thoroughly convinced that I've made the right decision. Heck, I'm not going to stream Wrestlemania or download it, either. There's no match I'm really hyped to see except maybe Wyatt vs. Taker, and even then, I'll probably come here to see if it's even worth watching.  









 Yeah, I saw it, but my question goes a little beyond that. What are they doing these days? I've seen them being allotted tickets at past games, but they are said to be dead. Is it an older crowd that was cannibalized by AO?  




 What about Sam's Army? I never hear anything about them.

 This is all completely subjective, but you're treating the supposed non-existence of religion as a fact. 




 And religion has nothing to do with that? I'm pretty sure many religions put the defense and saving of the innocent as a noble cause. 




 You didn't say that, but you're making a false equivalency between Shi'a militias and ISIS/Qaeda. They aren't the same. 

I'm no fan of Shi'a militias as they will often target Sunnis en masse, but they do not copy ISIS tactics nor have they taken slaves nor do they forcibly try to convert people. I can find numerous scholars preaching those things from the Sunni side, even before ISIS ever existed. 

Show me a Shi'a scholar preaching that Sunnis are kafir or that enslaving them or forcibly converting them is ok. The worst you'll likely find is some cursing of the sahaba, which I would agree should be avoided, but even then that in itself is rejected by Iranian and other leading Shi'a authorities.  




  There is no such a thing as Wahhabi.

So the people who follow Muhammad ibn-Abd al-Wahhab are what, then, Salafis? It's just semantics. 

And please find me an example of a Shi'a group declaring Sunnis to be kafirs, because all of the leading Shi'a scholars have straight up prohibited that.

 Actually, they are the midst of a good run in the CONCACAF Champions League right now! They just upset Pachuca, a Mexican team, becoming one of the few MLS teams to have defeated a Mexican team in a playoff series. [They did so in dramatic fashion, too](http://www.rds.ca/vid%C3%A9os/soccer/impact/porter-joue-les-h%C3%A9ros-3.1117584) with help from [a kid only playing his second professional game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Porter) in front of 60,000 fans at Stade Olympique. This isn't their usual stadium but is being used in the CCL for a larger crowd because Stade Saputo only seats 20,000. They face Costa Rica's Alajuelense in the semifinals. 

While they were in the lower leagues, they had a tremendous upset in the Canadian Cup and surprisingly clinched a berth in the CCL. Via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Impact_%281992%E2%80%932011%29#The_Impact_and_Major_League_Soccer): 

 In 2008, the Montreal Impact won the Canadian Championship, gaining the chance to represent Canada in the CONCACAF Champions League. The tournament features the best teams in all of North and Central America and the Caribbean Islands. The Impact won two legs against Real Estali 10 and 00 to secure a spot in the tournament. Montreal competed then in the group stage where they defeated Joe Public FC of Trinidad 20 and 41 and CD Olimpia of Honduras 21 and 11. They finished off against Atlante FC of Mexico which they tied 00 and then lost 21.

 On February 25, 2009, the team won the first leg of the quarterfinals match 20 against Santos Laguna from Mexico. The match was played at Montreal's Olympic Stadium in front of a club-record crowd of 55,571. The second leg was held on March 5, 2009 at Corona Stadium, in Torreon, Mexico, where the Impact led 21 at the half (41 on aggregate). With the Impact only a few minutes from a semi-final berth, Santos Laguna's Carlos Quintero scored twice in stoppage time to rally the homeside to a 52 victory, thus eliminating the Impact from the inaugural CONCACAF Champions League 54 on aggregate. Following the match, head coach John Limniatis commented that his side "should have done better", noting that it was "unfortunate to finish this way".

Since 2012, the Impact made the playoffs once, in 2013, despite struggling through the second half of the regular season. [They were eliminated in humiliating fashion by Houston 3-0](http://matchcenter.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2013-10-31-houston-dynamo-vs-montreal-impact/recap). 

[They have a nice new stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saputo_Stadium), but their owner, Joey Saputo, is a bit impulsive, having gone through three managers within the team's first three years in the league. Saputo, an Italian-Canadian, also has a reputation for signing Italians, even older ones. Marco Di Vaio, Matteo Ferrari, and Alessandro Nesta have all played here.

The only Italian now is Marco Donadel, who is new this year. Right now their best players are him, Laurent Cimian (Belgian International defender who is also new), Ignacio Piatti (Argentinian, the team's lone designated player, which means he is paid very well) the underrated Justin Mapp, captain Patrice Bernier, new arrival Eric Alexander (also underrated), Jack McInerney and Dilly Duka. 

The season has a lot of question marks as their chief offensive weapon, Di Vaio, has retired, and they already lost to DC United earlier today.* Judging by their CCL performance, they seem to be much improved from last season, where they didn't even make the playoffs. While I don't think they are title contenders, they do have a shot to make the playoffs and surprise some people. Their owner has a willingness to spend some money (he also owns Bologna FC in Italy) and their coach, Frank Klopas, is a veteran coach and player. 

Hope this helps!

 It's the weekend, so MSNBC will catch on next week.

 Since you're Brazilian, I'd normally suggest Orlando City, as they have a Brazilian owner and have Kaka. However, while they have invested a lot of money into the club and for all intents and purposes are "big," they are brand new to the league, so there's not really any history. 

As for history, the original teams in the league are Kansas City, Dallas, New York (Red Bulls), Dallas, Colorado, Columbus, DC, Los Angeles, San Jose and New England. LA and DC are the first and second-most successful clubs over MLS's entire history, respectively. LA is considered the league's golden child, having brought David Beckham, Robbie Keane and this summer, Steven Gerrard into the league. They were also home to arguably the best American player of all time in Landon Donovan. 

Seattle, Portland, Vancouver and San Jose trace their lineage back to lower level leagues and leagues from decades past. Seattle is the best-supported team in the league by numbers, drawing the most fans to their stadium each year, and is a very wealthy club despite only being in the league since 2009. Seattle, Portland and Vancouver maintain a regional rivalry where they compete for the Cascadia Cup each year, but the rivalry is fiercest between Portland and Seattle. 

Montreal has long supported soccer, and the Impact have a lower league history as well, but have only been in MLS since 2012. Chicago, while not an MLS original, has been in the league since 1998, but has not been successful in recent years. 

And like any league, there are Brazilian players scattered across different teams. 

Hope this helps! 









 What are you on about? There are tons of Muslims all over Texas.  




 Try to attend as many games as possible, and if you can't attend, watch them in whatever way you can. If you attend, you can also try and join one of Columbus's organized supporter groups.

 Jihad is not part of the five pillars of Islam. Fasting, prayer, Hajj, the declaration of faith, and charity are the five. I don't know where you got Jihad from. 




 I confused Black September with the PFLP, a Marxist Palestinian group. My apologies. However, Black September was still secular and not particularly motivated by religion. 









  I have been. They lied to me then, just as you are now.

You're only lying to yourself. You have a confirmation bias. You will only believe negative items about Islam. I wish you peace, and I sincerely hope you find it.  









   I feel the most useful public discourse would challenge Geller to organize an event that lampooned both Jesus and Muhammed.

Muslims are also forbidden from depicting Jesus, or any other prophet of God. So Muslims would likely shy way from any kind of event, as was the case here, as the only two protesters at the event were these two people.  




 Your source is non-academic and biased. Taiqiyya is only to be used when one's life is in danger, and has historically been associated with Shi'a Muslims, who concealed their faith to avoid physical harm. I'm not lying to you, and it would be a sin for me to do so. Google that Quranic verse on non-compulsion in religion (which you ignored) if you don't believe me. 

 So you're in a minority. Or, you're lying. Either way, what do I care?

Ah, there we are. Your mind is closed. No matter what you learn or who you meet, you would stubbornly remain prejudiced against Islam and Muslims.  

Muslims like myself are the majority of the world's Muslims. As loud as the extremists may be, their attacks are isolated and don't spark that massive war between Muslims and "The West" (this doesn't make sense because many Muslims live in the West and consider themselves Western). I've attended many mosques and gatherings of different interpretations of Islam, from Sufi to Shia to even Salafi, and have never heard of imposition. 

 Facts define Muslims. A poll determines facts. If you believe those facts are in error, it is incumbent on you to demonstrate it, not just throw your hands in the air and claim you don't believe polls. You'd do just as well saying you don't believe in math.

Well, I'd suggest you show up to a mosque and sincerely and politely ask questions. It doesn't seem like you've ever met any Muslims. I'd sit down and talk with you, but as I mentioned before, you seem a bit closed minded, plus you'd probably physically attack me or something. 

I hope you find the truth, or at least, lose your hostility. Peace be unto you. 
 




 No, I've heard it used by Muslims talking about extremists espousing Salafi ideals, especially those prejudiced against minority religious sects.  




  Yes, you implicitly did, just as the author of the article did, by implying that Geller's personality in any way whatsoever justified the response of attempted murder 

We clearly didn't read the same article, as Ali condemned the attackers, saying that Islam says to ignore them. There were no protesters at the exhibition, except the two attackers. The large Dallas-area Muslim community mostly stayed away. The writer in no way says that Geller's personality incited or justified the murder. 

By accusing me of implicitly supporting their actions, you're attempting to read my mind. Neither was justified in their actions, in my opinion. Geller's same "free speech" stance is undermined by the fact that she campaigned against Al Jazeera's launching a network in the United States.  




 I think you'd be surprised if you looked at Muslims and gun ownership in Texas. Most, especially those of an immigrant background, do not own guns. 

**EDIT**: Thank you to /u/espitatic for changing "Muslims" to "ISIS" in the above comment.  




 A poll is supposed to define Muslims? I am a Muslim and in none of the mosques I've attended have I ever heard of anyone preaching that Islam should be imposed on anyone. Extremism exists, but it is called extremism because *it is beyond the pale and outside of the mainstream.* It not only flies in the face of religion practiced by the vast majority of its one-billion plus adherents, but also in Islamic history.  

People like to take verses of the Quran out of context. Well, see what you can do with this one: 

"Let there be no compulsion in religion." - Quran 2:256.  




 We're talking about the writer of this article, not the attackers.  




 Where did you get the idea that the reasonableness of depicting the Prophet was an argument? Or that anyone was justifying lethal force aside from ISIS and fellow extremists? Where has that argument been raised in this piece?  









 Haha, I think Wade Barrett told Jericho that when Jericho was his "pro" during the first season of NXT.  




 Can you seriously not distinguish between ISIS and the other billion-plus Muslims around the world?  




  Wasn't the Munich massacre 42 years ago?

That was a Marxist group who was responsible.  




  In fact, they probably "support" the muslim extremists, inasmuch as they probably think we should give up our free speech so as not to antagonize them.

You're pulling that out of thin air. "OMG he's criticizing the cartoons he must want to appease ISIS" is some zero-sum nonsense.  




  Finally, I'm not really interested in hearing veiled justifications for the attacks based on the personality of one of the people involved in the exhibit. Apologising for people who attempted murder because they were offended by some cartoons is frankly disgusting.


Where on earth are you getting that idea? Nobody is apologizing for any attack. Based on your comments and seeming support for Geller, I could make a similar argument that your condemnation for Anders Brevlik's massacre is nowhere to be found either.  




 **Submission Statement**

The shootings in Garland, Texas over an exhibition of cartoons depicting Prophet Muhammad helped extremists as well as bigots with their narrative: that "Islam is at war with the West."

To quote the writer: "These ideological extremists are two faces of the same coin; they have a symbiotic relationship strengthened and sustained by the others toxic absolutism."

 As I also said above, he's also from Mercer Island, a very wealthy community, and I can't imagine his parents put much stock in a professional athlete's career. Thus, there probably is a lot of pressure on him to get his college degree before signing any contract, foreign or domestic.

I wouldn't say that, if you remember Bran, the weirwood tree and the three-eyed raven from last season...

 Who is preaching about a dragon queen...Wait, I have a theory.  [Lord of Light theory](#g "Based on the preaching of the priestess in Volantis, I think the dragon queen is an integral part of their faith, and that Melisandre is eventually going to sell out Stannis in favor of Daenerys, either by the end of this season or after Stannis possibly becomes King.")  




 Is that you, Stannis? 




 I don't think he's ever even seen a wight and might doubt their existence. 




 We already are. Public viewing parties are huge when the World Cup rolls around. Plenty of MLS teams routinely sell out their matches, with Seattle averaging 38,000 fans per game. International friendlies always draw tons and tons of fans. 

The sport hasn't reached mainstream status, but it grows every year. And as you saw at the World Cup, the national team does well, too.  














 Nah, he was the quiet and nervous kind of creepy, and really was just a kid scared of being bullied once you got to know him.  




 Both.

 




 They did this every World Cup, FWIW. It was usually him and Mike Tirico alternating. I have no idea what Fox will do in 2018.  




 You're kidding, right? Bob Ley's been covering US Soccer for over 20 years.  









 Messed up of the Qataris considering one of Prophet Muhammad's famous quotes is "An Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab, nor a non-Arab over an Arab, except in piety and good actions."  




 The whole notion of Muslims instituting Islamic law is fear-mongering. Some states have tried to laughably ban it despite US law already prohibits any law from superceding US law. Sadly, all this does it make it harder to do small things like enforce a prenuptial agreement made overseas.   




 With Carmello candy bar as a sponsor.  














 Exactly. If she's just around other women or her blood relatives, then she doesn't wear the hijab.  




 It's actually three substitutions for the entire game, not the half, and that's true worldwide, in every top tier league in every country. 

It's only in college and youth soccer in the United States that the substitution rules are different (some subs can come back in the game, there's more than three, etc.). 

Regarding strategy in subs, yes, they are used for that, and they are also used to sub out tired players. It's up to the coach of each team. Sometimes a coach feels the need to make tactical adjustments with different players, and sometimes a player gets hurt or gets tired.  




  the mod who was leading that charge MIA

It must get pretty spirited in those debates.  




 If she's sincerely wearing the hijab, then she's a practicing Muslim, and thus not having sex outside of marriage. So unless she's married, which would be quite a feat for a high school student, she's almost assuredly not having sex. 

 




  She's probably a super freak for some lucky fella.

If she's sincerely wearing the hijab, then she's a practicing Muslim, and thus not having sex outside of marriage. So unless she's married, which would be quite a feat for a high school student, she's almost assuredly not having sex.  




 I'm pretty sure that Muslims were persecuted and unfairly expelled as as well. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expulsion_of_the_Moriscos 




 If a dog sniffs you, or their saliva touches you, you become ritually unclean and can't pray unless you wash with something other than water (old traditions say sand, soap is used now), and that basically means a shower. I don't fear a dog that isn't attacking me, but I pray five times a day and I can't go run and shower and/or change clothing.

As such, Muslims are discouraged from keeping dogs unless we have a real purpose, like for hunting, using one as a guard dog or herding sheep on a farm, for example. This has led to Muslims seeming skittish about dogs, and since we don't keep them as pets, those of us who never spent much time around them (i.e. people who grew up in Muslim countries) may have some misconceptions about dogs. 

Really, though, most of us keep our distance because we're thinking about the next prayer and don't want to deal with showering and changing clothes. 

I was way off on the state, lol. I'm in PA.  




 It should be noted that the governments (at least as far as we know) aren't the sponsors, but private citizens in those countries. Of course, some of those private citizens have royal connections.  




 What about the Muslims who were kicked out? Oh wait, Spain probably hates them.  




 Hope you sent him/her a PM.  




 Such a shame when money goes to corrupt officials and not to places where it is actually needed to keep the game going.  




 Lol, security nightmare, and talk about human rights abuses.  




 They were scared of all the Ebola affected countries taking part.  




 Leaving Ser Alliser in charge is very smart on Jon's part, in that case. Mist of the anti-wildling people aren't going turn on him.  




 I live closer to the Amish than you do, lol. We probably live in the same state. I consider myself practicing, and no, it is not a sin to talk to you. Many Muslim women who cover wear jeans, actually most of of the young Muslim women I've met in the states wear jeans. 

Women aren't required to have a man escorting them everywhere. In some of the more conservative Muslim countries,  sure, that rule is there and it is misguided, but the lack of education of many there makes it a safety issue for women. 

I've been to Iran, Pakistan, Iraq (mid 1990s), Syria, the West Bank, Egypt, Dubai and Jordan, and I've seen women walking around all the time on their own without a male guardian. My mother and sister got to work every day on their own and both wear the hijab.

We use modern technology,  unlike the Amish, and we tend to wear all types of clothing, unlike them.  




  Evidence to the contrary be damned

Did it ever occur to you that your "evidence" isn't representative of Muslims, and that what you see here is what Muslims are *actually like?* 




 Meanwhile millions of Muslims go through live every day, going to school, going to their jobs, raising their families, living their lives as ordinary citizens, throughout Europe and the United States, not bothering anyone. 

Except you though. Because you sat behind your computer screen, read a couple of articles about some out of the blue, rare, abhorrent actions, and decided that those actions defined an entire religion made up of a billion plus people. 

I can see some radical, sitting behind a computer in a far off Muslim country, hearing about a terrorist attack in response to a U.S./coalition bombing and thinking, "You can do your Do-As-We-Say shit in the U.S. or Europe, but here we will not tolerate it. We will not have non-Muslims control our behavior through violent acts."

You aren't quite that different from that radical. He doesn't have the benefit of an education, so he might do something stupid. Thankfully, all you'll ever do is post stupid things on the internet and continue thinking stupid thoughts.  




 That looked like a legit HBO promo. Well done. 




 I recall her being very uneasy during the marriage. For example, she was very relieved when Jorah showed up with his gift. 

**EDIT:** I was referring to Daenerys's wedding to Khal Drogo, not her (upcoming?) wedding to Hizdahr.  




 Aww yeah, BJIV is in! 




 We're not the Amish, lol.  




 Dude, this is pretty old. I've seen quite a few.

 I get the feeling that if he was supporting the Israeli government, you wouldn't be saying that.  




 It's amazing what happens when punitive actions are threatened. This is why the BDS movement shouldn't be discounted.

 If you scroll down: 

 According to the source, Israel offered a four-point proposal that addressed most of the Palestinians grievances.

 1. Palestinian players and coaches will receive special documents to facilitate their travel from Gaza to the West Bank and abroad.

 2. Israel will ease restrictions and promote soccer-related projects in the West Bank, including the construction of a stadium and other facilities.

 3. Israel would cover the costs of tax and customs for sports equipment imported by the Palestinians to the West Bank via Israel  predominantly via the Ashdod seaport.

 4. A joint committee comprised of representatives from Israel, the Palestinian Authority and FIFA would be formed and would convene monthly to address day-to-day issues and any problems that arise. 



















  It's important also to note that Jordan is a constitutional monarchy, not an absolute monarchy like the Gulf states,

Eh, this is debatable. They profess to be a constitutional monarchy, but the Hashemite family pretty much calls the shots. They have a secret police and political dissenters aren't always free to express their opinions. They are somewhat better than the Gulf states, but aren't a constitutional monarchy like England or Spain.  









 York is cheap and has a few bars, plus it is relatively cheap to live there. It's close to Gettysburg, Harrisburg, Baltimore, and Lancaster (sort of in the middle of all of them). Lancaster is a really cool city with tons to do that has a lot of shopping, organic stores, great restaurants and young people, and since that would really be far from Gettysburg, York is your best bet.  




 The Caribbean bloc of CONCACAF were the ones implicated in the scandal. The lone Central American personality indicted was Eduardo Li of Costa Rica. It should be noted that CONCACAF provisionally suspended the current President, Caribbean Jeffery Webb*, in favor of a Honduran official. 

*EDIT: Just scrolled up and saw the name in the sidebar picture. Of course, it's Jeffery Webb.

  there is only one religion/unified group overthrowing countries

LOL, you think Muslims are unified? ISIS is Muslim, most of the people they are killing are Muslim and the people fighting them are Muslim. They have not succeeded in overthrowing any countries, as the countries they are in are *already Muslim* to begin with.  




 If you're thinking about Pynadath, he's in Real Madrid's system. 




 A man does not know the correct usage of "you're."

 That was a completely different kind of creepy, though. He was very quiet and reserved.

I think you mean repented. Recant means to take back what you have said while repent means to express remorse on what you have done.

 Don either finds peace or sells out and makes one of the best ads of all time. I like the open ending. Too much fan service on the part of Peggy + Stan that felt too contrived. However, I like Pete's situation. It seems more natural.

  this violence is explicitly part of these religion's dogmatic writings.

Not according to what I was taught, and to the scholars which I follow. Tell me, what is the nature of your expertise with Islam? Do you follow the religion, or have a theological background?  









 Thanks for your views. There are many things wrong in Baltimore and the police department is one of them. 

 




 I don't comment there. And why? I hold no ill will to you or even most police.  




 Funny thing about that: many who invoke religion don't know the first thing about theirs or do and are only using it as an excuse. If they can't use religion, they'll use something else.  




 It's to provide background about Baltimore's situation. 

You seem to be going out of your way to not comment about Detective Crystal or what happened to him. 




 I tend to be optimistic about people. Hopefully, I get at least one genuine comment before this post drops off the front.  




 You took that excerpt out of context. The story isn't even about Freddie Gray, It's about Detective Joe Crystal, an officer like many here (at least I hope so). You took two paragraphs about a subject not related to the main focus of the article. In any case, the quote you pulled says that the state's attorney concluded this fact, not that she was right or wrong in doing so. 

In no way have you addressed the main content of the article: what happened to Detective Crystal after he reported his fellow officers for misconduct.  




 What do you think about the article? Is it unfairly prosecuting? Does the officer in question have a compelling story or does something not add up? A good article is a good article no matter where it comes from.  




 I just posted an open-ended fresh question in a fresh post. I must confess, I've been in this sub before, and this is most abrasive reaction that I've ever gotten.  




 Ok, this is long overdue, so here goes: 

I saw this and was genuinely shocked at what happened to this officer. I want to know what you all think, and what your experience is regarding officers who report other officers for misconduct. I have no idea of how uncommon or common that is in a police department. 




  I guess you can waddle back to BCND and tell everyone how P S disregarded the article because of the source.

Can you honestly tell me how that is helpful to any discussion? What's done is done now. It seems you're having a bad day, and I'm sorry if this article was just the straw that broke the camel's back. What do you think about the article? Is it unfairly prosecuting? Does the officer in question have a compelling story or does something not add up? Please, I mean no offense. 
 




 Please, enlighten me. 

Posters in this thread are judging the story by the domain name, and I see few comments on the actual content of the article itself. i didn't post here to provoke or insult police officers. I wanted to see the genuine opinions of police officers on this subject, positive or negative. Is anyone willing to say anything?

  People tend to tell them to fuck off with the bullshit.

Uh, yeah, ever heard of [Serpico?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpico). This isn't new, and that's not an appropriate way to respond to public criticism. You're not doing yourself or your fellow officers any favors. 
  




 I think what I like about police most is their friendly relationship with the community.  









 What's the difference between ISIS and these kinds of people? They both look at texts literally without studying their context or deeper meaning. 




 I genuinely wanted to see what police thought of this story by posting it here. Instead, these comments are about people bitching over Buzzfeed.  




 I'm guessing you saw that post in /r/worldnews. Thank you for having an appropriate response and not resorting to "OMG Islam is evil just like all religions" like many on Reddit are prone to do.  




 Using the term "SJW" is an attempt to shut down a discussion or nullify a point by completely disregarding the person posting it.

 Narrations place her as old as 16, an din any case, it was no different than what was going on in other places in the world at the time. Then again, I'm wondering why we're jdpudging Muslims of today based on a one narration out of a possible many that took place 1400+ years ago. According to the bible, Noah repopulated the earth by having relations with his daughters. So we can we call Jews and Christians the followers of an incestuous prophet?  




 Oh, so you're an active member of the Church of England? Because that is the state religion.

 Generally, I look at the actions of politicians to judge them, yes.  




 No, I'm pretty sure Sunni Islam believes the Mahdi will defeat him. They don't recognize the 12th Imam, but they do believe he is a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad. [Numerous Sunnis have claimed the title throughout history.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahdi) 




 Muslims believe that the Mahdi, a different person and a descendant of Muhammad, will defeat the Antichrist. Jesus will return though too and will recognize the Mahdi and follow him. The Mahdi is basically the Messiah in Islam.  




 Yeah, that's not true. There's an entire chapter in the Quran devoted to his mother, who is considered one of the holiest women in Islam, and there are several verses describing his birth, his life, the fact that he isn't the son of God (according to Islam), what he taught, etc.

 In early June 2011, the conservative group Americans for Prosperity posted bogus eviction notices on homes in Detroits Delray district. With the words "Eviction Notice" in large type, the notices told homeowners their properties could be taken by the Michigan Department of Transportation to make way for the proposed new bridge. The groups state director said the fake notices were intended to get residents to contact state lawmakers, to ask them to vote against the bridge project.[38]

  I think you mean "bear arms," and I fail to see how owning a gun has anything to do with the freedom of religion.  









 How diverse is the Nordecke? Not trying to start anything, genuinely curious.  














 You'd think there would be a couple from when Jay DeMerit played there.  









 It is known.  









 He loves to sail, too.  




  little uppity bitch

-_- 



















 How does stuff like this happen? They don't even have an "Uncle Tom" Palestinian at the conference.   









 SHAME 




 She's from their militant wing.  




 Did they? Trystane was referred to as Doran's youngest son.  




 Sock puppet would also work.  




 Blazer, not Glazer, lol.  




 No more kingdoms! 




 Don't all bastards get that last name, not just the highborns?  




 To paraphrase Locke, "they were both highborn pricks." Why wouldn't they get along?  




 I can't remember where I read it, but "if anyone has an excuse to develop a spare tire around their waist, it's an over-the-hill luchador." 




 If you call split almost overwhelmingly against. ISIS's main opponents are also part of the Muslim faction.  




 I thought the Marines hadn't taken on the ISIS guild directly yet, instead backing the Iraqi and Kurdish guilds.  




 This is patently false. If you try a mosque forum, odds are you will be reported to higher level points before ever joining. The ISIS guild started from people who began on the fringes outside of the mosque forums. Many of the guild's recent members are people who checked out of the mosque forums because they didn't find any adversarial, vengeance seeking quests.  




 Yeah, I'm not following that fringe BS website, nor your completely reprehensible views. 

 In fact, I would rather let the Israelis kill every single last Palestinian man, woman, and child because at the end of the day, better them than us.

 




 You're projecting your thoughts into my head. My ideal solution is one single state where Jews, Christians and Muslims are living wherever they want and worshipping freely. If you call the death of a Jewish-only state as genocide, then you are deluded. 

The terrorists, the ISIS types, the ones who actually wish a military destruction of Israel would fight against "pro-Palestinians" if Israel is out of the way. They give Israel's military a justification, and most of us don't like that. It's why we have our own organizations and don't work with them. 

I want what happened to South Africa to happen to Israel. Last I heard, when the apartheid there ended, there wasn't some genocide of white South Africans. Now, prejudices there still remain, but people there aren't subject to discrimination and massive human rights violations.  




 You're putting stereotypes into my comment when there is nothing there. You might be right about sematrix, but you might be surprised how many people support the Palestinian cause because they are against the injustices committed against them, not because of some reprehensible prejudice against Jews. I'm no supporter of people like sematrix, as you'll see elsewhere in this thread. 

Groups like the Neuteri Karta, blogs like Mondoweiss (run by Jewish bloggers), individuals like Anna Baltzer and Max Blumenthal, and organizations like B'Tselem and Jewish Voice for Peace make it abundantly clear that the problem is not with Judaism nor the Jewish people. 




 I think people are downvoting you because of your reprehensible views, not because your statement is true. McCarthyist tactics are nothing to be proud of.  




 Sematrix, if you were just against Zionism and not Judaism or the Jewish people and weren't linking to a subreddit known as Gentiles United, I'd actually support you.  




 He's right. It's called canarymission dot com. Here's the [Forward](http://forward.com/news/308902/shadowy-web-site-creates-black-list-of-pro-palestinian-activists/) article on it.  




 What's the point of Tyrstane now? He's just going to get executed upon arrival in King's Landing despite having nothing to do with Myrcella's death. Or, even sooner if Jamie gets irrational and executes him on the boat.  




 What's to stop Jamie from turning the boat around and heading back to Dorne?  




 Does anyone have the video of him presenting the NXT Championship?  




 CLEGANE BOWL CONFIRMED 




 Your flairsake is still alive, at least we think.  




 Hey, we know who he is! He pays the iron price.  




 Whore! *splat* 




 Load the jump program. 




 The crown was also massively in debt while he was Master of Coin. I have a suspicion that he did that on purpose.  









 From Netanyahu's point of view, I mean. He's saying that the Palestinians will not know justice and freedom as long as Israel exists. I'm talking about Netanyahu saying it, not anyone else.  




 With or without context there is no way to justify that quote.  
























 You Targaryens are a contentious lot.  




 A lot of scholars say that covering the neck is part of hijab.  
























 I would add that the caste system has to figure into it. "The help" is probably not far off.  














 This is what I would say to those who argue that there no miracles today because religion does not exist. No, it's that they would still refuse to believe even if a miracle occurred in front of their very eyes.  




 Hodor.  




 Ser Loras would be happy.  




 Misplaced javelins can't melt steel plot.  




 They should have applied that to the sand snakes... 




 You don't have to root for Ramsey. Brienne's still waiting... 




  He had also previously displayed a disgust at the action of burning people AND. A mistrust of Melissandre's methods.

Which is why the second season started with him burning a ton of people, and pledging loyalty to Melisandre.  




 The first guy who tries that is the first one killed.
