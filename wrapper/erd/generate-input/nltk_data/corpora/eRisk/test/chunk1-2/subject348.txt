 Definitely a bad idea. Cars always depreciate in value from the moment you drive out of the dealership! Buying a cheaper car when your income is not a whole lot makes much more sense as you wont lose much once you sell it. A couple of years later, if you are making more money, then go for a better car.

 next door.. the "else" house 














 A rich billionaire Sheikh sends his son to a university in the US. He buys his son a gold plated Ferrari so that he can commute from his house to the university everyday.
A couple of weeks in, he gets really upset and sends an email to his dad:
Dad, all my friends in the university use the public transport .. usually a train .. to come to university. I feel really embarrassed to be driving around in a gold Ferrari.

Next day, the Sheikh responds: Don't worry son. I've just transferred $10 million to your account. Go buy urself a train.

Also, put lots of water.. and drain excess water once cooked! This removes all the starch which actually causes the stickiness. Your rice will be healthier and wont stick even if you put it in the fridge for a few days.
