 I could have even made weakness potions, but time and the game were not on my side...
 




 I could have even made weakness potions, but time and the game were not on my side...
 




 lol, Ice, there is no July 32nd :D
 




 Does it close and reopen 20 minutes before?

 




 Well, tbh, if he said not to use the command, then don't use it, and don't be that guy... 




 Actually at the time I am typing this, it is 17:35. 




 It will be quite a treat seeing all the new faces we may see during and after this event! Just remember, always be respectful to the host, and never cheat! 




 Make sure you don't have ./nick enabled, that allows people to change their name and causes problems. 




 :(
 




 Be there once more, hopefully better this time!

 




 Be there again, and no babies! 




 I only had like 9 :D 




 Although I didn't win, I'll have you know I also had a power 3, and died because you didn't have more arrows! :( 




 }:) 




 I've trucked through the only matches I've played of it, but through all of them, I have learned that baby zombies need to hit less as hard and have less health. Right now they are basically small, fast zombies, and any health I lose is to them. 




 Ice, have I ever told you how much I love your games? Because I do! Although, if this is the last 1.5.2 match, I may lose my always going to meetup and dieing streak, because baby zombies. 




 Maybe Ice will host? That be awesome! :D
 




 That doesn't seem right though, it says the 21st for blackie's?
 




 mwahahahahaha 




 I'll (try to) be there! 




 Your not alone, I did too :'(
 




 Or not :( 




 :D
 




 I'll be there again! 




 I thank him too, I wonder when there will be a game without us in it, or one with Jacob in it. 




 Earlier today huh, I'll still be there though!
 




 I'll get you this time! 




 Yeah, I had similar gear as shadowlego, and 5 golden apples (+ full health) and was against the wall, but then someone attacked with what I assumed was a strength potion or a really good sword, while 3 others were   charging at me, and died in one hit. I didn't even get to heal due to as many people as there were. 




 I would recommend next time, just ban him. Don't make a long lengthy deal over it, it makes the game worse. Better luck next time! 




 To those who would want to play in these matches, I would recommend not to. The OPs were spawning mobs to get rid of particular players, and down right annoy others. I had about 20 bats spawned on me on one occasion. Other players (regardless of who they were) had creepers spawned on them. I would not recommend playing these matches until their games are fair, and tolerant. 




 I am sorry, but that seems like the, "If it doesn't impact me, then i don't care about it." or basically, you don't care about anyone but yourself. I'm sorry if I offended you, but its my opinion. 




 okay, sure i see, but how many people dont use that chat, or want to organize all their information? It gets a bit hectic to do it in chat. There are also many that arnt in that chat that want to play games, and get their games from the subreddit. Believe it or not, but a lot of people DON'T use the skype chat. 




 Not to be rude, but, where else is there? 




 Those who are trusted by the host, not all, I understand you, but there are those who would not play fairly, however, I don't see them often or at all. Many on the UBL though do play fairly. I personally want to stay out of this one, but just clearing that up. 




 I assume that he meant 22:30 UTC or 6:30 EDT because PDT is strange to use without EDT unless you live there. (Also, JOHNNY, UTC from PDT is +7) 




 You didnt put the IP in the post guy, whata doin!?
 




 Wanting me to "shut the fuck up" when i am asking a question just shows that you cant take criticism, and i was merely asking a question for why you would say something that was not a sign of good hosting. You dont have to tell me what i already know. 




 I would love to play again, your guys server was all right with 15 people, so you shouldnt have a problem with 25. (Also, I like endurance ffa's, the ones with no time limit, hint hint nudge nudge.) 




 Was fun! Started as the first one to take damage, and went on to win! 




 It didn't matter who said it, i was merely asking why it said that, when that obviously is not a sign of good hosting. Replying "shut the fuck up" also is not, and was completely uncalled for, I replied back as narrow minded as you did. I'm not the only one that had a problem with your matches, or this being the first, and I'm sure, not the last, you may want to learn to respect people before they will respect you, and don't go "you swore at me, nyanya" While it may not have been one of the most mature things I've done, you swore at me first, and I don't "bow down" to hosts, I play with them mutually, and respect them. You, I have no respect for whatsoever.  




 Sounds like wdornbach to me, his hosting is very similar.
 




 That doesn't give much context, why did he deserve to be banned?
 




 Apparently you could have logged back in, and I had asked the host (who, contrary to what it says here, was t4t4t4t4, not actually_yes) why he had not replied, and he said he was afk. I then complained that he had said "this is an impromptu, do not complain about lag and bad hosting" and i said that gave no right to not host correctly. To that, actually_yes replied with "shut the f*ck up" and i replied back as narrow minded as he did. He then banned me for: faggot. 




 He is a very clever man, but apparently not enough, you sir brought this to light, so that we know to avoid this name too, thank you.
 




 Hopefully you will do better than he did with it. :)
 




 No no, -10/10
 




 However, curious why people were still on, I logged onto the server, to see if this was still going on, it appears that wdornbach said he had lost the server, and no longer owns it, so hopefully we wont see him anymore. 




 I would have claimed that before the point of wdornbach killing people, that he was just making honest mistakes, but at the point he just went and killed people, he was being incompetent, especially because he never replied at anything ever said in chat. He is a horrible host, no because he didn't know what he was doing, but because of the things he did know what he was doing. 




 were you still in game? can you not get on either?
 




 I am not whitelisted D:
 




 I personally think you could do well, but here is some feedback:

-Don't make PvP instantaneous, turn it off until first night or second day.
-Make the spawn box bigger and within the borders, the constant teleporting was quite annoying.

I do however, like your endgame of a re-scatter, and I would appreciate you trying again :) 




 it will be interesting to see who eats their apple at the start and who doesn't ':l.  




 I get DCed too, and now its white-listed! D:  




 Skype and IGN: test_subject5099
 




 Scenario?  




 As it says feel free to apply again, may I do that here? IGN: test_subject5099

 I know I'm a bit late, but it would be awesome to play, IGN: test_subject5099 




 I have been planning to be in everyone of your FFA's, and thwarted every time! 




 Twice and your out if a great idea, and if the person has tried to alternate account their way to play, the time should be extended as if it was a totally different person (A reset, if it were.).
 
























 You sir, are a genius! I think it is pretty balanced if so, because killing a witch is pretty difficult if it poisons you, and they are pretty rare. 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/ultrahardcore/comments/1kymif/news_about_xss_9/ 




 From this comments time, it is in an hour and 30 minutes. 




 23:00 UTC
 




 Its not up D: 




 Teams of -99* :P
 




 Is the message can't resolve host name or Can't Reach server? also the "(MPMG)" part is not part of the IP. 




 You messed up more than that buddy, the format is MMM DD HH:MM UTC and this is not an impromptu... 




 Well, that's how they are, yes, they do need to be nerfed, but the host cannot do that, if he decides to disable glowstone than so be it. 




 Nether is 1.6 isn't it? 




 Does it say teams or allies? No? Then no. 




 Hopefully, all went well except that the whitelist should have been cut off at the time you got twenty, and that you should have pregened. 




 YAY :D 




 Can you give us the direct IP, the one with the numbers? 




 Hopefully you can, but "trolling" doesn't give a good impression of you as a host. 




 Fun for you and whoever kills you, we would have all been killed by that one guy, thats not fun, imo, and once again, I didn't play your game... 




 Check you chat logs dude, I only ever said the F-Bomb, I never called you a cunt, the pinata thing was out of hand though, they were never a set of stuff that automatically made you win, just boosts...
 




 You can do better, but your assistant host, cannot, he has no better judgement and should have left it as an ffa, not a "kill me and you win" game, because that gear was too op. 




 It would have been fine if you used better judgement and known that the person that killed you would have won no matter what, your hosting skills can be improved on, but the pinata thing was the worst idea I've ever heard. Almost like Gammex, and that's pretty bad. I didn't get to play anyway, you banned me... 




 DO NOT EVER PLAY THIS GUYS GAMES...
Even for his first game, this is wildly unacceptable, he did not pregen or cut off the whitelist, leading to 30 minutes of trying to kick people to lower the player count. Then, the game was changed to FFA due to issues, (which is fine), however, then the host made himself "a walking pinata" with a sharp V sword and full diamond. I said that this was F-ing Stupid, and to that, he said, that this was a "random game" when infact it was a Reddit To2, not an FFA by some nitwit, even though thats what it ended up being. Do not play in this hosts games, unless you want to waste your time. 




 Swyrnd and test_subject5099 




 Hi, my name is nether rush, and I killed 4 people in 30 seconds! 




 WOO! 




 If you didn't notice, you can log in now! 




 This usually isnt how this works out, but sometimes it just doesnt work out :/ 




 Hope you do well :D 




 Practice your pvp overall, and start with an FFA, learn the basics, maybe some tactics, and listen to what some people say in chat, because while sometimes it is really annoying things that arent relevant, sometimes it is helpful. Keep the mentality too at the start of the game, that you will only have 10 hearts, and thats it.

And remember, baby zombies will eat your face, skellies have aimbot, and that the nether is over-powered. 




 Yeah, I know, I wanted to play too :/ 




 Cmon man it says the max is 30 players :/ Please tell me you didnt start early :/ 




 You already start? It was never specified when you opened and I'd like to play :( 




 Well, it says Vanilla in the title, but No mobs and Perma-day are not Vanilla :3 




 My PC doesn't work with ips of this sort, do you have the number form of the IP?
 




 nether enabled?
 




 Not the only one man, mine was the same way. 




 Please host adc, Brindle's game is home hosted...
 




 3:15 UTC is 11:15 EDT, the server opens at 11:00 EDT  




 Nether enabled this time? 




 GG, that win was a bit cheaty, but we killed so many in the portal. Thank you swyrnd for helping me win! 




 Man, you have to pregen, otherwise it will take an eternity to start the game. 




 What about the nether? Is its terrain 1.7.3 generated? 




 If I don't have potions: 1. Pick 2. Sword 3. Bow 4. Water Bucket 5. F S 6. Lava Bucket 7. Food 8. Blocks 9. Torches or Gapples

If I have potions I just remove blocks, Lava, and F S for pots and such, and my inventory itself is put accordingly to my hotbar, like arrows above bow or tools above the pick. 




 YES, my favorite gamemode! 




 Why thank you, even if i did lose, it was a completely fair final fight, but as it seems, Strength 1 vs. 10 dogs (I had the strength) is not good if you have no lava. 




 Can we get some clarification as to what is going on with this tournament, because it seems like game 2 is not happening without any reason why. 




 Unfortunately I cannot make this particular match, but all other matches in this tournament I should be able to make :) 




 I would not recommend playing this host's games, very early in the match he started an event that caused rain to do damage, with no notification on this post that that would happen. When anyone would say anything about this, he would reply "quit yo bitchin" completely disregarding anything said. Do not play a game from this host if you wish to pvp, and not hide in caves from an event we were not notified of. 




 Should be open, Its 10 minutes before start... 




 This opens in 45 minutes from when I replied to you... 




 Yeah, it should be open, but its not... 




 Why hello there, I'm test_subject5099 (I prefer JT personally), and I've been around since May 2013. I personally love the competition, and play a lot of  FFAs, but team games are always fun (I prefer random teams games over chosen, but that's just me.). Always have fun, and remember, pots are op, and enchantments first!  




 For future reference: 4:30 UTC is actually 12:30 EDT 




 Is there a chance you would allow solos? 




 Better hope that skeleton is on the left or right side of your screen! 




 When does it open?
 




 We over at /r/ultrahardcore have a very similar idea, where we have the "Golden Head". Simply craft a golden apple but instead of the apple use a player head and heal 4 hearts! This encourages pvp and gives strategy to how much gold you should keep on your person. 




 Yeah, got second :( what is your IGN anyway?
 




 hopefully I won't die with potions this time! 




 Don't worry, I died with pots yesterday, so you should definitely be able to kill me :) 




 I will murder you all 3 




 ICEEEEEEEEEEEEE, I totally will play this :)

 




 Yes
 
























 The ability to turn all sounds except player sounds may or may not effect UHC, probably will be fine due to the fact that all people have access to it in vanilla at any time, and it is intended, but idk. 




 TBH, with their rarity, it seems fine, if you get that lucky to get one of these books, or spend the time to, then its about as balanced as spawning next to a temple, not game ending, but good. Considering too the drop of books in dungeons, it seems okay. 




 No more endurance?
 




 This is not the way to format posts, the correct format is MMM DD HH:MM UTC - (Title) and you must use UTC time. 




 test_subject5099 




 You sir, should just stop posting matches, this is ridiculous.
  




 Isn't Blitz FFA you start at half a heart but you have a notch apple? 




 I would move to a much more convenient position to bow fight, hopefully catching the attacker off-guard and shooting him to death. 




 I have to thank you for that, while it wasn't directly my intent, you gave the chat a more of a wake up call then myself alone could have. 




 The UHCS skype chat, as I understand it, is for us to socialize, and it has been that way for a while, but or some reason lately it is filled with uninteresting, stupid guff that most people don't want to read or care about. Myself and many others have left the chat for this reason, where we were mostly there for information about the server, the occasional conversation was fine, but it had gotten out of hand.

A long time ago when the server was smaller and there were way less people, me and MG had a very long conversation about random stuff, that we were promptly told by many to stop, which we did, and talked in a private chat.

What I'm asking is to stop all this random stuff on the chat, and bring it back to its original purpose, the way it should be and was meant to be, not some role-playing chat with random topics that mean nothing to the chat. This is a plea for order, for the way things should be, not a spam-filled chat with things you can do elsewhere. 




 I didnt say it wasn't :P just that he said call, but calls are not permitted. 




 *cough* skype is not allowed *cough* only teamspeak *cough cough* 




 basically, teamspeak would be incredibly easier because you can just switch channels. 




 The Title format MMM DD HH:MM UTC - Title and the time must be on a 24 hour clock, and the post must be made at least one hour in advance. 




 The Title format MMM DD HH:MM UTC - Title and the time must be on a 24 hour clock

 So you said you will open at 21:30, but you opened 5 minutes before that... Why?

 This post is still here though...
 




 Hey, could you remember to close your server or put up the whitelist next time, your spawn is a bit screwed up. 




 GAH 




 You could literally make an alliance of the entire server. 




 cough cough, You need to turn off whitelist, cough cough 




 97 Coal Blocks and 221 Redstone Blocks 




 First of all, your title should be in the format of MMM DD HH:MM UTC - (Information), Secondly, you should be using UTC time, not GMT, which are the same, but UTC is used here. Thirdly, the only information you have is the gametype, time, and the nether, no subrules or other paraphernalia. Please look at other posts and follow the format next time. Also, you cannot post a match less than an hour before the actual match.

 Wait, what? 




 THE VERY FIRST GAME THAT THE NETHER IS BACK, YOU HOST AT A TIME I CAN'T PLAY. WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY 




 :/ 




 woo
 




 Damn guy punted me off a mountain for it though :D 




 Okay, I see, I see, I am aware too that for some reason your name was not there before, but congrats on freedom. 




 Allies cannot win together, they must kill in the end. 




 You are still on the UBL Slutty, Number 10. 




 Resource packs in general work fine with optifine, why wouldn't an xray one work? Just common logic... 




 ;_; 




 not that I'm trying to condone this or anything, or attack you, but there are xray texture packs too, which are obviously bannable, but they work with optifine...

DON'T DO IT KIDS, not even once... 




 You hosted my very first ever game, I am so sad to see you go :(
Hopefully you will do well in life, and I hope nothing horrible caused this.
...see you next time :) 




 test_subject5099, Swyrnd, Jaewoook 




 server not up? 




 because the game is tomorrow... -_- 




 Match posts must be made one hour or more in advance... 




 Not to be mean, but don't forget, if you're on the UBL, you also cannot be on the server. 




 Click the link... 




 :') I'm sure we will all miss you del, have a great time at college, the dragon rush I played with you was one of the most memorable games I ever played, and UHCS was (and is) a big deal to me :) good luck out there!

...and come back for a visit...ya hear? 




 This is true ^^^^ 




 ._. 




 No, log on at any time to play. 




 I wouldn't assume solos are allowed, are they? 




 Since this is the only activity this account has also ever had on reddit, this is almost certainly not true. Hooray for logic! 




 I win 




 Well, then allow me to go for round 3 :D 




 I posted this after the match was full, I posted it for people that didn't get into this match but still wanted to get in, but that's fine, I hate fun too. 




 You disable glowie yet? 




 Anyone that would still like to play a uhc, there is a voted match at uhc.msarchet.com:25618 




 It filled in half a second. 
























 test_subject5099
 




 It is the correct format, probably can't be parsed because it goes into next year. 




 The plugin, being from /r/ultrahardcore, I feel that the plugin is 100x better, for no ghast tears, enderpearl damage can be toggled, player heads, golden heads; with all of this, I feel makes the game a lot better and more strategic. 




 The overall format is Mmm DD HH:MM UTC - (Title) 




 The correct format for this match is Oct 06 01:30 UTC - Cheesy's #3 To3 




 Sep removes them from extreme hills and chests.

 Thanks Obama 




 I wish more kills to you, and death upon you at the same time :D 




 Next time, your post must be at least an hour in advance. 




 Whitelist isn't off.
 




 probably
 




 The correct format for this particular match is "Sep 30 18:00 UTC - dannyminez's #3 To3 Endurance (Sign Up)"
 




 test_subject5099 




 I did then lol 




 Walden, matches cannot be posted less than an hour in advance. Do not be surprised if this is taken down.  




 I was in the game :L 




 Then don't, but we really don't either. 




 He made the best out of a bad situation :D 




 Listen D4, your post is going to be removed because only mods can post goodbyes. Sorry to see you go, but rules are rules. 




 To add to this, this was 2 hours ago. However, being that it doesn't say impromptu, as much as I want it to be today, is probably tomorrow. 




 The civilization crumbles, and you walk quietly back in, and we all listen, all of us, in spirit.  




 Maybe the one that isn't an asshole.
 




 "isn't" 




 Then that is not an allies game, thats a long distance to2 with solos. 




 You can always backstab in an allies game. 




 I can't get the ip to work, can you supply the number ip? 




 Incorrect formatting, the correct format for this match is Sep 24 00:45 UTC - Awalk's To2 w/solos 




 and maybe test_subject5099?

 Sep 22 16:00 UTC - MCRuler10 #1, FFA (Return of Funk)***
I only assume its today. 




 Sep 22 07:00 UTC - FFA - Big Toe's Impromptu #12* :P 




 RTo5 means random teams of five, so there is no guarantee you can play with your friend. 




 Sep 22 09:00 UTC - * 




 When sessions go up everyone jumps like this and it DDOSes the servers so they time out again. 




 No golden apples or heads? 




 Sup 




 Yes, but on an even higher level, where one enters the nether or things of that nature, especially with things like enderrush. I played a few of those games though, and sometimes it helped me get gold or diamonds I wouldn't normally see right away. 




 You are able to toggle it in default minecraft I believe, but I would like to see scenarios using this functionality.  




 and a hyphen :P 




 "Date and Time: Sunday, September 16 02:00 UTC (09:00 PM EST)" 02:00 UTC is 10 EDT :P
 




 Also, how many allies? 




 Guy, the format you want to use for this particular match would be: Sep 16 20:00 UTC - DIg224#1 Vanilla FFA with Allies 




 The correct format is Mmm DD HH:MM UTC - (Title) 




 Is it FFA or To3?, it says To3 in the post. 




 I got pots (which yes, can make this completely invalid, but it was still pretty cool) and I went to 0,0 with 30 minutes left in the game, then, I see a guy, do a typical st2 2 shot, then it gets interesting. I see another guy in the desert, 2 shot him, see 2 more in the distance, run up and kill them both, turn around and kill another, and then go down into a temple to re-brew and heal. All this took less than a minute. As it turned out, there was enough diamonds left on the ground for full diamond, but I couldn't pick them up. :D (I won after 2 more kills if you didnt guess) 




 Once again, please use the correct format: Mmm DD HH:MM UTC(space)-(space)(title) 




 Announcement flair is for moderators only. 




 The format is UTC(SPACE)-(SPACE)(Title) :P xD, definitely don't delete and repost, just remember for next time. 




 As long as you know the rules, its not a problem. 




 I mean, at least the impromptus would follow the rules, they werent even posted an hour in advance. 




 See here - http://www.reddit.com/r/ultrahardcore/comments/1k53na/regarding_impromptu_and_official_matches/

No need for a mod to message you, it is against the rules, pushing your game back 15 minutes would suffice, but rules are rules, and while there may be enough players for all three, many time there are not, so please follow the rules. 




 While it is true that he does host everyday, and hosting an FFA at the same time, there should still be players, then there is no problem with holding the FFA back 15 minutes for people that want to play that, correct? Rules are Rules, even if they dont matter at one point, they do at another. 




 Games must be posted at least an hour in advance, no earlier. 




 Games must be posted at least an hour in advance, no earlier, and the correct format is MMM DD HH:MM UTC - (title) 




 Please use the correct format, the format is MMM DD HH:MM UTC - (title), and you may want to add some additional information, such as the nether, length of the game, and number of people.  




 The game that prompted crimson to write this was an ffa with one ally, and no backstabbing, to give some context, long distance to2 is basically that, in its entirety, for one change and one only, no teleport. 




 "Long Distance" To2 with solos and FFA with allies of 1 and no backstabbing are the exact same thing, infact, I've seen some hosts tp allies together before, there has to be a set description for these scenarios, it seems just too common that the two blend together. 




 1: No, I cannot record.
2. Anytime on the weekends or anything from 18:30 - 02:30 UTC
3. Teams, but only due to my inability to record, teaming with players who can would be beneficial. 




 Do you have an alternate ip? I cannot resolve the hostname due to the type of ip this is. 
























 Mine's 16, and I'm the second ranger, what do you want from me? 




 For my own input...

Wolves do not require regen unless you lower their durability, because they are able to 3 shot any dwarf outside, and if they can't be set back by low health, then they will absolutely destroy.

I can see skeletons taking more than one hit, don't get me wrong, but to give skeletons infinite arrows, does two bad things, allows hackers to use auto fire, and gives no hindrance to skeleton assaults, they can just continually push uncontested.

Creepers should not take more than one bow shot, they deal 7 hearts of damage up to 4 blocks away, 3 creepers can destroy a wall, and they can move rather quickly. Super Creepers should NEVER take more than one shot, if they are 4 blocks away from a dwarf under or on equal footing as him, it will just kill the dwarf 99% of the time. 

The digging zombie has enough pick to get through one wall, that is quite enough if you ask me. Really Digging zombies are near useless, since going through a wall doesn't do anything much, so really I think they should be removed.

Spider Kings, afaik, are being removed, and if they aren't, they can take you to half a heart in 20 seconds.

Spiderlings, they have a high maneuverability, so they should be able to dodge hits, not take them. I don't contest higher poison if the spider king is removed, but if it's not, spiderlings can take you to half a heart in 35 seconds, and every time you heal, you delay your mana regen. 




 On Bruce's Gym, the format for the website was nearly the same, and what was on that tab was a server-wide Quest to slay 1,000,000 zombies. I would assume on PMC, the logistics would be the same, and it would be a server wide quest covering some or many of the gamemodes of the server.  




 hopefully as a result, we will get more fictional heroes, that would be awesome, maybe even something like my ShepherdOfFire, but that is tooting my own horn :L 




 mhm, makes me sad :(  




 I do not know myself, I have never seen anything to indicate this, and if it's true, I'm sad I'll never get to be Guude, or have a second change at a one shot bow again :( 




 What other explanation do you need? :P 




 Some cool ideas I had to heroes abilities were like, for instance, Lance's axe would do a ton of damage, and swing really slowly, but when he procs, the mining fatigue becomes haste, and swings incredibly quickly. I had two entire ideas about heroes, because that is what I like to do when I'm bored :L. But I couldn't really tell you who I think would make a good hero, since my ideas are more along the lines of Lance. 




 To elaborate on who all the old heroes were: BruceWillakers, LanceWillakers, GoldfounderPause, CaptainBoulderFist, NisovinsIllusion, Deadbones, LadyKedemonia, and RoaminThePaladin.

* BruceWillakers had possession of Virendra, a bow with Punch 10 and one shotted all monsters except golems, and Excaliju, a weapon with greatly increased damage and proc time.
* LanceWillakers did not have a special weapon, but it is speculated that he will get his (axe?) that he uses in Death Fears Me.
* Pause had a bow that one shots all mobs, like Virendra.
* Guude had Frostshock, which I believe was a chain lightning weapon.
* Nisovin had the Tinder Flame, which was meant to do splash damage, when hitting a mob, but was never completed/fixed, and the Wriggly Wrench, that acted as a melee weapon, and when used on another dwarf, repaired all his armor.
* Deadbones, as you may have guessed, had his EZFIX SLABS, which placed a large temporary wall in front of himself and could also remotely place blocks.
* Lady Kedemonia had the Regrowth Star, which could remotely heal dwarves, and death grip monsters, pulling them to her.
* Roamin had the Holy Purifier. It's a flamethrower.

 The problem with the enderman is that its character model is 3 high, however, because a player model is 2 high, arrows would bounce off its head. DvZ used to use wither skeletons instead of normal ones, but this was changed for that very reason, the character model just didn't work. 




 Thanks for the geegees Ageegee, maybe see you soon sometime, have fun, and good luck. 




 The "Death Zone" has a bit of leverage, it isn't like the instant you pass it you die, it's maybe like a 20 - 30 block range. 




 To add onto the updates of last night, some minor tweaks and changes were made to the game, and one big one:

* Invulnerability has been reduced (10 seconds)
* Creepers **do not** receive invulnerability.
* Wood working has been redone: 1. Torches take significantly longer to make. 2. All wood products are **transmuted one to one** (I.E. One plank = one stick **except in the case of sticks to bowls, which is still one to four**). 3. When a bowl is used in oil, it will produce 4 mortar.
* The only ~~map~~ **maps** at this moment are Mount Willakers, Oasis, and Dogekac as the other maps need to be changed to accommodate multiple shrines. 
* **Multiple shrines have been added:** Instead of one shrine, there are several, which must be captured **in order** (1st, 2nd, 3rd) for the monsters to win. It seems to take **less time to capture** each of these points, and once one is captured, the **monster spawn is moved on to or close to it.**
* A monster **cannot** pass the shrine currently being attacked, else it is struck by lightning, and dies. **I'm unsure on this, but this seems to have broken the "Infection" plague, because the instant the infected turn, they die to the shrine's fail safe.**
* **All maps** now has starting supplies, of about 20 - 40 of mortar, cobble, and torches.
* At least from what I could tell, past shrine 2, monsters that turn into Super Creepers will do so on the spot.

I figured I would write another one of these to go into detail of the changes, but if Rob and Nis would like me to remove/stop these in favor of the Trello list system, I gladly will if they ask. 

* Link to the Trello here: https://trello.com/b/Wi2Di0qF/playmindcrack 

More features, yay! 

* Oasis returns with 2 shrines.
* Dogekac has 4 shrines. 




 Nis actually does not have two items, his bow, the Tinder Flame, does no extra damage, and was originally meant to be AoE, but never was implemented that way. 




 If you look to the Changes thing Rob posted, it's actually a complete change of flow, as seen by the "multiple shrines" card. You can't really have squid when the shrine is outside right infront of you, kinda defeats the purpose. 




 They have been removed due to a new upcoming feature, that I will post about when it is fully instated. 




 I had the purifier in it's overpowered version, and my god, it made zombies melt into it, can't wait to see it return. 




 Thanks Juhdas :P 




 I always liked being Nis, and when I was Nis with Virendra, that was heaven. I in general just like class stuff, I could eat that stuff up all day. 




 So many people won't ever know the satisfaction of killing a dwarf, as a squid xD. 




 I myself do not play as monster that often, but do the golems spawn with their picks? If they do not, then they do not do any more damage than one heart, which is unfortunate. 




 Nisovin, as I stated above, Holy Blades do not do 10 damage, and still do 8. Thanks for the clarification though! :D 




 eh, maybe, I would totally do it for the Hero update though, love that stuff. 




 So, as you may know, DvZ is still a WIP, as heroes are not finished, sounds still need to be added, and new maps are still needed. However, there was another "balancement" update rather than "content" update today, and these are the changes I observed:

* Procs are now limited to within 5 blocks of your person, so basically, **bow proccing is removed.**
* Golems are readded, ~~however, spawn with only a seppuku, so they do not have much of a function other than a walking damage soaker.~~ **They now spawn once again with the ancient pick.**
* **Healing ale now uses 150 mana** rather than 200 from before.
* Mount Willakers has invulnerability added upon monster spawn (18 seconds).
* As of this moment, ~~I did not see any instances of squid (maybe rarer?)~~, ~~wolves (also rarer?)~~, ~~or the map oasis (removed?)~~ ~~and have not played on any map other than Mt Willy to see if they have arrow invul too~~.
* ~~WE GOT FANCY SPECIAL MONSTER MESSAGES, I LOVE YOU ALL.~~ **SPIDER KING MESSAGES ARE MESSED UP, PRAISE REDACTED.**

I myself enjoy these changes, it makes indoor combat easier, shields have more use outside, and spawn camping isn't devastating anymore, at least from what I observed.

As stated by nisovin below: 

* **Sword damage was increased to 10** rather than 8 (~~**PALADINS, USE THE RUNEBLADE, THE HOLY BLADE IS NOT UPDATED**~~ Fixed.).
* All map's invulnerability was increased (18 seconds).
* Squids are, in fact, removed.
* Oasis, is in fact, removed.
* Holy Blades and Longbows are shiny again, keep in mind they **DO NOT** do anything extra, just shine.

In a speculation: (as per substitutemyown): An event, rather it be randomly occurring (most likely this, as if it were a special monster event almost) or admin controlled, that occurs during the day known as the Solar Eclipse will block out the sun, and cause havoc among the dwarves, as the zombies regain their buff.

Side note, I would gladly make more of these if people want, it's kinda fun, always pondered the idea of a constantly changing guide, maybe one day... :P 




 No no, the kills recorded fine, the time the game took did not, which is why my longest game is still about 1:20 and not 1:40 :P 




 My *longest* and *highest total* kills game was a game on Mount Willakers in which SlyiceT100 was Bruce, and the game went on for about an hour and 40 minutes, reached 2700 kills, and didn't even record on my stat page, because I was last to die. However, my *best* game was one that only reached about 1200, but 450 were my hand as Bruce, on Mt Willy. And my most memorable game? I was nisovin....with Virendra, Bruce's bow, the props of a ranger 3 (also, do note, all of these are on the gym :P) 




 Heroes, if there is one thing I want to see, it is demonstration of hero abilities. As well as showing what is more effective at killing mobs, aka no mazes. The basics too, of course, so people don't think procs are hacks and to show bow procs are allowed :L 




 Who plays as monster?

But in all seriousness, I love to be anything that isn't a spider or digging zombie, due to them having the least lethality. 




 it's you're, can't, kyle's, and all your "i"s should be "I"s 




 Maybe I can stop by and say hi :P
 




 It takes a lot to hold up the 4th place title, but maybe sometime I'll stop by. :P 




 That's because I haven't been in one in ages. I've been in another community, and its nice there. Didn't think anyone actually missed me. 




 huh, weird, Its been a long time I guess, not as long as sk8, but a while. 




 ,. 




 I'm not missed either, no worries :P 




 Even if this is lag, a video from Scorpion is going to be posted soon enough of this guy on ttaylorr's, of him literally flying around. 




 Infinite* 




 I love it 




 :3 




 No one even knows me :P 




 I wish I had any. :( 




 Ultra Hardcore, no crafting table usage, and hardcore mode. There is a challenge.

 PA, 6:33 P.M. 




 not much, playing games. listening to music, doing (procrastinating) homework. 




 What's up? 




 Hi o/ 




 Gifted have and A, Math have an A, Spanish have an A, Web Page Design have an A, I'm really not that interesting :P 




 A few years ago we had like 5 of these in our own school a year, it was just bad, luckily they solved the problem, but those idiots took away some of our freedom in the mornings. 




 Shepherd of Fire - Avenged Sevenfold 




 The letter Q 




 Maybe the Back to the Future Trilogy? 




 Rouge - From the Dust or Shepherd of Fire - Avenged Sevenfold, been stuck between the two. 




 Literally anything I listen to I could listen to over and over as long as I initially liked it. It's almost a curse really, I will listen to some monstercat or Avenged Sevenfold and won't listen to anything else for weeks, the flip to the other and have to dig up songs out of my Youtube favorites if I want to listen to them. 




 Check to see if someone logging on has a name longer than 16 characters.  




 There is no need to lower the slot number, someone nicknamed themself over the character limit, just disable /nick. Probably want to clear the player files too, if that guy joins back with the nick he will crash it again.  




 He does :P 




 OMG this is amazing, wonder if you could do that in a game, guess you would need a resource pack for it, but on the DvZ server they have it when you level up a thing flashes on your screen, so maybe its possible. 
























 * ~~Bows in DvZ are not using spell damage, so they're just glorified vanilla minecraft bows, and don't do any real damage.~~
* ~~Roamin is spawned as the Default hero, instead of Bruce.~~
* Armor takes more than one durability per hit from zombies.
* Dwarven Runeblades use the Lightbringer Textures.
* and btw, 30 Dwarf games are still a thing, why? 




 :L I'm just passing by. 




 Throughout time this happens quite a bit, UltraSoftcore had its time, Mystery teams had its time, and right now Cutclean has its. This happens all the time, it will go away eventually.
 




 15 soon 16 




 The server isn't full, why can't I join? :/
 




 possibly whitelist me? IGN: test_subject5099
 




 make sure you are not using 1.7.9 




 As far as I know, this isn't true, what actually happens basically, is if you hit a mob, then hit it twice more, you can 3 shot it, however, if you hit that mob twice, another person must hit it 3 times, because your shots did not hit 3 times in a row to kill it. 




 Disabling gapples and gheads for this could make it even better :P 




 Can't forget MotherNature, or the other one off events like the RiddleMaster or other such events :P 




 Personally I don't even have fun surviving.
 




 and I know that you know this, I'm saying your request isn't really going to be fulfilled, because it's going to be completely overhauled soon anyway :P 




 if you look at the greeting messages, it is not actually out of beta. Power Juice in its current form will never be out of beta, only the upcoming arcade version will be "out of beta". 




 I'm sure when the next update comes, and Power Juice is changed to an Arcade game, then it will be available for all, and the server will no longer be in beta. 




 I've always perceived this rule as: if you are purposely doing something to inhibit anyone's game on purpose, this is bannable, such as putting a roof over someone's head or digging them into the quarry. If it is done as an accident, and they are unaware of the bad their actions cause, I don't think this is bannable. This is my interpretation of the rule, I'm sure others have their own. 




 there won't be another KGM update, as you can see [here](https://trello.com/c/FPXkf3cW/87-wizard-school-tournament) and [here](https://trello.com/c/Dbgnb2OZ/89-classic-golden-monocle). This is because the entire gamemode is being overhauled, and will be completely different. KGM will no longer have leaderboards or titles, but will instead be transferred to WZT or Wizard School Tournament. 




 You killed that player before, and he must have suicided at some point, so you were credited with the kill, even as a zombie. 




 You are mistaken, the one in red is ry1234567 before he changed it to black, the one in the penguin suit is deathbot. What I think is funny is they're not even trying to get the LightBringer, that sword there is Excaliju, Bruce's sword. 




 and Deathbot  




 DeathSeekerJT, part of the DeathSeeker lineage, those who can use the silver blade of Orion, one of the most powerful swords ever created, blinding monsters with it's glint. Only one DeathSeeker can live at a time, and for millennia one family held the DeathSeeker title, until their last heir died and Orion keep. JT was sent to find the sword, and in the process of escaping the keep, found the blade could be used in his hand, becoming the DeathSeeker. (Also has Brenna, a bow acclaimed for it's explosive power, not as cool a story as Orion :P) 




 To take a quote from rob himself, "The masses don't know what they want."
 




 it's been a long time, but i'd love to be in it! :D test_subject5099

 Precisely the reason I left that game.

 3 Thank you :D  




 Me and Yetii were wondering if you do one of her, could you possibly put both of us in it? If it isn't that much of a hassle. :S I don't mean to sound demanding, I love the art, we were just wondering :P 




 They do get damage immunity, however, because their death is by a spell, they can be "tagged" by a player, and when they blow up it registers as a kill. This works for all mobs that die a suicide type of death, like Seppukus. so it appears like they have no immunity if you just looked at kill feeds, but they do have it. 




 ry of the gym beta never forget. 




 Check Rob's twitter, it's there somewhere. 




 I won anyway ^^
 




 Salogel is a part of the cats, and we do not participate in such activities. - JT of the Cats 




 They always tell me to get a room  




 There's a difference between a real argument, as you explained, and a role play argument, as wolfboy explained. 




 Void, if you fall in you just get teleported back to spawn. 




 It's not. 









 You won't be getting that helmet back. 




 And for this, they risk getting banned. This is an exploit, and it is bannable. Warn them, or don't, but they can be banned for having two sets. 




 fixed. Saw some myself, just was took a bit to change it. 




 The protection is not as intrusive now that the creepers you are shooting don't have invulnerability, and the mobs don't drop right on your head, so it isn't as difficult to not walk into the zone. This area technically is still farther than it was when the protection was first introduced, but less than when Nis moved it back.
 




 No, what it means that you can't throw armor, you can't be rearmored ever. You will always have armor in your inventory, unless it all breaks, so you can't be rearmored. RNG is Random Number Generator, how a lot of games make things random. 




 As I stated above, I mean the Diamond armor, any piece. 




 I mean your full set of diamond armor, if you throw it out of your inventory, any piece, it will teleport back into your inventory. Be sure to click around your inventory to find it, and if it doesn't appear, it can take a while to appear. 




 After several Test games run by Nisovin, a very small update was rolled out to Dogekac and Daragor, plus a removal of a certain mob.

* **Dogekac** was known for having a large amount of **holes in the bedrock** to bypass certain areas, such as at the front of the keep, there being holes under the lights, straight to the Inner Shrine. **These holes are now filled in.**
* Speaking of **Inner Shrine**...It **was removed**, there are now two shrines. The Bridge Shrine, and the Final Shrine.
* **Daragor's mob spawn was pushed back**, the tools tables were moved slightly over, and many trees were added abouts the front. The **mob protection is slightly forward**, to about **4 or so blocks infront of the shovel table.**
* ~~Unless the RNG was being very harsh to the **Spider Kings** in the games I played, they are **removed.**~~  *Saw some in a Dogekac game, JT is wroooooooooooooooooooong.*
* **Armor is not throwable anymore**, it will teleport back into your inventory.  ~~This means you CANNOT be rearmored.~~ *Unless, of course, all of your armor breaks.*


* You can now be rearmored if you are missing a piece of your armor, such as a helmet, and it will be re-equipped. No need to drop all your armor anymore. (Thanks Nis!)
 




 My setup:

1. Pot 2. Sword 3. Bow 4. Pot 5. Shield 6. Pick 7. Cobble 8. Glue 9. Torches

The reason I use two pots is because when I played on the UHC reddit, I liked to have pick, sword, bow. So I was never accustom to changing that system and using hotkeys, so I prefer to keep my bow and sword together.  




 Yes! someone else that uses two potions :D 




 Oasis is out of the rotation, and has no indication of returning. 




 Something that I had heard, is that Nohdalag would eventually get flame as an attribute, which doesn't do anything because zombies have fire resistance, but it would look pretty cool. I know this was a planned thing, but never actually put in place. 




 Another Hero idea I had was the ShepherdofFire, a hero that has the Staff of Hellfire, that creates lanes of flame around its target, just to look cool. He also spawns with 5ish one use items, that are very overpowered, but hurt the dwarves too, such as killing all the monsters at once, but also killing a few dwarves, or giving every dwarf a 30 second proc, but unarmoring half the dwarves too. The Shepherd of Fire may have 10 items that he CAN spawn with, but may only relieve 5 or so, making every Shepherd unique. 




 DeathSeekerJT: Uses his own bow, Brenna, a one shot bow that causes the explosion animation and if it hits a block, breaks it. He uses Orion, the silver blade, that deals more damage than a runeblade but not as much as Excaliju, and when it procs, produces large amounts of fireworks that blind the monsters (this may or may not work, depending on if it crashes players or not). Orion is passed down by DeathSeeker lineage, and only one that uses the blade, can have that title, and only one DeathSeeker can exist at one time. 




 That was my idea too D:

 




 This change was today, the 27th, and not yesterday, the 26th. 




 More balancement changes, and reintroduction of an old map.

* Daragor has been readded, using the multiple shrine system, has 3 shrines: the Gate Shrine, the Juice Shrine, and the Final Shrine, each on a layer of the map.
* Armor, when repaired, gives 160 durability per repair, rather than 100 from before.
* When dropped, an armor piece ends up in oblivion, and is gone forever. (Remember, if you require a new set, throw away ALL of your old set.)
* Mount Willakers' shrines were reduced to two: the Courtyard Shrine behind the front wall, and the Final Shrine.
* Each map has a monster spawn debuff/protection, that deals a dwarf nausea and a bit of poison if within the radius. (This has the unfortunate effect of blocking dwarves from the cave on Dogekac, unsure if intentional or not.) The debuff is the same amount of nausea, but the poison starts as a very low amount, and then after about 5 seconds, becomes poison III.
* Dogekac's lobby is no longer destructable.
* **As of the 27th,** Dogekac's shrines were changed as well, to 3 shrines: Bridge, Inner, Final. **THIS IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE** 




 Meh, not for me, but personal thoughts I guess 




 Lost my Pegasus Boots, great day yesterday. :/ 




 The Exact Opposite way JT would be, hooray! 




 Thing is, I would agree if the walls weren't literally behind the shrine you need to take, so once you get through, you die to the shrine field. Maybe with the new shrine placement they will be more useful, but atm, they aren't that good. 




 When the pigs fly and we all spawn with Excaliju, only then. :P 




 Your last point would be extremely cruel, because we just want to play games like anyone else, that's why titles don't have  more powerful weapons (with the exception of the Staff, dealing an extra half heart) so I see no reason why we should be hindered, just because we are titled. There are plenty of people without titles that are better than me, and they wouldn't be hindered. Also, I see no reason to nerf procs, and rob has mentioned before, he will not do any rebalancing until after heroes are reintroduced, but I think procs are fine, in my opinion. 
























 With the Departure of Nisovin and Rob, I will be following and supporting them like I did when I first joined PlayMindcrack. I hope the best for Guude, and I hope that maybe he can do something to keep his server alive too, but at it's core, Nisovin and Rob were PMC, they were the games, and they were AT LEAST half the community, and I will stick by their side, as I have from the start. 




 Well, KGM is under Rob's jurisdiction as well, so I see that going with him, as well as WAT, I presume. Camelot I'm not sure who that's under, as well as RoC and PJT. 




 Noosa - Walk on by (SR   RNG Remix) 




 good job :L
 




 Mexican posted before you, you cannot host at this time without proof of permission. 




 Whitelist will be off at :45, for those that are waiting. 




 Not the time, nor the place, there's another thread you could just have easily said this, and if what rebexer said is true, then you should be less of a hypocrite. 




 Time to go, although, while being known for what you do is nice and all, I wasn't known at all on the gym until I became 10th on the leaderboard, that's when I go noticed. However, even if getting noticed is a good thing to come from the boards, they do so much more damage than good to me, and others, so it seems. The board should be removed, that's my opinion. 




 Honestly, although matt is in a case of ban evasion, he was only banned for bad fellowship, and so he himself is not cheating, and all his kills are legit, as one person, as much as he can play. FWP is not one person, can play any maximum of its time its members are on, and while there isn't modded clients in use as far as we know, and play time is not a bannable by any means, it seems very unsportsman-like to use one single account just for the purpose of bringing someone who got all his kills as one person, fairly, down, just on account of his past ban that doesn't have anything to do with his ability to kill.

tl;dr, Op got his kills as one person, fairly, it's unsportsmanlike to use a group on one account to do the same. 




 Sadly, I would not put it past some people that were once or still are in the community to do these things. Some groups are maliciously toxic, while others are very very nice. The thing is, those that are toxic are sometimes the popular ones, and they are part of the reason I am no longer playing on the server. My situation, as well as another friend of mine's are very similar to your's in terms of falling into a depression. I do not attribute these people alone as the cause of this, but I do site them as partial reason, as well as the boards, and other goings on in my life. It makes me very sad to see a community fall into something like this, but I am happy that someone brought it to light, something I couldn't do. 




 And our top Paladin being a bunch of people on one account is any better? it feels wrong to the community to do that. 




 While I have a personal bias due to people being rude to me in a similar manner, the *penguins* as it were, are known to share many alt accounts. While this on its own is not really against the rules, it is a relatively common occurrence.  




 THAT. IS. PERFECT. I love it :D:D:D:D:D

 says on "blacklist of items" at the bottom
 




 if all the dwarves were in the shrine, that be fine, but if not, you killed all the dwarves that needed to get back in to repair or regen mana or whatnot. 




 He wasn't wrong, blocking off does kill dwarves. You would need more of an explanation to actually be able to convey your point.
 




 Did you actually read the post? It says it right on Team size.
 




 It was 1.5x gold, just a little edit. 




 I miss short games 




 nono, you are correct, they dont show up until those 5 are exausted 




 and patrons do not get double, they get 1.5x 




 FBI's game was posted first 




 I don't enjoy the indoors anymore, but I used to, now it's just about who has the most slabs and the most wrenches, it's not about tunnels anymore. Tunnels are pointless anymore 




 Honestly I have more fun with short and quick games, these new hour and a half long games are basically the reason I quit, they give me such a bad headache.

PS: Why is this downvoted? are you serious? It was a statement, my god.

PSS: This community is so broken now, all these downvotes on Mae's statements even though he is just trying to show his point, quite sad guys. People have opinions, they aren't necessarily wrong, and he has no reason to be downvoted. 




 Longer and more kills does not necessarily mean more fun. 




 It's unfortunate this is so downvoted, as you seem to have the same problems with the game now as I do, and it is the reason I have quit.

edit: lol, ironically being downvoted for a statement about downvoting. 




 Could I join?
 




 May I ask what IrishBrawler (on the 2nd to last picture) is saying, what's that supposed to mean? of course, only if you know, by chance. 




 You all think this is a joke, it's not. 




 The special weapons do not give any bonus damage or any other buff, they merely have a different name and shine.
 




 Hasn't gotten any better really. 




 The boards to me have done so much more damage then ingame, and I want them gone so badly. 




  Milky Way
 




  Server Info: this server is a 4GB server hosted in PA, USA, North America, Earth, Milky Way.

But which Universe and Dimension?
 




 but it has nothing to do with what's happened in game, people just focus others based on personal grudges.  




 I myself lost the whole team feeling when people started to form their own little groups and hold certain people up higher than others. It makes people not in these groups plain feel like crap as they're not included and sometimes discriminated against. Can't say you feel like you're on a team when someone on that team punches out your torches because they don't like you, or let their friends that are mobs just focus you all game.

 No, the upgrade was removed because the armor system is going to be revamped.

 Still think my hero idea for the ShepherdofFire from the link TetrixxYT has below would fit into the DvZverse nicely.
 




 You can actually make these yourself, simply going into your server textures file, changing the playmindcrack one into the same format as a resource pack, and then replacing the files from the resource pack of choice with the playmindcrack ones with the items you wish to change. 




 Magma Cream Represent!
 




 Alpha Gym Represent!
 




 You may think PlayMindcrack is unlikely to go down, but it's predecessor, Bruce's Gym, which used the same systems and had a lot of fans too, could not operate due to the low amount of donations, and was abandoned. Donators are more likely to donate if they have incentive, even if that incentive is only silly and fun. Getting nothing doesn't bode well for servers, and it won't. 




 What happens when you have servers like PlayMindcrack, that is coded and run by someone with a loyal fanbase, that wont work anywhere else, because they actually own the rights to a lot of the minigames? These servers are run for hundreds of dollars, you can't expect one man with all that money to all of a sudden run a server. 




 People already do.

 You obviously don't know Yetii 




 Could be OldManWillakers, Rurikar22, nisovin, and Jintozen, or really any of Rob's alts 




 NOPE, AMAZINGLY CUTE, THANK YOU

I fight because I find myself obligated, but when the fights are boring, and I relive my losses, I quit, and give my memories, as well as protect the sword I am sworn to, Orion. 




 But I can't be lost forever, sadly, our world for whatever reason doesn't allow us to do that. We end up as failures, I just want to go before I end up that way in the end :/
 




 I would do things I liked to do, if it wasn't for the fact all I likedcto do was things with her. I can't help anyone, anyone I try to help just ends up hating me in the end, I just don't want
 to do that to people anymore, to hurt anymore, I just want to be gone :/ 




 I'm a rather depressed person. For about 5 years of my life, I felt lost, without anything to aim for in my life but maybe a chance I could find a reason. And then, one day, after a bit of time, I found that reason.

I found her.

And I know what you're thinking, he's going to kill himself over a girl, it's not worth it, I know that.

She was more than a girl, she was my reason to live.

We met eachother through a game, we lived across an ocean from eachother. We loved eachother, but we had issues with what we did by ourselves. Me much more than her. I cause breaks like this with everyone. I don't have friends, I don't know where to get help, I was sent to a mental hospital, it fixed nothing, my following therapist, nothing.

I am talking here, because I had no friends. Everyone I have ever talked to has one way or another turned out to hate me. I just wanted someone to talk to, that's all. I have little hope, but I need to know if someone, anyone out there cares about who I am for more than just a human, for me, JT.

And if there is not, then may there be salvation beyond.

 I personally got to see the Kraken about a year ago, and I can dig up screenshots at your request, no video though. 




 I walked into the room, instantly feeling a sense of, *emptiness* in the room. It was clearly lit by the full panel windows along the walls, but the light didnt reach the back recesses, to the staircase. It was nearing night, and patrol would need to start again to keep the monsters out. It had been a few days since the last attack, and the pink sky out the window seemed to fully encompass that bliss that many of them had been feeling. They were still warned however, to not go beyond the shrines reach, because if they do and die out there, they would not have the shrines timewarp ability, and they would be eternally doomed to a death of nothingness. 

I sat down in the chair outwards from the table, and had a look around. The room was mostly bare, but bookcases lined the walls that the windows did not. Books filled with history and knowledge of the Dwarves past and even before that, before the calamity. These books and this house held the utmost importance to this outpost, as this was home to the second oldest living dwarf, and not only was he the ancient in his status, but he is also ancient in name. He is the last surviving titled warrior of the dwarves, a practice that was ceased a long time ago, after one certain title was killed beyond the shrine. After that title died, The Old Man never titled another dwarf again, realizing that giving these warriors titles and then losing them was causing more morale loss among the dwarves than needed, and was unnecessary. 

Slowly, more and more of the remaining titles were lost to the place beyond shrine jurisdiction, and eventually that left one. At 23 dwarven lifetimes, he is only four lifetimes younger than The Old Man himself, and because of this, he experienced much of the important events that had befallen the dwarves. So, this dwarf, was forever to have the occupation of The Rememberer, which has now become his name, as no other name seems to fall upon him. His job was to answer the dwarves any questions they might have that could pertain to the past and all events in it to his knowledge. 

Thats what I was here for, I had vaguely heard rumors and seen inscriptions of one certain topic in particular and I had come to ask The Rememberer if he knew its origin or meaning. The question befell on me each night when I saw a vision of the inscription each time I shut my eyes, of the bright blade that shone brighter than all others, but was not that legendary sword of the Old Mans , but was another, beside his, with another name below it.

While in thought, a small, quiet voice asked me, Yes, Jimmy, what are you here for? What is it that you seek to learn?

He slowly walked to me, with a cane in hand, and sat in the chair infront of mine. He sat there, giving me a questioning gaze with that bright blue eye of his. He only had one, the other was lost lifetimes ago, in another battle; no one had asked. He had one rule about questions of the past, no dwarf was to ever ask about *him* and his involvement in dwarven lore, and so the mystery of his eye and his title are known to very few surviving dwarves, and they do not utter a single word. 

I quickly composed myself and as fast as I could asked the question that was burning inside my mind, Who was; The Deathseeker?

Excuse me son, what was that? He asked, as if completely dumbfounded that such an audacious question could befall upon him.

Well, sir, I had been seeing some visions of an inscription I saw a little bit ago

I dont need backstory, he interrupts, just ask the question again.

Well, who was the Deathseeker?

He sat there for a few moments, and put his face in his hands, for several minutes he sat in silence, and then very quickly outbursted, I dont know what youre talking about, Im sorry, I dont have that information, goodbye.

Dont you think they have a right to know, JT? a soft, low voice said. Across the room near the door stood none other than the General himself, OldManWillakers.

No, Bruce, they dont, it need not concern them and theres no reason to lose more lives because of a dumb prophecy. The longer they dont know, the better. The Rememberer said, very quickly and coldy to the General. It had surprised me to hear him say The Old Mans first name, something no other dwarf had ever said and lived to say again.

Just because you refuse to use its power because of your loss does not mean another Deathseeker cant after you. There is no reason to be withholding this information from them, it doesnt hurt them to know, if they want to know, tell them. She was important to me too, you know The Old Man said.

It doesnt hurt them not to know either Bruce, so what does it really matter? And please, dont talk about her. The Rememberer said, almost moving to tears over his last statement.

I began to tune out their bickering as it seemed not to be going anywhere important, just endless arguing, so I began to look about the room some more. Something I had appeared to miss now shone from the falling sun, up against the wall by the staircase was two very unique items. One of them I very clearly recognized, was the bow known as Brenna, used by the Ranger JT, who had supposedly fallen many lifetimes ago, one of the first to fall. However, he did note that Bruce had called The Rememberer JT, and no one had ever asked about JT specifically in the past, it was possible that the dwarf standing before him was JT himself, but it didnt change much if he was, beyond the name. 

The other weapon however, was more curious. A shiny Silver Blade sat in a glass case, and I couldnt look directly at it, as the shine off of it made it nearly impossible to do so. Its shape was not unlike that of the Dwarven Runeblade, yet, slightly bulkier. It did not have the same bend of a holy blade, this sword was much different from them.

The Old Man and JT seemingly stopped arguing, with The Old Man walking up to me, saying The Rememberer here has agreed to give you your answer, but I am going to give it to you.

The Deathseeker is a legendary hero of the dwarves, able to unlock the power of a sword nearly as powerful as Excaliju; Orion, the Silver Blade.

I glanced back over at the case, this sword seemingly to fit the description.

This blade could blind the monsters with its shine, and cripple them from escape, allowing for an easy powerful swing to end their undead lives. Only one Deathseeker can live at one time, and when one passes, another can then realize his potential with the Blade. The Old Man explained.

However, the last Deathseeker to be known did not use the Blade, and instead kept its knowledge from the dwarves for thousands of years, as well as hiding its prophecy and inscriptions.

The current Deathseeker is the man that stands before you, and that is his blade, in the case, never to be used until he passes

Never to be used again, I hope. JT interrupts.

You wasted your ability to use that blade, you could have helped purify so many places and you wasted it. Bruce sternly said.

Because that sword gives nothing but trouble, and I wanted nothing to do with spreading its curse to others. JT retaliated.

The curse is a small price to pay for power. Bruce said.

It wasnt a small price JT trailed off, seemingly on the break of tears, Get out Jimmy, thats the story, now leave. 

I got up and left the room, heading out back to my barracks to start my shift on patrol, and think over what I just learned.  
 
























 Well some of the maps are not in the works though, as they had critical flaws to them, if you happened to get this information for maps off the wiki, sorry for not updating that page recently, I had been doing it for a while. 




 Met Yetii during the gym, and she's my best and maybe only friend and I love her  ^ ^  




 Well, except that some of the maps you named were never added to the rotation, like arkansium and Elbe, etc 




 Bellows is one of my all time favorites, as well I did kinda like Plains, as boring as it was, but no molgan, NEVER molgan 




 GammeX^see^I'm^funny but seriously probably Del, Dans, and Audicy 




 i just preferred if the map makers did their own lore for the map they made, rightfully so. And you're welcome, i did my best! :P 




 a need for spacing became something much more beautiful in the end :P 




 were you looking to add in the lore to the map yourself? 




 Were you still looking to make the lore for the map when you get the chance? 




 I like it a lot! I'll edit a few grammatical errors in tense, but other than that I like the story!

Edit: I also used your screenshots from the original map thread for the slideshow, hope that's alright! 




 Well, I mean, the facts could be wro ng, but instead of telling me, why not change it yourself? :) The person that made the system for map lifespans made a basic one that works, but you could always change it! 




 Its stuff I came up with, and kinda just needed it to fill the space needed by the slideshows for each map. I suppose they can just be replaced by map showcases or something, just need it for formatting purposes. 









 And I do :/ 




 And I do :/ 




 And I do :/ 




 Just a quick correction, there were 4 heroes max in a default game 




 I just, feel so useless, that I'm not really good or even decent at anything, that I'm just shit at everything and only hurt people :/ 




 No, just, games I like are kinda lack luster as of late because all I want is to die :/ 




 Sandboxes are fun, I just wish I liked other stuff, I just don't like anything anymore, everything just turns to death for me :/ 




 well the glass on Hidden Valley only broke from Blaze Cannons, and after that it was just poor bedrocking, so if I do the Bedrock correctly, no worries 




 ~~I thought it meant that he wanted to lower the player count so a game starts every ten minutes, but you could be right as well.~~ edit: as well as not commenting to the right person, Rob and Nis proved me wrong on the most recent update. 




 The only difference between my pack and the DvZ one is the 32x32 textures, dunno if it would be that different. 




 It is, but I made this in a few hours, so hey, why not see if its worth redoing. 




 Well, it shouldn't look that different, the only difference between my pack and the DvZ one is the 32x32 textures. 




 Probably not, but its not that they're that important anyway. 




 The map essentially lacks two very, VERY important things, bedrock, and a front. I do realize that these two things are pivotal to the actual playing of the map, but I threw this together and just wondered if it was worth the hassle at all, so I'd like to know! 









 Shooters and Indies, sometimes open worlds, not much else though :/ 




 Just video games :/ 




 I just, dont have determination to be strong like that :/ 




 Just being worse and worse in my depressive state :/ 




 Just who I am is utter shit and I can't fix it. 




 I do enjoy the escape sleeping brings, but it can also bring terrible nightmares, I never have trouble sleeping, just hope I never wake up. 




 Distractions never really distract me, the feel comes back fairly quickly or while I'm doing the thing :/ 




 I honestly have very few people to talk to, and I'm just on the brink of giving out :/ 




 I just can't fix any of my own problems, no one can. 




 I just, don't want to be around anything anymore, I want to be how I feel, nothing.
 




 I do listen to them, all the time, but I never really can do much for them :/
 




 I think I'm going to smash my laptop though 




 I have, but more into the PvP stuff myself. 




 I like minecraft, but beyond that, it's just shooters and indies. 




 I'm not a big fan of sports, love video games though, really my only hobby. I watch doctor who and the walking dead as well. 




 Pretty much, except I get worse and worse as the process goes on. 




 I just, really don't have much to say, just want to die. 




 Many people cared, they all said they'd never leave me. They all left me, I am beyond hated. 




 Well, I am a bad person myself, and I cannot be forgiven. 




 I really don't think anyone could ever like me. 




 I just, always need someone to talk to, to the point I get annoyed if someone is doing something else and can't talk to me. That's why I understand I'm terrible, because it's wrong I get annoyed by that, people should do what they want, but I just can't stand being alone.

People that never met me dislike me, just, I guess because of my immediate impression. 




 All these people tell me they care about me, that they like me and say I'm a good person. Then, weeks, sometimes days gone by, they hate me, they like nothing about me. People that never really met me hate me, no one can stand how I am and what I do, and I only blame myself. I'm pushy and needy and everyone hates it. 




 I sit here, and I keep thinking of ways I can kill myself, I try my everything to find a way, and there have been several. I posted before, yesterday even, and I still have nothing but want to die. I'm still just sorry to all those people I hurt emotionally, and I hate how terrible a person I am. All I want, and all I need, is to die, the world would lose nothing by it. 




 I honestly cannot have a friendship or relationship with anyone, I'm just that terrible. 




 I have gone to a hospital once, I only found it to drive myself worse. I never find hope for anything in the world, and I'm tragically ironic. I dislike most people, I like few, they become my reason for the world, and then they hate me because of how I am, and I'm terrible. I have been this way for years, and I honestly just give up, and I'll figure out a way to fix it.  




 I am not, in any way, a good person. Everyone tells me that the first time they see me, everyone tells me they were wrong in a very short time. 




 But nothing would ever smile back at me, I do nothing but drive people to anger. 




 This post is more located here for the fact I can't put it in a place people know me because it would be rude and against guidelines.

I've posted here before, I've given up before, and I find no guarantee I will kill myself today, but I sure really want to and will think of a way to. I don't find hooe in the world, as I'm lonely and destructive in friendships, and most people end up hating me. I'm sorry to all those that I hurt, especially her, and I'm sorry that I was such a stupid ugly person that only annoyed others.

I'm sorry. 




 Its nice that guys like you exist, and are able to be a light of friendship and hope to others, when some of us just, have no hope left, like myself :'/ 




 I sadly have, just never works out, and I always ruin it, whether I try to change or not :/ 




 Just happens people dont like my company. 




 It comes back to that thing where I feel like I hurt people more than I could give them. :/ 




 No, not really, I just play by myself :/ 
























 This isn't funny at all, in anyway, you sir are sick. 




 It be better for everyone I know if I did. 




 The update hasn't released, the beta-testing period of the update has been opened to super jimmys, there's quite a big difference. 




 You know all the unfair things that happen to people that they die? Like car crashes and fires and muggings? I'd take one of those so someone else didn't have to. I think that would be the best for everyone. 




 Sometimes I think that hole though will be for the better, that all I do is hurt.

I affect things, but not positively.

It would be for the better. 




 I have gone to a mental institution for 8 days, and I can say without a doubt that they were the worst days of my life. I actually fear my home phone ringtone because I'm afraid they're going to take me back.

I wouldn't be here if I had nothing to lose. I'd be gone, but I'm afraid of failing and going back to a place I feel was worse than hell. I'm here, talking to all of you because I want so badly to just have something happen to me, but couldn't do it to myself.

I don't know what to do. 




 It's not the best option though, not from what people say. The best option is to end my suffering and everyone's qualms with me. It's not fair to anyone for me to know how painful I am but still inflict myself on others.

The best option would for me to just never have existed in the first place. 




 Anything I say or do is wrong. People get angry at what I say and do in general and I don't know what I do is wrong, just that it as a whole is, I yet don't understand. I've just accepted my entire existence is the problem, and most people agree.

It's just that though, I'm lazy, or selfish, or something but I just can't help people, but feel like shit that I can't. I've pretty much determined the best way to help people is to not exist at all in my case. 




 I care about others yet can't do anything for them but bring anger and frustration. The only way for me to seriously help people is to get rid of the problem I am. 




 Doing my part consists of being out of everyone's and everythings lives.

I have honestly tried to change myself but it turns out the same, the pain and anger generator I am. It doesn't change the bad I do. 




 Alone in how I am? No.

But alone in people that care about me? Yes, even I don't care about me.

I just want people to have the best, but I don't do anything good for people and if I didnt exist it would honestly make the world better off. I fit in nowhere and ruin everything.

I'm not fit to be around people, they deserve this punishment. 




 I don't. I don't fit in yet I'm not interesting. I honestly just make people mad and I'm terrible to talk to. I can't do anything for people but I want everyone to have the best from me, and the only real way to do that is to not exist. I couldn't care less about myself, I just want others to be better off. 




 The person I most looked to in the world has told me they're better off without me, as most people do when they speak to me over time. I don't fit into the world, I don't have a place, and I just make people angry and hate me. I'd make the world better by simply not existing. What am I supposed to do, make people suffer my presence? It doesn't seem right. 




 Before I got a fan to put under it, my skin would actually blister and melt to my laptop, so that was always fun. 




 It doesn't seem to matter if I admit and regret it, people still end up always hating me. 




 No, but who I am is pretty indicative of who I'll be later in life, someone completely hated by anyone he talks to even for short amounts of time. And to me, that tears me apart. 




 Search for what though? What is there even to search for? I could never be truly happy knowing all I do is cause pain for people. 




 I've poster here before about all the bad things I am and feel. And I still believe them. But I had one person I thought I could trust and talk to and they betrayed me too when I was at my weakest. I'm broken and hurt and feel like I don't have a place in the world. What am I supposed to do. 




 You do know there was an "official release" of the Gym, which was coined as season 1 by Rob? Just something of note. 




 Well that's just what I name it character lore wise, but yes, two :p 









 Well thank you! I learned how to write really from one specific class, up until then I didn't really know and I'm much better off for it.

The best thing to do is practice though! And thank you again! 




 Nice to have more map makers put their own lore on the wiki, I hope mine was okay until you did your own. 




 I had thought it was the elves that were thriving, but could be wrong. 




 May I ask, why the unsatisfaction? 




 I awoke with a jerk.

Today was the day, the day I would finally get to ask Lord Willakers my question. He was returning today after going to H'cet to assess the damage the elves had inflicted.

Long ago, Lord Willakers ruled over an area within a land called Dong Dank; a place filled with dwarves that acted like all sorts of races, but the pure would reside in the Dwarven District, which he ruled. However, ages ago this place fell into disarray, with warring factions and accidental destruction plaguing the land, Willakers set out for a new homeland for his dwarves.

In his travels, he came upon what we now call a shrine. Hidden deep within the Chocolate Mountains, it had a sort of allure to it, a glow and a power that made him feel stronger and more agile. Finding no adverse effects, he would return to Dong Dank and would make an announcement: all the dwarves that wanted to live in general peace, come with him.

Most of Dwarven District did, with a few from the other districts coming as well. They would build a stone keep in those mountains, centered around the shrine they now praised. This is where I am now; Mount Willakers.

I sprung from my spot on the floor to my feet and put on my boots. We don't have much for commodities here but I was able to fasten myself a pair after collecting bits of leather for weeks. I headed outside the great entrance and looked out into the field. Around the entrance we had a wall, and past that, a camp filled with makeshift tents and campfires. You would think we hadn't been here long, but in fact, we've been here ages.

My great-great-great-etc. grandfather came here from the Dwarven District, and I was raised here in Mount Willakers. Our infatuation with the shrines seemed to halt all other progression of our construction, and so we've lived in a camp of tents for centuries. Being one of the original dwarven families however, I was able to sleep inside, which was a treat, as the weather we've been having recently was rather dreary.

Out into the distance I saw the source of our blight in recent times, as storm so black we thought it may have been bugs instead of clouds. It had been swirling for weeks and stayed just to the edge of the field, by the hills at the front. I walked over and found myself a chair, it wouldn't be long before Willakers arrived.

Slowly a crowd would build by the outskirts of the field, awaiting his arrival. Many dwarves adored the Old Man, and while I could say I did, at the same time I was not infatuated with him. He was a dwarf, same as us all, more powerful yes, but just dwarf all the same. After a few hours, I finally spotted him, coming over the hills with his companions; Nisovin, another Lord of Dong Dank, but also the last known Gnome of his time, and Roamin, a rank 11 paladin that was a descendant of the Lord of Brickton.

A path formed between the dwarves for them. Fearing the Old Man's death stare, they knew they had to step out of the way, or be made to. I stayed where I was, I was in no rush, as Willakers would of course remember that it was my turn for a question, an inquiry, and that I would not have to bother him with such petty reminders.

But he didn't, he walked by with his group of gawkers and proceeded to the entrance.

"Well, maybe he did just forget, he is rather busy." I muttered to myself, grudgingly. 

I walked up behind him as he observed the group of dwarves around him, and tapped him on the shoulder.

"YOUNG DWARF, YOU DARE TOUCH ME." He bellowed, with genuine anger in his voice.

"Well, Mr. Willakers, it's just..." I said, trailing off.

"JUST WHAT, WHAT COULD BE SO IMPORTANT YOU TOUCH ME?" He yelled, louder this time.

"Well, today is my question day, and you just, wandered by, is all." I said to him, half shaking.

"Oh, I see, I'll be right with you, sit back over there." He pointed at the seat I had been in.

I put my head down and walked back, sat and observed him. He dismissed his two companions and talked to a few dwarves before he walked over to me, and pulled over a chair.

He sat down and produced a flask of juice from his pocket, swigging it and then putting it back.

"H'cet survived, barely. They've begun to rebuild and this time, will better protect their shrine." 

I stayed quiet. It did intrigue me, these other shrines. Long after Mount Willakers was founded, other dwarves would venture out and discover more, and under the Old Man's guide, would build more keeps around them to protect them from any attacking force. H'cet was one of these, a smaller one, but extremely fortified as it sat right at the edge of Elf land.

"Well, I suppose I should get going quickly, so, what is your question?" He asked, before preparing to stand up.

"Yes sir, of course, well I wanted to know if...." 

BOOM. A lightning strike from the storm beyond, but not just a normal weather occurrence, this was blinding, even for the Old Man. After my eyes readjusted, I gazed out and saw a new anomaly in the sky. 

A dark cloud? No, it looked, like a ship. 

"Dear God, I knew this day would come." Willakers said under his breath.

"We have until nightfall. GET THE WEAPONS READY, FORGE ARMOR, BUILD A WALL, WE NEED THIS PLACE READY FOR WAR, NOW." He screamed out, so that all dwarves could hear.

I was dumbfounded, I had never seen such a structure before and nor had many of the other dwarves, but I did as the Old Man said. I found myself a juice, a runeblade, and a shortbow, and got to work. I was given armor and fletched arrows until nightfall.

We all stood at the edge of the massive forward wall we erected, stretching halfway across the field.

Beside me, another dwarf would remark "I feel kinda sick.", with a few others around making moans and one falling over.

All of a sudden, my comrade fell flat, and then, within seconds, would spring back up, with his flesh falling from his face and armor shedding off, he began to run at me, maw wide open.

Practicing long ago with a sword and bow, I knew the basics of their function but not much else. I swung wildly at him, successfully pushing him back so he could not bite me, and instead ran after another dwarf. After some time, these "zombie" dwarves would drop dead, and dissolve into the ground.

But this wasn't the worst, floods of monsters, ranging from zombies to wolverines were springing from the ship and decending upon the land. We would do our best to defend against them, shooting and swinging at whatever wasn't dwarf. Many of our men began to realize that our blades and shovels had magical properties, that they could roll and "proc" monsters in quick succession after killing one. Using this to our advantage, we would push back the monsters many times to their ship, but when night fell, they pushed back. Hard.

We would be driven back to the inner wall, then the inside entrance, and eventually we found ourselves in the halls, tandem sword fighting and proccing anything that moved. We could hold, but not forever, and eventually we were pushed into the shrine room itself.

The shrine's light, while empowering us, was beginning to dim, as more and more monsters piled in, until finally, it gave way, and after a thunderous BOOM. I found myself without weapons or armor, and suffered a quick death.

Or did I?

I then woke up, found myself on the floor of Mount Willakers once more, with Willakers shouting at the men to armor up and build a wall to defend against the zombie hordes.

"Oh no, not again." I said, with a sigh.

It's endless. 




 **Weapon:** Orion

A "silver" sword that does 15 attack damage and blinds mobs, making them slowed. The glint of the blade is was blinds them, its very bright. This sword is weilded by the Deathseeker, a dwarf with immense power, as he is the only one that can use it.

**Weapon:** Brenna

Its mine. A bow that has such a graceful "twang" when she fires, she pierces the hearts of mobs with double damage, and a spurt of fire erupts around the mob for a second. 




 Praise be the ranger god. 




 Brenna got stuck in a time loop in Oasis for me until we moved realities, hooray wierd timelines! 




 Did he snipe from afar? 




 I went on the DvZ server lobby for 10 seconds and in that time you talked in chat 5 times and had 2 people tell you off. 

You are literally as dense as lead. 




 I can say with certainty that it doesn't really bother any DvZ players and that /u/awesomeshafter in no way represents any sort of opinion DvZers have.

We honestly don't like him. 




 /unjerk

Can you not? He has an opinion, good or not, you don't have to burn him at the stake.

Edit: and I meant that referring to producing an IP, people should never assume anonymity, even if they are entitled to it

/jerk

BURN HIM WITH TORCH 




 He means it sounds like a previous map's name, if you would like to see the names of old maps, look [here](http://dwarves-vs-zombies.wikia.com/wiki/Maps) 




 When I played UHC often, I adored beast, it brought a smile to my face when I saw him in game, when he messaged me. I thought he was an awesome guy, its terrible to see him gone. RIP good buddy 




 When I played UHC a lot, I adored beast, he was always kind and funny. I'm so sorry for your loss, RIP 




 Don't forget the screams. The screams... 




 Nostalgia does not always need to be the best maps, nostalgia can also come from maps like Erebor and Bellows and Molgan too, just to add. 




 Back when he still existed, Pause was the most fun to me, one simple weapon that suits my playstyle, was cool :p. Bruce now, just because Roamin is too easy and bland and I don't like nisovins abilities, just personal preference. 




 It used to be 7 on the gym, that's probably where that came from. 




 No, its not, its spelled YetiiWho92

Edit: ah, my apologies, reflexes

 Is there something wrong with asking for art if people offer it? I love the art I get! 




 That would be awesome! Thank you for taking the time, you didn't have to  ^ ^

 I like it, thank you! 




 XD that's great, thank you :p 




 He didn't create them, all the weapons are from Hypixel's Warlords, and so all he did was reassign the textures to different items. 




 I submitted that, I have not asked her if she wants to play, as it slipped my mind last night, but I submitted it with my name on the off chance she did. If she doesn't, its not like she can't be removed later.

Edit: Also, if at any point someone freaks out she comes on, she won't play, so keep that in mind. 




 This sir, makes me happy, I love it! Thank you  ^ ^  




 Very impressive sir, I like it :p, thank you :D 




 Just me and a friend :p 




 Thank you :P 




 Bellows didn't have armor tables, so yes, we did start with armor like that. 




 Niiiiiiice, thank you! 




 Very nice, thank you :p 




 You sir, are an amazing artist, I thank you a thousand fold  ^ ^  




 Redraw these bows, please? http://m.imgur.com/J41pq4E http://m.imgur.com/a/T82UV   




 Creepy face :L, but looks great! Thank you  ^ ^  




 Nah man, any art someone draws for me is always more than enough, thank you ^^ 




 XD love it 3 




 XD that's amazing  




 :P well thanks for the previous one! 




 They're more personal to me then you might think :p 




 XD sorry, didn't see the name, I always keep the username of the guy that made the art handy, sorry I didn't realize XD, but truly, this is amazing art, I love it :P 3 




 Different, yet, charming! Thank you :p 




 Thank you! You're quite good at pixel art! 




 Sorry I didn't get to you earlier, her slumped against him might be nice, or her sitting down and him laying in her lap, either is nice, but its not terribly important 




 OMG ITS SO GOOD, THANK YOU SO MUCH  ^ ^  




 XD love it
