 Don't you dare. 




 Thanks much. 




 Headunits, speakers, subwoofers, receivers, amplifiers, harnesses: I don't get it. Can anyone easily explain all this stuff to me or link me to an article that walks you through what each unit contributes? Making a car sound nice is confusing stuff.  




 Funny that would happen right after "The Gang Desperately Tries to Win an Award".  




 I clicked the picture without looking at the subreddit, and prayed that I was in /r/cringepics. 




 Is this still a Guy Ritchie thing? 




 I was at a Chili's (chain restaurant). We had just ordered a desert when the guy in front of us starting violently projectile vomiting all over his table and the aisle and all surrounding tables. Eventually the ambulance showed up and took him away. He never stopped vomiting. Worst part: we were in an alcove and he was blocking the way out, so we were trapped behind him, with our food and table puke-drizzled, for a good 15 minutes.  




 Yeah she was a bit mental. 




 Once when I was in middle school, I had an english teacher who was always getting on to me about leaning back in my chair. I didn't purposefully do it, it was just a bad habit. But after like the 5th time she had to tell me not too, she flipped out and threw a mug across the room and yelled at me saying that she wished I would fall over and crack my head open and shatter my skull because that would make me learn my lesson. She ranted on for a good 3 minutes before she just left the classroom. Everyone just kind of sat there and stared at me for a few minutes before we left. 

The next day she called me into her office and calmy, but very angrily, asked if I had been going around the school telling everyone that she said she wanted me to get brain damage and die (which she did), and I had to explain to her that considering she yelled at me in front of the entire class for five minutes, there was a good chance that I wasn't the only one that heard her wishes. She started grinding her teeth and shaking and told me to leave, and as soon as the door shut I heard her start hitting her desk and trying to hold in her screams.


Later that year, she tried to get me suspended/expelled for racism and called me in front of the principal and religion teacher and a bunch of other staff to discuss this, and they all realized she was talking out of her ass. I left that school after that year, but turned out she had some mental issues. She was fired the next year for assault with a deadly weapon (not in the classroom or anything). Her mugshot was hilarious. Always wanted to visit her in prison.  




 Why does this have thousands of downvotes? 




 What is your first major memory? 




 That's in all high school classrooms. 




 He didn't. 




 I recently worked on a movie he starred in. I wasn't very important at all but he treated me like the director whenever I talked to him. Really nice guy as far as I'm concerned.

Oh good.

 They switched Skylar's and Walter's hands. Check the lighting. 




 I saw an outtake from the scene where Mac's dad was talking to Mac and Charlie about filling up their butts with heroin and they couldn't get through it because they were laughing too hard. What other scenes have been hard to get through without cracking up? 




 Who on the show is most like their character? 




 http://imgur.com/1RgjbxV I nominate Andy Milonakis to play Frank in some kind of flashback. They're the same size and everything. 




 Yeeeeeah... I'm going to go ahead and call bullshit.  




 I love you.  




 I wasn't aware this was a thing. I should have known this was a thing. 









 That's the movie I thought you were talking about, but Not Rated is VERY different from PG. Not Rated means the it was not taken the MPAA to be rated. That movie would be NC-17. 




 ...what PG movie has a real blowjob? 




 Well, he passes here. Still not too happy with it but we'll see. 




 Great. Now I want a hamburger. Thanks alot, OP.

 That guy with the kid looked so confused and appalled.  




 This is so inaccurate. There were no exclamation marks in Max Payne 3.  




 Did you ever find out what was wrong with the kid or the family? Just mental problems or something?

 They should have gotten Jonathan Banks (Mike from Breaking Bad) to play Richard. 




 It wasn't staged. These judges are just programmed to overreact to everything that happens, and the producers let the worst go on as long as possible.

 What's your favorite movie? 




 Unhealthy food is cheaper to produce than healthy food. Even now, buying an organic, locally grown apple is far more expensive than a regular apple grown in Mexico.  




 Also, the sticky notes Hank was using in his research were yellow. 




 Yes. Healthy food would become 10x more expensive than unhealthy food. 




 Love how he just casually throws out "making a transition of authority to me" 




 You photoshop like a god. 




 Spike Lee is a racist, egotistical megadouche. Plain and simple. 




 Well, sure.

 On the other hand, I met Macklemore in the NBA store in NYC two or three days ago. Dude seemed really sad and didn't say a word as I asked for a picture. Made me feel like a bit of an asshole for asking although I've been a huge fan for a while. He was all alone and looked tired as shit.  




 Please tell me that was some kind of essay you had already written and not just a reddit comment.

 I don't think this will happen, but it's not always necessarily about bringing something new. Especially after finding so much success with Craig, I doubt they'd want to bring in someone completely different after his run is over.

 I remember this guy. He used to be full of cringe and bullshit. He would make videos where he drank two bottles of vodka with no hands in 45 seconds and crazy stuff like that, and then he would upload videos saying he would never upload a drinking video again, swearing on his mother's grave. Then he would upload two more and delete the last video. Also he ran for that "KingOfTheWeb" thing where the winner would get some cash prize, and Shoenice had a smear campaign where he would trash the people who were beating him (usually teenaged make-up gurus), and he would encourage his fans to cheat and make multiple accounts to vote for him, and then he freaked out when he was banned. I used to message back and forth arguing with him and he would constantly lie and brag about his YouTube money and how he was so much better than me because he was making his living eat glue on street corners for YouTube. It was pretty funny, and pretty sad.

 Oh yeah. One of my favorite "mind-fuck" movies. 




 Se7en is one of my favorites. Looks like im watching TGWTDT. 




 I have a kid in my class who talks like doge in public.

Everyone hates him. 




 If you are in for a longer ride and have Netflix, watch the BBC series "Luther" starring Idris Elba. Judging by the movies listed, we have similiar taste. I promise it wont let you down. It's incredibly well acted, written, and directed, and has some amazing cases and killers. The last two episodes of season two were up there with Se7en and Prisoners. Really good stuff. 




 The Strangers is the cheesiest horror movie ever. It makes no sense and it sucks. 

That came across very terse and rude. I just have strong opinions about how shitty that movie is. 




 He says, having already clicked on a close up photo of the gaping head of a penis.  




 You wouldn't need to.  




 Philip Seymour Hoffman was. Not just saying that because he just passed, but the man made great choices with his roles. I've never been disappointed with a movie he's been in. 




 Well if it's just a picture of someone warming their spoon so they can scoop their ice cream better then the caption doesn't make much sense does it.

 I could care less about the bat-shit storyline. The gameplay is phenomenal, though. I've put a lot of time into it. 




 Blue Valentine and Punch-Drunk Love. Blue Valentine is just dark and sad, but Punch-Drunk love is actually pretty sweet and funny overall but it deals with emotionally fragile/disabled characters and gets pretty dark at times. 




 It's amazing to play Infamous: Second Son and then this game and think that they're from the same console generation. This game looks miserable.

 Someone else that did this recently and owned the fuck out of it was Jake Gyllenhaal in Prisoners. He added so much depth to an otherwise relatively 2D character. 




 I mean, they do say "DO NOT REMOVE THIS CARD FROM AIRCRAFT". 




 Fantastic Mr. Fox or Mary   Max. Both absolutely incredible. 




 That's not my point. Fisher is an aging, American, raspy-voiced, father. Hardy is a young Brit. I have no doubt he'll make a great Fisher for the movie, but it won't be the same Fisher from the games. 




 I disagree. Not to say that this movie will suck or anything, but it will most definitely be just another action movie that happens to have the same name as a beloved video game franchise. Tom Hardy is a great leading man for an action-thriller, but he's not a great Sam Fisher. 




 I wish they kept this a secret so the movies had more "FUCK YEAH!" moments. However, "FUCK YEAH MEL GIBSON!". I hope he's just porter again. Watching Payback Straight Up and Get the Gringo back to back make me long for more. 




 Good luck kicking Statham's or Wahlberg's ass.

 A Cartoon Network short series called "Purple   Brown", if memory serves. 




 So then what (other than morals and what not) prevents me from going to Redbox with The Princess Diaries in hand, renting Thief, taking the Thief disc and putting The Princess Diaries disc in the pouch and go claim that the previous owner switched it? 




 Not surprising considering the song was written for the movie. 




 Yeah I know. I thought that a funny 5 second clip out of context would be appropriate though. 









 I just watched Prisoners. It came out last year and I hadn't seen any of Denis Villenevue's work prior and it blew me away. I've already rewatched it and I love it. Incredible performances all around and an incredibly tight and intense thriller/mystery. For me, it's easily up there with movies like Se7en and The Silence of the Lambs.

 All due respect, I don't think "passed away'' is the appropriate term for his case. 




 I didn't see it. But there shouldn't have to be a shitty sequel just to clean up after the first film. 




 Not Viggo. His voice isn't raspy enough and I don't want to hear his country accent. Plus, he may be too old. Maybe Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Josh Brolin, or Joel Edgerton. They've all done good country accents in the past. 
























 If he's over 80, I think he's allowed to do that.

 Death At A Funeral, Fargo, Payback: Straight Up, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Man Bites Dog, and Three Kings are all dark comedies with the theme of death. Happiness is the darkest of dark comedies. 




 Ehh. Not really a comedy. 




 To be fair the original Saw was pretty good as a standalone horror flick. Once the original writers (who are doing this movie) left, the franchise turned into torture porn. 




 You should watch the movie *Downfall*. It's a German film about the fall of Hitler. It affected me in the same vein as this image, but 100x more potently. 




 I've always considered Casino Royale far superior. 




 I feel ya. It felt like an extended YouTube action short. 




 That was fucking cool. Hey OP, how drastically does your Reputation meter change? Can one lengthy police encounter seriously affect it? 




 The NPC's behavior in this is impressive. People getting their picture taken, checking their shoes for gum, scurrying in the rain without an umbrella, having realistic conversations and phone calls, all with just the right amount of population and street traffic. 

People who have it already, how repetitive is NPC behavior? And does their number increase and decrease with location and time of day? 




 No 




 The hair over the mask is the icing on the cake. 




 /r/ShitCosmoSays 




 Also just don't watch it if you have a penis. 




 Speaking of Cop AI, how is the wanted system? I hate to continue with the comparison, but is it similar to the GTA 5 star system? 




 You have really unique handwriting. I like it. 




 How's that inbox? 




 He does a stellar job in "The Hunt" as well. That movie is too damn tragic.  




 YMS did a great job explaining why he thinks it's a shitty horror film. I agree.

 That's actually someone's remix of the final product. 









 I love The Veldt. 




 Although to be fair, that would make more sense in this game on account of ctOS and all. 




 Holy shit. 




 Why 




 I hope they can get some real talent involved. 




  Autonomous Meridian Response Syndrome

 Basically it's a community of content creators who make videos of sounds that give people a non-sexual tingling sensation (similar to goosebumps, I guess). However, one of the most common an popular "triggers" of these tingles is an up-close whisper, which causes quite a few creepy comments on YouTube videos of girls attempting to help people relax.

 I believe it was for Brach's, the candy company. 




 Exit Through the Gift Shop (if that counts) 




 Prisoners. A million times Prisoners. 




 Brtish Actor to play the lead in The True American. Hm. 
























 Why the hair? 




 What's your best memory of filming UHF? 




 Exactly my thoughts. I was so confused why people were so obsessed with it. It felt like an overly long YouTube action short. 




 * Dredd sucks.
* 22 Jump Street sucks.
* The Dark Knight is the most overrated movie of all time, but it doesn't suck. 




 Desh. All the people that are sent to kill him are the CIA's "assets". 




 Don't let the people fool you: Brothers sucks. I'm too lazy to explain why here but it does. The Hurt Locker does a brief but good job of shoving the *life after war* thing in your face; regardless, its still a great watch. 

[The Messenger](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0790712/), with Ben Foster and Woody Harrelson, is great. Check it out. 




 MMW: No they won't. 




 The Guard is great. I'm getting ready to see Calvary now. 




 In Bruges or the entire Cornetto Trilogy 




 Asylum and then City. Unless you finish up quick and can't wait for Knight, I say don't play Origins. It adds literally nothing. The story isn't half as good as the previous two, and gameplay is not nearly as fluid and is full of infuriating glitches and bugs that devs refused to fix.

People will disagree but honestly it was a really upsetting release for me, seeing as I 100% the first two (which I've never *wanted* to do in a game before). I didn't have 1/50th of the fun playing Origins that I had during Asylum and City. 




 [Ooh La La - The Faces - From Rushmore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--HaFAtC17U) 




 Neat. 




 It's pretty great entertainment. It's just a guy with a camera following a different cop/set of cops per episode, hence the title. Its been on for like 30 seasons. 




 That was surprisingly good directing. That oner in the hallway that ended with Blue Eyes silhouette behind Malcolm was great.  




 I have checked out their other stuff. He is awkward. That's not my problem. A main component of his job is to not be awkward. Get over *your*self. 




 Theres still time! Reboot with Donald Glover! 




 Damn hipsters. 




 Good one. I forgot about him. 




 Not my favorite, but definitely the best of recent: Koba from Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. 

The "human work" scene with his scars shows the emotion behind his hatred for humans, and the scene where he [SPOILERS](#s "goes from goofy monkey to killer ape at the weapons cache and throws Ash off the balcony") are two of the most intimidating and villainous actions I've seen in a while. 




 Watching House I always surprise myself remembering Hugh Laurie is British. Who else has a flawless accent?  




 http://www.empireonline.com/interviews/interview.asp?IID=1102

That's the first Google result for "David Fincher Alien 3 Problems". I didn't bother reading it but I'm guessing it covers it. Basically Fincher had little to no control over the film and was constantly arguing back and forth with the studio. He has publicly criticized the final result in the past. 




 You've named most of them. Fincher hasn't ever made a bad film (not counting Alien^3) and so far Denis Villeneuve is 3/3, all of which are excellent. 




 Fassbender and Phoenix. 




 Titus Welliver has never not played a cop. 

DJ Qualls gets typecast as the guy whose name end with "-y" or "-ie".

Seth Rogen is typecast as Seth Rogen. 




 I love the movie and the documentary. I was wondering why people were downvoting you. 




 Original. Then Redux. 




 DOES IT HAVE TO BE IN CALIFORNIA?

edit: I didn't mean to do that in all caps but I'm happy with how it turned out 




 It fades with overexposure. When I found out about ASMR I listened to several videos a day. After a few months I stopped getting tingles unless I heard something new, since I jumped on the bandwagon pretty early on.

Since then I took a break for a few weeks and am now back to experiencing tingles just as powerfully as I used to.  




 *Spiders Are About The Mass Of Cow 




 In response to all of your replies in this thread: just fucking google it. 




 I love how into it he is. 




 Shut down? No. Better regulated? Yes. 




 I figured they were messin about.  




 Falling Down 




 I opened the video while I was doing something else and didn't notice it wasn't soccer until 3 minutes in. Fucking hilarious. 




 The host of this show sucks. 




 He may be the best villain I've seen in a movie since the Joker. Especially during that scene where he takes the gun from the weapons tester after using his goofy disguise. 




 I didn't see the first one. I was fine. 




 Dat tracking shot with Malcolm running through the building ending with Blue Eyes in the background tho 




 It also made me realize that Jason Clarke could make a damn good Joel. 




 I've seen Secretary. I'm not going to sit here and lie to myself. 




 Someone's mad. 




 The Grand Budapest Hotel museum scene was incredible. And hilarious. 




 equals crazy delicious. 




 I saw them filming this in Venice beach almost two years ago. 




 I don't know much about Miles Davis or this movie, but I sure as shit love Don Cheadle. I'll see it. 




 The one on the right looks like a young Chevy Chase.  




 Birdman. 




 There Will Be Blood... 




 Lecrae performed at my elementary school when I was in 5th grade. We jammed out to Jesus Muzik. 




 Does Prismacolor just make the best everything? I've never used anything made by them. 




 It's exciting that he finally confessed that sometime in the future we will be seeing the preview for the preview for the movie. 




 Is that Joel Edgerton in picture 5? I think that is Joel Edgerton in picture 5. 

Anyway, for some reason I think this movie will end up being pretty mediocre regardless of some great performances. Calling it now. 




 Oh yeah. 




 He's done a couple of short films in the past and some other writing work but I think that's it as a director. Really talented guy though, from what I've seen. 




 I didn't read on as I just bought the movie yesterday and haven't watched it yet, but if you're looking for another family drama using crime as a plot device, check out Animal Kingdom by David Michod. I watched that a week or two ago and loved it. 




 Perfect Day fits in the OD Scene of Trainspotting, well, perfectly. 




 Well that's not exactly fair as the song was written for the movie. 




 ...why, though? 




 That's it! I thought it was a Bruce Willis movie. Thanks. 




 Recently, either the scene where the driver/boyfriend guy talks about his Red Bull sponsorship or the scene where Wahlberg drinks a Bud Light in Transformers: Age of Extinction. Product placement so blatant that it was hilarious. 




 Thanks a lot. This doesn't sound too bad, and I love Denis Villenevue and Jake Gyllenhaal enough to tough it out. 




 **Animal Kingdom** by David Michod

An incredible Australian crime-drama. Well written and directed with some great performances and an intense story. Can't wait for The Rover, Michod's next film. 




 I'm incredibly arachnophobic. I tried starting it a few weeks ago but immediately had to turn it off. How prevalent are spiders throughout the movie? 




 Walt should have a red line to Hector and/or Gus, technically. 




 I wouldn't say True Detective is Harrelson's pinnacle. Did you ever see Rampart?

(Sorry.)

 Zoolander? 




 It does suck that all the gay Hispanics have an easier time getting into colleges.  




 I fucking love Chance and this drawing is amazing (especially the hair), but those pupils are freaking me out

 That movie is about happiness.

 Oh no. Megan is Missing is such an atrocious movie. 




 She could do a reading of Mein Kampf and I'd doze off to it. 




 As much as I'd love that, it's not going to happen. Elba's already said it. 




 Good thing it's on wheat. Otherwise that'd be a bit much.

 Anyone got a link to any videos of these moms straight up attacking a child in a skate park? I'm sure some exist somewhere. 




 I always thought that There Will Be Blood and No Country For Old Men could switch and still work nicely. What are other movies that work this way?

 




 I said it before, and I'll say it again. They should have gotten Mark Strong. He's an excellent actor who excels at playing an intimidating, stone-cold badass. Plus he's naturally bald, so that won't look weird.

 Hay now... 




 C'mon Jerry! The Dark Knight Returns! It's canon! 




 Paul Thomas Anderson is a huge fan of Sandler's early comedy movies, like Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore. That's apparently why he hired him. 




 Plus....all those goddamn puns. 




 I've seen the pilot. It's *fucking bad*, like they took some of Mulaney's jokes and ran them through 10 other FOX sitcom writers and a clich machine. 

The Big Bang Theory : Silicon Valley :: Mulaney : Curb Your Enthusiasm 




 Just fucking get Mark Strong. He plays a great, stone-cold badass and he's already got the perfect look.

If you had said overrated I would've understood where you were coming from. I'm gonna need you to explain why you think it's bad. 




 I agree with some of these, but I don't understand how you can think that the Avengers is not overrated, but Inception is.

Then again, Robocop is your favorite movie.

 That would have been amazing. And shaky. 




 Submarine and Moonrise Kingdom did a great job of making me grin like an idiot. 




 There's also Escape Plan and X2. That's all I got. Still, all of those movies are very recent, with the exception of Silence of the Lambs. It's becoming more prominently clich. 




 He should totally play Agent 47. 




 Not sure. But the fact he censored "Crap" is the icing on the cake. 




 Adding to that: A glass cell!

* Silence of the Lambs

 So was True Grit. And I think both surpass their originals.

 I only watch Table Talks at this point, and only ones with casts I like. I save em up and listen to several in a row in podcast format. 

The other news videos just seem redundant to me and I don't care about any of the nerd stuff, and the cheesy format is off-putting to me. 

Oh well, I don't care enough to unsub or anything, but I only watch probably 10% of what they put out compared to the 90% or so that I used to watch with the original bunch.  




 I didn't like it either but to rank it behind Batman and Robin is just fucking absurd. Care to explain? 









 In terms of entertainment, check out the Tropic Thunder commentary. 

In the film, Robert Downey Jr's character says "Man, I don't drop character 'till I done the DVD commentary", and he doesn't.

And any McDonagh movies play out like stage plays, mainly considering Martin was a playwright before he was a director. (By the way, read some of those. I love the Pillowman.)

 WHY 




 This is actually the voice of Geoff, Craig Ferguson's robot-skeleton sidekick on the Late Late Show. He also does a perfect Morgan Freeman and DeNiro, among others. 




 I love the drummer playing along to the video. Synchronizing little beats with the machinery.  




 Just noticed they reused two shots of Bourne's foot on the railing and Bourne in between two windows. Kinda lazy. 









 I don't get it. What's the message here? 




 Nah. He's better as a character that pops in for a gag. 20 minutes of pure Kreiger would oversaturate it.

Sorry. I didn't genuinely laugh once and I didn't care about anything that was happening or any of the characters. Above that, I thought it was boringly written and I thought Bautista, Saldana, and half the other characters did a cheesy job with already cheesy enough lines. I love Pratt in Parks   Rec, Cooper in everything, and I like James Gunn as a director. I was really looking forward to it. In the end, I didn't even appreciate it as a fun, cheesy, space-opera. Maybe I'm heartless. I'm guessing y'all will think I am.

 I figured I get hate for this. He is a great actor, but recently I watched The Way, Way Back and I couldn't take him seriously at all. Especially if he puts on a weird voice behind some makeup.

 I love them all. Somehow I never caught Inherent Vice in theaters, and I've been waiting to see What We Do In The Shadows since I saw the trailers. Thanks. 




 Oh yes it is. Watched it with my very conservative mom once. 




 How the hell did I forget Four Lions in my description, it's one of my favorites. And I love In the Loop. 




 I'll have to check those out. Thanks for the list 




 I've been meaning to check that out. Thanks 




 Of course 




 Two of my absolute favorites 









 Love em all. I've seen all the Coen Brothers stuff more times than I can count, all of Guy Ritchie's best, and I've already seen Kingsman twice. 




 Thanks. Always happy to watch a classic. 




 I'll check it out. Which version? I'm guessing the original? 




 Definitely. I love everything Coen. 




 Oh, most definitely. The Naked Gun is amazing, and Airplane is one of my favorites.  




 Love it.  




 I just watched Alan Partridge and absolutely loved it. That dry, quick humor that's constant in the movie is my favorite. I watched The Trip as a follow up, and it was moderately funny, but not constant enough to have me dying like Partridge did.

Other movies with the kind of humor I'm looking for are In the Loop, Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Rushmore, In Bruges, The Guard, etc. 

Any suggestions?  




 I just saw The Boy Next Door in theaters yesterday.

It was hilarious fun to watch with friends, but it's far and above the worst film I've seen in a while. 




 Whoever edits these How To's is amazing. The timing of the cuts and the music makes the videos 10 times funnier. 




 If the script were written by a woman would it have been okay?

 I can't tell from your comments in this thread: do you get upset when people use "underrated" incorrectly?

 It looks really cool, and almost like Jennifer Lawrence. I think the eyes are too high, though. But what'd you use? The textures are great. 




 Well shit. I feel all cold and cynical now. 

I guess I took it as too much of a legitimate guide to the underlining themes of The Shining instead of a documentary about the cultural phenomenon it became and the obsessions it created. 

Thanks for pointing that out to me. 




 Really? I found that movie to be pretty worthless, if not frustrating. 

There were a few people in there with interesting theories and neat analyses, but they were overshadowed by the idiots talking about random shit. 

What was that lady talking about the drawings her kid made? Or the guy trying to prove Kubrick's face was in the clouds?

Plus it didn't seem very careful production-wise. It was more than obvious that everyone recorded themselves at home with mics of varying quality and no concern for background noise. I remember hearing kids pplaying behind some of the speakers.

 Your choices are wrong.  




 I think a big part of the movie was the fact that there were plotholes. The scene where she's recanting her stories to the FBI people and any questions from the Sheriff woman are shushed because of the preconceived notion of "innocent little Amy" and the media's role in how people perceive the couple and treat the case, overlooked evidence against her case in favor of their unfairly biased ideas, are pretty huge. Especially with the whole Nancy Grace parody thing running in the background. 




 I'd buy.

 Go look up the movie "Riding the Bus with My Sister". She plays a retarded person in what I supposed to be a very dramatic and touching drama, but it's one of the most unintentionally funny movies I've ever seen.

 Hey Adam, how do you feel about piracy laws? 




 I'm praying they add the store again. So much fun to be had. 




 It looks great except for the inside of the mouth. The crest of the tongue is too defined and makes it look like he has two big squirrel teeth or something. 




 It's sideways. 




 Big Lebowski. Before the Devil Knows You're Dead. Punch-Drunk Love. Moneyball. Synecdoche, New York. Happiness.  




 Franco's five facts are the best five facts.  
























 Yes they are. If I hadn't have seen the pair they'd be perfect. 




 Loved Animal Kingdom. Love anything with Ben Mendelssohn for that matter. 

I'll check out A Touch of Sin. Thanks. 




 Movies like Collateral, No Country for Old Men, Haywire, Bourne, even John Wick where there is tension and quiet broken by "professional" violence, where the action is mechanical and feels like something ordinary for the actor really get my attention.

Any suggestions for other intense, occasionally grisly, operatically violent thrillers? 




 what the fuck 









 Man Bites Dog 




 what's your favorite movie 




 what kinda pianos you got?

all your keys and synths sounds real nice. 




 Bravo, Judge!!! 




 Hell yeah Bruce Wayne skin. Wonder how they'll handle the cape. Maybe he'll just be unmasked Batman.  




 if you have to do New Game Plus to get all the way back there I'll be pretty peeved.

edit: i'm an idiot. just go through the elevator at Arkham Knight HQ South. 




 When was this? 




 That's him.  









 The American. More about a hitman than a spy, but still. Directed by Anton Corbijn, who did A Most Wanted Man. It's tense and beautiful. And it has George Clooney. 









 I wouldn't recommend Out of the Furnace, but The Drop is excellent. 




 but relatively speaking, I'm willing to bet it's still a similarly proportioned group, if not a bit larger in size. 

what made the psychedelic revolution a revolution was how new and exciting LSD was. it was polarizing.  




 I don't want any of your bullshit excuses. 




 Yeah, we're gonna need a yearbook photo. 




 it's one of those icee lids.  









 she's a successful fat woman in comedy

people are going to hate that 









 this some harmony korine type shit 




 MMW: Tomorrow, somewhere, a bear will shit in the woods. 

 




 Thanks man. Greatly appreciated. 




 Yeah I've started to learn it by ear on my own. It's so much more time-consuming but oh well

I need to learn this. I can't read sheets. 

I can learn it by ear, but a video would help tremendously.

If someone can learn it and upload a video of them playing the song showing their hands I will pay them like $10 or something via PayPal.

Thanks. 




 F is for Fake is essential. 

It will teach you how to edit.

EveryFrameAPainting has a great video essay on it. Check it out.

 get rid of wall
 




 Nice title, OP. 




 X-Men 2. The Nightcrawler fight is the best sequence in the whole movie.

Also, the new Bond movies, and most Tarantino movies. 




 Wow I didn't realize how much people didn't like that. I guess if you don't put "/s" after something blatantly not serious the hoard jumps on you. 




 They have a really polarizing sense of humor. My favorite is Burn After Reading, but really all their films are worthwhile and often darkly comedic. 




 Another great Caine quote on the matter:

"*Now I never saw Jaws 3, but I saw the house that Jaws 3 bought, and it is quite beautiful.*" 




 Soderbergh. His style works so well across genres.

Also, Spielberg and the Coen brothers.

The Coens may not seem it, but watch No Country for Old Men and then Raising Arizona or any of their funnier films back to back, and I bet you'd agree. 




 I'm Gazorpazor-fucking-field, bitch. 

Now give me my fucking enchiladas. 




 lol "the bomb"

because terrorists are often brown 




 I love the end of Burn After Reading, too. JK Simmon's nonchalant apathy is hilarious.

 Once you make this exist, please post the hell out of some pictures 




 Yeah, that did it. 




 "Not many people in California have basements" 




 Thanks 




 I'm finished. 




 The Funeral Monologue in Synechdoche, New York. 

Not necessarily a lie, but a pretty thoroughly multi-faceted scene that shouldn't just be taken at face value. 




 That seems like a pretty fuckin stupid idea

 Hey Steven, I imagine you're reading this, so just to let you know I haven't extensively looked into any of your theories and I don't necessarily believe that you are Christ, but you seem very confident, so just in case, what can I do to get off this FEMA Detention list? 




 A Single Man. 

It's only R because Colin Firth's character is gay. 

Everywhere else it's for most all audiences. 




 /r/asmr 









 The Bonds.

Quantum of Solace serves to help you appreciate the other two. 
Still has some nice fights and chases though. 




 That's like 10 hours though. 




 Just to be sure, won't all the pre-order bonuses be able to download eventually? 

I'll want to be sure I have access to all the characters/skins/challenges when all is said and done.

Edit: Apparently the answer is yes, but I'll go ahead and pre-order from Gamestop. Thanks guys.  




 yeezy's verse on Smuckers tho 




 Someone please save her videos. I feel like they won't be up forever and they're very good. 




 I want a Bruce skin. I love beating up people in plainclothes.  




 Riggan's words to the film critic and to his daughter in Birdman.

Really all of Glengarry Glen Ross, but especially Alec Baldwin's "motivational" speech. 




 They better keep playing Rainbow Six even if they dont get the views. These are the best videos they've had in ages. 

Who'da thought that when they actually enjoy their game we would too? 




 The black people watching were just as disgusted as I was. 
























 Where'd you watch it? 




 Out of all of the things that didn't happen, this one didn't happen the most. 




 Nightcrawler. 




 Gavin and the Communist Masseuse 




 yeezy just got me to look through some weird nudes in a public place 




 Trinidad gets royalty checks for Uptown Funk sales. 




 Emotional as hell. 




 Friends don't introduce friends to Burn Notice. 




 WE'RE BUDS!
