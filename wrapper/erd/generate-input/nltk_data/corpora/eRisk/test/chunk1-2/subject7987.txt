 Marine Systems Engineer here.  I'm just about to graduate from a 4 year curriculum at the US Merchant Marine Academy.  The program I've been a part of has introduced me to a wide range of engineering.  We start off learning the terminology used aboard ships and going over a core curriculum of calculus, physics, chemistry, electrical, and thermodynamics courses.  We spend an entire year as cadets on a number of ships in both a four month and eight month periods.  I was on four different ships during my sea time.  We then go over a number of advanced calculus, physics and electrical courses, we take classes in systems design, machine design, and, in the systems program we have a Capstone design project for which we go through the entire design process of designing systems for a vessel.   
























 Hah, figures someone beat me to this.  We considered using one of these in a marine engineering design project.  They are MASSIVE.   
























 Wow there's a lot of awesome in this picture. 
























 Shame.

Michael Fassbender was fantastic, and the film itself was masterfully crafted with a powerful message, but in the end that movie had me emotionally floored for about a week. 
























 My ex is a shy, sensitive girl who had gone through a rough childhood with an emotionally abusive mother.  We had first met as pen pals in high school, so over the years she had opened up to me with a lot about her past that she had never told anyone else.  We started dating when she moved to the city I was going to school in.  I was studying engineering at a military academy at the time, so with the demands of my school I could only really see her on the weekends.  With the stress of her past, and her living paycheck to paycheck in a rough city, she would break down every once in a while and call me just to try to get through whatever was bringing her down.  One night she called me during the week, and she seemed especially upset.  For some reason I had a light load with my schoolwork that night, so I told her I'd call her right back, took a taxi to the train station and got on a train before I called her.  On my way over she told me just about everything that was on her mind.  It was late in December, but after I got to her apartment I waited outside talking to her until she had vented everything on her mind.  I explained the cars going by by telling her some guys in the next room over were watching a loud movie.  I waited until she told me she felt better before I told her where I was.  She was on the fourth floor, but she ran down all four flights in pajamas to meet me at the door.  We talked in her apartment for about an hour, but, because of my academy's curfew, I had to take a late train back to school that same night.  
























 I bounced around troops when I was in scouts, so for my eagle project, since I didn't know a lot of people, I tried to do something small, that didn't require a lot of people, and that could still have a big impact.  I would shy away from doing trail restorations, or building any large structures as those require a lot of people.  I looked at those options first, but after asking my new troop what other Eagle Scouts had done in the past, I was able to replicate an old project and knocked the whole thing out in a weekend with a handful of volunteers.  By asking the adult leaders and new Eagle Scouts for ideas on your project, you show that you're really trying to make an impact on the community you're moving to.  By showing an interest in them, they're more likely to help you both with ideas and by encouraging their friends and sons, in the case of the adults, to lend you a hand.  It also doesn't hurt that helping with an Eagle project counts as volunteer work for advancement, so you don't need to feel like any of these guys would be going way out of their way to help you. 
























 I'm looking to buy a gaming laptop, something I could store a ton of movies on and play games like skyrim on as high of graphics as possible, all within the price range of around $1500-1800.  Working on ships, I can't exactly carry a pc onboard, so this is what I'm stuck with.  Looking through the threads here, I was excited about the Samsung Series 7 Chronos H, but since this is the first time I've looked into a gaming laptop I really have no clue what to get and am open to suggestions from you guys.  Also, I've just read a bit about spinning disk hard drives vs. SSD, but so far I haven't seen anything mentioning what would be better to have aboard a moving vessel.  It gets pretty rough out in the gulf, and I have burned through a few portable hard drives crossing the Pacific, so if any of you can lend some expertise in that, I'd def. appreciate it.   
























 Thanks - I'll check that out 
























 One of my favorite things to do on board was watch for flying fish.  I work in the engine room, so i would make a point to get out on deck every coffee break and walk up to the bow.  To my knowledge, flying fish only jump when they're threatened, so we'd be sailing through apparently lifeless water, and intermittently we'd hit a patch of them and they'd make these zig zag ripples on the surface as they shot out in every direction.  especially in the Arabian Sea, where the water was crystal clear and always calm, we would go for days where I could count hundreds jumping out of the way of our bow.  I think that Planet Earth does a great job of showing what our oceans are really like.  While it is mostly open and void of larger life, there are always small things like plankton, krill or sea grass, and the oasis where larger life can flourish are plentiful and very different from one another.  Just the color difference alone between the different oceans is really significant based on the makeup of the water and the microorganisms that live there.  After doing a few 4 month trips across the ocean, I realized that I'd rather stay around the Coast of the US.  There's more money to be made on smaller ships and rigs working in the gulf, and I'd rather see land and have time off in frequent bursts than sail a few months and have a few months off.   





























 Not only far, but if they hit an updraft just right, they'll come flying straight up in the air and land on top of you.

 Have an upvote, man.  Also, KPS 




 The birds out in the middle of the ocean are always cool to see, until one flies into the engine room.  We had this large, green/black sea bird fly on board our ship off the coast of China, and, because we didn't want it crapping on, landing on, or damaging the equipment in any way, I spent the good part of a day just trying to shoo the thing out of there.  However, on a 600 ft container ship the engine room was 4 stories tall with a ton of open space, so we ended up saying screw it and let it be.  Not sure whatever happened to that bird, but it wasn't seen again for the remainder of that voyage.  Hopefully it found its way out the same way it came in.   




 We ran into one of those fields over by Taiwan - probably my favorite moment out at sea so far. It was dark enough out where you could see most of the stars, and all around us were what looked like lanterns, small taiwanese shrimping boats all lit up for fishing. we were drinking this Chinese vodka that tasted like ever clear and playing darts in the galley. When we walked out to the stern to light up some cigars we'd bought ashore, the wake of the ship was lit up like fireworks. As the propellor hit the jellyfish, they'd flash in bursts and light up the wake behind us in a dull glow that stretched for miles behind us. 




 It depends on how calm the seas are.  Most of the trash I've seen has been floating 10, 20 feet beneath the surface.  It's out there, especially in the Pacific between California and Hawaii, and big time around China, but if the waves are rough enough, you may never know its there. 




 I was on an older, German-built ship from the time when shipping companies really catered to their sailors.  We had a 12' x 16' heated salt water pool on the 04 deck and crossing the North Atlantic in the wintertime, I would spend an hour a night just laying on the surface of that pool, steam rising from it into the 20 degree air above, and just look across the sky and see it lit up with more stars than you could ever see from the most isolated place on land. 




 Those scientists better keep working on that whale deterrent tech, especially to get them out of the way of container ships.  I don't want one getting stuck on our bow.  Can you imagine how much extra load that puts on an engine? 




 This does a real number on hard drives
