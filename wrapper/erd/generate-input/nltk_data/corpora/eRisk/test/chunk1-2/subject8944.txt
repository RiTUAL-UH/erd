 Why zero research skills? I'm looking for the stuff that is not easily found. Yea I've typed in "best beaches San Diego" in Google, but I'm looking for the local specialties. 




 Oh yea, I'm completely aware. I plan on attending all law networking events available. Are you in the law industry? Do you have any specific suggestions for getting a leg up? 




 Thanks for the laugh. I'm sure I'll hear them 1000 more times. +1 




 Hey guys, me and my girlfriend just moved to the area from Texas. We are both attending law school. I was just wondering if anyone had any suggestions on pretty much everything: beaches to visit, clubs to see downtown, restaurants to eat at, and anything else you can think of. Thank you in advance, sorry to invade. 




 Even better there's a computer program that can draw districts in the "shortest spitline." It is completely unbiased and draws it where the amount of people fit in the lines. 




 Call up the contact from that website again and say you never signed a lease and request that the website requests proof of a signed lease and if none is provided then it be removed from your history. If you pay a lawyer a small fee, they will probably write it for you which will be a lot scarier for this website and likely make them more responsive. 




 Just in case adoptive kids read this part and see "chose not to abandon me when that would have been the easy choice," I would like to point out that many families who choose to adopt out their children are making the choice to do so to give the kid a better life, and simply don't have the solid family structure you were blessed to have. Most adoptive parents see it as their suffering for the betterment of the child. 




 www.bigwords.com and type in all your ISBN numbers, then click to include international editions. It will tell you where to buy the cheapest bundle of all your books, and you can include rentals and everything. 




 So still don't go to a low ranked law school and if you go to a high ranked school make sure you go with a big scholarship. This is the same advice you would have been given in 2011. Would anyone here have told a student not to attend a top 30 school with a big scholarship even then?

 Go check out the discussion over on /r/MMA, this very thing happened yesterday with a male fighter finding his girlfriend in bed with another guy. Complete opposite reactions. 




 I'm sure most of the people here don't follow the sport mixed martial arts but just to fill everyone in, there is a fighter named War Machine (real name), who is dating a porn star and he reportedly beat her after finding her in bed with another guy. Over on /r/MMA, there has been lots of discussion of this and the consensus is it's wrong no matter what he found her doing. Anyway I just wanted to point out that the double standards are pretty sickening. 




 I would offer no more than 20%. I realize that is drastically different than what you were thinking, but realize that your friend is only bringing the good credit. That's nothing. You could find that with a Craigslist ad coupled with an attorney written contract giving you all the rights to revenue, and I assure you many people with only credit would take that. 




 Just curious, but what's the split? 




 George RR Martin is pretty unhealthy and will probably die before he finishes Game of Thrones. 




 Agreed. Let's look at 2 other scenarios: 1) Someone wants to frame him. If they wanted to frame him for cheating there are a hell of a lot better ways to do it than setting up profiles with his picture and fake names and minimal info (which is what he says is on the accounts) then just HOPING that his wife or one of her friends finds the accounts and rats him out. 2) It's some guy who thinks OP is of godly looks and is using his profile to pull in chicks. In this case, they got his pictures off FB. OK Cupid and such are LOCAL websites. What are the odds that this random dude using his random pictures would set up profiles within his same exact 50 mile radius.

On the other hand, if he wants to cheat while out of town on business, he would probably be setting up profiles in those cities, not his own. And it is possible that the wife's friend who "found out" set them up if she has a personal vendetta against OP. Or even that one of OP's friends set up the profile with his picture and is using it to bait in girls. I just think these are less likely than OP being a cheater.

Honestly, I have no idea, but I'm leaning more towards the fact that this post is just to get ideas for a cover up. 




 I just realized how much Zach Braff will look like Ray Romano in 20 years. 




 Whatever you're comfortable with. Extremely risky: 15%, average risk: 7%, super safe: 5% as examples. 




 Wouldn't it be even smarter then to make your whole ad 5 seconds long then just black screen the rest of the time? Then the person sees your whole ad but and will always skip after its over and you never have to pay. 




 Define the odd phone calls.

As for reserving a room, she was heading to the mountains, of course she is reserving a room. She's not gonna party out in the woods. 




 Why not just wait another few months until Aldo is ready and do Edgar/Swanson in the meantime for #1 contender? 




 You know it always really bugs me that they never count Aldo's defenses from WEC in there. I mean the WEC FW division became the UFC FW division and was seen as the premier place for FW's even when it was the WEC. They should say Zuffa belt defenses, or even UFC/WEC belt defenses, not just UFC belt defenses.

Aldo has held the belt longer than Jones and had more defenses. Granted the competition hasn't been up to par with Jones' but people always cite stats like these to show why Aldo is above Jones in P4P rankings. 




 Although I completely disagree with charging anyone for any crime here, if they insist on charging the underage boy shouldn't they also charge the underage girl with possession and manufacturing of child pornography especially since she started it? 




 I mean that one sounds pretty straightforward, no?

Theory: Girl invited to party, empties bank account b/c she's an irresponsible college undergrad, buys alcohol b/c of same reason, drinks on the way up, hits snow b/c drunk, tells person not to call police b/c she was drunk driving, then hitchhikes with the wrong person and gets murdered.

I mean they found red stains that they assume are from red wine. Of course she didn't want police called after she crashed while drinking and driving. 




 If it is truly valued at $200K now and $220K with $15K worth of work, but I doubt it. It's much more likely that $20K worth of work will cause it to sell for $220K. The market is very good at being efficient. I am a former real estate agent and my suggestion would be to sell it as-is, unless all other condos in the area are selling with improvements, and yours is not, then act accordingly. 




 "Proceed." 




 Exactly, Nader can warn all he wants against Clinton but I'd rather have Clinton than abortion made illegal again, no chance for gay marriage, no chance for further healthcare reform, less investment in green energy, and no minimum wage reform. 




 What country, or if in the US what industry? 




 Dana has routinely paid both guys if there is a last minute cancellation. 




 That's actually still not entrapment. The law defines entrapment as a police officer convincing a citizen to commit a crime they would not have otherwise committed AND that a reasonable person would not commit.

An example of actual entrapment: A police officer runs up to a person on the street yelling they have just been poisoned and there is an antidote in that store, but the store is closed and he must break a window and take the antidote. The citizen is arrested after he breaks in and steals the antidote.

A reasonable person would steal the antidote, but not buy crack even after being harassed. 




 Just read the whole story and watched your trailer. It looks really cool! Where will you be posting it? Like which subreddit? 




 These people probably shouldn't be driving... 




 Yea this was baffling. The dad disputes the kid did anything wrong then grounds him? Sounds like he's taking out his anger over getting arrested on the kid. 




 How did the dad support multiple kids with a job a McDonalds is the real question? 




 Technically, it means she would potentially sleep with any guy with a girlfriend, her boyfriend included, but not exclusively. 




 Yeeeesh that was brutal. The most interesting part by far was the fact that SPOILER ALERT: the guy's wants to kill himself after the accident and everybody's saying let him kill himself if he wants to die and is in that much pain, then he goes on to make a fantastic recovery with wife, kids, and attend law school. 




 Life and Death Decisions

Awesome teacher, awesome class, super interesting. Extremely informative. Easy tests. Opt out of the final. Man I could go on and on about that class.

Edit: And no presentation or speeches. 




 Incoming 1L taking this advice to heart right now. I appreciate the sacrifice. 




 If many people in the company are entitled to it then I think your best bet would be for you guys to all meet together with a lawyer and outline the story and see if you have a case.

Other posters are right, $400 for one person isn't worth a lawsuit, but for 20+ people, it is more reasonable.

Most of the time, a simple letter from a lawyer would be enough to scare the company into complying. 




 Hi.

I'll preface this with the fact that I'm not an excon and I only subscribed to this sub because I'm interested. However I am a undergraduate who is heading into a graduate program this Fall so I know things from that side a tiny bit.

I have been in the legal system for minor charges, some of which I pleaded not guilty and they dropped immediately after and one of which I went to court and was proven not guilty by a jury.

It was a minor charge that I beat in court and I was 100% guilty of it, and I was a 19 year old pompous kid, but it was a misdemeanor Minor in Possession charge so I don't feel too bad for misrepresenting some stuff.

The major fact I took away was, it's not what is true, it's what appears true. Like that Training Day quote where Denzel talks about "It's what you can prove."

Well, what I'm getting from your case is that there is little "proof" on either side. Do the discovery, find out what they have on you. Also did you take pictures or any proof of your injuries?

Now you go up on the stand, look as innocent as possible, seem exasperated and just be emotional and work in to the jury that you just don't want to go to jail for something you didn't do and the other damage it's had on your life. SEEM innocent.

After it's over 1 of 2 things will happen: Not Guilty, you walk away learning a valuable lesson or Guilty and you go to jail most likely and when you get out, you talk to any employers and tell them the full story and hope one of them believes your story. Now let me tell you what you get if you just plead Guilty. Most likely, employers will not believe if you tell them you are not really guilty but plead guilty because you were scared. Unless they are in the position, it's almost impossible for people to comprehend that people will plead guilty to a crime they did not commit. Again this is all just my opinion and you are free to do whatever you want.

Also, I don't know about you, but for me I would not be able to plead guilty purely based on principle. I would rather do a year I got sentenced to after a full trial than 6 months I plead guilty to.

I would like to add one last note that I am not a typical poster here and I have never been to jail/prison so I am likely talking out of my ass when I say I would rather do the year I didn't earn than the 6 months I condemned myself to, but this is all just an opinion for you to take into account and decide for yourself.

In any case, good luck man. I sincerely hope you the truth prevails. 




 Can you stop downvoting me just because you disagree?

And that's not a response. You're just dodging the question but whatever fine. 




 Just to be clear: you are saying you don't think he needs even a few thousand though in case his car breaks down or there is a medical emergency, because that is what I advocated for and you seemed to disagree. Is that right? 




 It would be naive to think his expense are $0. He obviously pays for lunch, most likely his gas and probably insurance, entertainment, etc.

He should obviously have money for the loan payments and/or a car breaking down AT THE MINIMUM. Are you advocating he have no emergency fund because we assume his parents can/would help him? 




 I disagree. I think 6 months of whatever his expenses may be is appropriate. If that is only food, gas, phone and insurance then I think he should save 6 months of that, which would only presumably be around $3500 or so. And everyone wants an emergency fund that size if for example their car breaks down or something of that nature. 




 I'm sure even you miss a line here and there when casually browsing reddit. Or no? 




 Just remember:

1) Make a budget
2) Emergency fund with 6 months expenses
3) EMERGENCY FUND WITH 6 MONTHS EXPENSES
4) Put all excess in student loans 




 So highly paid, elite athletes get paid more? 




 When they wrote "his address" in the article, those words were hyperlinked to his actual address. 




 Used to watch every UFC, the whole card through, every pre and post press conference, watch every interview, and even watch the 2nd tier promotions (DREAM, Strikeforce, etc) but now I watch only the main cards of some of the UFCs, not really the TUF Finales or anything like that. 




 Just to piggyback on the top comment, even if a drug with euphoric effects was created that didn't have any physical adverse effects, it would still have mental adverse effects.

Imagine a drug that produces a high and you never have to worry about ODing or having a hangover or any other health effects. Would you take it every day? Would you spend your last dollar on it instead of eating some days? Would you steal in order to get money for it? 




 It's better than the previous status quo. Pre-existing conditions and no medicare just because you don't have a kid, not to mention lifetime caps and being dropped by your insurance if you develop a condition. 




 More like pacman. 




 The salesman thing lines up with what others said in the other thread. Have him attempt to get a job at a home improvement store. As said in the other thread they like to hire older people and he has sales experience and they can teach him the tools part. 




 I don't understand how the judge could possibly deny the biological father the right to be named on the birth certificate.

I feel like that happens all the time in cases of straight couples using surrogacy. 




 They put their sperm with an egg of a donor woman, then implanted that fertilized egg in a 3rd woman.

Also, why do you not support it? 




 I'm pretty sure it's going to depend on the dynamics of the child with the parents. If the child is indifferent towards the dad but close to the mom, and the dad has full time custody then the child will be unhappy and vice versa.

My parents had 50/50 custody when I was in elementary school and it was the absolute worst. Literally every day I was asking who would pick me up and occasionally the parent who was supposed to pick me up would forget.

The only thing I can say for sure that if this is studied, 50/50 is most likely to be the worst. 




 Agreed. I think he could have beaten Texiera if he had his head in the game. He just got to overconfident, just like against Lyoto. Although I do think he would have lost to Lyoto even if he hadn't rushed in. 




 The Keith Jardine fight?

I don't recall them being legal, are you sure?

Edit: 1:30 mark http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hl475QNxCM
Definitely illegal. 




 PS3 reporting in. Not gonna spend $400 just to spend $60 as much as I want to play this game. 




 staph, just FYI 




 No, nothing has changed. Can you provide a video or rough time period in a fight where an upkick that connected to the head of a down opponent was no called by a ref? 




 Hey, so you seem to have it down pretty well. But I have one last suggestion. Do your parents have bad credit at all?

If they apply for a PLUS loan and get denied, you are able to take additional unsubsidized Stafford loans in your own name only, and at a good interest rate (comparatively to private loans).

If not, then just go private loans with your parents as cosigners. 




 That was $12K each year. The guy has 2 years left, he should be able to take a break for 2 years before working the rest of his life. 




 Hey guys, I was one of the redditors who helped Tim Kennedy do his AMA.

Just FYI, he said they have about 30 fighters ready for DLC content and are just gonna be adding fighters as they go. 




 I'm not sure if /u/Mr_asdfghjkl was implying it was a bitch move because of the circumstances or just in general but I'll throw out my thoughts.

I would like to see soccer kicks/stomps legalized but it was still a bitch move because it was illegal, and the other guy knew it was. If it was legal, it wouldn't be a bitch move. 




 The Sims and GTA5

I want to lead a normal family life with a job as an accountant, then go out and rob banks with my crew on weekends. 




 There are 7 different last names in his list of grandparents, parents, and children. 




 You think Republicans will have a 2/3 majority in the House AND Senate? You're wrong. 




 I was the other guy who helped with the AMA at Tim's house. I asked for a pic and he immediately asked for a leg kick at "about a 7 or an 8" out of 10. Looked like it hurt. 




 Because Dems have the Senate and nothing Democrats really really hate would ever get through the Senate and thus he would never be able to veto it. Trust me, if they start passing stuff that the Dems don't want, he will veto it. 




 Still won't matter. Obama will veto anything that makes it through and R's don't have 2/3 majority in House and Senate. 




 Dude had some hilarious answers for his AMA. I was cracking up typing some of them. 




 Hey guys I was one of the guys he chose to help with his AMA just cause I live in Austin. He was a really cool dude! Me and the other guy just helped type up responses while he dictated, but we typed it word for word. He gave us each a signed glove and we got to see his dogs and meet his wife. He seems really down to earth. I got a pic with him, and the other guy asked Tim to give him a leg kick (there was a video, I'll let him post it if he wants). 




 The Republican nominee and Democratic nominee for this race are both teachers at the same college. 




 Out of the 6 people living in that house, 5 are unclassy and you are alright with 1. 




 I'm gonna be working there tomorrow from 7-7!

I get to serve the athletes and their families food. 




 I just saw the first showing of this movie today, opening day, and WOW it was a really great movie. Not what I expected. Tom Cruise actually played a type of character I had never seen him as before.

He wasn't the futuristic guy from Oblivion, nor the super-agent type from that one movie with Cameron Diaz. Cruise was scared, unsure of himself and a refreshingly great character. The movie itself shattered all of my expectations, which weren't great as I didn't expect much and went on student discount Thursday night as I didn't think it was worth full price, but oh how wrong I was.

Also, the comedy, my god I was laughing out loud at many parts in the movie and you will too.

Seriously go see it and thank me later.

Sidenote: There's another disaster movie coming out in a very 2012-ish vein and it looks even worse.

 I have loans from undergrad: subsidized govt, unsubsidized govt and unsub private. Will the subsidized ones continue to be subsidized while I am in grad school (law school) as long as I am full time?

I am going straight from undergrad to law school. Do I have to notify any of the loan servicers (even the private ones) that I will still be in school or will they be automatically notified so that my payment period does not start? 














 All my acceptances are starting to come in and while I have a great GPA, I only did decently on the LSAT and I'm looking at going to a lower-ish ranked school.

My question is: While looking at the ABA profiles of schools, I noticed some have really high attrition rates. They break it down by "Academic" and "Other" but also have Transfers Out. Are transfers out counted in attrition rates? If so, which category? Does Academic mean failed out or does Other? I searched google and the ABA website and could not find the answers to these questions.

I know it is generally frowned upon for 0L's to post here, but I think this question can help a lot of others. Thanks for taking the time. 









 Sorry if I'm posting in the wrong place. Perhaps I could be directed to the correct place if this is not the right subreddit.

Here's my problem. Yesterday, all at once, the clock stopped working in my car (the little LED one that is right next to the temperature display, which still works), the remote that locks/unlocks the car no longer works, the trunk button in the car does not open the trunk, and when I turn my car off, usually I can still close the windows, but now I have to have the car on to close the windows.

I've checked all fuses. I've check the battery. Everything is good. The car is a 1998 Toyota Avalon.

Perhaps one of you more knowledgeable folks might point me in the right direction? I don't know much about cars and any help in appreciated. 














 I'm just confused, because California could have just put up a shitty defense, then the losing side would appeal up to the SCOTUS and they would be FORCED to make a decision. By striking down DOMA, we can ascertain that the Court clearly have the votes in favor of marriage equality. 









 Hey /r/MMA, so I'm in summer courses majoring in economics and currently taking an upper division Economics Statistics course. Well, my teacher assigned us a project (I only have a brief overview of it now, will have exact details of it tomorrow) to do a numerical statistics analysis on discrete numerical data in which our sample size is over 30. She specifically said we could do it in sports. Obviously as a huge MMA fan, I'd like to do mine in MMA.

So I'm looking for everyone's input on some cool statistics I could analyze and I will of course share the full results of the project with everyone here so that could be cool right?

To cover a quick few things:
1. it has to be numerical, not categorical so I cannot do things such as types of finishes;
2. it has to be discrete meaning a specific number (ex. # of strikes per round, not weight of each fighter- which fluctuates);
3. sample size has to be over 30 so if I'm analyzing one person's fights it has to be someone with more than 30 of them, but I could analyze all champions fights; 
4. I don't want this to be a comparison across weight classes where there are already many predictable patterns;
5. don't pitch an idea that is insanely hard such as analyzing every single fighter in the UFC for the past 10 years;
6. keep in mind I can also analyze #'s that aren't takedowns, strikes, etc. such as viewers for shows, salaries and more.


Thanks! And I look forward to sharing the project with you guys! 




 Not sure if this is the right sub but.... I'm looking at law schools and when I see them according to US News, it show's the average indebtedness at graduation for each school. My question is: does this include undergraduate debt as well?

The definition provided on the website states: "Average indebtedness of 2012 graduates who incurred law school debt." As you can see, this does not clear up my issue. So if anyone with any insight can help, I'd be thankful. 




 Hi, I am a student and subleased my apartment for the summer. Over Craigslist, I met a Law Student (ironically) who agreed to sublease my room. He moved in and lived there from the 12 until 25th of May (today) and when rent was due, he sent me a text saying he has moved out. He said I could keep the deposit and left a $100 check for utilities from the time he lived there (it was only like $40). I immediately texted back asking if he could call to discuss it. He responded, declining.

I went to the apartment and found the check as well as him completely moved out. My question is, do I have legal recourse as he signed a lease in which I explicitly outline the deposit, rent amount, move in and move out dates, and he signed and sent a copy of his drivers license? He signed this agreement and I have emails from his official .edu email address in which he signs his full name and has his schools listed at the bottom. I also have texts confirming his move in date and confirmation that the lease was signed.

A friend told me that I could possibly be out of luck as I did not get the contract notarized. Is this true or does it simply decrease my chances of winning a judgement from him, considering I have the emails, texts, drivers license, and signed contract (signed by both of us)?

I live in Texas, and the reason he cited for moving out was originally that the hot water and dishwasher don't work (they do) and when I called him out on that he said the place wasn't clean (it was reasonably vacuumed, swept, and counters wiped when he moved in). He is now not responding to any texts of mine in which I ask him to call me. I have not threatened the lawsuit yet, but I plan on filing in small claims court as of Tuesday (Monday is a holiday).

Thank you all for your time and help. 









 ***Hi guys, I am an American student taking Danish here in Texas. I know lots of you have helped me before editing my papers and I want to thank you guys. I am now on my very last paper for Danish, and after this I just take the oral exam and written final exam and I am done with my Danish studies. I want to thank this subreddit as a whole for helping me learn Danish, and a special thanks to /u/Neovitami and /u/Solgudinde who have helped edit many of my papers. I just didn't want to keep burdening them, so I come to you all for my last paper.

The topic for this paper is about a vacation we want to go on. I went away from the topic a bit and wrote about an adventure I wish to have. If you just edit it by bolding my mistakes (spelling and grammar) I would be very thankful.***


Den ferie jeg nsker, er at bestige Mount Everest. Det ligger i Nepal. Det har vret min drm lige siden jeg var lille til st p toppen af verden. Jeg har planlagt denne ferie i lang tid, og det bliver meget spndende, nr jeg har penge til at tage. Jeg bliver ndt til spare op masser og masser af penge, fr jeg kan rejser der. Og s jeg bliver ndt til finde en guide, der vil hjlpe med at guide mig op bjerget. Jeg bliver ogs ndt til at trne. Jeg skal have masser af erfaring klatring andre bjerge, fr jeg kan forsge til bestige det hjeste en. Jeg bliver ndt til spise rigtigt, s jeg kan vre meget sundt. Jeg vil spise masser af frugt og grntsager, og jeg vil g lber hver dag. Sidste til at blive klar til min eventyr, vil jeg ndt til samle det rigtige udstyr. Jeg vil kbe en klatring kse, klatring sko, og masser af varmt tj. Jeg vil ogs kbe en srlig sovepose og telt. Og jeg kan ikke glemme at kbe en brndeovn at lave mad varme mltider!

Frst jeg vil flyve p et fly til Kathmandu, hovedstaden i Nepal. S vil jeg vandre fra Kathmandu til Everest basislejr. Denne vandretur er omkring 100 kilometer lang og tager ca 4 dage. S jeg vil bo i basislejr i 10 dage eller deromkring. Dette vil give min lunge at akklimatisere sig til den hje hjde, basislejr ligger p. S jeg klatre til Camp 1, s Camp 2, derefter Camp 3, da Camp 4, og endelig til topmdet! Hele eventyr vil tage omkring en mned for at afslutte. Det vil ogs koste en masse penge! Men jeg vil fle sig en stor flelse af realisering, s det vil vre umagen vrd for mig.
Mens andre mennesker nsker at rejser p ferier, hvor de kan slappe af, lide i Caribien, jeg nsker at rejser p en ferie, hvor jeg kan opleve en stor liv eventyr.

Jeg har boet i Austin hele mit liv. Byen er vokset meget siden jeg blev fdt her. Jeg elsker Austin. Jeg tror, det er den bedste by i verden. Den har alle fordelene ved at bo i Texas, men det er meget forskelligt fra andre byer i Texas. Austin er stor nok, at det er interessant, men lille nok til at det er let at kre fra den ene ende til den anden hurtigt. Austin er den mest unikke by jeg har hver besgt, og jeg er stolt af at bo her.

Jeg elsker Austin, fordi der er altid noget at gre. Der er masser af butikker for at kbe ting i. I Austin, kan du tage vandreture p Greenbelt. Eller du kan sejle p sen. Eller du kan kre rundt sporet p Town Lake. Der er ogs mange steder fantastisk til datoer. Du kan tage til Mount Bonnell og se solnedgangen. Eller du kan fodre nderne i Zilker Park. Hvis du nsker at feste, er der masser af barer p 6th street. Der er ogs masser af levende musik i barer og klubber. En anden aktivitet at gre, er at besge det Texas State Capitol og lre alt om historien af Texas.

Jeg elsker ogs at i Austin, der er masser af aktiviteter at gre p ferie. I marts kan du se live musik og film p South By Southwest festival. I marts kan du ogs flyve med drager p Austin Kite Festival. I juli kan du se fyrvrkeri p Town Lake for 4. juli fester. I september kan du tage til Zilker Park og deltage Austin City Limits, en kmpe musikfestival. I december kan du tage p Trail of Lights og se masser af juledekorationer.

Og sidst, har vi det bedste universitet i hele Texas, University of Texas, hvor du kan lre noget, selv dansk! 




 This happened about 4-5 hours ago. So here it is, several days after Valentines day and I'm walking on my college campus with my girlfriend to go pick up a package her mom had sent her containing lots of Valentines day candy and such.

Well we pick up the package and walk about 20 feet when out of NOWHERE a tall skinny kid about 18-20 years old comes running and grabs the package from my hands. But here's the thing, **he's maniacally laughing the entire time.** First thought that entered my mind is I'm trying to see if I know the kid from class or a club or something, nope. Quick glance to my girlfriend next to me says she doesn't know him either.

So then after about 20 seconds of trying to grab the package, he rips it open and candy goes flying everywhere. At this point, we are in the middle of the hallway in one of the busiest buildings on campus. The kid starts trying to wrestle me. Sweet. I trained in MMA for about a year, so I know some stuff. I immediately go for a trip takedown, and when he puts his hands on the floor to stand up, I sink in a rear naked choke. First  I'm not squeezing that hard, but then I get pissed thinking how much of a pain he caused me. By the way, I'm borderline sick today and the only reason I even went to school was because I had a huge test. Add this to the fact that I'm lugging around a 30 pound backpack with books, binders and laptop, and you could see why I'm pissed when someone tries this crap on me. So here I am, applying the choke, and all these college kids (about 30 or so) have formed a big circle around me and a bunch of girls start screaming that I'm gonna kill him, and I can tell I'm about to put him to sleep, so I loosen the choke.

Oh and I've got my 30 pound backpack on this whole time. I guess here is where I should mention that I'm about 5'7 and 130 pounds and this kid is about 6'0 and 200 pounds. Needless to say he's got some size on me. So I've loosened the choke, but I'm still holding it firm but not squeezing at all. The kids starts grabbing my hair and just pulling the crap out of it. The girls are still yelling that I'm gonna kill this kid. So I start arguing with them, telling them he's gonna run if I let him go. They keep screaming at me. Fine. I let go, and hold firm around his waist. He stands up and starts dragging me, while standing, trying to run away. I implore any bystanders to help, and these two big-ish guys help me hold him there.

Finally, an employee of the college shows up and informs us that the police are on their way, but he can't touch the kid. So this kid is still dragging the 3 of us around and we're trying to hold him. Finally, we agree that we'll put him on the ground. So we ground the kid and he just starts unloading punches at me, mostly top of the head, but some hit me in the jaw (which is now sore and slightly swollen). College employee jumps in and helps us hold him down til police get there.

They take, my, my girlfriend's and some other witness statements. At this point I hear a bystander mention that they know the kid and he's mentally ill. Crap, I should have realized earlier. Now the police pull me aside and start grilling me, asking me if I thought the kid was an imminent threat to me and actively trying to harm me. I point to the fact that he punched me in the head several times. Then the officer informs me that I could be arrested for applying "deadly force" in the form of the choke, which is a felony. Pshhh, I tell him, that's complete BS, dude tried to rob me.

So it ends with me telling the police that yes I'd like to press charges for assault and attempted robbery. And the police informing me that they will contact me and the kid may try to press assault charges on me. By the way, before someone complains, I'm only pressing charges because clearly this kid is either off his meds or on the wrong ones and they need to be adjusted. If his doctor informs me that they have fixed the medication and he is indeed taking them, and I get an apology from the kid, I will gladly drop the charges against him.

**tl;dr: Kid tries to rob me, I choke him, he punches me, whoops he's mentally ill, cops come and tell me I might be arrested for a felony in the near future; ALL LEGAL ADVICE WELCOME** 




 On my last paper I got a bad grade because my grammar was bad. Would anyone be willing to proofread my paper for mistakes?

Here is the paper:

Jeg s det program hedder Horisont: Liv og dd. Det var i fjernsynet p sndag, klokken 21:55. Det er 24 minutter langt.

Filmen handler om abort i Irland. Demonstranter der gr ind for abort er vist. Nogle kvinder er vist, som gr ind for valg. De nsker abort rettigheder, fordi der nu er ingen rettigheder for de kvinder til abort. Der er kun rettigheder for fosteret. Reporter interviewer en mand. Manden siger, at hans kone havde graviditet komplikationer. Manden siger, at lgen fortalt ham graviditeten var en spontan abort. S en lge interviewes hvem siger, at irsk lov siger, at lgen ikke kan abort et foster, hvis mors liv ikke er i fare. S interviewe manden, der siger deres lge fortalte ham, at de ikke kan abort fosteret, fordi det er live.

Reporter interviewer en kvinde, der er en anti-abort demonstrant. Kvinden mener deres protester beskytte ufdte fostre. Et fjernsyn interview er vist med republikansk senator Todd Akin. Senatoren siger, at han tror, hvis en kvinde er voldtaget, hendes krop vil aborterer fosteret.

Reporteren er vist interviewe en anonym irsk kvinde. Kvinden siger, at hun tog til England for at f en abort. Kvinden siger, at for hende turen var god.

Reporteren viser os et sted, hvor forldre, der ikke nsker deres brn kan opgive dem. Stedet har mange anti-abort plakater. Katolske nonner administrere stedet. Nonnerne stte brnene op til vedtagelse.

Et interview med en pro-choice kvinde vises. Hun siger, at regeringen i Irland gr love for abort og anti-abort love ogs. Regeringen fortstter med at forbyde abort, selv med mange protester mod abort love.
Lge Peter Boylan siger, at han tror Irland skulle debat abort nu. Han siger, at for 20 r siden, ville regeringen ikke lytte, men nu regeringen skal lytte.

Filmen slutter med at vise den mand, hvis kone dde, fordi lgen ngtede at gre en abort. Filmen er meget trist og flelsesmssige, og sger at ndre betragterens sind, hvis de er anti-abort.
 




 Just watching his interview (http://www.mmafighting.com/2012/12/5/3734168/rory-macdonald-plans-on-annihilating-hurting-and-destroying-b-j-penn) and the UFC on Fox 5 pre-fight press conference (http://www.mmafighting.com/2012/12/6/3732750/ufc-on-fox-5-press-conference-video) I can't help but get the feeling that Rory has the demeanor of Fedor except that Fedor actually smiles, and Rory is just... cold. I absolutely love his attitude and sincerely hopes he takes over at WW soon. 









 So I know it causes uninhibited growth which forms tumors, but how do the tumors kill you? Do they get large enough to block blood flow or what? 




 The limit represents the derivative of some function f at some number a. State such an f and a.

lim as h approaches 0  (fourth root(16 + h) - 2)/h



My answer: I got that a is 2, but I can't for the life of me get f. 




 So my internet is fine for everything but videos. On youtube, you know how it loads only the next 30 seconds until you press play, then continues loading? Well over that entire 30 seconds it maybe loads another 5 seconds, so I have to watch that 35 seconds, then sit there for another 2 minutes while it loads the next 30 seconds.

As you can imagine this gets pretty painful. But the kicker is I know its only my computer. My roommate's laptop loads the exact same videos fine with no pauses and we are both getting wireless off the same router.

So maybe, just maybe someone knows some easy fix to make my internet go faster or how to make youtube load the whole videos?

Additional info: I have Webroot and Malwarebytes and they both run clean scans so I'm pretty sure its not spyware slowing it down.

Edit: I'm on a Toshiba Satellite A305 laptop and am running Windows Vista if that helps anything

Thanks so much in advance for your help! 




 And I don't mean the historical explanation. I mean the "hey that actually makes sense" explanation. Seriously, our 12 hour blocks go from 12,1,2...11 It just makes no sense to me. Like maybe if it went from 12,11,10,9...1 then ok I get it, it's going backwards, but this go 11 numbers back then start increasing by 1 thing makes no sense to me.

And no I'm not high, I just finished my college semester and have 3 weeks to sit around before Summer classes start so I've been contemplating a lot of boring things. 
























 And even then nothing changes, because Obama will just veto anything the Dems don't like. And the Repubs don't have majorities to override vetos. 




 If the GOP win the Senate, nothing changes.

Any bill passed by the House and Senate that Democrats disapprove of will be vetoed by Obama and nothing will change that because the GOP do not have 2/3 majorities in both houses, or even one house.

Gridlock before midterms and gridlock after. 




 Power is always the last thing to go. 




 Correct. The Circuit Court made a ruling that the ban was unconstitutional, then the Supreme Court denied the case, and a federal judge just ruled that Alaska must abide by the Circuit Court's ruling, which is what happened in this article. Gay marriage is legal in Alaska today. 




 The appeal already happened. The Supreme Court denied to take the case. This is it. Gay marriage is legal in Alaska today. 




 Yes, in this case. Here the Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the ban unconstitutional, and the Supreme Court chose not to take the case. All that had to happen was a federal judge rule that Alaska must abide by the Circuit Court's ruling, which is exactly what happened here. Today, gay people can marry in Alaska. 




 Are you saying the Tennessee Constitution would have an amendment banning abortion?

Because if it passed, it would make absolutely no difference. Each state answers to the Supreme Court and since they ruled abortion is legal, it is for every state unless a US Constitutional amendment bans it or the Court reverses itself. 




 OMG, that's what the movie's gonna be about, him finding his sister! 




 See this is where you call the cops and paramedics who should contact CPS. 




 Find an Arizona lawyer here: http://www.azbar.org/FindALawyer

Call up as many as you can and see if they'll take the case, but accept payment from any settlement/award you'll get from the landlord at a later date. The lawyer will decide if it seems like enough of a winnable case that they would risk that. 




 I would look into a lawyer if I were you. It's possible they need to repay you for the excess in electricity you've been paying for. 




 I'm just curious what GORPS means. 




 Napalmenator is. I directly asked him if he would subject his child to a situation in which he believed his child was being physically or sexually abused if the court ordered him to do so and he answered he would, by saying he would not violate a custody agreement.

I have made my point clear on what I would do and I stand by it: contact the police immediately and not let her son go over there in the meantime. I don't think any rationale parent in the world would subject their child to physical or sexual abuse just because of a custody agreement.

To pose the same question to you: Would you send your child into an environment you suspect they are being physically or sexually abused in, if there was a court that ordered you to do so? 




 What a cop out line.

So explain how a parent who purposefully places their child in a situation they suspect subjects that child to physical or sexual abuse is anything other than a bad parent. 




 That would make you an extremely bad parent. Some things are more important than the law. 




 As you should note then, I recommended she contact police immediately. In spite of all the things you mentioned, you did not answer the question. 




 I disagree. Would you send your child into an environment you suspect they are being physically or sexually abused in if there was a court that ordered you to do so? 




 I'm merely refuting one point of law advice with that of common sense. 




 I would agree with point 2 if it were not predicated on point 1. 




 I just somehow really doubt any judge would look at all the facts here and come to that conclusion. 




 A very good point! 




 It's not. It's rooted in life experience and common sense. 




 I respectfully disagree with point 1. If she feels it is likely her son is being sexually or physically abused she would be a bad person, let alone parent, to let her son go over there. If I were her, I would call the police immediately and report everything. They will likely have the son seen by a court ordered psychiatrist who will evaluate him and recommend any further action. 




 Sorry I can't answer more but I can confirm that it is illegal for them to enter without notice or an emergency. I don't know what the damages are or about moving the camera. 




 It actually is physically addictive to some people. Usually only serious users. They go through withdrawals and everything.

 Fake boob dude 




 Thank you for answering! 




 I mean, if it's so obvious can you answer at least one or two of the questions? 




 Yea, like an hour ago. What am I missing? 




 I was thing the same thing about the tapes but it's possible she deleted everything before the last couple days and just insinuate he had the tapes overwrite every few days. 




 Someone help me here cause I know there's a few hidden things near the end.

How did Amy get pregnant? The sperm bank? When did she get pregnant?

What were Affleck and the sister planning at the end? Not to kill her, but... Also, what was with the several instances of twincest insinuations? Was there actually something going on? Was that why the sister got THAT mad when she found him banging slutbag when she already hated the wife and was jealousy the reason she hated the wife? Did they ever mention why she hated the wife?

Why did he feel so trapped with her at the end? Why not just leave? Why not try to record her? She was obviously getting careless when she said she killed for him and he was fully clothed and could have been wearing a wire.

What was the significance of the dementia dad? There must have been something. Why did Affleck only visit him once in a year he had been in the old people home?

What was the significance of the parents borrowing from her trust?

And last, how in the world did Amy find out that Affleck was banging this girl in the fathers house, in the woodshed, etc.? 




 Awaiting the eventual comment you're all thinking. 




 Assuming their striking is equal, I assume the wrestler would go for a TD if he has no advantage on the feet, then the BJJ guy would sub him since the wrestler doesn't know any BJJ, no? 




 What kind of symptoms do you still have? 




 I guess the period was the FG in that case? 




 A touchdown for every letter in RELAX. 




 I mean four losses is the end for anybody though. How many people with four losses have they kept around for another fight? I can only think of Hardy, and that was b/c one was to GSP. 




 Dude's got the gift. If MM goes out and they need someone to fill his place ala PSH style, they know who to call. 




 Am I the only one who enjoys being called on and attempts to participate each class? Granted I'm a 1L so I have no idea if this is gonna fade over the next few years. 




 NO. Absolutely do not talk to the police anymore without a lawyer under any circumstances. 




 Ok, so purely from a financial standpoint, this is stupid. HOWEVER, it depends how much this is worth it to you intrinsically.

From a loans standpoint, you're decent. Your $30K in loans at 0% interest is about equal to $21.5K in loans if they were at 7% interest, a pretty standard rate, for the standard 10 year repayment period.

So if I were you, I'd figure out if your total loans after studying abroad, equal to $30K at 0% and $20K at 7%, are going to be in excess of 10% of your salary after graduating and getting a job. I calculated that you'd need to pay about $5700 a year in loans to pay them all back in 10 years, meaning if your expected salary upon graduation is above $57,000 then go for it, and if not don't. 




 Personally for me that would be close of a margin. Can you tough it out for another year? In general, with more job experience you will have an increase in salary and that might allow you to float by longer if the house goes vacant. Additionally, you can save an extra "vacancy fund" in this year's time. 




 Oh I completely agree. I just think everyone should be given some sort of due process, even if it is just a hearing. But that is just my opinion and has no effect on what is "right." Like you said, the NFL is a private corporation and can suspend anyone after an arrest. 




 I think the issue is very clear that AP did commit the abuse. He hasn't denied that in the least. You don't always have to let the justice system play out, if guilt or innocence is excessively obvious.

HOWEVER, I believe that everyone should be given due process. What this does not mean is that their due process must come from the govt directly. But a small hearing with impartial judges deciding AP's fate after hearing all of the evidence available? Yea, I think they'd be fine suspending him after that. Do you agree? 




 Shamrock had almost zero BJJ experience. My argument was both for someone smaller and with a moderate amount of experience. 




 I'm making a pretty mild claim here: that someone moderately athletic but with a massive size advantage could take down and punch someone with extremely limited grappling experience. 




 Oh I completely agree. 




 I'm talking hypothetically based on the dudes comment that untrained guys cannot beat champions. 




 Even an athletic 250 pound dude taking on a 125 pound champ?

There's a limit somewhere. 




 Dude 50's got at least 60 pounds on the dude and could probably get him down to the ground if he just charged at him. I think it'd be at least a semi-interesting fight. 




 So whichever of the three concurring opinions has the most senior justice is the majority?

Also your link does not work. 




 I'm not an expert but...

Although my below posted link does not explicitly say the residents did not receive money, it is heavily implied by the fact they were viewed as second class citizens who were wild.

http://history.howstuffworks.com/revolutionary-war/louisiana-purchase3.htm 




 I agree but you can't say you may want to pursue an action at a later time and at the same time turn down a police report on the matter. 




 Say there are 3 concurring opinions (with 2 justices each) and a dissent with 3 justices (and say the CJ is in the dissent). Which opinion become majority? 




 More than that, when he said that the driver offered to call the cops instead so they could make a ruling on the case and he goes "oh no, I don't talk to cops." Really dude? You don't get it both ways. 




 Ok your options seem to be: 1) drop out 2) go talk to your school's financial aid office and see if by some miracle they have a program that will help you 3) apply for private loans immediately and get your parents on as co-signers if you do not qualify by yourself 




 I don't think they are requiring that the jurors have no prior knowledge of the case or they would have moved jurisdictions already. 




 I'm by no means an expert in the subject but I'll try to answer. The number of deaths from 9/11 is massively higher than the vast majority of terrorist attacks. Just to give you a statistic, in 50% of all suicide terrorist attacks, the only person that dies is the suicide terrorist themselves. Not to mention that 9/11 was the mark of an absolute explosion in suicide terrorism across the world. If you were to look at a chart, you would see the number of deaths resulting from suicide attacks drastically increases in the following years. It's also just a marker that life as we knew it was over. Between the PATRIOT Act, increased airport security, and the creation of a new Dept of Homeland Security it just changed so much about our way of life. 




 I'm honestly not sure. Like I said, I didn't actually CAP, just went to UTSA, looked at what CAP required (I think a 3.2), figured as long as I had at least a 3.5 they wouldn't say no, then filled out another app for UT and got in.

Maybe someone else will know the answer. You can always post again on here, people are pretty nice about the whole thing since we were all in your shoes pretty recently. 




 Hey just to give you some hope, my SAT score was horrendous, like way below yours. I hadn't studied or taken school seriously at all in highschool, and I wasn't in the top half of my class, rank wise.

I didn't do CAP, but I did a year at UTSA and it was the easiest thing in the world. I made A's in all 10 classes including Fall and Spring then transferred to UT and actually just graduated (finished all my classes in July). And UT isn't exceptionally hard either. I can count on one hand the number of classes I didn't make A's in while there. Granted, I studied my ass off my entire time at both UTSA and UT. I say all this not to brag, and really hope it doesn't come off that way, but just to let you know it's not that bad to spend a year somewhere else and it's totally do-able. Good luck and let me know if you have any questions. 




 Wait are you the guy in question? I'm on mobile and the 'in context' doesn't go back far enough for me to see. 




 Ok, I'm not disputing that its taboo to have sex with someone besides a spouse.

The ONLY point I'm making is that a cheater (someone who has sex with someone besides their SO without their SO's permission) is a terrible person, in my opinion. 




 You don't have to. Nobody has to.

I'm judgmental because cheating destroys lives and is a horrible thing.

Are you judgmental on anything? Murder? Rape? Kidnapping? We all judge things we deem morally deplorable. Nobody is required to live up to another person's morality, but must suffer the consequences of their actions. One of the consequences of cheating is I will find you a terrible person. 




 It's highly implied that the spouses are not ok with it in the original posts. I think either one of them would have said so if their SO's were aware.

But if their spouses are ok with it, then nothing is wrong and they aren't scumbags. I stated this a couple replies up. 




 Those are not reasons why cheating on a spouse is legitimate. MANY things are more important than sex in a relationship. But a child growing up in a house where a parent has so little respect for their spouse that they cheat on them does not set a good example for that child. Do you disagree? 




 I see that and agree. But there's plenty in here that is just consensual stuff going on, whereas this is non-consensual to their SO's. The cheaters should not be encouraged, in my opinion. 




 There are no legitimate reasons, therefore it makes the person a shitty person no matter what.

What you're saying is tantamount to someone admitting to killing their 5 year old child in a gleeful manner (which is the attitude this guy and girl gave off bragging of their cheating) and you saying you'll "wait to hear all the facts." A reasonable person can conclude that its not necessary to hear much more, and if there was a justification, the people would have said it. 




 Give me a legitimate reason on why someone cannot/won't leave their SO.

What else would they do? LEAVE THEIR SO. That is the alternative to cheating.

I am commenting on what a reasonable person could take from the post, that they are having sex with other people, without the permission of their SO. It seems a reasonable person would take those to be the substantial facts here.

 




 I'm pointing out that their SO's don't know the cheating is going on. If you're cheating on someone, it makes you a shitty person. Leave the person if you really can't stop yourself from sleeping with someone else. 




 This makes you and her both pretty terrible people, assuming both if your SO's don't know. 




 Appreciate the support. 




 I never said the case was clear. I merely said it was not alleged, it was a matter of fact. The United States court system allows for an allegation to become fact upon conviction by a jury of your peers. That is an indisputable fact.

Edit: Just for fun, I'll comment along with you. You didn't give context and I haven't read the interview, but I'll assume the quotations are from Tyson.

Point 1: Tyson says he did less time b/c the judge did not believe he committed the crime. This is where I introduce the concept that correlation=/=causation. Just b/c he was given less time than others does not equate to the fact that the judge believed he was not guilty. There were several other mitigating circumstances, such as the fact that some of the evidence was not as strong, or the fact that he had no prior felonies. Further, a Court of Appeals certified that the evidence was strong enough that he should not even be granted a retrial. If he really thought people believed he did not commit the crime, then why didn't the Court of Appeals vacate his conviction or at the very least give him a new trial?

Point 2: Tyson says that just b/c she falsely claimed she was raped once, she should never have put herself in that position. What position? The position of having entering a hotel room? The position of hanging out with someone you don't know alone? Any of these contentions are absolutely ridiculous and have no bearing on proof of his guilt or innocence and the very fact that he made these contentions is insulting to all rape victims. 




 No but it's ruling is taken as fact. 




 Hey just a note, but it's not an "alleged" rape. He was convicted by a jury of his peers. He is for all intents and purposes guilty of rape and therefore it is treated as a matter of fact, not allegation.

Edit: LOL to all the haters. Feel free to downvote me. It's a matter of fact that upon conviction by a jury of your peers, an allegation is seen by fact for all intents and purposes. If you wanna hate on me for stating a something that is unilaterally true, at least have the decency to comment with a reason.

Edit 2: Goddamn you guys are just a bunch of whiners about this. I point out one factually relevant point about a post and you guys fly off your hinges. I always assumed my fellow /r/MMA-ers were a cool bunch of folks, but I have been proven otherwise. Have fun debating others about how facts don't apply to you bunch. 




 Contact the police in the meantime and have record of ownership (vet records, if your dog is chipped, adoption records, etc.). You will get your dog back immediately.

In the meantime the guy can sue you for $1000, which I would guess you MIGHT be obligated to pay, but not anything above that as any judge will find that $1000 is a reasonable reward.

If you don't know where the guy lives who has your dog, I would set up a fake meeting, telling him you have the $1500 then call the police once he shows up unwilling to give you the dog, and follow him if he leaves the meeting spot while maintaining contact with police. 




 As the other guy said, implied consent.

Here's a hypo:
Man in car crash. Man loses consciousness and suffers severe lacerations. Emergency medical workers show up and treat the lacerations. Man regains consciousness. Man refuses ambulance ride after stabilized and walks home.

Do you think the man would not be required by a court to pay for his treatment?

 Anderson Silva was probably the GOAT at one point between Fedor and Jon Jones. 




 Should've been a no contest like the Maynard fight where he knocked himself out in the slam. 




 No judge will count the cost of wood flooring under a carpet and padding as ruined by cat pee. If I were you I would tell her she has no evidence of ruining the wood and it is unreasonable for her to count it in your damages.

In most cases, you are required to give 30 days notice, even after a lease runs out. You will automatically revert to a month to month tenant with no lease and this is one of the requirements. You're saying you gave her 26 days notice? I am not a lawyer, and you should consult one for an answer, but I would think you would only have to reimburse those four days so for example if your rent was $500 then you would have to reimburse 500*(4/30)= $66.67

I would consult a lawyer for advice on these issues if I were you but ultimately take her to small claims court without a lawyer. In many states you can sue for 2-3 times the money that is rightfully yours. 




 So the carpet wasn't new when you moved in. She is entitled to charge you proportionally for the life expectancy of the carpet for the damage you did. Say life expectancy was 10 years and carpet cost $500. If it was 5 years old, and the cat pee ruined it then you owe $250.

If I were you, I would let her know that you know you are aware that you only owe for the life expectancy you prematurely ended. You ask her to produce a receipt or official record of when the carpet was purchased, what the cost was, and what the life expectancy was. If she refuses and continues to pursue further you take her to small claims court. 




  I'm not a lawyer, but I am in law school and studied several cases taught by law school professors in undergrad. And something I've learned is that if a reasonable person can imply something then it has at least some consideration. Here, the landlord could reasonably conclude that she had leased the property for a minimum of one year. That is why I came to my conclusion. 




  she basically said that even if she filled the apartment, she would continue to charge us until December due to inconvenience.

This is generally illegal. I do not specifically know the laws of your state, but in general you can only sue for ACTUAL damages. If she is not losing any money, she will not win any damages.
 




 If she has emails of you implying you know your lease is for a year, then you should be prepared to lose in court. I am not giving you binding legal advice, but absent of any other major factors, this seems like a 50/50 case.

Have you looked into subleasing? You should be able to find someone to sublease your place for a couple months and usually around the same rent you are paying as that is most likely near the market rate. Also, be sure to check your lease on the legalities of it. But even if it is against your lease, your landlord may be willing to make an exception (GET IT IN WRITING IF SHE DOES) because she most likely wants to avoid a big legal headache as much as you do. 




 Not the same thing. 




 I guess we just look at the concept differently, which is completely ok. To me, a situation is either just or not whereas it seems you are viewing it on an individual level.

To expand on my main post, I feel that if we condone this behavior in any way, i.e. calling it just for one party, then that is going to encourage others in similar situations, resulting in a VERY slippery slope. 




 The fact of the matter is, in this case yes the guilt was kind of clear, and many will argue the punishment fit. But if you allow vigilante justice, you screw the whole system.

What about a guy that's "pretty sure" someone else killed his dog? Can he go destroy that guy's car? What about a case like this, but the driver were not drunk, and merely hit a pothole causing the car to swerve and kill these two kids? Would he deserve to die in that case?

At the end of the day, we as a society have agreed that anyone, guilty or innocent, deserve their day in court before they are punished. The driver in this case was deprived of that. For me, that is injustice. 




 Fair point. But that doesn't matter. Walmart will pay out the ass before this goes to trial and if they don't a jury will still find that the Loss Prevention guys clearly went above what was reasonable in hitting him in the face once he was on the ground. 




 Classic case of jury nullification. I read another article with more/different details.

Basically the guy was pushing his car (ran out of gas) with his two sons in what was basically the middle of nowhere, but still near this guy's house. Drunk driver plows into sons and kills them. Then drunk driver is shot to death almost immediately. They are 100 yards from guy who just had his son's died house. The ammunition the drunk driver was shot with matches ammunition that was found in guy's house.

Defense's argument was someone else randomly came and shot the drunk driver. Small town jury felt sorry for the man and acquitted in face of obvious beyond a reasonable doubt evidence. Due to double jeopardy the man will never be found guilty. Justice? You decide.  




 Unfortunately that dude is gonna have a LARGE payout. Walmart employee caught on video battering an unarmed man already on the ground? That's a 6 figure payout. 




 Why would you ask that? Are you a bloodist? 




 Dominick Cruz will be champ within the next year.

 Literally. 




 You are definitely going to want to contact a real estate lawyer about this. They will let you know if you need to be on the contract as well as help you write up an agreement regarding ownership. 




 Wrong. In many states the age of consent is 16. I think it's 14 in Hawaii.

 Well that's that. It is his building. 




 Hey I know this isn't a budget post, but just some rough advice. If I were you, I'd consider one of two options:

1) Move in with parents if they have room and allow it and put ALL available money towards the loans. Even if you are only making minimum wage, at 40 hours a week (and if your job isn't full time, get a second one), you should be earning $1100 after taxes per month. Live like a pauper on $200, and pay $900 a month towards the loans. Do this as long as you can.

2) Pick up and move to the oil fields in the Midwest or Texas, or go work on a fishing boat in Alaska. Yes it will suck and it's dangerous, but you'll clear $100K a year and have the loans paid back in 2 years. 




 Curiosity compels me to ask what exactly do you do as an independent contractor and how you were able to grow your income so fast. 




 What state, if you don't mind? 




 While I agree with the advice, there's almost zero possibility this person will agree to meet at a police station and suggesting so may spook them so that OP will never get the car back.

Why not meet in the store parking lot with a guy friend? 




 Red's Saloon. I just moved here too and its my go to Packer bar. 




 Just moved to San Diego in July and that's the bar I go to! (Although I didn't make it out tonight, so I'm not in the picture.) 




 No problemo! Glad to spread the knowledge! I was an econ major and did plenty of statistics studies in undergrad, so I can see it from your view. 




 I was hoping someone would catch that. 




 I'm betting you paid with a credit card, no? You can always do a chargeback with the CC company.

If I were you, I'd politely request a refund, minus some money for the work they have done already, and if they refuse do a chargeback, then negotiate with them for the amount of work done already. 




 Well my opinion is that that fact is mind blowing. 




 Wrong. Quoting from the article: "The fixed ratio of AS/H in our population was 1.02 for males versus 1.01 for females."

AS/H means arm span to height ratio. The ratios are virtually identically.

Here's your peer reviewed source written by Phd's in the field: http://m.erj.ersjournals.com/content/37/1/157.full 




 But they are heavily correlated and the average person has a wingspan equal to their height. 




 That just sucks so much for him. From Romil's point of view he spent 21 years completely alone just to die a couple hours later. 




 Yea. Here's the thing, this movie was what, 100-200 years in the future? I'll grant them that they have an artificial uterus that can house the eggs until birth, but then what? Anne Hathaway and the robot have take care for hundreds of babies? I mean even if that robot is 100% about the babies all day long, doesn't the ship only contain a few years worth of food? So Hathaway has to farmer the crap out of the planet for her and 500 other mouths and simultaneously raise all these babies into at least 10 year olds until they can start contributing. I don't envy the task. 




 Saw a theory in these comments that said something like: it was an alternate timeline where humans survived the first time around, but decided to set it up where this timeline's humans survived most likely b/c it is a better existence than theirs. It stands to reason that if the future humans could control the 5th dimension, they could control the alternate timeline.

It's not perfect logic, but it works for me. 




 Neither. They said in the movie that "them" was humans far, far in the future, like hundreds of thousands of years, that had evolved into being able to control the 5th dimension. 




 Marcus' reach is 4" longer, but he's 3" shorter. Weird. 




 Is THIS what's going on?

I raise my hand to ask and answer questions at least twice a class, and some people just seem to hate me. I've played on IM sports teams with different groups at my law school and people seem friendly to me on the team and I get along with people in small groups, but I'm never invited to any group study sessions and nobody wants to work with me on the group research project. 




 The wording is a little weird, but they mean the unemployment rate in terms of full time, JD required jobs is above 20% for all but 20/200 schools. 




 I'm with you. What percentage of the population is open to torturing a child to death? 0.1%? I mean seriously, what are the odds they got together? Insanely low. 




 This. OP's parents should spend a couple hundred dollars to verify this with a lawyer who deals with international law issues on a personal level. 




 Next time just say "I had a very large soda for lunch, please excuse me for a minute" and go to the bathroom. 




 This prompted me to look at other terrible games.

I found Kim McQuilken, who went 5/26 with 43 yards, 0 TDs and 5 Ints. How the hell does he not get pulled earlier?! 




 That seems to be the consensus between other posters. Because if Romilly had gotten the robot properly working, he would have realized a all the supposed resources the planet had were nonexistent. 




 I too hated the paradox of future self giving info to past self causing him to become future self and it is the one thing I noticed in the film as someone with a modest to low knowledge of theoretical physics that just doesn't jive with any part of sound theory.

For the embryos part, I assumed they were scientifically advanced enough where they had artificial wombs to birth the children. Although it would still be a massive pain in the ass to care for all those babies. 




 Out of those movies , I have only seen Cloud Atlas so I can't speak to the others. In my opinion, Interstellar had the perfect recipe of tiptoeing just on the line of unbelievableness without crossing that line. I've yet to see a movie that placed itself above Interstellar in that respect. 




 It has a 71% rating mean that roughly 3/10 reviews say it is a bad movie overall. That fact is almost more mind blowing than the movie itself. 




 No way. I've seen all those and they don't compare at all. This too science fiction elements of several different kinds and blended them into a tale that stretches across about 90 years with significant portions at different points along the way. Further, it expands with physics to a point jusssst on the edge of unbelievable but theoretically sound enough for the average person. 




 That's just his Texas twang for ya 




 As a former Realtor, it is absolutely LAUGHABLE that any reputable company, let alone a bank, would use Zillow to calculate a home's value. Zillow is damn near worthless for accurate home values.
 




 You're right. It's tens of thousands of people who voted the exact way he described! 




 I misspoke. It can't be enforced below minimum wage. 




 They can't go below federal minimum wage. 




 And maters gonna mate 




 Or make election "day" 2 days long and everyone who works day 1 is not allowed to work day 2 and vice-versa. 




 I honestly believe he'd rather be playing. Do you not? 




 Ok. They willfully intoxicating themselves knowing it would vastly increase their risk of killing someone. 




 Completely agree with you. When someone beats their kid that bad and just doesn't see it as wrong, I feel like it is extremely hard to get them to turn their views around. I don't believe anything less than a couple years could make someone feel genuine remorse, especially not missing a few weeks of football.
 




 I mean it's only child abuse, right? 




 People that drive drunk don't intend to hurt anyone, but sometimes they kill people. Apply the same logic. 




 Here's a fun comic on entrapment. Kinda long, but you'll know entrapment pretty well if you make it to the end.

http://thecriminallawyer.tumblr.com/post/19810672629/12-i-was-entrapped 




 First file a claim with your insurance for the accident.

Second, do you have a lawyer helping with the lawsuit? If so, he can probably best answer your question. If not, just be honest in court and tell them everything. 




 If they haven't been paying their loan for 2 years, then this isn't "out of nowhere." In fact, that's about the longest a bank will go without payment before starting foreclosure proceedings.

In short, they've been duped by this "negotiator." While he may help some people, a bank WANTS people to pay the loan. They will help you go through modification to a certain extent, usually. Rarely, does a person need a negotiator to talk to the bank for them. If the bank wouldn't negotiate after a year of non-payment, it seems they would never negotiate, which is exactly what happened here.

Here's some food for thought. How long have they owned the home? More than 10 years? It's likely the bank would LOVE for the family to stop paying and foreclose on the house at that point. I'm gonna make up some numbers:
Lets say they bought the house for $100K, taking a loan for $90K
After 15 years, they only owe $60K
Meanwhile, the house is appreciating 4% per year and is now worth $180K

In that scenario, and the numbers in real life might be worse or better for your boyfriend's family, the bank would be able to sell the home and PROFIT $120K. They would be insane to renegotiate any loan when they could profit by letting the home go to foreclosure. I'm strongly suspecting something like that is what's taking place here, and is the reason the bank refuses to renegotiate.
 




 /u/hansSA is right. You need couples counseling. Here's the thing: you're in denial over your husband meeting a man for a gay relationship on match. That's understandable in this situation. What would never fly in any situation would be if I asked my SO to go to counseling because I perceived a problem in our relationship that I thought required professional help and my SO refused to go to counseling. Right then would be the time that I would look to get out of the relationship, because at that point I would know the person does not care about your feelings in the relationship.


Suggest couples counseling, and if he refuses, I would start looking for an out if I were you. 




 I would 100% mention that you do not live in the US and do not intend to return. That is the only leverage you have, because otherwise they will just wage garnish like they do with all the others. 




 

Since it is legal, and the original owner has no recourse, everyone should tweet/email/FB Spirit about how shitty they are for stealing this person's idea. 




 Thanks! 




 So I've read all the comments and I'm still not sure who the fighter is. 




 Oh gotcha. I see the argument both ways. Seems like the UFC and any other media need to define p4p next to the ranking. 




 Can you expand on your second definition? You just repeated "pound for pound." 




 "Yea, this will make us look real tough! Let's shove our fingers in their butts!"

I sincerely don't understand the logic sometimes. 




 Or repeat business if he just seals the cat in again! 




 Can you go to a therapist or perhaps have one come to you if you are unable to leave the house? You could do some therapy with the boyfriend and ultimately tell him with the therapist there. He would have someone to tell him "yes this is real and its not going to change" and also help him deal with his feelings on the matter. 




 Chael vs Vitor

I know people like to hate on Chael, but he's my guilty pleasure.

I thought he could wrestle Vitor and with it, I'm sure he would have gotten a title shot. I just want him to get the title he promised his dad he would get. (tear) 




 Could be any number of reasons. Maybe the suicidal man came to the window and pointed the gun at them and SWAT was outside the whole time. 




 Lots of times these kinds of waivers will not hold up in court. If there was a case of actual negligence you can still sue. 




 In bankruptcy, in most cases the court cannot take your house, or car. 




 They have been stripped of their firearms and are on suspension. It says it right in the article. It's standard procedure for any officer involved in a shooting. 




 I did that in middle school then they banned it. So I just had to be more sneaky ;) 




 Maybe it reflects upon them. But I would never assume the actions of an individual were with bad intentions merely because they belonged to a government organization where there had been stories of unlawful actions before.

You guys are literally assuming these guys are guilty until proven innocent. That's not how a society should operate. 




 Let's put you in that scenario. You're on the SWAT team that responded and the suicidal guy points a gun at you. Do you fire?

I would argue that any cop in that situation has "no choice" but to fire at the man. 




 The fact that you're referring to it's only what you've seen is the very definition of anecdotal evidence and therefore no air quotes are needed. 




 So you're going with the assumption that they are guilty until proven innocent, just to be clear? 




 I said "So are you just comfortable judging **this** SWAT team..." and you answered "Basically yeah..." and now you say "I wasn't specifying this SWAT team..."

You're backing out and spewing some good ol' fashioned cop hating, when all I'm doing is reiterating the point that none of us know the true facts and we shouldn't based our opinions of **this specific case** on a news report that doesn't give us the full story of what happened.

You have some good points, but your blanket hatred of all cops seem to have clouded your judgement. 




 These exact people on this SWAT team? 




 You don't know that these specific people on this SWAT team have done anything, unless you know something more than the rest of us. 




 Well I hope you never sit on a jury in that case. 




 I just don't understand how this is a rebuttal to Dolce. I think BJ had an off night and could have performed better. The fact that Dolce thinks he had amazing conditioning and was beating up the guys they brought in has nothing to do with that and why BJ blames Dolce for his loss blows my mind. 




 So are you just comfortable judging this SWAT team based on your preconceived notions with absolutely zero evidence? 




 Your story is nothing more than anecdotal evidence. It does not show it reflects the intentions of SWAT teams elsewhere.

Here, we don't have the full story. It is entirely possible the suicidal man got frustrated and aimed his gun at police who at that point would have no choice but to shoot him. Or its entirely possible something much like the scenario you described played out and they killed the guy on purpose. 




 I don't understand how people pick split decisions. Are you deciding the judges will suck? Or just that there will be a round that is a legitimate 100% toss up round?

If it's just close rounds then you'd pick the winner of the majority, no? 




 Aldo. Listen I'm not crazy, I know Aldo gasses. I know when he gasses he is susceptible to getting laid on (Hominick). I figure he'll stuff some TD's, maybe get taken down once or twice in the first two rounds but pop up soon enough where it doesn't count against him too much, and outstrike Mendes through the first 3 rounds to take them by a close margin, then get laid on for 4 and 5 but not finished from the bottom. 48-47 Aldo 




 I like how it took him 15 minutes to think of that last reply. Like he kept thinking of a follow up, but would erase it over and over thinking "no, that's not good enough" and THAT'S what he settled on?? 




 I'm not saying it's not possible but just be aware that there is a remote chance he was the beneficiary of a trust or his wife is or they won a small lottery, have a rich uncle or any other possibility. 




 Could the kid not wash it off themselves? 




 What was Rumble's deal? I remember Dana saying he was in danger of being permanently banned and I remember it was for what I thought was BS but I don't remember the specifics. 




 Before anybody bitches about it, the grammar in the title is correct. 









 I really thought that was going to end with "gay." Not that the premise would necessarily line up with the conclusion, but damn it just fits. 




 That ending. He was SO close to getting out. 




 It's quite possible he has a wealthy spouse or a trust fund or any number of other things. Just because someone's job has them making less money than they're spending does not always mean they are corrupt.

Have you considered that maybe since he's home by 2 every day that he's putting his time to good use and running a successful online business or something similar? 




 Wait, why? 




 Is this true? Can you cite a law, either Federal or state?

I just moved to California and nearly every single business here asks to see my ID when I pay with a credit card. 




 The first step would be talking to other employees and getting them to go with you to talk to a lawyer about the matter. Most likely, the other side will get audited by an independent accountant who will calculate the damages. 




 Of course, it's happening right now. China claims Taiwan, but many regulatory bodies recognize Taiwan as its own state and Taiwan did not win a war over China to gain independence. 




 Yep. 




 Thank you for taking the time to answer! 




 Disagree again. What if the UN and every other country in the world recognizes the new country but the host country refuses to go to war with the new country. In that case would you recognize that a Declaration would be a legal document? 




 I might be misunderstanding myfunnynamewastaken's question, but I think he's asking how one would know if they truly don't want to be an attorney whatsoever or if they're just having 1L blues. 




 Another 1L here: So does the lawyer for one side say the evidence is prima facie, then the other lawyer can rebut it and it's no longer prima facie? 




 What about nations that just declare their independence and do not go to war with their former host country? 




 ALL law was created at one point or another by its own institutions. You say emancipation is a legal process. The courts who made it a law gave itself that power. That is my argument for why the Declaration was a legal document.

Also, I never said anyone could reference the Declaration, only that  




 I guess we'll just have to disagree. I think one country formally declaring they are no longer part of another is inherently a legal procedure.

I would liken it to a minor declaring independence from a parent by emancipation, which I don't think you would disagree is a legal procedure. 




 My mistake on the source, however the Declaration most certainly is a legal document. It is breaking off connection from another country's rule. 




 Well I was just going by what the founding fathers defined as rights. 




 I completely disagree. Sweden doesn't have MORE of a right, they just have less chance of their right being taken away, an important distinction.

Nonetheless, for your Colorado example, the Constitution doesn't guarantee the degree of a right, only that there is that right. 




 Yes, there is a "right to life" even if we have the death penalty. I am arguing that the govt can validly take away rights. It's the user I was replying to that is arguing otherwise. 




 No, both are ok. I'm not arguing either is not ok. The power to veto is a check on power and is the very essence of our democracy, as is the power to filibuster. 




 Obama would never let that happen. He can manufacture a trillion dollar coin, simply order the debt payments continue as a matter of national security, or any number of other scenarios. Also the Republicans took a beating in the polls last time they pulled that stunt, and seem unlikely to try again.

Also, can you give me a source on him saying they would default if they won the Senate? I had not heard that. 




 No. How could it be? 




 Dana does, and he watches it the whole fight. You see it in a lot of his vlogs. 




 I guess the moral is, most challengers think you gotta have something extra up your sleeve if you wanna beat the best. 




 That's not true. There is a right to life, which can be taken away by the death penalty. There is a right to liberty, which can be taken away via a prison sentence. And there is a right to property, which can be taken away via seizure or eminent domain.

Were you thinking those weren't rights or that we shouldn't be able to have any of them taken away? 
























 8, plus most of the game he was injured in. Plus several games in earlier seasons. Altogether, it adds up to about the same number of games Brady or Peyton have missed in their careers due to injury, but I see your point. 




 By that logic, it doesn't matter if someone was great 2 seasons ago (or last season for that matter) if they have fallen off now. 




 After this season, he will have 2 MVP seasons, and a Super Bowl MVP. You don't think someone with those stats should make it in the HOF? 




 Rodgers has already had an injury that sidelined him for most of the season and come back from it. 




 You're good. Most people here see your intent. I was just pointing it out for OP. 




 I'm sorry, but that's just not right. Banks look at intangibles. There's no way they'd trust two 18 year olds with $100,000 loan. This guy's "work history" was a retail store as a teenager. No loan officer would approve that. Like I said earlier, is it possible? Yes. Likely? Not a chance. 




 Dude I'm not saying it's not possible. Just that it's unlikely. This was retail, not life guarding. He would also have to have averaged 35 hours a week while in school full time, never taking sick or vacation days, never spend ANY of the money, and find a bank willing to loan a couple of 18 year olds somewhere in the order of $100,000.

Taken in its entirety, it seems unbelievable. 




 I don't doubt that it's not possible. But **16 years ago**, working retail as a 16 year old. Nobody would be paying $12/hour. 




 No don't post the yelp review here.

Now, if you didn't actually do anything that you're aware of, he likely has very little evidence (if any) that you did this. Any judge will see through this charade as an attempt to scare you off your claim of collecting your paycheck. It will be painfully obvious to everyone. 

Also, did he threaten to sue you over text, letter, phone call, or voicemail? If anything besides phone call, save all the evidence for court. 




 Just to reiterate on that 2nd point, OP.

We were all young and dumb at some point in our lives. Unless we have been told before, we don't know not to talk to the cops and fully trust them as authority figures.

Yes, you told them everything which will be used against you in court, but at 17, me and any number of people on this sub who like to chide people for doing that probably would have done the same thing in your situation.

Eventually you'll be past this. As for now, the best thing you can do is hire a lawyer if you can afford one. 




 Maybe knock on the apt door and ask the guy if he's month to month. Because if he's not, he'll want to have a word with the landlord as well. 




 I think Johny was a little too mad for the interview. 




 That's what I feel is going on here. Does the dude have 1.5M met worth? Probably. But I doubt he earned it starting from purely a retail high school income and investing in housing with his other 18 year old friend to get himself started. 




 But this guy would have had to make that same amount nearly 16 years ago. Inflation kills a lot of that. 




 I don't need you to lie, buddy. But let me entertain the question: how on earth do I seem insane? I'm legitimately questioning the guy when his story doesn't add up.

If it's a lie, then he should probably stop misleading people. I'm not saying it is, only that his story is suspicious, as numerous others have pointed out here. ~~But if calling people out doesn't matter, why are you doing it to me? I mean truly, who should be the one to "shut the fuck up and move on"?~~ 




 Yea I agree. There's just no way.

I'm trying to give this guy the benefit of the doubt, but he's making it hard.

Like if he said his grandparents gifted him $10K, and his dad was a contractor by trade (to the point he could actually learn how to rehab a house by 18), and he got his loans from a hard money lender that happened to be his uncle. Yea, then I'd believe a little more. But with this story and his refusal to answer specific questions, I'm suspicious at best. 




 I'm just pointing out what doesn't make sense, and since you are refusing to clarify I cannot see how it would be possible. 




 That's not how it works... If she turns 15 tomorrow and he turned 17 yesterday, the age difference is only 2 years and 2 days. 




 How off? I just don't see it unless you were earning at LEAST $12 an hour (which almost nobody would pay a teenager in retail in 1998). I mean you still had some expenses as you admitted in other posts here. You still had school, and you probably took some sick days here and there. I mean it's just a bit unrealistic when you insist that you did this all without any family help.

Also how in the world did you get a bank to loan you tens of thousands of dollars to you and your partner with almost no experience and no credit? 




 Assuming you were making around 7.25 an hour, which would be appropriate for a 16 year old retail job, to earn $20k, you would have to have averaged over 30 hours per week every single week, after taxes, to save that amount in 2 years. That's assuming you never spent a single penny. On top of this you were in highschool for these 2 years.

That's just not realistic.

Edit: just realized you worked in 98. At a retail job, your wage almost surely would not have been more than 6.50, (5.50 or so after taxes). Meaning you would have had to average nearly 35 hours a week with no sick days, and never spending a penny. 




 I'm not saying there is a law that states he can detain people. I'm saying the bartender has a moral duty to call the cops and that laws designed to prevent rape override company policy in any reasonable person. 




 How did you get $20K from 16 to 18?

Did you go to college?

What kind of job did you have, and can you give a rough break estimate of your earnings throughout your 20's? 




 You realize laws overrule "policy"? 




 Smoke sesh brah 




 My 1L Property prof JUST covered this as a hypo today. According to him, the Blue Neighbor would get an Easement by Necessity across Purple Neighbor's land.

This situation is complicated by the fact that Purple informed Blue of fencing in the gravel road area, but it seems to me that a judge will require the easement across Purple's land, and for Blue to compensate Purple for it. 




 See now you have a reasonable argument there. There was likely something in your contract that said they must provide you with reasonable service, which any judge would determine Sprint did not.

OP, on the other hand, he just wants out (and maybe reasonably so), but you gotta pay according to the terms of the contract. 




 Just FYI, you signed the contract that (I'm assuming) stated when you terminate, you are responsible for the full last month. So you are no longer bound by the contract, but are bound by that condition. I understand why you're angry, but you literally signed the contract stating you would abide by that condition.

No judge will let you out of this. It will only ruin your credit score, costing you money in the future in the form of higher interest rates if you had a higher credit score.

Just pay it. 




 Then it would have been on to /r/legaladvice. Man Reddit really does have everything! Dude should get his budget checked over at /r/personalfinance  while he's at it. 




 I'm not saying it made him fight a bad fight, only that it most likely affected him in some way. I think he would have done better if he did not have the mental aspect of nearly dying from the weight cut, and I don't see how you could argue against that.

I'm sure it was you, but whatever, deny all you want. It was minutes after my comment, deep into our comment tree when you're the only one likely to see it or with any motive to downvote. Further, you only had 1 upvote on your previous 2/3 comments, meaning if it was someone else, it's highly likely they would have downvoted me and upvoted you at the same time. 




 I am simply saying it is more likely that he is affected more than the average fighter based on the fact that he almost died from a weight cut. Even if it is only a mental effect, every time he cuts to 205, it's somewhere in his mind that he nearly died, likely affecting his performance even a minimal amount.

Also, you're a jerk for down voting my opinion. 




 Dude. At least spray paint it the same color. I had my car keyed and did that. Nobody can tell unless they're less than 5 feet away. 




 How are you debunking it? With what evidence? My argument is that it has a possible mental effect on DC enough to affect his performance. You cannot conclusively say DC would not have performed better at 205 without the weight cut. 




 I'm just saying, it's a factor. 




 A bottle of ketchup in 40 seconds?! Yeesh! 




 Unless the weight cut takes too much out of them. Remember, DC had to be hospitalized for kidney failure and almost died in the Olympics when he cut to 211 pounds. Now he wants to cut 6 MORE pounds. Yea, he's probably on a diet to help the cut, but it's just a factor to keep in mind. 




 If we both win out, then it still comes down to week 17 for division title, you know. 




 It's so funny how the other side sees it. It took me a second to even remember what you were referencing.

To me: we barely missed sealing the game by Adams' fingertips.

That's POV for you though. 




 So refreshing. 




 With my taxes, absolutely. It is a problem of our society, and we should solve it as a society.

Edit: Not to mention, the cost of what? A few port-a-potty's and a dumpster? Yes I think that is cheap enough where it shouldn't even be a controversial issue. 




 I think one nice act is pretty good. They are not totally responsible for all the people they feed. Are they responsible for housing the homeless as well just because they feed them? 




 Surely the solution would not be to provide them with bathrooms and trashcans, but instead cut off their food supply. 




 Third Parties ~~can never~~ are very very unlikely to win in First Past the Post systems. It's [Duverger' Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law). 




 Gerrymandering 




 More likely, flexibility. 




 I was just pointing out the difference between the words though. 




 I was not pointing out anything specific to this series of events. Only the difference between objective and subjective. 




 100% disagree. You never know when you could be fired, have your car stop working, family member die and need to attend the funeral, etc. That's the whole point of emergency funds. I fully believe everyone should make 6+ months of expenses a priority. I don't think he needs to sell any possessions to reach that emergency fund amount, only that any excess money go to the emergency fund before anything else, including debt or retirement.

Edit: Your point that 6 months is overkill unless you have dependents or a mortgage seems logically wrong. Why would either of those decrease the amount of emergency fund you need in time? It seems those should only effect the amount of emergency fund you have, which is already controlled for by saving 6 times monthly expenses. 




 Objectively reasonable belief does not mean specific to the person, only to the standard of a reasonably prudent person.

You're thinking "subjective." 




 Hey, just to piggyback on this post and give you some more opinions, I definitely think you need more than $1K as an emergency fund. What if you lose your job? 6 months of expenses should be the MINIMUM. I'd bet that would be at least $8K for you, if not more, depending on your expenses. 




 Eh.... sure. 




 I enjoyed 22 Jump Street far more than this sequel. HB2 had some decently funny moments, but nothing crazy. The beginning of how they got into their predicament felt too forced. And the movie just didn't capture the magic the first one had (jokes were almost too raunchy to make up for lack of plot).


SPOILER BELOW!!!














They could have just filed a lawsuit and not had to go through with the entire process. The excuse given in the movie for not filing the lawsuit was "oh the other side has powerful lawyers." People still sue Walmart. This was a textbook case of breach of contract they had and they would have easily won in court. 




 Yea, I've lived in the middle of Texas and now southern California my whole life. Something tells me we don't have the same definitions of "incredibly temperate." 




 I'm seeing it.... Yea, I'm there. 




 That was rude. 




 I don't get this. 




 When did he become governor of Alaska?!? Man I miss some big news sometimes. 




 Wait did this actually happen or are you just being funny? 




 At this point, can we just skip the Siver fight and have Conor fight Aldo now. Then at least Edgar can get his rematch sooner. I'd have him fight Lamas for the next shot at the same time Aldo/Conor happens. 




 I'm not going to say this is a good option, or that I'm recommending it, only that it IS an option:

You could always lie to her and tell her you love her and want to be with her but will break up with her unless she has an abortion. And afterwards you actually can break up with her.

Important to note: if you take this route she will likely hate you forever and fall into a deep depression. On the other hand, if you think she willfully lied to you about her taking proper birth control, you might not care. 




 Thanks for the info! 




 Ok, that makes sense. Is a borrower able to drop it if they refinance, like PMI? 




 It is for the life of the loan. That's why you need to refinance to get rid of it.

Edit: I think I'm confusing MIP for PMI. If so, please disregard. 




 You're wrong. And for a very simple reason: preventative care is cheaper than fixing a health problem.

You ask what incentive people have to stay healthy. The incentive to live longer! It would go against human instinct to let yourself get sick merely because your healthcare was free.

Back to preventative care. It is VASTLY cheaper to use healthcare to stop a disease before it happens than to heal one after it already starts. With free healthcare, you would have most of the population going to the doctor multiple times per year to stay healthy or catch health problems early. Whereas today, many Americans wait to go to the doctor until the last second because they cannot afford healthcare.

Further, people who wait until the last second for their healthcare are often using their local ER, which is substantially more expensive than a family doctor. And because they are poor and have no health insurance, the cost is passed onto tax payers.

As a country we pay more per person for healthcare than any other nation in the world, and it's not even close. And for this, we receive less services. Many thousands of Americans DIE every year directly because of a lack of access to affordable healthcare. That is not a recipe for success. Single payer is the most economical and moral solution. 




 For some countries, yes, it is a longer wait time, but for others they actually have shorter average wait times to see doctors than the US. I specifically remember one study that broke down wait times by service received and by country. I don't have it off the top of my head right now since I'm in the middle of studying for finals right now (ugh law school), but I will try to find the source and edit it in by tomorrow. 




 Cheaper per capita, longer life spans, less medical bankruptcies, shorter waits for doctors (in some countries-not all- and only for the lower four quintiles of income, since the rich will always get their healthcare in the US), not to mention much lower costs per service since they are substantially less bloated with beauracracy as insurance isn't big in most of those countries.

The biggest thing though is that the poor in those countries are much likely to receive preventative care and thus save the ER room bloat when they would otherwise go in for the flu when it's about to kill them instead of receiving a small amount of care a week earlier. This saves the govt in those countries billions every year. 




 Right there with you buddy. Econ major here who studied health economics under a couple PhD's while in undergrad, and it's just mind blowing how much better and cheaper those systems work. 




 Wait. You're saying you don't think single payer is the most economical healthcare solution? 




 Instead I'll leave this quotation that is on point instead. It has a source in it. Just for background, I'm a law student and virtually everyone in the community sees Chemerinsky as the premier legal scholar on Constitutional Law. Here he is talking directly about Obama enforcing the immigration order:

The president clearly and unquestionably has the authority to do this, said Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Irvine School of Law. Presidents always get to decide what laws to enforce or not enforce. Chemerinsky cited the Supreme Court case United States v. Nixon, which held that the Executive Branch has exclusive authority and absolute discretion to decide whether to prosecute a case. The president can direct law enforcement to decline to prosecute an entire class of people  in this case, parents of U.S. citizens  without even approaching a legal gray area, he said.

Source: http://news.yahoo.com/how-congress-can-fight-obama-s-immigration-order-193627501.html 




 What a feast he would be! 




 Presidents can and have simply ordered laws not to be followed. Regardless of whether it is against their oath of office or not, nearly every president has ordered select laws not to be followed. That's exactly what Obama has done with not enforcing raids on medical marijuana dispenseries. Why no public outcry there? 




 Please explain how you think the Supreme Court will find the executive order unconstitutional. Nearly every president for the past 50 years has acted unilaterally on immigration and none of those have been found unconstitutional.

The bottom line is that it's completely within a president's scope to enact this type of order.

You are correct in that processing work permits do cost money. And congress could pass a budget defunding the permits. But Obama will never sign such a budget, and thus it will be congress who will be blamed for not passing a budget which could lead to another govt shutdown which the Republicans will surely bear the burden for (again). 




 I agree we'd have to see the order before knowing for sure. I was speaking in generalities based on what it seems the order will be. And merely costing the money to print the order is not substantive enough to be practically defunded. 




 How would an order telling them not to enforce the status quo require money? 




 You can't defund an order that requires no money. All his order would do is stop enforcing the current deportation effort. 




 How do you know what to dispute and what the actual codes are? 




 I dunno. Women are outpacing men in higher education. Continue that for another 100 years and I definitely think average pay for women will be above men. 




 This isn't on you, but it is extremely frustrating that not one of those sources provided the ACTUAL pay gap after controlling for position, education, experience, and hours worked. I mean why are all these authors assuring us the gap "virtually disappears" then not providing the actual gap? So frustrating. 




 I agree. I was being very conservative there. 




 Money talks. I believe at least 90% of people would choose the latter option. 




 Well of course. If a person doesn't agree with the taxed item, they are unlikely to indulge in it and thus won't be paying the tax, while people who do indulge will be stuck with the extra tax. 




 According to this compound interest calculator (http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm) if you start with $38K, add $12K per year for 40 years and the market grows at 5.5% then yes you will have over $2M. 

However, at average annual inflation, prices will double every 20 years (source: http://inflationdata.com/Inflation/Inflation_Rate/Long_Term_Inflation.asp). This means that your $2M will feel like $500K. At the safe withdrawal rate of 4%, that means you'll be living on $20K a year. That sucks. However, you can combat this by raising your contribution rate as your income increases over those 40 years. I don't have a calculator, but I imagine you could easily have $4M in the account by retirement, meaning $1M in today's money, meaning you'll live on what feels like $40K in today's money. That's realistic. 




 Not sure if it works anymore, but I have a POTENTIAL solution.

About 5 years ago, I set up a credit card, one of those 1 year no interest cards, with a $10K limit and bought coins from the US Treasury, then just went and deposited them at my bank. Free shipping, no fees. Bank gave me some crap, but allowed it.

Or you could buy a big expensive item such as a TV with your credit card, and just resell it as brand new on Craigslist. Yea, you'll lose about 10% but desperate times call for desperate measures.

Edit: Buy an Amazon gift card! You can buy them up to $2000 and you can sell them for probably 97% of the value. Sell on Craigslist with A TON of proof. 




 Look into PAYE. Depends on when you got the loans and if they are federal or private.

PAYE works by:

1) taking your salary
2) then subtracting 1.5 times the poverty line, now $17,500
3) then you pay 10% of the amount left each year (divide by 12 for monthly payment)

If your income was $30,000 for example, you would pay $104 per month MAXIMUM.

You pay the amount according to the formula for 20 years and anything after will be forgiven. Although you will be taxed on the amount forgiven as if it were income, but this is still a better deal than if you paid the whole amount. 




 Oh I have no idea. Was it?

I was only saying that cause I moved here a couple months ago, and the planes fly so close to the buildings where I live. 




 Not true. That could be charged as criminal mischief. They're creating the impression they just stole from you, which is dangerous in case anyone retaliates. 




 I don't know cause it hasn't come out in my area yet. :(

They did a very poor job letting everyone know that it was such a limited release. But I'll let you know what I think next weekend. 




 Took me a couple looks, but it says GLUE, most likely as in "I like huffing glue" by the looks of him. 




 This is now a realistic fear since moving to San Diego. 




 Sorry I have no advice but to wait out the process.

However, in the future, the best protection you can have is to use a bank account, and use a credit card attached to the account to set to auto-pay the full amount every month. In a situation like this, you would still have money to use (up to the credit limit) and almost surely not be responsible for any of the money the thief spent. 




 What is the breed of that dog?! It's so cute. 




 You need an attorney. Depending on the state you live in, he may be able to get half the house's equity or may not, also depending on what proof of him cheating you have.

Do not sign anything without an attorney. If you cannot afford to pay him half the value of the equity in the house you may be forced to sell and split the proceeds. 




 It's almost hilarious that a cop caught with a theft conviction will be back on the job in 30 days. Almost. 




 Possibly from the perp's point of view, but a prank can still be a crime. And here it appears to be. 




 It's so weird to watch those accident scenes where the medics are loading the victim after having seen the movie Nightcrawler. 




 Seriously. If that happened in the US, he'd be in federal prison regardless of how many lives he saved. 




 Assert dominance. Keep petting cause I'm not a little bitch and I need to show him who's boss. 




 Oh my. Dumb me didn't even notice your username. Cheers! 




 1000% on the Supreme Court point. It looks like Scalia, Kennedy, Ginsberg, and Breyer will all need to be replaced within the next presidency. 2 liberals, 1 conservative, and 1 "swing" (who is really more conservative). If Clinton was president, the Court would be composed of 6 liberals to 3 conservatives after these four current justices were replaced and that would massively change how the court rules than if we got a Republican in office, where the Court would then be composed of 7 conservatives and 2 liberals in that case. 




 I'm being hyperbolic but serious. In those oil towns, demand is so high for labor that fast food restaurants have to pay $13-15 per hour because otherwise those workers would just go work in the oil fields. (Source: http://www.cnbc.com/id/101767406)

The average wage with under a year experience is around $67K/year, while the average wage overall is $100K/year. (Source: http://money.cnn.com/2012/05/10/news/economy/oil_workers/)

Yes, it is a legitimate option, but it's not very realistic for most people. If someone had no family that relied on them and no reason to stay in their current city of residence with a massive amount of debt, and wanted a little adventure in their life while simultaneously taking care of that debt, I think it's a viable option. But only you can answer that. 




 It's not his top priority. It took 6 years to get here.

Also, the number of issues he can handle is not some finite resource (although technically it is, realistically it is not). He has many many people working on solutions for many many issues. Why not handle immigration while it's a hot topic? 




 Agree. Where in her career has she shown exceptional strategy? Meanwhile, she has a proven track record in banking. While I'm all for her moving up in the party, this is more of a horizontal shift than vertical. 




 Listen, I'm way more in agreement with Sanders' views than Clinton's.

But here's why I'm going to vote for Clinton over Sanders in the Democratic Primary: because Sanders won't win the presidency and Clinton can and likely would against any Republican challenger.

The reality is that if Sanders went up against a Republican challenger in the general, he would probably lose. The fact is that Americans in general just aren't that liberal. Here's a chart posted in another /r/politics thread that shows how the Dems of the US are basically the Conservative party of the UK (http://cdn.yougov.com/cumulus_uploads/inlineimage/2014-11-06/tax5.png). Yes it isn't a perfect representation, and is only one issue, but I think you would find that general trend to be true in many other issues here in the US.

While Clinton will do many things I will likely disagree with in her presidency, I'm thinking bigger picture. And I'd rather have Clinton in office than the ACA repealed, immigration reform stifled, marijuana legalization held off further, gay rights trampled on, and net neutrality a dream.

If Sanders (by what would be nearly a miracle) beats Hillary in the primaries, he will almost surely lose the general election, and you can say goodbye to all those issues I just listed. 




 I'm guessing he's including FICA, and maybe even a 401K contribution. 




 It is not. She need to give them 60 days written notice as soon as possible. Then file for eviction assuming no changes by then.

Also, she should give the new January tenants the courtesy of letting them know the property won't likely be ready January 1st. 
























 That's horrible legal advice. Look at the source it came from. That's like asking your opponent in a football game what you should do and they say "fumble the ball and let me score a TD." 




 The downfall is that many of the kids in the program are there because there were ordered by the court to be, as in they are generally troublemakers and there are lots of reports of stealing. Not to discourage you. It's actually a great opportunity. I'm just trying to give you all the information. 




 Well damn. All right, let's do a breakdown. You have $1000, plus $400 on Amazon. Do you mind saying what city you live in? You need to be in a place with good public transportation (even if you get the car, b/c gas is expensive), that is cheap, and has jobs.

Step 0) Sell everything you don't need. This includes the guitar, excess clothes, everything. If you absolutely cannot part with stuff you cannot carry on your back, you need to find one of those storage rental places that gives you your first month for $1 or some great deal like that. But be careful not to sign a contract for longer than that period. If you end up needing longer than the month, 

1) Do you have a laptop? If so, you need to find places with free wifi. Usually McDonalds have free wifi so look there first.

2) Get a library card to waste time, read, and use their computers.

3) The $400 on Amazon is now your food money. They have Amazon lockers that you can get your items shipped to so you don't need an address. Buy small items that can fit in your backpack, and shop cheap.

4) Join a gym. Usually YMCA will give you a membership based on income. Check there first. This is now where you shower, shave, etc.

5) If you don't get the car, you need a place to sleep. Homeless shelters can probably be nasty and dangerous. If I were you, I would buy just an absolute junker of a car off Craigslist to at least sleep in. You can probably get one for $300. If you don't want to do that, start researching nearby shelters. I hear Walmarts are good at letting people sleep in their parking lots, but don't take that to the bank. Otherwise try to find deserted areas that don't look too dangerous. Warning: Don't sleep in the storage locker listed above. It's probably illegal and there are all sorts of dangers of freezing/heating to death, not to mention lack of oxygen if its airtight, etc.

6) Do you have a cell phone? Will your mom continue to pay for the plan? If not, then go buy one of those cheap phones with the pay as you go minutes and only buy the minimum and never text anyone. This is strictly for work contacts.

7) You need an address to put on job applications and where you can receive mail. Buy a PO Box from UPS. They have ones that look like real street addresses (http://www.theupsstore.com/mailboxes/Pages/personal.aspx).

8) Now you have all your immediate needs out of the way. And honestly all the above steps shouldn't take you more than 2 days. Now you start job searching. Apply everywhere. You cannot discriminate. It's already likely going to be 2-3 weeks before your first paycheck arrives. Fastfood places generally have high turnover. Put on a button-up shirt if you have one and make your hair look good. You walk in and ask if the hiring manager is working and tell them you'd like to apply. Another good place to apply would be CVS or Walgreens, basically small drug stores. They also generally have high turnover. And this is actually a good time to be applying. There's not a lot of competition from high school/ college students like there is in summer.

9) After you get a job, you want to get a place. Don't waste time finding an apartment you can't afford right now. Go find a rent a room situation on Craigslist. Shouldn't be more than $500 including all bills. And make sure its a month-to-month situation.

10) Now you can start looking at community colleges. I'd start with 1-3 classes you can take when you're not working. Seriously, college goes faster than you know. Think of it as 40 classes. That's all you need to graduate from a 4 year college. Or even start looking at trade professions your community college may offer if you're interested. You already applied to FAFSA, great!! Take any aid offered. Aim to start this summer! You'll be done in just a few years. If you want to transfer to a 4 year college, do your first 60 credits (20 classes at community college) before you transfer. If you take 3 classes each term, and don't skip summers, you'll be done in 2 years + 1 semester. That can be your Associate Degree or your step to transfer to a Bachelors.


While my situation wasn't as dire as yours, I went through something similar, getting kicked out, on 1 weeks notice, when I was 18 and still in high school. I ended up working and taking community college classes for some years before transferring to a 4 year school and graduating with a double major. I'm now on a full scholarship to law school with a fiance and a cat. I'm telling you this so you can see there's a light at the end of the tunnel. It will get better if you put in the effort. Feel free to respond on here or PM me if you have any other questions.


EDIT: Just saw you lived in rural Pennsylvania. That can't work. You need to get to the closest big city. It looks like Philadelphia is the biggest city in Pennsylvania by a lot. So you need to get there before any of these steps can happen. Try to get a ride from your mom since she's moving, but if not you need to use a tiny bit of your money to buy a bus ticket there.

EDIT 2: Just saw someone from Philadelphia say the job market sucks there. I looked up the lowest unemployment rates in the US and Salt Lake City, Utah is at the top with an unemployment rate of only 3.5%. But they have a very small population. The city on the list with the highest population and lowest unemployment rate is Minneapolis, Minnesota or Austin, Texas. I looked at a Greyhound ticket and they're $108 from Philadelphia to Minneapolis or $139 to Austin. They are both big cities with low unemployment rates under 5%. 




 Do you have any interest at all in the military?

I'm not a huge proponent of the military, but you are low on options and they will provide you with food, housing, medical, salary and seemingly most important to you, some structure in life.

Plus you can learn a skill that might be applicable when you get out. 




 For anyone on mobile where it's a pain in the ass to get to, the nickname is Cuddly Bear. 




 I assumed it would be unranked schools, but it's Iowa (27th) and SUNY Buffalo (100th to be fair).

The article suggests this is the ABA no longer requiring the LSAT for up to 10% of each school's entering class and that more schools will soon follow. Article also suggests that schools will likely lobby the ABA for an even higher percentage of students to be allowed in without LSAT scores.

This is all due to dropping enrollment, which dropped another 7% from last year.

The schools will require the students' SAT/ACT, GRE, GMAT, or other standardized college scores in place of the LSAT. 









 Planning on going to 187 so this is easy.

Edit: I'd obviously buy the UFC to record at home so I can hope to catch myself going nuts. 




 That's it. I'm buying tickets. 




 More like, "dude I have this great deal where you'll make $20. Sign this contract real quick." 




 Not now they won't because they still wouldn't have the votes to override a presidential veto. Now if they get a Republican president and still have a House majority but only between 51-59 Senators, I would highly suspect they would do just what you say. 




 He's also going for his 16th Zuffa win in a row, same record Anderson set. 




 His case got reviewed by the Supreme Court. It's over. There's no one else to appeal to. I think I'd be happier running and always looking over my shoulder than spending my time in prison. 




 I agree 100%, but that does not mean that the decision to do something detrimental to your health would not be a stupid decision. Do you agree with the suicide hypothetical I posted above? 




 Surprisingly good. I like how they're taking their time to set up for the long run. Taking it kind of slow, but have some powerful scenes so far. 




 Those people are pretty stupid. Yes, there are a few that won't get addicted after doing heroin for a week, but I'd argue that the health effects of that week alone are enough to make it stupid, much less the likely possibility that you aren't one of the few chosen ones who will get addicted. 




 Right. And I'm saying that it's pretty stupid to likely ruin your life for that chance. 




 Not at all. If you just filmed it and the after-effects, it would serve about the same impact as this heroin experiment. 




 That's not my hypothetical though. It was only what happened here, which is someone doing something extremely detrimental to themselves for a CHANCE they will prevent others from doing the same. 




 I realize that. I'm saying it's pretty much one of the stupidest things someone could do. You've agreed that it is analogous to someone killing themselves if it prevents others to do so. I also think that's insanely stupid. But according to you, that could NEVER be stupid if you do it with the intention of the public good in mind. I think that's a pretty stupid idea. 




 So you are completely agreeing with the suicide hypothetical. 




 You are effectively arguing that if someone does something that is bad for themselves but prevents the general public from doing that thing then it's not stupid. So if this guy were to kill himself instead, say gunshot to the head for example, and that prevented others from killing themselves after they saw how sad his family was, then that wouldn't be stupid, right? 




 What part of purposely getting addicted to heroin do you not find stupid? 




 It was a personally stupid idea to knowingly do one of the most addictive drugs on the planet. 




 Let the door hit you in the face on your way out. 




 I'm sorry but how stupid can you be to think that's a good idea? 




 The Way Way Back, The Spectacular Now, The To Do List, and of course Boyhood. 




 Someone said 17 year old and that it was consensual. 




 That's like a scandal over jaywalking. 




 Looks like I'm redditing mobily from now on. 




 I'm sure that's exactly how it would go but I'd at least be able to prepare some sort of defense compared to the other two options. 




 Never beach and move from hotel to hotel every week. 




 Where so I can just never go there. 




 Typically not. Instead they will track the market rental rate in their area and when the current lease is up, the renewal rate will be at market rent. This sometimes correlates with interest rate increases, but is not caused from these increases, if that makes sense. 




 It's part of Obama's budget proposal. But the cap has not passed yet. Also, it seems it would be interpreted to mean that it would only apply to new borrowers. 




 If it's a phone, you just don't go on wifi. 




 Do you pet them? I'm just unclear on what you do with the wolves? Just looking?

As someone semi-new to the area, I've never been around a wolf and have no clue what to do/expect. 




 Looks like an even dopier version of Eli Manning behind Bones. 




 I always see these kind of pictures from up north and think "Gee, it sure would be wonderful to live there," but then I remember you guys actually have winters and how I walked outside in shorts today here in San Diego. 




 Ah, that makes a lot of sense then. 




 I don't believe his cut has been released for anyone besides BJ, but correct me if I'm wrong.

Also he works with lesser known fighters all the time and I'm fairly certain they are not paying him more than they make. 




 There's no way Dolce charges that to the lower tier guys. 




 3rd year law student. 




 Your landlord has a specific clause in the lease stating you can't replace your door with one with a lock? That right there should have been a red flag.

You should inquire as to why you are not allowed to secure your things and if you can change that part of the lease, as your safety/wellbeing is being affected. 




 Get a lock for your door. $15 and 10 minutes to install. 




 Damn. I even looked on the front page and just must have missed it. 




 I'm inclined to agree that Rumble is best based on what we've seen of his power in his last few fights. But I kinda feel like he's ranking Rashad above DC and Gus just because he likes to make those to feel bad because of all the crap they've talked recently.

I do agree with his DC over Gus though. 









 I have no idea about Australian law, but I'll give general life advice. Do you have proof she forced you to write the note to her, such as texts, email, or voicemail? If so it seems unlikely to hold up.

I also am unsure of the damage responsibility.

However if I were you, and were scared for my pets life, I would lie and tell her I had the money and that I will meet her in public with the money if she brings the dog then just take it from her in as harmless way as possible. Let her call the police and attempt to sue you and deal with that later but your first priority should be keeping your pet safe from a seemingly psychotic person. 




 Thank you so much! 




 Thanks, I really appreciate it. 




 Why do you see so many fighters there? Are you in Vegas or LA? 




 I did call at about 2pm today and those were the only options available. 




 Yea that's definitely not what I'm saying. 




 It only gives me the option to say I'm calling about a refund, which is the option I've been selecting, or an amended 1040X. Should I just select the 1040X option? 




 And in the absence of any contenders, would you agree someone could justifiably get a title shot in a new division? 




 I can see the difference. However, my point is that you are recognizing that someone can earn a title shot in a division they do not have any wins in.

You are not refuting this point.

I'm merely extending the point to #1 contenders who just lost. 




 See that's my point. If you are agreeing that someone, ANYONE, could be entitled to a title shot based on their performance in another weightclass, then why not a #1 contender who just lost? I mean to become a #1 contender, they obviously had to have some pretty high level wins, so they are likely going to be competitive in the new weightclass, just as a champion would have. 




 What about the JBJ part? 




 Really? Why not, because he has no wins at MW?

What about if JBJ wanted to go up/down to HW/MW for his next fight? Would he also not deserve a shot because of no fights at HW/MW? 




 Dude. Many people believe Frankie beat Bendo in the 2nd fight and thus was arguably better than the 155 champ. Yea, he didn't earn the fight at FW, but he more than earned it with his wins at LW.

Let me put it this way: if Cormier, who just lost againt JBJ wanted to (and physically could) drop down to MW, do you really think he wouldn't be worthy of an immediate shot at Weidman? 




 WHERE DO YOU WORK? 




 I filed my taxes in January 2014 for the 2013 tax year. My refund never came and when I went to Where's My Refund, it said it was still "in process" or something along those lines. After 10 weeks or so, I figured I got audited but I had nothing to worry about. In June, I called up the IRS (forgot what number I called or how I found it) and was told that they were indeed auditing me and that they would contact me before August. That came and went with no contact from them, and I got busy with school. Well now it's January and I need to file this years return but I kinda want to know the status on last years return (and get my refund).

So when I got on Where's My Refund now, it thinks I'm entering for tax year 2014 and doesn't work anymore. And if I call the (800) 829-1040 number I found, it keeps prompting me for SSN, refund amount and filing status, but when I enter those it asks when I filed my tax return, either before January 5th, 2015 or after. When I select before, it just says they haven't processed those yet, but obviously they're thinking of this years tax return and I'm thinking of last years.

Please can someone point me in the right direction?

 That's exactly my point. Kuhn stands out from the other fullbacks. 




 How many better FBs can you name? 




 Haha same here bro, same here. 




 I mean I get that, but in the article it says Peyton's earned $230MM. I don't follow Peyton's life too much, but I'm sure he lives in a house he's probably paid $20MM or so for, and lives on mayyyybbee $1MM or so each year he's been in the league. After accounting for taxes, which should be about 40% or so, that leaves him with a little over $100MM left, assuming he had no investments whatsoever. Now what in the world would PFM want to buy that he could with $120MM but not $100MM. It just makes no sense. I mean if he invested in US Bonds, yielding some of the lowest interest rates, he'd be nearly guaranteed $2MM each year for the rest of his life.

tl;dr: If he comes back, it's not for the money. 




 What do you think Peyton would want right now that he can't afford but an extra $19MM will allow him to afford and is worth the risk of another severe injury?

If I had as much money as him, I would retire yesterday from a sport as dangerous as his. 




 Unless OP's name is Larry. 




 I nominate Court McGee for best response. 




 Oh you almost certainly have nothing to worry about. Here's a study on births by pregnancy week. Basically anything past 43 weeks would be extremely rare and a doctor would almost certainly induce by week 41.

 We are in agreement that OP should get the test.

However over a 9 month block, months certainly do work on averages. Pick any 9 month block and it will be closer to 40 weeks than 36 weeks. 




 Months are 4.33 weeks on average, so it's actually much closer to 9 months than 10. 




 As someone who uses adblock, I think you should put a small banner at the top of the site that explains this, because now that I know, I will disable adblock for your site. 




 That reasoning doesn't make sense. An interception on 4th and a fumble on 4th down are still turnovers. 




 I don't know him personally. I hung out with him for an hour or two. 




 When Tim did his AMA and came on here asking if any redditors wanted to help, I responded. Me and another dude went to Tim's house and played with his dogs and we helped type up his AMA as he dictated. He gave us both plenty of signed gear and invited us to a BJJ seminar he was doing the next day. Pretty cool dude. 




 Oh man I completely forgot it was vacant. 




 LOL I was getting downvoted for that?

Such is life in /r/MMA  




 A couple things to note. 1) Johny was injured when Lawler was climbing his way back up so an immediate rematch wasn't possible. 2) A contender losing and getting the rematch is pretty unprecedented (only happened with Shogun/Machida), whereas a champion losing and getting an immediate rematch happens all the time and is even more justified because the result was controversial


For the record I disagree with the rematch. I think Rory should get the fight. 




 The federal govt will just give them to you. No need for you to shop around. Don't go private, or you lose all sorts of repayment benefits.

 If you verified there was a problem with the handle it seems likely they weren't lying.

Just keep that in mind when making your offer. 




 I think that's more 1/3 




 Is this what Leo was talking about in that scene in Django? 




 LOL. No, you signing the wrong name on the contract won't hold up in court. You would lose that argument 100/100 times. 




 W-what is this? 




 Yea, that's not gonna hold up in court. 




 When you say fill in the missing parts, do you just mean stuff your teacher mentions that the outline did not have, or do you just keep the main headings of the outline and fill in all the information?
 




 Henry "Mini Tito" Cejudo 




 Apparently dude just got out of jail. 




 Would Rodgers be Iron Man? 




 Said wrestler was supposedly right around 200 pounds, so 12 pounds is 6% of his bodyweight. 5 pounds for Nate at 160 is just over 3%. 




 Sorry to hijack here, but I just saw Foxcatcher tonight where Channing Tatum is a wrestler and the weigh ins happens, and the dude telling Channing he's 12 pounds over. Mark Ruffalo asks dude how much time they have and he says 90 minutes. I started busting out laughing cause the next scene is Channing biking his ass off on a stationary with a sweatshirt on, and apparently he makes weight cause it shows him fighting the next scene. No idea if that part was based on a real story but it was unreal.

Point being, if that wrestler could do it, Nate could. 




 Cause it's 12/12 




 Who would you vote for instead if Hillary ended up being Dem candidate? 




 That actually brings up a very interesting point. Like right now, if you have a fight coming up in the next 3-4 months its whatever, you'll fight either way. But if they try to schedule you for an event in May/June, would you just get "injured" and not be able to fight until July? I mean really, how many sponsors are gonna stick around until the very last minute? It just makes sense to try to delay at that point. 




 Where you at motherfucker?!? Don't be scared! 




 I still stand by my statement than anyone with multiple MVP seasons is a HOFer. I don't care if they only played 2 seasons. I think that alone deserves HOF, but I realize people will disagree with me.

Also, a SB win, SB MVP, and 3 SB appearances. I mean that's better than 99% of all QB's. I definitely feel Warner has earned HOF.


Edit: Let me give you a hypothetical because I'm curious. Say a QB came into the league and had most yards ever in a season, highest completion percentage ever, most TD's in a season, least INTs ever in a season, lead his team to a perfect record and won SB MVP. Then the next season he had identical stats and record, but promptly retired after those 2 seasons. Would you think he deserved HOF then? 




 In your position, I would do night school if you want to finish your degree. Also, since you're moving soon, you should wait until you qualify for in-state tuition.

Also, welcome (soon) to San Diego! I think it hit 80 today. I got hot walking around in a light jacket. Also, people freak out when it rains at all and forget how to drive. 




 Let me guess. Punitive damages, jury trial? 




 This 2014 season. Nearly everyone has him leading.

Also, Warner is looking like a first ballot HOFer, so I don't see how that's a good argument. Yes, there's argument, but if he doesn't make this cut, he'll almost surely be in within the next few years. 




 They said it last week, when they had Pats #1 after they JUST lost to the Packers. I believe it was something along the lines of "I know how good the Patriots are and nothing I saw in this game changes that." 
























 It should be a thing. I don't think I, or anyone else I know, realized just how much work it would be. I had multiple law students describe it, but actually doing it was a complete wake up call to the amount of work that had to be put in. 




 Maybe, but if I were TJ, I'd still want the fight to get that loss back. 




 Two scenarios: 

(1) If the candidate died the day before the election, would (s)he be taken off the ballot? If so, who would (s)he be replaced with? The VP on their ticket? If not, and (s)he still won, would the VP become president?

(2) If a candidate won and became president-elect, but died before being sworn in, what would happen? VP-elect becomes president? Something else? 




 I'm lost. 




 Replying to wrong person. 




 Likely not enough evidence to charge the guy if your video doesn't show his hands on your neck. I'd steer clear of his home if I were you. Should you have to? No, but it's the smart thing to do if there is an alternative route. 




 I'm so sorry.

Was your cat an outside cat or would the cat have been stolen from inside the apartment?

You could always have a lawyer write up a letter demanding the neighbor return your cat and hope it scares them into giving the cat back. 




 Money? 




 Perhaps the agent is upset because he didn't properly verify your identity. You should ask him about that. 




 Went to a 9:30 yesterday. There were only two other people in the theater besides my girlfriend and I. 




 Just want to point out that lots of people say "I have nothing, you will never be able to collect," it's not necessarily true. I would highly recommend getting the judgment in small claims court. The filing fee isn't much and it won't take a ton of time.

Then you can fulfill the judgment anytime in the future. If she ever gets a job, you can garnish her wages. If one of her grandparents/parents ever die and leave her any inheritance, you may be able to get a cut. If she ever wins the lottery, you will get your cut. It seems highly unlikely that for the rest of this woman's life, she will never have any income or assets.

Also, I'm reasonably sure that interest will be included whenever you are able to collect. 




 I'm not a lawyer, but maybe one can chime in on the legality of just not paying the landlord and leaving it up to them to bring you to court for non-payment at which point you bring proof that nobody was in the apartment for three weeks and then the burden of proof would be on the landlord. I'm inclined to believe that if the landlord admitted it was his/her workers plugging in that caused the overage, any court would make them pay for it. 




 Well assuming he got his money back fairly quickly (I know, a big if), then he could have reinvested and caught the market on at least a portion of the upswing. 




 Why false? The market did fall over 40%. 




 I tend to agree with that. Anyone can go nuts for a minute 30 and outshine their opponent. 




 You could suggest an alternative of getting a camera to cover the area if it's usually all in one place. Also, you could point out that this would have to be an ongoing thing, where every time a new dog moved into the neighborhood, they'd have to get DNA tested. 




 Warning to OP: he will likely claim OP gave him permission to do so, and if that's the standard business practice (I'm unfamiliar with the gold trade business), then it seems the decision may be tilted in the gold buyer's direction.

Then again, just the threat of a lawsuit is enough to scare some people to pay up. And, the filing fee for small claims court is usually not much, so it seems worth a try. 




 I apologize in advance because this will come off as racist, but if you just go to the airports and stand in front of the United and American terminals, because no security to stop you from getting there, and look for the most Islamic-looking people you can find and call them out in front of everyone. At the very least, on that day at that place your odds are pretty decent of targeting the right people, and innocents who get offended are just part of the deal, unfortunately.

Maybe they'll bail at that point. You can point out that they have boxcutters and give light details of their plan (they have pilot training, etc.). At the very least, it seems the authorities will detain you and them and you just try your hardest to convince them.

I at least remember United 93, so that's one terminal I can definitely get in front of and execute the plan. 




 What a time to be alive.

Drone dude was probably just hunting for boobies at Spring Break. 




 If he comes back looking anything like the fighter that destroyed Mizugaki, I still think he takes the belt. 




 I'm not a lawyer, but it seems pretty straightforward that by not signing to un-enroll your child, he is effectively not allowing you to choose the daycare. Therefore, HE is the one who is not complying with the court order. Perhaps talk to your attorney to see if the attorney could send him a letter to this effect. 




 Ok bud. 




 Ok bud.

I find it hilarious that your entire comment karma is negative, btw. 




 Ok buddy. 




 Can a lawyer chime in on the legalities of the husband appearing and paying the ticket for her? 




 Here, the orders were warranted because the dog (correctly) alerted on the car. So the officer had every right to ask the man to step out and search the car.

Haha coming away with no charges does NOT mean he was illegally detained. 




 Dude needed to learn to comply with cops orders. Dude got arrested because he didn't. 




 I thought the same thing. I can only guess that it was because of the length of the fight.

Look at Ronda's last few fights. Were they beatdowns? Yea, she whipped the hell out of her opponents. However, it would have seemed more of a beatdown if she just battered the opponents for 25 minutes. 




 If it is illegal, you can and you should. For example, if he hits you or threatens to hurt you in any way.

A police record showing hundreds of violations will only increase your likelihood of you being able to get out of there as fast as possible. 




 Which country can you buy 12 UFC's for $120? 




 I mean they can, but it's against the rules and could result in a DQ. 




 Just in case anyone else just got curious, season 2 is set to premiere in "mid-2015" whatever that means. 




 Yea.... It's definitely time to lawyer up. 




 Why don't we do those? Sounds fun. 




 You call the police every single time anything out of line happens. If you have to call 100 times, so be it. You don't have to walk to the police station every time. Walk to the nearest neighbors house and ask to use a phone to call the police if you don't have a phone. If that neighbor doesn't answer or refuses, continue on to the next one.

By continuing to call the police, you will have a continued record of what is happening. 




 Eh. I guess. I feel like if a fighter's corner thought he was being brain damaged enough to throw in the towel, the fighter should least care about the manner in which he lost, as long as it was clear he was going to lose either way. 




 http://www.ufc.com/discover/sport/rules-and-regulations

Section 15(A)(xxx)

It's illegal.

Edit: LOL downvote me for showing you the light 




 It's legal in boxing. Not in MMA. I know, it's stupid. 




 So wait, if you were not working there before law school, what was their incentive to pay you to go? How did you apply for this deal? 




 It's so funny how people view experiences differently. I worked for several years in a professional office and got used to the 40 hour work week then nights and weekends are mine. Then I attended undergrad and went straight to law school after. I found it MUCH easier to go straight from undergrad to law school, because I was used to giving up my nights and weekends to study. While I agree they are nothing alike, I still found it easier being used to working nearly every night and weekend, as opposed to only the occasional night and weekend in a real world job. 




 Good point, fair enough. I guess the fighter would just lose by DQ, but if you're gonna lose anyway who cares? 




 Corners can't stop the fight in the middle of the round. It's in the unified rules. 




 Like the other guy said, what if OP dies in a car crash on the way home from the funeral. Now there's 7 kids with no income. At least if OP has life insurance, they'll have some sort of fallback. 




 At least you could explain that away by "he just got caught," and you're not the guy who assured his friends that Barao would wipe the floor with TJ, and then TJ outclassed him the whole fight (even though we all thought Barao would win). 




 Yea, watching that video and Rogan says something like if Nurmagomedov is dominating RDA like this, then I'm excited to see how a fight with Pettis, the top of the food chain goes. It's crazy that Khabib DID dominate the the top of the food chain like that. It just so happens that RDA was above Pettis' level. 




 For real, before FW got moved to the UFC, the best in the world were in the WEC, except for a few small exceptions. 




 I honestly thought Jon Jones would beat Matt Hamill. 




 Not the time or place, dude. 




 It is almost surely already criminal. If I were you, I would (in order) cut my contributions to zero, start job searching, and report the CEO to the police. 




 I'd be very interested if you have the time! And it seems like there is a lot of interest from others around here. 




 I'm sorry if this is too much but do you think you could just post the top 10 for all weight classes?

Like you should make the rankings a whole post and explain a bit how you came up with them. I for one think it would be very interesting and probably pretty popular. 




 Why are you being down voted? Isn't what you wrote true? 




 I use VPI and I've made two claims for a total of about $3,000 in the past 3 months. They're great, you just email in your claim form and receipts to them and they process it and send you a check. The only downside is you have to pay the entire cost upfront. 




 I have it because I know I would spend anything on my pet to keep her from dying. I also know I don't have the funds right now to deal with that.

The deal with insurance is that, on average, it's a bad deal. That's how the companies profit. If you have the money to cover a potential large expense (think $5K per animal) then you're good. If you don't, then get insurance.

I pay about $200/year for my cat and I've used it twice in the past 3 months to claim a total of $3,000 from the insurance company. It's worked out for me. 




 Damnit I was off by 100 days on my math. Oh well.

RemindMe! 7300 days "You did the math wrong" 




 RemindMe! 7200 days "Check the bet" 




 Pettis did the same thing in his post fight speech. "After the first punch, I couldn't see out of my right eye. No excuses." 




 You could just tell me. It's not cost of living because he's not comparing NY to anywhere else. It's not PPP because he's not comparing another country to NY. And if you think it's CPI, you should check the source on my inflation calculator. 




 Not necessarily. The Court could interpret the ruling however it wants. It could legalize marijuana for just those plaintiffs or for all of CA. 




 Sorry that's wayyyyyy off. NY State minimum wage in 1979 was $2.90 (http://www.labor.ny.gov/stats/minimum_wage.asp). Adjusted for inflation that would be $9.34 (http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=2.90 year1=1979 year2=2015). Extrapolated out for 40 hours per week for 52 weeks a year, we arrive to $19,427, nowhere near the $50,000 you claim. 




 Does that not make those grad plus loans ineligible for PAYE? 




 Very surprised not to see MMA on the list at all. 




 No but really. Explain where I've been childish. 




 Lol. Justify how ever you want. I was asking because I was wondering what jobs besides actors take off months at a time. I guarantee you come off as more of a creeper than me to any girl with that comment. 




 Way to be a creeper dude... 




 If you don't party and focus you can easily get a 4.0 in your year at UTSA. With that you are virtually guaranteed to get into UT. 




 What do you do if you don't mind sharing? 




 Obamacare still caps the annual out of pocket cost at $13,200 even if he's on a family plan. This is sketchy.

https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/out-of-pocket-maximum-limit/ 




 If you're Packer fans join us at Red's Saloon when NFL season begins! 




 I just want to throw Pet Insurance in here as a possibility too. I've paid about $200/year for my cat and she's racked up bills of over $5000 already from eating a spider, a couple UTIs, and getting into some lillies (highly poisonous for cats).

I'm aware that, on average, insurance companies make money. That's why they sell their product for the price they do. Therefore, you need to do a cost-benefit analysis. I knew that I would get my cat to the vet no matter what because she's a family member to us. And I knew that, being in graduate school, I couldn't afford it if she had a big expense. Therefore I will keep insurance until I have a job where I can afford a several thousand dollar expense if need be. 




 This. OP should contact the trooper at his phone number and notify the trooper that he just became aware that it is against the law not to report the accident since he believes the damage will be over $1000. Unless the trooper is stupid, he won't argue at that point and OP can easily get the trooper's insurance info. 




 I have several friends who work at the DA and that charge is never dropped around here. I guess people in different JX's have different experiences. 




 Well I don't know what the charges are, but $200K bail generally means it's pretty serious, and this is not his first offense. I think it's decently likely he could get several years.

Edit: Read the article. Charges are resisting arrest, battery on a peace officer and unlawful fighting. The prosecutor will likely be out for blood for battery on a peace officer. That alone could get him several years. 




 Even still. I doubt Mayhem has $20K to give up. 




 Bail generally works where you pay a bondsman 10% of your total bail amount and they post the whole amount to the jail. However, the catch is you don't get that 10% back when you turn yourself back in to the court system for trial, like you would if you had paid the whole amount yourself. 10% USUALLY isn't that much. However, here it's $20K, so I'm inclined to agree with your original statement of "bye bye Mayhem."

Sidenote: When people skip bail (don't appear at their next court appearance), and have made bail through a bondsman, then the bondsman in some cases is entitled to bring the criminal in to receive their money back. This is where you get shows such as Dog the Bounty Hunter. He's a bail bondsman. 




 I don't know about pointless. I think that it works *most* of the time, just not every time, as long as you keep it to only 2-3 degrees removed from the first fight. It's not very accurate when you get to the point that Might Mouse beats Fedor like 26 fights removed, but it is pretty good if you have A beat B, B beat C, therefore A will probably beat C.

Let's look at this current scenario. Khabib beat RDA. RDA beat Cerrone. Khabib will very likely beat Cerrone. Not 100%, but it's pretty likely. 




 If you got 8th in your class you are likely a hard worker.

I went to a pretty hard high school and was barely out of the top 50%. I then went to UTSA for a year and focused on my studies and no partying. It was ridiculously easy. I was top of ever single one of my classes and easily had a 4.0

I say this not to brag, but to show you it is possible. If you're a hard worker and willing to put in the time, you can likely successfully CAP in. Now it's just a matter of deciding if you're willing to live in another city for a year.

Also Austin is a kick ass city with tons to do. I grew up there and it's just become better every year with ACL, SXSW, the kite festival, tons of hiking, Barton Springs, Zilker Park, 6th Street, etc. whereas I have a good friend at UNT and he hates it cause there's nothing to do. 




 As a Packers fan watching the Bears get rid of Marshall, the Lions get rid of Suh, and reports that the Vikings are trading AP... I'm just excited.

Edit: And with us keeping Cobb!! 




 Yes. 




 I applied every year and was never approved and I had a zero EFC every time. They just run out so fast. Everyone knows about it, unlike the article implies. 




 I actually threw you an upvote because while I don't agree all his competition has been crap, I think it has been a significant step down from what Johny and Lawler have been facing lately. 




 What card is 2% cash back? 




 Cause we've seen Johny and Lawler slow down significantly in 3 round fight whereas Rory is still going strong at the end of 3 rounds in pretty much all of his fights. 




 Dude he definitely gassed HARD in the first fight. I mean Johny did too, but not as bad. Johny won the 5th of the first fight and that was what put him over the edge. 




 Oh I completely forgot they just had another one. I just moved from the Austin area actually and missed that one. I was talking about the one like 5 years ago headlined by Palhares/Marquardt that ended in disappointing controversy. 




 I bought tickets... I wake up and pray to the injury gods every morning.

This is my second UFC event and the first was Fight Night Austin with such a disappointing ending. 




 Agee. But I think Rory will just have a deeper gas tank. Remember how Robbie looked dead for the majority of the last 2 rounds in the Hendricks fights? That may have been fine in those fights, but Rory don't gas like Johny. 




 How would anybody know not to park in the spots then? I haven't read the statute but I'm almost positive it would be illegal to tow in that scenario. 




 You need a breakdown of ALL expenses. You only listed housing. You're missing food, medical, gas, car insurance, pet costs, cell phone, entertainment, household costs, gifting, and anything else you spend money on. 




 Look at refinancing it. I've heard of Sofi but do your own research.

Also, you didn't post your budget but if you are paying $1000 for housing costs, you can probably fit all other monthly expenses into another $1000 per month. Where the heck is all your money going???

You should budget it all as low as possible then use all money to pay off your debt. I'm almost positive you could be done in 3 years. 




 You may actually want to look at getting a credit card. For example, the one I have gives cash back of 1% on everything and 5% in certain categories every month. All together, it works out to about 2% per month cash back. Adding up roughly what you spend (can't use it for mortgage, electric bill, or child support), that would be about $600 per year.

I just set mine to full auto-pay each month out of my account and never worry about it.

Also, I'm not sure if you have an emergency fund, but it would give you some form of payment if you had a true emergency. Say your car broke down and needed a $300 repair tomorrow. Can you pay it? What would you do in that situation. Yes, it sucks to be in CC debt, but it sucks even more if you can't pay to fix your car so you lose your job and then you lose your house because you don't have a job, etc. 




 I hope you got the drivers insurance information and several of the witnesses names and contact numbers. 




 Many times, it's the guys who are loose and having fun out there that can get inside their opponents' minds. Werdum-Fedor comes to mind where Werdum was laughing, joking, and making funny faces all fight week. 




 Everyone forgets Father Gabriel. 




 Non-military here. Why so? 




 Non-legal advice, but perhaps there are social services he qualifies for since he was abandoned. Maybe start with calling the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services (http://www.dhs.state.pa.us/) and asking them where to go from here. 




 I'm saying if he walks in with a lawyer and wants a plea deal, they will likely offer him a deal where he pleads guilty to a lesser charge. In that scenario, the prosecutor will drop the original charge.

I see where my original post could be misinterpreted from my intended meaning. We both obviously know how this would work so lets stop arguing about it. 




 How am I an idiot? I said "if you plead guilty, they'll drop the case." What room for sarcasm is there even? By "drop the case" I mean to say they charge you with Murder 1 then plead to Murder 2, they will drop the Murder 1 charge in that case. They have to. Again, I don't even see anywhere where I could have been sarcastic. I'm not recommending anything, merely stating facts. 




 Well it's your weed budget for the rest of your life then. 




 I'm not being sarcastic. 




 So Chik-Fil-A makes tons of extra money, people get reheated, day old food, and you don't make any profit because you gave it all away? 




 I'm guessing from your phrasing that these are both already reality. 




 Of course they'll drop the case if you plead guilty because that's their whole goal. If they charge you with murder they'll drop that too if you plead guilty. 




 Dude just get a lawyer. Look at it like this: you had enough money to buy weed. Take the money you were spending on weed and spend it on a lawyer. Lots of them will do payment plans. As others have said, look for a plea deal that doesn't affect financial aid and is eligible for expungement. 
























 I see debate all the time on here about buying a cheap car. Heck, I give that advice to people on here.

I'm actually sharing a car with my girlfriend right right now, but in the next year or so I'll have to get one of my own.

I care almost nothing about style. If it is safe and affordable then it's for me.

So what is the most cost effective used car taking into account MPG, potential repairs, how long it lasts, and of course purchase price?

Also, I'm assuming stay away from dealers? Or can they beat Craigslist sellers, on average? 




 Is that really true?

Couldn't someone just "sell" their home to a family member who would "sell" it right back to them?

Edit: [found a source](http://www.boe.ca.gov/proptaxes/pdf/lta12060.pdf) That's crazy! 




 Huh, I hadn't seen that. Doesn't mean you can't try! 




 Bitch my line breaks are just fine! 




 Ok, so an emergency fund is generally thought of as "if I lose my job tomorrow, I want 3-6 months of income." With that said, right now, I doubt your food expenses are $0. Do you work 7 days a week and eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner there? If not, then it's not $0.

Here's your monthly budget:
Car: $325
Rent: $550
Bills: $165
Gas: $100
Car insurance: ??? - assuming $100 for now
Health insurance: ??? - assuming you don't have it for now
Food (if you lost your job): $300
Minimum payment on CC: $60
Total: $1600

This means for a bare minimum emergency fund, you need $4800 (3 months of expenses). This is goal #1.

As an income estimate, I'm getting $2565 per month after taxes for you. Your current expenses (assuming $100/month for food and $100/month for car insurance) are $1400. This leaves you $1165 to save per month. Since you already have $3000 in you emergency fund, you only need to make the minimum payment on your CC for a month and a half to save to the full $4800 for emergency fund.

Goal #2 is knock out that debt. Currently at $1500, you just need 5 weeks after your emergency fund to knock out that debt. This means you put the full $1165 you have extra each month at that CC.

Goal #3(a) is build a savings. I saw you said your employer does not offer a 401K. This means you fund an IRA. Currently the limits are $5500/year. Since you save $1165 per month you should have this fully funded within 5 months. After that, you move on to an individual brokerage account where you can save money, but that doesn't give you any special tax breaks. I use Scottrade personally and like them, but you should look into your own. I also recommend using the 3 fund portfolio (http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio) for your investing. They should also be able to set you up the IRA.

Goal #3(b) is an alternative to Goal #3(a). This is you going back to college. I saw in your other comment you went for 3 years for Biology then stopped b/c you ran out of money. You should definitely consider going back. The advantage to going through life with a college degree is so massive that you would be an idiot not to if you had the opportunity. How many credits short of your degree are you and what is the cost of a year? I would almost recommend you take out any loans necessary to complete your degree.



P.S. Also, never buy a car that expensive again. It doesn't do anything. If you make over $100K a year, sure buy something nice. But until then, remember all a car needs to do is get you safely from point A to B. Think $5000 car instead, the next time you need a car. 




 You sound like you have a very good head on your shoulders. I wish you the best of luck. If your situation gets abusive for you or your siblings, do not hesitate to call 911 immediately. Don't let him scare you into not reporting. Also, you should be able to advocate to the court on your own behalf and they will likely take it into consideration. 




 They did say it was pretty smart. So it could follow you into the bank vault and just wait in the doorway. It could just wait for you there until you tried to come out or fell asleep. Not like it had anywhere better to be. 




 I can see it now: he gives the mom the money and gets a lien on the home. Now the mom can't make the payments to him so he initiates... foreclosure, getting back to the original problem. 




 Jesus Christ you need to stop loaning ANYONE money. After your brother pays you back you need to get out of that game. Your parents should not expect it. If anyone asks just say you're sorry but don't have the budget for it.

Also, you need to sit down and have a serious discussion with your gf. I saw in another reply you said you plan on marrying her a bit down the road. If so, you need to discuss together if you two will be subsidizing her mother, because if she continues this now, I guarantee the mother will only expect it more in the future. If I were you, I would point out things the mom has done to shoot herself in the foot, such as quit her job when she could not afford it, take in dogs when she couldn't afford it, take in a nephew when she couldn't afford it, and take in an alcoholic boyfriend when she couldn't afford it. Show your girlfriend how irresponsible her mom is and that your gf is only enabling this lifestyle and making it worse by giving her money. 




 Pepper spray can actually be pretty dangerous. At 15, you're probably old enough to be able to handle it, but a 9 year old? You might consider taking it away from the 9 and 11 year olds. Then you and the 13 year old can step up for them if they are in an abusive situation in any way.

Also, you should probably have your mom show you how use it properly and actually practice. It's harder than it looks. 




 Yes, they take anonymous reports. 




 You are entitled to access to your cards. He cannot just shut off your money supply. You need to talk to a lawyer about this and divorce immediately. 




 This is definitely what I'm reading as well. To clarify for OP: this is something that they theoretically could take foreclose on your home for, but practically will likely not.

OP should probably contact the city tax assessor (wherever you pay your property taxes to) and pay the lien. It will likely be a similar amount (if not slightly more for interest and maybe fees to file the lien) to the amount he sent the check for originally. 




 Wait, you owe $1500 in CC debt or your minimum payment is $1500? If it's what you owe, what is your minimum payment? This will change how much you need for an emergency fund.

Also, how do you eat for free? Parents?

Last, trade down in your car if possible. How much is it worth? 




 I get it. I accept that there will be reposts. But wasn't this just reposted last week? 




 That's.... a unique take on things... 




 Right. And I think universal healthcare is the way to go. It's cheaper per person.

I'm just saying with the way the US is set up, we can't have open enrollment year round. 




 Unfortunately it's necessary. Since they are not allowed to discriminate based on preexisting condition, everyone could just not pay for health insurance until they get a major illness and then all the insurance companies would go bankrupt and nobody could get health insurance. 




 Yea, sounds like he's just horrible at flirting. You say he's been celibate for 5 years? He's probably REALLY out of practice at flirting.

Next time you're with him in a private place. Sit down next to him, look him in the eyes, and tell him you have a crush on him and want to explore it. Explicitly ask for a response. If he gives you a positive indicator, maybe try for a kiss if it feels right. 




 Funny how it defines Ephobophilia as attraction to 15-19 year olds. I'm sure nearly every guy in the world would admit attraction to an 18 year old, and yet according that that, it's the same as attraction to a 15 year old. The imaginary boundaries we set make the world a strange place. 




 Let me give you a scenario: You are walking down the street with your friend when someone runs up and stabs your friend to death with a knife then tosses it at you. Instinctually, you catch it. The stabber escapes in a car but you didn't see the color, type, or license plate because you were focused on your friend. The police show up shortly after and you are arrested. Now last week, you and your friend were in a big argument in front of lots of people and you threatened him in front of everyone, but you two cooled down and were friends again.

If you tell the police this, and they offer you a deal of five years in prison, your "idiot" public defender would be the worst attorney in the world if they DIDN'T encourage you to take the deal. She would say it doesn't matter if you're guilty or not because the evidence would point to you being found guilty, and she would be correct. If you threatened suicide if found guilty that would not help in the least.

This is the world we live in. It only matters what the evidence shows. I'm assuming the evidence in your case points to you being guilty, even if you are completely innocent. How would you like the justice system to change to accommodate innocent defendants who look guilty? Take their word on it? 




 It makes me wonder if "It" would risk giving itself away by killing someone in front of that many people. Wouldn't all the passengers see her get ripped to shreds and be like ...? 




 I saw it as they never tested how smart it was, and so thought maybe it would get in and they'd electrocute it.

Afterwards, Jay knew she'd never escape it and so she just settled for Paul because she knew she'd at least have a partner to get through life. She wasn't completely happy, but it also wasn't the worst thing in life. 




 Can you give an approximate rank of your pre-transfer school? 




 Well if OP's wife does not own a vibrator that a condom would conceivably be used for then this is still an effective method. Or, if she does, he can ask her quickly where she bought the condom and check if she used her card there recently. 




 This movie killed it. I love my coming of age films and have watched every one I can, but this film easily tops them all.

I would say a distant second is Moonrise Kingdom. 




 Same. Me and the gf share a medium popcorn and large icee at ever movie. Hell sometimes we'll throw in a chicken strip combo. I know I'm overpaying and I'm ok with it. 




 Wow. This is genius. Because lets be honest, we're all telling him to confront her. But if she's at all a decent liar, she will convince him any number of ways it ended up there and just hide evidence better. With this method, if she hides it, she's almost certainly guilty. But if she tells OP, it's likely to be some sort of misunderstanding. 




 Interesting you bring that up. It's certainly something I've considered. I just need to sit down and run the numbers. Thanks for the article! 




 Police are mandatory reporters. They will just pass it off to CPS. Again, you are introducing anecdotal evidence. 




 I simplified down my situation. I also have a gf who will be graduating at the same time and bringing in a similar income. I've calculated what our after tax income will be and budgeted appropriately. 




 So if it were me, I would sell the car to a private party and have them go to your bank to pay it off, then immediately sign over title. That way you just need to focus on saving as much as you can towards the difference between car value and amount owed. 




 Dear god the interest rate on that vehicle!

I'm unfamiliar with how the process works when selling a car worth less than what you owe, but do you have to pay off the entire difference at once? If so, then do everything you can to get rid of it. Only pay the minimum on your CC debts and apply it to a fund to pay off the difference, because every month you keep the car, it is depreciating faster than you can pay down the loan.

So sell the car as soon as possible, buy a $5K car, and get a loan for that car if you have to. Or better yet, is public transportation an option for a while?

After that, assuming your car payment will be substntially lower, you should be able to pay off about $1800 in debt each month. Apply that to the card with the highest interest rate, making only minimum payments on the others.

You could be debt free in 7 months after you get rid of the car. Use that as motivation and stick to your budget after you're debt free. 




 Having a plan. If I made $50K a year and owed $75K, I'd live on $20K and throw $30K at the debt to pay it off in approximately 3 years. Done, no worries.

My situation is I am projected to earn $80K and owe about $105K when I graduate law school. My plan is to live on $50K (more than reasonable) and throw the rest at my debt until it's gone. Not only do I not worry day to day, but I sometimes splurge a bit because I'm comfortable with that debt. I'm aware that for every dollar I spend, I will owe about $1.30 for, and yet I still went to Disneyland a couple weekends ago because I thought it was worth it. 




 By arguing that they should not be considered "safe" to call, you are arguing they are likely to do more harm than good.

I vehemently disagree with that notion, as do many others. I think anyone who suspects child abuse of any sort has a moral obligation to contact them. Let me ask, how would you handle a situation in which you suspect a child is being abused? 




 LOL. The panic in someone's eyes when they need medical attention and the EMT asks their religion. They reply Christian thinking they are close to being saved. And the EMT just starts packing up, looking over his shoulder, "I only serve atheists." 




 I went to UTSA and graduated UT last year. The GPA did not transfer. 




 As someone who did a year at UTSA, I can say that the classes were beyond easy. They were easier than my community college classes. Now, a big reason for this is because I pretty much decided I would have no life. I went to the gym a bit, but other than that I had no life other than studying. I easily got a 4.0 in all 10 classes.

I'm assuming the quality of classes is similar at UTSA and Arlington. If so, and you are willing to sacrifice 9 months of your life to obtain your goal, then I would encourage you to go to Arlington. Baylor will likely be harder with a smaller chance of successful transfer.

The important part is to be totally committed. No (or very few) parties. And little time spent on socialization. I saw it as, friends don't really matter because I'm only gonna be here for 9 months. Just suck it up for 9 months and focus completely on academics and you will easily be able to get a 4.0. Best of luck. Let me know if you have any other questions. 




 While there are surely bad CPS agents, that is not cause to get rid of CPS. Just like we should not abolish the prison system because sometimes innocent people go to prison, we should not abolish CPS just because some agents lie or exaggerate to get children removed from homes.

Does the system need reform? Likely so, but that does not mean they do more harm than good. 




 Your experience is anecdotal evidence. The article specifically says "One data point I couldn't find, in the report or elsewhere: the number of children taken from parents, even temporarily, only to be returned with no finding of unlawful behavior."

 




 Man if you could somehow trick it to board a shuttle before takeoff, and get them to just push it out while on Mars... That'd be the end goal. 




 And I'm arguing you that you abolish all of those programs and replace with universal healthcare. It's cheaper per capita than what we pay collectively.

As for the supplemental insurance, the point is that some people will never be happy so you give them the opportunity to pay for faster healthcare.

And for being glad to hand money over, it's something that's the right thing to do. I know because right now I'm poor and know what it's like to need resources and will be happy to support those in need. I've given substantial money to homeless who were in need when I was earning money because I could see they needed it. That's what being human is about. 




 I understand that, but kids are not the best judges, nor are they always privy to all the facts. Contrary to popular belief, CPS does not just remove children at whim. They do thorough investigations and only remove when there is overwhelming evidence. If anything they usually remove later than they should. 




 I think that if the counselor felt it necessary to push boundaries, she should have the discretion to. Many kids are not forthcoming about their abuse. If 9 kids have to be needlessly interrogated to save 1 from an actual abusive household, I believe it is worth it. Yes, it's a hassle for those kids, but there will always be innocents in any sort of system.

The bar for defamation would have to be that she knowingly made a false statement. I don't know why you're assuming the counselor said anything other than "I suspect the following abuse..." She is obviously doing her job and should be given the benefit of the doubt. Of course if I am wrong, OP is gladly free to correct me on this point. 




 Do it!

If there's one thing you should have no regrets about, it's love. Since there are strong mutual feelings, you should not let this opportunity escape. Date him and if it's worth it, have one of you move to the other. Best of luck! Update us! 




 The possibility of sexual abuse was a different incident from the bruising. It was mandatory that she report it if she suspected.

Seriously, what motivation do you think this woman has, other than doing her job, that would be furthered by harassing OP?

Edit: it's not defamation or slander because there is at least a somewhat reasonable basis for her thinking that OP is abusive. He would have no case for that. 




 I did know they had supplemental insurance in the UK and think it would be a fine idea to introduce in the US after we have socialized healthcare.

As for the "free" part of your argument, I grew up in an upper middle class family. My proposal would increase taxes on my parents. You are correct in that I have little income currently, but being in law school, I can safely project that my gf and I will collectively bring home at least $160K annually in a few years and I will be GLAD to pay my fair share of taxes and subsidize healthcare for those who cannot afford it. This is because I have empathy and a pro-society viewpoint that supports the lives of people that need help. 




 Oh I totally thing it's a step in the right direction but does not go far enough. When Cruz says "repeal and replace" what do you think he means? And what would you like him to mean?

Because when I say replace. I mean that we should have a system much like the UK, where all medical services are free and paid for with a higher tax rate. That is shown to be vastly cheaper per capita than the current system we have in place. But I know that is exactly what Cruz constituents are against and believe he means replace with something in the opposite direction, which will lead to needless death. That is why I think Cruz is evil. 




 No, Ted is a horrible person. I agree with the other poster that he's obviously brilliant, and just chooses his positions for political ends.

Just for example, denying that global warming exists, which would result in defunding and initiatives to combat it, if Ted had his way, would cost untold lives in the future. Further, repealing the ACA would also result in untold death by more people not visiting their doctor or getting a certain treatment just because they couldn't afford it. If you knowingly attempt to cause mass deaths, that makes you a horrible person. Thus, since Ted is smart enough to understand these consequences, he is a horrible person. 




 Seriously. I feel like I'm crazy here. Why would the counselor not report the abuse? She's required to by law! 




 Dude not the same at all. The counselor saw the child withdrawn and reported it. The counselor saw bruising and reported it. The counselor heard about possible sexual abuse and reported it. The counselor is a MANDATORY reporter. If she suspects child abuse at all, she must report it. She's letting CPS investigate. She's only doing her job. 




 Yea not related at all. There's substantial reason for the counselor to believe the child is being mistreated. It happens to be wrong here, but that doesn't mean counselor a should stop investigating child abuse claims when a parent complains. 




 Thank you for some support. I feel like I'm going nuts. If I were a counselor and suspected abuse from 3 separate incidents, I would also report each incident. No way should the counselor be forced to stop just because a parent is mad about the investigation. Then wouldn't every parent whose mistreating their kids just complain to the administration that they're being "harassed?" 




 Show me stats that support that this happens on even a semi-regular business. Or are you saying that we should abolish CPS because there are some innocents taken away? 




 Honestly, I realize this sucks and is inconvenient to you, but hats off to that counselor. She is doing her job, and seems like she genuinely believes you are beating her and so continually reports all suspected abuse. Maybe you could turn it around and praise her for this. Telling your daughter not to talk to her is possible but will only make the counselor more suspicious of you.

If whenever you are confronted, you tell them you appreciate she is doing her job, and that she is a good person for reporting all suspected abuse, she may let up on you. 




 That would be a hilarious result of this new policy. 




 Oh, that makes sense.

So doesn't everyone basically get one "free year?" Like if I start PAYE right after I finish school and my income during the school year was zero, then I would basically not have to pay for the first year? 




 Bad is an opinion. In my opinion some of it was bad. Yes, I like the 80's feel when the monster was near and the tension was building and when it got really loud, but the high pitched tings did not feel like they fit the moment, and there were lots of them. 




 That's exactly what /u/xtrexjpsouz described. Your degree was phased out. You chose the degree. They phased it out after letting you finish. The school does not believe there are job opportunities for your degree in the future.

Their deciding this does not allow you to completely discharge your student loans. And why should it? You chose this degree, and even admit if they hadn't offered it then you would have looked elsewhere for the same degree. You believe the school is wrong and that there ARE job opportunities for this degree. So go find those jobs and pay your loans. 




 Basically, I'll be graduating from law school in 2 years and am considering going solo. Maybe not immediately, but eventually.

How would PAYE work if I have no idea of my income? What if I project I will earn $50K that year and end up with $30k? Do I just pay the differences at the end? What if I project $50K and end up at $80K? Will there be penalties? 




 That would be hilarious. Like board a plane like you're going to Europe, then just get off after it gets on, and right before the doors close. Then it has to go to Europe.

I would think it would just fly to Europe but then fly right back and resume its plan. 




 I'm pretty sure it could cross an ocean. From the pool scene we know it can swim. It would just swim slowly and it obviously doesn't run out of energy. But what I want to know is if it can board a plane and get to you if you're really far away. 




 You can hire a lawyer to write a demand letter for you to the broker. This will likely scare it out of them, but will cost you a few hundred dollars. 




 Generally the breakeven point for buying a house is about 5 years. Further, you are unlikely to qualify for a house purchase with little credit and low income. Sorry to be a downer. 




 It's crazy that Aldo is about to tie Anderson Silva's record for title defenses and he's not given the respect as one of the GOATs. 




 I mean we saw in the pool scene that it can swim. It would probably just swim at you very slowly. 




 I don't know the nuances of the law there, but maybe you had to verbally assert that you were invoking your rights to mutual combat. 




 They did say it was smart and it avoided getting into the pool. I don't think it would get into the container but it's worth a try. 




 So you need a mobile job. Also, can it ride public transportation? Like would it take the bus to get to you? 




 That would be a great idea! Another idea I thought of would be to shoot it with a tracker dart, so you could always keep track of where it is. But with the whole "it's slow but it's also smart" thing, I'd be wary about it tricking me by putting the dart in another animal and giving me a false sense of security. No doubt it would be worth a try though. 




 Just wondering what everyone's strategy would be if they caught it.

If it were me, I'd fly to Australia and sleep with a prostitue then fly that person to Europe where I pay them to sleep with someone, then fly that person to Africa and pay them to sleep with someone and then maybe to China and at that point is feel safe. 




 See I loved the ending. Just curious, what kind of ending were you looking for? Jay to die in the pool? 




 Just finished It Follows. I've been waiting for the last 3 weeks to see it and... Just wow. It did not let me down.

Yea some of the music was pretty bad but that was about my only complaint.
A lot of the shots were very well done. I particularly liked the ending where it's following them both as they casually stroll.

You just get so deep into the psyche when you see Jay getting desperate to bang those dudes on the boat, and the pure panic in her eyes when the window first broke.
I loved the concept and am really glad this movie made its big break to 1000 theaters.

Coming from someone who absolutely hates scary movies and only saw this because it was advertised as a scary concept and not jump-scare heavy, I just want to say this movie thoroughly delivered on that promise.

I hope to see more from that writer in the future.
P.S. What year was it supposed to be? That little shell reading thing made me think current, but the house phone and other things made me think otherwise. 




 Thank you. Anecdotal evidence bugs me. Also, nice username. 




 Have you tried contacting all local jails, hospitals and morgues? Have you filed a missing persons report with the police? Do you know where the car was when it was towed? 




 Look up Phoenix Jones mutual combat video on YouTube. That's an example. He offers to settle via mutual combat and the cops watch as the guys fight. 




 According to the way OP posted it, it says he only has to pay it back if HE chooses to leave.

If I were him, this would be acceptable provided the comply gives an exemption if he leaves for medical reasons as nobody could predict that. Although in that case it would arguably not be his CHOICE anyways.

Edit: saw he clarified below, my bad 




 Edit: misread question  




 Ah my bad. I took "current dollars" to mean if dollar amounts were current and I missed the second column because I'm on mobile. 




 1-2%?!? Not true at all. 




 That $2700 per year is for private colleges and inflation adjusted. It was $655 per year, ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION! Now I'm sad. 




 Did it seem to give you a boost in your internships? 




 Just wondering how well you were compensated. The TA's at my school make $1500 per semester, which hardly seems worth it.

Also does it look good on your resume? I got an A+ my first semester in property, which is the area of law I'm looking to get into, so I feel like it would be very on point. 




 My girlfriend got an accommodation just for 1L exams. Was not for ADD though. Basically she just asked the school what needs to be included in the letter and they told her. It was stuff like: what condition and what accommodations are you requesting. I would recommend you ask the bar what they want in the letter. 




 So what? 




 As someone with 187 tickets, plz... 




 Just to note, you can almost certainly sue the man who beat you up to recover medical cost and other damages. Were you wrong to call her a cunt? Most likely. Was the other guy wrong to beat you up enough to put you in the hospital? Almost surely. Also note, some states have an exclusion on liability for "fighting words." 




 Former realtor here. Can confirm, Zillow highly inaccurate. 




 Honestly, if it were me, I ask to meet up with her, and when you show up at the door, ask to just spend some brother-sister time with her. Go to a decently quiet place and just lay it all out there. She sounds like she's pretty smart, just a little overtaken at the moment. Tell her you think it's in her best interest to leave. Plead, beg. Tell her she can leave with you that night and you will help her get on her feet (then be prepared to actually do that).

If she takes you up on it, have her leave with you immediately and make sure she blocks all contact with this guy. After 6 months or so in the "real world" she'll see how crazy he is. Then just hope for the best. 




 Purely guessing, I'd think that the hospital the professor worked at said "you get free healthcare at any of our facilities" and so when they price out an aspirin at $5 and a bandage at $20, that's what they're projecting in the professor's coverage. This is in contrast to the mother of 3 who works at IBM, where IBM negotiates all the costs with the exact same hospital, where they only get charged $1.50 an aspirin and $3 a bandage. 




 As a law student, I'm loving how accurate this is. Never thought I'd see "shepardize" used on TV. 




 Jesus I didn't realize what a murderer's row he was facing until seeing it typed out. I'm not sure anyone outside the top 10 would do better than 0-5. 




 Do you mind sharing how? 




 Frustrated =/= angry

I think Poirier was frustrated. Aldo's just pissed at him. 




 I don't think angry = getting in someone's head. But that doesn't make it true. You're entitled to your opinion though. 




 That's a nice thought, but almost surely there was a contract provision that required him to return the money. And if he fought it in court, he would almost surely lose and just cost himself the money plus legal fees.

I'm doubting he gave back hundreds of thousands of dollars to a billionaire out of the goodness of his heart. 




 That just means you're average. I see that you go to a high T2 school. With average grades there, you are may get a semi-decent job. However, if you're positive you do not want to be a lawyer, it's probably wise to get out before you get anymore debt. 




 Agreed. If OP was a 3L, people here might encourage him to just stick it out for the marginal advantage it might possibly give somewhere down the line. But as a 1L, bail now. 




 I said nervous or scared.

If some little punk came up to you talking shit but he was like 5'2" and weighed 110 pounds, you wouldn't be scared or nervous, but you'd probably be angry enough to knock him silly. Which is what I expect Aldo to do to Connor. 




 Why do you think this is getting into Aldo's head? I haven't seen him look nervous or scared at any time. 




 If they had time, of course, but I was attempting to give a hypothetical in which it would be impractical to change out the candidate's name from the ballots. 




 Well do it.

You may have to take this to court if the police will not help. 




 I like to laugh at them. Not out loud, but in my head. Unless you're a 1L and they're being dicks to weed out the class, then they're only doing it because they have fun making other people uncomfortable. In that case, realize how sad their lives are that they have to resort to basically bullying people under them. It is then that you laugh at how pathetic that is.

 Except 4 were chokes.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Carwin 




 I know. I even checked before I posted my comment and nobody had called him out yet. Dude had about 750 upvotes, so likely 1000 people just voting on his comment and not one bothered to fact check it? Like really? 




 Yes he is. By average of the polls over the last month, he's in first place actually. The worst he's doing in any poll is 2nd, by 3%.

http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_republican_presidential_nomination-3823.html 




 Ok but I'm saying if they get terrible they won't get better. 




 Ok let's be real:

1) The reason we say don't vote for third parties is because of the spoiler effect leading to possibly your least favorite choice winning.

2) Obviously an individual vote doesn't make a difference. The closest vote in electoral history was Florida in 2000 that had a difference of 537 votes (Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_close_election_results).

3) Thus, the reason we say don't vote third party is because we don't want people to encourage others to vote third party because then we may end up with the least desirable candidate winning.

4) So even if you live in a non-swing state, you shouldn't encourage others to vote third party because it may turn your state into a swing state if you have enough sway, or if you make a few people decide to vote third and they in turn make people decide to vote third in the next election and so on, until your state that would have been a safe state is now a swing state a few elections down the road. 




 While this is true on a micro level, if you start it and others follow then eventually enough may follow so that your state turns into a swing state. 




 But if you don't follow the rules, then the greater evil candidate can win. And they DEFINITELY won't change it so that your vote elects someone else. 




 Because you don't change it by voting for your favorite candidate. Think of it this way: if there's a democrat you're meh on, an independent you love, and a republican you hate- and you (and enough others) vote for the independent, causing the republican to win where the democrat otherwise would have- then the republicans are in charge and your arugment is that this will somehow be a message to them to change the voting system? Maybe it will, but wouldn't they be completely disincentivized from changing the system because they won in the current system?

You need to change the electoral system before you abide by its voting rules. 




 Wouldn't that get a little confusing with current President Clinton? 




 Completely agree. But until we change the electoral system, we must play by their rules. 




 Vote for whoever you want in the primary, but when it comes to the General, you need to pick the lesser of the two evils. Otherwise you risk splitting the vote and having the least desirable candidate win. 




 Yea, but you'll also go to jail. So you may be "up" $10K, but then you spend 2 years in jail not earning money during that time. 




 List all loans with interest rate and all income and expenses 




 Wait what goes in that last blank? Nearby street name? 




 Or fired when they realize your job is automated... 




 Dude's about to make a killing. Likely punitive damages after his lawyer argues that this is just the first time the cops got caught. 




 For real. As a 1L I've only ever talked to 2Ls. Also, this would have been more appropriate to post last semester. I know what I'm doing now. 




 You linked Austin and he's in Houston FYI. 




 For real. I would feel very good about volunteering to do this for a weekend. Is there any place I can search to see if these fake clinics are in my area? 




 This just made me think: if there are pro-life protesters outside of abortion clinics, couldn't pro-choice protesters go stand outside of these fake clinics and warn people? 




 . 




 Don't do this without consulting a lawyer first. 




 Ah I though you were saying waive it for the year, not permanently. That seems like a long shot but I see your logic. 




 Hire a lawyer to investigate.

Possible they have a different person with the same name. Possible he was convicted in absence (although then he would have had a warrant and the cops would not have let him go). Possible the clerk just entered it in wrong. 




 If they waive the graduation requirement he'll still have to complete the classes though and thus wouldn't be able to attend the college anyways. But if he does summer classes, they wouldn't have to waive the requirement. 




 Your family should hire a lawyer. If you completed the classes, I'm not sure they can withhold the credits, even if it's "policy." However, I could easily be wrong. A quick consult with a lawyer should clear it up.

As others have pointed out, can you do summer school for the credits? Through your current high school or community college?

Oh I just thought of another idea! Can you have your Wisconsin high school transfer the credits back to Ohio school and graduate from there?
 




 Just a note, but you usually have a duty to return the apt to the condition you received it in. So if it was filthy (AND YOU CAN PROVE THAT) then you would at least likely get the "extra cleaning" fee back.

Other than that, by looks the door knob is 3x the price, the covers are 2x and everything else looks somewhat reasonable. 




 Age is really the defining factor on if this was child abuse. 




 Well well well. How the tables have turned... 




 Not over 4%, 3.8%. Yes, 2.07% is the average for past 10 years and usually the target inflation rate. A plausible rate would 2% + whatever % accounts for defaults. 




 4%?!? Inflation rates are currently close to 0%. It hasn't been over 4% in the last 24 years.

 Now I'm imagining a world where every person in a seedy bar files rape charges against their one night stand when they find out their partner was not a "secret agent" the next morning. 




 Maybe so. 




 Well he's likely worried about it getting worse. 




 Exactly! That's why the high school student is saying he's afraid of the crisis! Because even if he has perfectly legit credit, it may be too restricted. 




 So he's wrong... Like I said. 




 I skimmed and must have missed it. I guess don't respond if you don't want to. 




 It severely increased the requirements, which is what the high school student is concerned about. 




 Ha, no. 




 Wait how? Just because the electoral numbers don't add up? It doesn't work like that.

Perot was much closer to Bush than he was Clinton. So if we say for example that, of those who voted for Perot, 60% would vote for Bush and 40% for Clinton, Bush would have a clear majority of votes. Then you'd have to distribute that on a state by state basis, but the consensus is that Bush would have won.

 Best thing you can do to driver her away from him is make her see him as she sees you. Next time he's over offer him a beer and sit in the backyard talking about 401Ks and taxes. Ask how his golf game is. Anything to make her see him as old. 




 It'd be funny if the parents were still paying Lucas. 




 Ok fine let's say they are legally retarded, defined as IQ under 70 (if I remember correctly) and they believe they are not, and hire me to follow them around telling them they're not.

However, to your substantive point, I agree they are still evil scum taking advantage of a vulnerable population. Further, I agree that we, as a society, have a duty to identify vulnerable populations and expose them to other methods that can help them instead of letting them fall prey to bad influences.

From a Due Process standpoint, we cannot merely make it illegal to charge for "reading fortunes" without a host of other issues. Instead, we could treat it like the Pay Day Loan industry and heavily regulate it where people can still use the services but are substantially less likely to be **completely** taken advantage of. 




 Ok, let's say a person believes they are beautiful but everyone calls them ugly. So they hire me to follow them around all day calling them beautiful. Even though it's a lie, it makes them feel good. Why should they not be able to do this? It's their own free will. Yea they could get better support from a psychiatrist, but they chose me to make them feel better. 




 That is realistically the only way I see him winning. 




 I agree. Obviously, in real life, the line is crossed much more frequently from "person helping widow get over her grief" to "taking every penny possible."

It's a crap business to be in on either side for completely different reasons. 




 Yea I see your point. To further play devil's advocate: let's say there's an old couple with no kids or family. The husband dies. The wife believes in mediums. Why shouldn't she get to spend the rest of her money to "talk" to her husband? It's still 100% her choice. Nobody if forcing her to spend the money. 




 To buy out an entire theater on opening day for a popular movie would be what the theater expected to make plus a fee. So assuming it sold out and you only wanted the theater for one showing time, lets say $10/ticket and $150 seats, you could probably rent it out for $2,000. But you still have to drive there, sit in crappy seats, and be seen in public, which isn't feasible if you're Lebron. 




 See I get the hate, but then a part of me thinks if it actually comforts the person is it not worth something? Obviously $10K would be wayyyy over the top. But if for something like $100 someone was comforted that their dead loved one was "doing well in the afterlife" that would be reasonable, right? 




 I would agree with the statement that we know nothing concrete from all presidential elections, especially because they are spread out over such a large period of time. That's not to say we know nothing of election theory because we have many thousands to analyze in the last 10 years alone, in the US. 




 Nobody is in charge. Who is "they" in your "they wouldn't run her again" example?

It's all just voters voting on whoever has enough name recognition and screws up the least. 




 n=10 is NOTHING in statistics. You need a sample size of at least 1000 to to even establish a weak correlation, let alone causation. 




 In your situation, assuming you are moving states, it would seem wise to move as soon as your last final ends and just come back for graduation. Or you could just skip it. 




 Not the person you replied to but I'd imagine if he continued to live like he was near homeless (think $20K) on a salary of someone who finished graduate school (maybe $100K) and invested that at 7% (average stock market return), he could easily be a millionaire in 13 years. 




 RED ALERT ON PRO #2!!!

Even if the seller is an attorney, you pay your own attorney to look over the contract and advise you. He could easily write a contract with a term you don't understand and screw you over with, **especially because he's an attorney.** It will not be a big expense compared to all the other closing costs. You'll still want title insurance, a survey, and inspection (which will all be required by the bank anyways). Do not cheap out on the attorney, or it could easily come back to bit you for 10 times the cost.

Other than that, just be aware you will independently (as in without your friend) be responsible for the entire mortgage payment if the upstairs rents move out.

Also be aware of the potential costs you're taking on. Water heater/AC break? Your expense. Tenants upstairs literally begin taking axes to the walls? You'll need to take proper eviction proceedings and know how to do that (you'll need an attorney). This will require an emergency fund for the house specifically of at least $10,000.

 I tried to look at the MTurk article, admittedly not thoroughly, and didn't see what they defined as "child." Is it just under 18? Cause then like 99% of guys would be attracted to a post-pubescent "hot" 17 year old. And then that would make the study a lot less noteworthy in my opinion. 




 Would you like to bet on it? 




 No round winner or loser. It's a tie. 




 Ok but if it's your injuries you would want pictures then? 




 Nope.

I'm saying ROUNDS can be competitive, even where the FIGHT isn't even close.

Example: if every round was identical, with Also outstriking Mendes by a single punch each round with the power and everything else even, then it would be a clear 50-45. That's a fight that's not even close but was competitive as hell. 




 If you're employees are not busy at some points, you could have them hold a sign counter-protesting with something like "We did give him correct change. Ask me about it." and have the employee give a short blurb if you're worried about losing potential customers.

Plus, since this guy seems a little nuts, if he threatens any employee you can report it to the police. 




 If I were you, I would tell your landlord that you won't be moving out. Instead, move stuff to be reasonably messy around the house. By early May, (s)he'll be begging you to move out and likely offer you some money instead of you paying for months you won't even live there.

Your landlord is strong arming you right now because it's working. Stop play by their rules. You can easily flip the tables. 




 For real. I've paid about $5,000 on my cat's various illnesses. I know technically she's worth maybe $20, but to me she's worth a lot more.

A lot of time on /r/legaladvice I see very uncaring attitudes. I wish people giving advice on here showed a little more compassion sometimes. 




 Eh I guess he'll just have to face Khabib instead. 




 I love that you set your post up so that someone answering "yes" means two different things. It depends if they're replying to your title or the text body. 




 Completely agreed. I think a competitive fight can still result in a clear decision. 




 I completely agree. I'm not saying it wasn't competitive, only that Aldo clearly won and it wasn't close (by that I mean, it wasn't very arguable that Mendes won). 




 Then you consented to the search. The proper thing to do in that situation would have been to wait for the dogs. 




 If you clearly win 4 rounds, then you clearly win the fight. 




 What reason did they give for searching after you denied? 




 I actually agree with you. Frankie is a much busier fighter. I know it wasn't a lot of time, but even in this fight, Lamas was hitting Mendes much more before he was dropped. Frankie is non-stop work for 25 minutes. If he avoids getting caught, I think he takes Mendes. 




 Every judge had it 49-46. That's not that close. Granted some of the rounds weren't runaways, but they were all pretty clear. 




 Well maybe they really do hate him. Can't imagine why. 




 Agreed. I see it as the classic two wrestlers end up in a striking match. And I think Frankie is just busier and more accurate. Granted Mendes has more power, but as long as Frankie doesn't get caught too badly (although he does have a hell of a chin), he'll grab a unanimous decision. 




 I think of a super fight as 2 champs fights. If Aldo gets the immediate shot it'll be a super fight to me. 




 And the 1 win was a split decision. 




 Oh thanks. 




 Not to mention that we're going to be seeing JBJ with more cardio than he's ever had before, because he won't be dealing with a weight cut. 




 I'm pretty positive Aldo will move up after his win and get an immediate title shot. You'll have a super fight in early 2016. 




 See I always think that, but the way Edgar just absolutely manhandled Cub makes me question it.

I sincerely hope Aldo moves up after McG, and Edgar sweeps the floor with Urijah and we get Mendes/Edgar for new championship. That's the only fight in the division that would make be worthy of a championship fight after Aldo leaves. 




 I just want your post to have at least one positive comment. I agree with you. 




 The fans were booing the decision, not the fighters. At least that's how I interpret booing after a close decision. 




 You don't have to verbally tell the victim, just make them apprehensive. Walking at them with your fist raised would usually be more than enough in most jurisdictions. 




 I'm in San Diego. That about as South and West you can get. Get ready for the expensive housing though. 




 Usually assault too though. 




 Thanks so much man! 




 Ok that's the thing I don't know. I haven't driven a manual since I was 15. 




 Thanks for the insight. I think I'm just gonna have to bite the bullet and thank myself later. 




 Where would I find these? Is there a specific website? I'm in California if that helps. 




 So if I tank this semester just enough.... 




 Thank you for your input. 




 I don't get this reference. Is there a manufacturing problem with the car? 




 That's another thing I was afraid of. This coming Fall, assuming my grades stay stable, I don't want to be asked why I'm not on it and have it come off as if I'm lazy.

Do you know approximately the time commitment per week? 




 Real way to fix the problem: sit in one of the first 2 rows. 




 I am decently sure I'll be an automatic admit to Law Review after 1L finishes. I'm wondering how much it actually helps in job searches. I have zero interest in actually reading, writing, or editing articles in excess to classes and an internship, but if it gives me a big boost I'll do it.

Any input appreciated. 




 Didn't even know of that subreddit! Thanks! 




 No gear to move. No kids. Not fat or tall. No snow.

Which of the cars you mentioned is best? I assume the smaller for better MPG? 




 Budget is anything up to $20,000 really. But I don't want to pay anywhere near that. Just whatever is the most cost cost effective.

As for what I require: literally nothing except basic safety.

I realize this is broad, but I'm just trying to find what the best deal possible is. 
























 I agree that if he can achieve the name recognition she has that Sanders will win. I just do not agree that he will end up anywhere close to Clinton, even if he had a full year. 




 How is it not useful? If Bernie does not ever achieve close to what Clinton has in name recognition then he won't win. 




 For the life of me I could not understand why the police just told the guy they suspected him of a crime. That would have forced him to identify himself. Also they did meet the burden for arresting him. They had testimony that a woman reported him of stalking her, a crime. They just knew he didn't do it and didn't want to go through the paperwork. 




 I always wonder who the white kid is in that video. Is he getting picked on by the black kid? Is he just chillin? He plays it cool as a cucumber. 




 The link you refer to compares Obama to different Republican candidates. In your link, if you go down to the Democratic Candidates heading and click that link, and sort to a Broad Race, you will find that Obama was polling about 20-25% in June 2007.

The percentages you refer to Sanders polling in are open Democratic primary races. The above link I referenced is the closest comparison.

While I agree it is highly unlikely Sanders will win, your comparison was not referencing the same type of polling for Obama in June 2007 and Sanders in June 2015.

 After I posted my comment, I saw your comment below regarding the Cruz case where different is not necessarily worse. I guess that within the context of the article, the connotation was that you meant worse, even if that is not what you meant. 




 The potential client. 




 I don't see that as nitpicking at all. I love Slack's writing but that was sloppy. Don't make an absolute statement if you were not intending it to cover all instances. 




 JUST. LIKE. THAT. 




 If it would depend, please give me a scenario  where you would advise a client to sign a document that they would not treat as legally enforceable. 




 He went undefeated for 10 years. He fought for many different orgs and in many non-title fights so title defenses is not as impressive as it could be. But his strength of competition was still respectable. He fought many fights against fighters ranked in the top 10 at the time of the fight. 




 I'm in law school. I work in a law office and write enforceable contracts ever day. 




 Of course it is. Would you sign a contract that you may be able to use unconscionability as a defense for? What if your defense to the contract is denied? 




 Of course, but it's better to treat everything you sign as if it is legally enforceable.  




 Do not believe it if they say that! Whatever you sign is legally enforceable. Your best bet is to go over the contract with a labor attorney. 




 While you are correct, you never want to give the police information that could be used against you.

If it were me, I would give a short, one sentence statement on my 911 call or after police arrive, explaining that the person attacked me first, and then shut up until I had a lawyer. 




 If it were me, I would say on the 911 call that I shot/stabbed whomever in self defense because they were attacking me. When the police get there, say you to refer to your 911 call and shut up until you have a lawyer. 

I say this as a law student who has been working with and been around many lawyers. 




 Burden of proof is on the state. Yea they can take you to jail, but police can take anyone to jail for any reason.

 This is not a legal issue. I am not familiar with Australian law, but there is almost no likelihood that they are required to rent out to someone under 18.

This leaves you with only the option of finding someone you know there to let you stay with them, or find a company that will let you rent from them at 17 (highly unlikely).

Another possibility is catching a flight there the day of the game, attending the game, and flying home immediately after.

 Well I'm saying that Kennedy is decidedly on the side of same-sex rights. Thus, he is not the swing vote. It's possible that even in a 5-4 decision there is no swing vote. 




 Then you're calling every justice in the majority the swing vote, in any 5-4 decision. 




 Kennedy literally wrote the Windsor opinion. He has been in several decisions that have upheld same-sex rights. It is highly doubtful he will be the swing vote in the current same-sex case.

As for the Obamacare subsidies, he was in the dissent in the last case, with CJ Roberts being the deciding vote. That one is a crap shoot on the final decision. 




 I live in San Diego!! 




 That seems... unlikely. It would be highly unethical of them. I'm not saying you're lying, but do you have a source?

  Older fans started whispering that this felt like 4th and 26.

As someone who watched that live, I remember felling like crap for 3 weeks afterwards and had a similar feeling after the Seahawks game. I'm 26. Am I old? 




 It's ok. I'm in law school making terrible financial decisions as my current self. :(( 




 I see. I went to a state school where tuition was only $4,000 per semester. I bet that makes a big difference. 




 My experience was the opposite. The vast majority of people I knew paid their own way with grants, loans, scholarships, and jobs. 




 Again, many parents refuse to cosign. Mine did not do that either. 




 The trick with fines is you have to control for how many times the person is caught. So if $50 would prevent me from throwing a cigarette on the ground, but I'm only caught 1/50 times, I might find it worth $1 to litter each time. But at $2500, it's worth $50 for each offense. 




 No, but most parents don't pay for their kid's college. My parents didn't pay a cent of tuition or living costs. 




 Stop paying fees for grandma.

Stop paying brother rent unless it's cheaper than a storage facility.

Stop giving uncle money unless it's cheaper than living elsewhere.

Get a job, anything- even minimum wage to keep her busy and give her income.

 He did say in one comment that he has a felony on his record. 




 I don't know if this is how other schools grade, but mine does points. I got exactly 255 points, equating to a B+, both semesters. Afterwards, I just thought about the odds of that happening.

Unfortunately, that went from my worst class first semester to my second best class second semester. :( 




 As someone who has filed several FAFSA's, that is definitely not true. You put down whatever income you want, and if they audit you, which is very rarely, then you have to provide verification via your latest tax return. However, it would be very dumb to write a higher number on FAFSA than you actually make, so it is very likely she makes AT LEAST that amount. 




 You're being downvoted, but as a law student currently working at a firm where a company is doing exactly that, you are likely right that this is at least part of the reason. Zuffa has very deep pockets and can bury the fighters in motion after motion until they run out of money.

As a result, these lawyers who were likely hired locally by the fighters, now have to travel to Nevada for every hearing. That can get expensive. 




 Law student who just finished Civil Procedure. This is correct. You cannot appeal unless it is a final judgment, with very few exceptions that it doesn't look like fit here. However, they would be able to appeal this after the entire case finishes, but it is highly unlikely it would be overturned. 




 I see it from that perspective. I guess it just depends on the dynamic of their relationship. For me, I know my SO would never say she would be going to the corner store and not answer her phone for so long. We also live in a bit of a rough neighborhood so that plays into effect for me. 




 I'd love to hear your breakdown after any high profile fights if you want to keep posting here! Glad to have you, Scott! 




 It might have something to do with being a new user. 




 For me, the corner store is about a 2 minute walk away. I would report my SO missing if they took an hour. 




 It will expire, but the extension will be able to pass 3 days after its expiration. We will be right back where we are now. But hey, I guess we'll get 3 days without the govt reading our stuff.

 He means the person who lost the bracelet, the police, or anyone besides the legal clinic. Who did you admit to that you took the bracelet? Did someone see you take it? 




 I'm only a law student but perhaps someone could weigh in on the possibility of suing your school in small claims court. You would not need an attorney for this and the fee is rather cheap. You could bring your friend whose door was also left unlocked and any other proof you had. I believe this would be your best option. 




 What is the context of this? Jonah just doesn't wanna be on camera? 




 Went to see it with my girlfriend last night. I cheered when Clay came on screen. A bunch of girls in the theater cheered as well. My girlfriend informed me it was because they tore his shirt sleeves off to show off his muscles. I just thought there were a lot of Packer fans :( 




 In addition to recording the screams and giving them to the police, you should attend your next city council meeting and bring the issue to light. See if you need to sign up to be a speaker and explain the situation. The more neighbors who will come with you, the better. If it were me, I would suggest to the city council that maybe a motion-activated flood light could be installed, facing away from the houses, but I'm not sure if that is practical. Further, making sure these two are prosecuted each time they break the law and suffer a higher punishment each time could be a suggestion, but that would only help if the possible punishment includes jail time. For the break ins, you could look into having a security camera point at your driveway. 




 You are literally crazy. 




 Even in civil courts, the general rule is to require unanimity. The difference is the burden of proof, from "beyond reasonable doubt" in the criminal system to a "preponderance of evidence" which basically means 50%+1. 




 I don't see a legal issue here. She can proceed however she wants to. 




 If they have a waiting list for your type of apartment (ex. 2 bed 1 bath), you will almost certainly not be responsible for the extra month if you tell them you are moving out on such and such date. You could find this out by having a friend call and describe your type of apartment and ask if there's any openings. Note: you may still be responsible for some incidental charges 









 I don't know how many MMA fans I'll find in here but this guy looks EXACTLY like an old-man Nick Diaz.

 Dude probably has crazy high insurance limits to protect his massive net worth. I'm sure his insurance will settle for below his limits. 




 My god... I'm not sure I would have been able to leave the table. That's just insane. 




 Yes but not a ton. It won't get you into a school unless you were right on the edge and the others didn't have the work experience.

An admissions officer once told me that LSAT is 50% of an application, GPA is 49%, and everything else put together is 1%. I find that to be pretty accurate. 




 A good LSAT score is essential for you. You don't have a great GPA but you don't have a crap one. One point about the LSAT is to give yourself time to take it at least 2 times, if not 3. Since you're taking a year off that means your last one should be December 2016, 2nd to last October 2016, and first one June 2016. You have plenty of time to learn so you should begin reading some of the Bibles and maybe take an LSAT class.

Also for your gap year, try to find a job that is law related. It can only help your application and give you a perspective on if you want to be doing that for the next 40 years of your life. 




 As much cap space as he's eating up, I agree. I think anything up to 1/3 of our cap space would be a good value for him. I mean he's (arguably) the best player in the league at the most important position. 




 Rodgers is the highest paid player in the league at $22M per year? So much for TT's value contracts... 




 Exactly. People get picky here, sorry.

 As a 17 year old, who won't be at the same school his girlfriend until after the first year of college, I can say with 99.99% accuracy that it won't last the rest of your lives. And there's nothing wrong with that. Everyone has young relationships where they are head over heels for each other and think life is just the best ever. But people grow up and change. As much as you may not want to hear it, you will change a LOT over the next 2, 4, 10 years.

My advice would be to enjoy the time you have with her. Be happy, let her be happy and just go with life. This is one of the last times in your life where you have next to no responsibility, so just go with the flow.

Your college plans sound like one of you is a year older and have plans to join the other at college after the first year. Is that right? If so, I can almost guarantee the relationship won't last. I'm not trying to sound mean. It's just long distance is hard. And even if by some miracle you were in the same city, it would ruin the first year of college where you should be making all sorts of friends and getting into schenanigans and going to your first parties while living on your own.

Assuming you're the one leaving for college and she's a year behind, I would say you should enjoy the time you have, but when you're about to leave just let her down gently. Be nice and tell her there's a whole world out there and if she still wants to pursue a relationship in another year when you're both a little older and have more life experience, you'd be glad to try.

Best of luck, man. 




 Well how common is your name? Closer to Joe Smith or Fencile Whooperpuff? 




 Former Realtor here.

This is standard practice, at least in my area. He will get paid a finders fee by the apartment complex you rent from. 




 Just like OJ... 




 Pure conjecture, but maybe growing up with the Internet? I'm 26 and the Internet just started to get big around middle school for me. So I was all over it to learn and research during my developmental years. 35 year olds were mostly out of high school by the time the Internet started to get big. 




 You should start applying for other nanny jobs immediately. Look for jobs that include live-in if you need it. Otherwise they should pay enough, if they're full time, where you can afford your own place (even if with a roommate).

Your safety and mental well-being are most important. Be vigilant at all times when you are at the house, especially if the wife is out. 




 He certainly did. At 23, Holloway is starting to show some serious game. Punches were on point, subs were on point. I'd like to see him become a little more comfortable with wrestling and clinch but he's coming into his own.

I just worry about them throwing him to the top too fast. With Aldo/McG coming up, Holloway likely only has one more fight before a title shot. But he should take at least another year or so to continue improving. 




 Dillashaw-esque was his performance, Joe. 




 This whole thing about "family" is crap. Would you not report any child molester to the police?

If I were you, the absolute next thing I would do after reading this comment is to immediately call the police. You can call 24/7. You can call the non-emergency line.

These girls lives are likely to be severely impacted because of this. You were who they confided in so YOU have a responsibility. Your uncle doesn't want the cops called on his dad? Tough crap dude. Maybe he shouldn't have molested children. If someone in your family murdered someone, would you not call the cops?

Come on man, get your head in the game. 




 Fun Fact: Holloway fought four times last year and is already fighting for the second time this year and it's only mid-April. If he ends up with four fights in 2015, I believe he'd have the record for most fights in a 2 year period (8, tied with Cerrone (twice)). 




 He's starting to say "two of us" but gets cut off after the t so it looks like "t-" which looks the same as +- because the handwriting isn't perfect. 




 Gracias. 




 HOW DO YOU HAVE TIME TO BE HERE? 




 It still hurts... 




 Why would you wipe off with a towel??? 




 Why wouldn't you just go up to your room??? 




 I agree it helps, but it's still not bullet-proof. 




 Ok, so you get them charged with that. But if caught, they still may report it to their insurance and you could easily be found responsible for the damages. 




 I am just a 1L, but where did I go wrong?

More of a Civil Procedure issue than Evidence? Same end result and since he wasn't asking for nuances of law, I figured I answered it enough. 




 Yea, rules of evidence. But you could wait until they formally file the lawsuit and then give their lawyer the dashcam footage in discovery. 




 On the flip side, if anyone ever does this and you DON'T have a dashcam, just gesture towards your windshield and say you do. Maybe they'll freak out and leave. You'll still be stuck with your damage, but that's better than the other guy's as well, b/c 99/100 they would rule you responsible in this situation. 




 Even better: "You're welcome" 




 Jehovah Witness if I remember correctly. 




 Where do you see that? In the article they only mentioned getting rid of the personal exemption. 




 I'm not arguing that at all,only that anyone that now has a personal exemption can simply claim s religious exemption. 




 I left out the sub to punches. That's more of a tko. 




 Still allows religious exemption. Biiiiig loophole. 




 Under current election theory with our current electoral standards, that is exactly what you should do if you want to minimize the risk of a Republican winning. 




 But that's what I'm saying, it won't get better under your scenario.

Let me put it this way: you're saying "swim across the ocean, you'll hit land eventually" and I'm saying "you're not going into the ocean, you're heading for outer space so you'll never hit Earth again." 




 Well then 4(b) applies.

But my point is that by posting this or telling others you'll vote 3rd party, you are possibly convincing others, who are convincing others, etc. So by then, if you go "oh now it's a swing state so I'll vote Hillary" then it doesn't matter at that point.

You doubt New Jersey will EVER be a swing state? Texas was blue not that long ago. NJ was red 27 years ago. 
























 Just got back from a special screening that AMC did where they sent me two free tickets. First I will say that right before the movie began, I checked the ratings and saw it was at 54% on RT. Disappointing so my hopes were not high.

But that movie was amazing. The raw emotion that Jake showed was extremely intense the entire film. This was not a movie about boxing, it was a movie about an emotional journey of a man.

As the trailer spoils, Rachel McAdams dies. This happens pretty early in the film and the rest is a semi-poorly written script on his downward spiral and redemption. While I was not a fan of the writing, Rachel and Jake both shined bright.

If you've been watching the new True Detective season, you've seen a side of Rachel McAdams that she hasn't shown before. This is another. Rachel's character is an extremely realistic, semi-trashy girl who plays the part perfectly. When she shrugs when Jake looks at her in between rounds in the first match, it portrays a girl who grew up with Jake's character and does not love, but lives with his career out of necessity. She never celebrates the huge money but clearly enjoys it, nearly to a fault. The way she played the character was perfect for the background they gave.

As for Jake, it was a brilliant performance. The way he acted in Rachel's death scene was perfect. While the death itself was not particularly realistic, Rachel's reaction and the way Jake held her and talked to her was more realistic than I've ever seen in any movie. It showed the pure fear he had for losing someone he'd grown up with. It showed how much he depended on her. It made me shed a few tears.

Jake's character was played as a hyper-emotional, dumb kid, who grew up in the foster system. He nailed it at every turn. Meeting his new boxing trainer, perfect. Frustration with his comeback, perfect. Dealing with his daughter in uncharted territory, perfect. He truly got into this character's head and the dedication to his work was evident. He lived and breathed this character every second of the film.

This was a character that Jake had never played before. While I thought his worst performance was Source Code, where he didn't show much at all, he added another masterful performance to his collection here. Between Nightcrawler, Enemy, Prisoners, End of Watch, Zodiac, Jarhead, Brokeback Mountain, Bubble Boy, Donnie Darko, October Sky, and now Southpaw, Jake Gyllenhaal is truly one of the most versatile actors of our generation. It is truly a pleasure to see him perform- especially when we have actors who play basically the same character at every turn (Michael Cera, Liam Neeson, Kevin Hart, Melissa McCarthy, etc.).

My biggest gripe in the movie was probably that he literally was a southpaw fighter for one second of the entire film, and the lone reference to being a southpaw was of no significance whatsoever. But if you're not a big fight fan, you likely wouldn't notice that anyway.

If I could rate a movie just on the raw performance of the lead actor, I'd give it a 10/10. Unfortunately the writing was weak and some of the secondary characters were weak/underdeveloped (the random extra death, 50 Cent's performance and Forest Whitaker to an extent), so I'll give the movie an overall 6.5/10. 




 Like what? We can torture them if they commit a crime? 




 What about it? The article you responded with does not provide a national total. 




 The article you are referencing uses another article as its source. In that source article, it demonstrates this 40+ point lead in only Nevada and Colorado, specifically noting that Hillary's lead is not as big in either North Carolina or Florida. 




 This poll is for Nevada only, where Hispanics/Latinos make up 27% of the population. Source: http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/32000.html

Aka, this is near meaningless, unless you can think of some reason you should extrapolate the results nationwide. 




 Why in the world did you answer the door when the cop knocked? 




 I always hear tons of anecdotal evidence but I'll wait for a poll from your state before judging. 




 Please reconcile the differences. 




 So you're ok with killing those with low IQ, those in prison, and unwanted kids in general? 




 You should read up on the term "anchor babies." 




 To put it in perspective:

The closest states, by percentage vote, between Democrat and Republican, in the 2012 election:

North Carolina- R

Florida- D

Ohio- D

Virginia- D

These are the true "toss-up" states. Every other state was more than 5 percentage points apart.

To put this in perspective, the Democrat for 2016 can lose every single one of those states and still achieve the 270 votes necessary. So basically, Virginia is decently important, only if the Republicans make some headway on the more solidly Democratic states, including Colorado, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, or Iowa (and it just gets more unrealistic from there).
 




 Wait, so you're saying you're ok with killing unwanted people? 




 They can be punished appropriately now. There is nothing about how recent a decision came down that says that it need not be followed. As soon as it can be reasonably interpreted by the county, it needs to be followed. This, historically, means less than a week, which we are long past. 




 You have to look at not just the lawfulness of the situation but the reality of the situation.

The reality is, any clerk who denies marriage certificates to gay couples is likely in an area where they are surrounded by like minded people. This person will not get fired immediately because who will the person denied complain to? The clerk's boss, who may say too bad? The person denied will have to hire a lawyer and file an action against the county.

Contrast this with the reality of your Muslim clerk. What are you picturing? A Muslim who is surrounded by non-Muslims? In such a case, the woman would complain to the clerk's boss and the person would be quickly fired. However, if surrounded by like-minded Muslims, the exact same thing as the first scenario would play out.

Your premise is picturing two different situations. The bottom line is, if clerks are surrounded by like-minded people, it will likely take attorney action. If not surrounded by like-minded people, the boss will quickly correct the action. It really has nothing to do with being against gay marriage/Muslims, other than the fact that one is more prevalent in our country. 




 Just FYI, you guys are planning on committing a couple felonies including false imprisonment and possibly another by refusing him to seek help (impeding his ability to call 911, which he may try to do if he feels threatened).

 Medi-Cal is usually retroactive for a certain period, I believe 3 months. 




 You know I was going to say Executive Order, but the more I think I about it, the more that it's almost an entirely private issue.

Sure, the President could order that all government entities convert to metric, but private companies would still provide both conversions due to demand. I reckon it would take multiple decades for the private companies to switch over after the government. 




 There was an article the other day posted on /r/TrueReddit where there were 2 sets of identical twins accidentally switched at birth in a South American country. One family was middle class in the city and the other was rural poor. Very interesting article. 




 You would like Naked and Afraid.

It's usually a 2 person team and they each get to bring an item (usually choose firestarter and machete), and they have to survive for 21 days completely on their own.

They recently started a show of the best survivors, called Naked and Afraid XL, where it's for 40 days and consists of 4 teams of 3 each, and by the previews it looks like the groups find each other in later episodes. 




 Weeds was the only one. I loved that show and how they mixed up the opening song. 




 The question is: of the support she does receive, who gives more than 50%?

If she truly receives no support then give her a dollar and she can legally use your and her wife's tax returns instead. 




 The closest analogy I could make is PPV where the providers typical take a 50% cut. Not exactly the answer you were looking for, but just to give you an idea. 




 It's worth noting that the test is which parent provides more than 50% support to the child, not who the child lives with more than 50% of the time. Small, but notable difference. 




 That is fraud. It's a low likelihood but possible that the school could ask for verification. 




 Same! I've had this on my list for awhile and was very disappointed to see no theater release or any promotion whatsoever. 




 You can't. I was in this situation where my parents kicked me out of the house midway through my senior year in high school, and when I applied for financial aid, I couldn't because my parents would not let me see their tax return.

I applied for an independent override at my school but was denied because I didn't meet their very strict requirements- including physical abuse by a parent with corroborating police reports. In short, it's not gonna happen in your situation, given what you've described.

What I did was wait until the year I turned 23, when you get automatic independent status.

What your kid can do is community college in the meantime that does not require loans. 




 I'm unsure why guillotine is never mentioned. Assuming it's properly sharpened, that's about as quick and painless as you can get. 




 First, yes there is spyware for iPhones. Second, nobody needs confirmation to know you look at porn. By virtue of you being a teenage male with Internet access, I know you look at porn. 




 Is your username because God created Man? 




 Completely agree that one innocent death is too many.

I believe it should only be used in specific cases of absolute certainty. 




 High quality video, hundreds of witnesses, and DNA evidence. Think Columbine. How is certainty of guilt invalid? 




 Fully expected Omar 




 Oh wow I'm not in /r/mma 




 I hate the radio commercials I hear 5 times a day about how we need to scream louder, cheer harder, blah blah blah.

It's like a girlfriend threatening to leave unless you buy her stuff and your friend going "oh dude you better do everything you can to get her to stay." Screw that, if you're gonna threaten to leave unless I do something then I'd rather be single. What poor ownership of the team. 




 Was the dog found in the University Heights area? 




 I'll let an actual lawyer specializing in landlord-tenant law answer but to me, as a law student working in an office that deals with mostly property law, all charges look legitimate to me.

Definitely request an itemized invoice and copies of receipts for work performed, but I doubt the fact that he was maybe a day late or didn't provide those before you requested them would give you the right to not be responsible for any portion of the damages. 




 Besides Barao, at HW, Noguiera unsuccessfully defended his interim belt against Mir when he could have fought the actual title holder (Couture), who lost to Brock, who fought Mir at UFC 100 to unify the titles. 









 Yea I'm not sure how that would play into it. I just remember that I had a friend who lost one parent and his surviving parent received a good chunk of change until he was 18. Let alone 3 kids with both parents dying. 




 It's not after the victim speaks up, it's after they turn 18. So if the statute of limitations is 7 years and the abuse ends when the kid is 12 then he/she has 15 years to have charges filed by the DA. 




 Have you looked into getting social security benefits for the kids since their parents died?

Children are usually entitled to such benefits until 18. 




 Other people gave you advice on the bill, but for the insurance I can tell you if you need to go on Medicaid or the exchange if you tell me your annual income. 




 Maybe he is just never around mirrors. Maybe he's a vampire and doesn't want to be known. Someone put a mirror in front of him next time they meet him. 




 Was BJ at the airport too?


I'm kidding, that's actually pretty cool. What did he say about the fight? 




 So let's say you, as a gay man, is on a road trip. You try to buy gas at the town you stop in because you're near empty. The gas station, and every other, refuses to serve you.

Ok so you call up a tow truck to get your car towed to the next town. That person, and every other tow truck service in town refuse to serve you.

So you're getting hungry, but every single restaurant/grocery store refuses to serve you.

Well you'll just go sleep somewhere and figure it out tomorrow. But the only hotel in town refuses to serve you.

This is a world you want to live in? 




 HIPAA 




 Whooooo! Bought time. 




 Yea, I keep refreshing thinking I'm missing it, but it still says standby. 




 I mean I totally see where you're coming from. I thought both were extremely close. 




 Look at the strike differential for Rory in the 1st. Also, the 4th was Rory's pretty solidly in the beginning and Lawler didn't hit back as hard in the later parts of the round.

I'm not saying it was clear cut, but I think both Rory edges both rounds. 




 I'm sorry, I forgot the rules since I never post threads. I just deleted it but it's still showing. 




 Ah I see. Those threads get too hard to read for me unless you sort by New, but then it screws up the rest of reddit until you change it back. 




 So do they put Conor/Aldo on 190 in 3 weeks or 191 in 8 weeks?

I think they could make 190, but barely. On the other hand, do Aldo and Conor really want to go through all that press again for 8 more weeks? I guess Dana will tell us in the post fight press conference. 




 Who the hell thinks that was early? Chad was done, and that coming from someone who hates Conor. 




 Conor's cardio is unreal. Like how did he take that wrestling for 2 rounds, with punches peppered in there, then stand up with cardio looking like he just started the fight? Especially with that weight cut.

It was the cardio that won Conor the fight, hands down. All bets are off for favoring Aldo now, and I'm a Conor hater and huge fan of Aldo. 




 IM BETTING GOLD FOR A YEAR. I GOT MENDES. PUT UP OR SHUT UP MCGREGOR FANS.

Edit: I admit. I was wrong. Glad nobody was confident enough to bet it. 









 Do you have any proof of this deal? Emails? Texts? Witnesses? 




 Do you have a contract? 




 I'm not sure if they do at Hooters, but they definitely show the prelims at Buffalo Wild Wings. 




 I actually caught a card there and met some pretty cool guys so good suggestion. 




 I moved here about a year ago and have been super busy with school so I haven't made many friends, let alone ones who watch MMA.

I usually drag my girlfriend to watch the big cards at Buffalo Wild Wings, but she has a big test coming up and won't go and I don't want to sit at home by myself and watch a card this big.

So anyone nearby?!

Bonus points if you realize Mendes is gonna wrestlefuck McGregor so I don't have to argue with you the whole time. 




 Girls. 




 I mean almost every champ is top 10 p4p... 




 No, I don't want to try to remember a bet for over a year. Propose this to me next year in October and I'll take it. 




 You can't just use your grandparents for no reason. If OP's cousin lives with her parents then her parents must file taxes for The cousin to use FAFSA. 




 50% 




 Not OP, but I think Hillary takes the exact same electoral votes and a more dominant percentage, around 54%.

The main difference will show in Florida where Hillary will win more seniors than Obama did. 




 I see a bunch of answers that do not QUITE answer what I perceive your question, OP.

So here's what would happen, despite how unlikely. First, as others have said the amendment cannot be unconstitutional by definition if it passes. But let's say it passed and SCOTUS said it WAS unconstitutional. Well then according to them, the amendment is invalid. However, it seems likely that the Executive branch would be unlikely to enforce such a decision because of the overwhelming support.

It really comes down to the fact that each govt entity only has as much power as its people bestow upon it. 




 More like:

You: "Hey what's your name again?"

Him: "You don't know my name?"

You: "No, uh, I meant your last name."

Him: "Oh. It's Smith."

You: "Ok, uh, bro, Mr. Smith..." 




 Obviously I was referring to the fact that they do not enforce by not arresting along their set guidelines while reserving the right to arrest and prosecute where they please.

Now if you will answer my question instead of going around it, WHAT IF the federal govt refuses to enforce any law? 




 The rule I've heard from advisors is that LSAT counts for 50% of your app, GPA is 49% and everything else, including school difficulty, work experience and extracurriculars are 1%. 




 Ok but your argument has one problem. The executive branch HAS stopped enforcing federal law on marijuana. How have they achieved that in your view?

Now, since the executive branch is tasked with enforcing the legislative branch and judicial branch's laws, what do you suppose happens if they refuse, as they are doing on the subject of marijuana? 




 Nothing. The President could order any part of the govt to stop enforcing any law. As a society, we give legitimacy to the govt by accepting its role. If we recognize the role of the executive branch as enforcers with the power to stop enforcing laws as they see fit, then that is a legitimate political end. 




 Just visit the Army/Navy/Airforce/Marines/Coast Guard website and I'm sure there will be a button for a recruiter to contact you. 




 I never said they created the law. My contention is that their decisions are interpretations of the law and that majority opinions are the supreme law of the land. 




 Ultimate lawyer answer. I love it. 




 You'd have to ask the founders of our country. My guess would be judicial economy. 




 I reject your premise. My contention is that SCOTUS is allowed to do anything, yes, even an infringement on the rights of others.

SCOTUS decisions ARE the law and therefore everything they write in majority opinions are their lawful interpretation of the Constitution. So you cannot say they can make any decision that is unlawful. Again, I cite to Marbury v. Madison for this contention. 




 Not according to my argument. If you tell me why it's flawed, I'll respond accordingly. 




 Lol. I'm aware how the decisions are made. I was merely saying that they could have been made on any day of the past weeks or next week and it was definitely on purpose that Kennedy released his third opinion on the matter on the anniversary. 









 YES! If a majority opinion of the Supreme Court says something is so, then legally it is the supreme law of the land. That's how our country works! See Marbury v. Madison for context of this phenomenon.

Also I'm fine removing the word "implied" because it does not LIMIT the text of the 10th Amendment, whereas your adding of the word explicitly does limit the text. I'll cite to the Necessary and Proper Clause to show that our Constitution grants implied powers. 




 So you would be denying someone the right to marry based on their gender? Eve can marry Adam, but Steve cannot marry Adam, and thus Steve would be denied the same rights as Eve, based on his gender. Thus, since gender discrimination should not be allowed, same sex marriage should be allowed. 




 What about before the Loving decision? The previous 100 years or so had said that interracial couples did not have the right to marriage. So you can see why basing your argument merely on the fact that most of our history was against it is flawed. Unless you are also contending that interracial marriage should be not allowed? 




 I believe the language was appropriate in light of the decision bring a landmark in American history. It wasn't the first to use cute language and certainly won't be the last.

And to be honest, that type of language does not matter at all. When we study cases in class, they only leave the relevant parts and cut out 90% of the text that reiterates or is useless in changing the previous status quo. Only a very small portion of future lawyers and legislators in America will even read the flowery portions of the opinion. Not to mention how salty his dissent was. Why is he allowed to use unprofessional language and not the majority? 




 You are factually incorrect. To quote the text of the 10th Amendment: "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."

It says nothing about the powers not EXPLICITLY granted to the federal govt being reserved for the states. Therefore, any implied powers are also reserved for the federal govt. Since the power to regulate marriage on the basis of sex has been implied by the majority opinion today, it is therefore deemed to have been one of the powers of the federal govt since the 14th Amendment passed, on which the decision is based. 




 I've read the opinion and it only mentions that states are required to grant marriages and recognize them. It explicitly leaves out territories, and unlike the recent healthcare decision, it seems that there is no intent to include anything beyond the text.

However, I am only a law student and unfamiliar if SCOTUS decisions normally apply to the states and territories. 




 It is implied, as are numerous other rights. The Right to Privacy is also not explicitly stated in the Constitution. Would you argue that citizens do not have the Right to Privacy? 




 I agree and would contend that this is a fundamental right that has been wrongfully denied to same sex couples from the passage of the 14th to 2003. 




 For the record I'm in law school now and actually right in the middle of taking my Constitutional Law course this Summer.

I think it's very fair to summarize as 14th v. 10th. The hard part about the justices wrapping their heads around saying that gay marriage is legal is that they are not granting new rights but merely interpreting the Constitution as saying that these rights were granted when the 14th Amendment was passed and are merely being recognized now.

I just finished reading the majority and the dissents and in one of the dissents, I think it was Scalia's, the author says that by interpreting the 14th Amendment as granting the rights of gay marriage, the majority is contending that they see something that every past SCOTUS justice has missed in the past and how insulting it is to those past great justices. The author then goes on to list these great justices and how by finding that this right exists, every state from the passage of the 14th to 2003, a total of 135 years has been missing this right.

This is a somewhat disingenuous argument as justices can only judge the cases in front of them, and I am not aware of any cases regarding the rights of same sex couples to marry until very recently. And so, these justices have not missed this interpretation as it was never presented to them. The states however, have missed this interpretation. At that comes in the 10th Amendment. Since it is generally understood that states regulate marriage, it seemed natural that they would determine who could participate in such institution. However, they did not anticipate that this interpretation would be an infringement of civil rights.

Therefore, I believe you are correct in saying that because the states believe they have the rights to regulate marriage from the 10th Amendment, but SCOTUS has stepped in and said that when there is an infringement of civil rights, the 14th rules. And by the fact the federal law overrules state law, it is lawful for SCOTUS to interpret the Constitution to bestow these rights of marriage upon all citizens. 




 I definitely think this was done on purpose. It could have been issued yesterday or Monday with other opinions. 




 I read an article talking about how this still happens in the US, usually exactly how you described it- rich families in rural areas having foreigners be literal slaves.

 Maybe look up the closest campground. They're usually cheap and all you need is a tent. 




 I don't really agree with that since he was one minute away from winning 2/3 hardest fights (Anderson 1 and Jones) and he dominated the first round of the other one (Anderson 2). 




 I'm actually buying this. 




 A third place win? 




 Foakes v. Beer!!!! Law school has finally paid off! 




 You're convincing the wrong person. The average person will see over and over that Bernie is a self-described socialist and that will be it. 




 I see this all the time on reddit, but I truly do not believe he is electable in the general. I have not seen any polls of Sanders vs Republican candidates so I base this instead on statistical evidence showing that 50% of Americans refuse to elect a Socialist (http://www.gallup.com/poll/183713/socialist-presidential-candidates-least-appealing.aspx).

Now I love Sanders' viewpoints and think he'd make a great president. But he openly says he is a socialist, and looking at the evidence shows America is not ready for a socialist president.

Therefore, I say that if I voted for Sanders in the primary, and others do as well, he may win, and therefore likely lose the general election. Thus, I will vote for Clinton because that is the avenue most likely to not have a Republican president. I look at the lesser of evils. While I am not so fond of Clinton, I view a potential Republican president as far worse. 




 Fair enough. 




 To be honest, I only read about it in here. I have no idea if it exists either. I was basing my statements on the assumption that it does exist. 




 Whatever. I vote for whichever candidate I feel will do the least harm. 




 At least 30-40%. There are many many people who have no idea that he even exists. 




 I based my statement purely on statistical evidence from polls indicating that those who know both Clinton and Sanders favor Sanders. While it is possible this will not extrapolate to the population as a whole, I believe Sanders' positions are more favorable to the average American and thus that if he had the same recognition as Clinton he would win.
