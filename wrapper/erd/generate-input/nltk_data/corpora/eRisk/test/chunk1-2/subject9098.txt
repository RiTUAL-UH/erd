 We just have the anatomy of raptors in our heads from what we suspected them to look like millions of years ago.  Over that time I'm sure they have been able to evolve enough to put their long claws up to their mouths in order to think. 




 Like a whole bag of dicks! 




 And after too many uses you had to find just the right sweet spot on the switch to make the RCA input work through it. 




 That's because it's still the best multiplayer system to date! 




 I usually try to use a self checkout anymore so i can cram as much into as few bags as possible.  But you're saying that by putting my items together like this when going to a person would avoid the bagger person from using 13 bags for 15 items? 




 Oddly I agree with you here.  When I was in college and used a computer lab, cleaning the roller was one of the things I usually did. 




 The Big Lebowski is a good one to do this to considering how many times you have to watch it to get everything. 




 I don't think the success kid would hit the wrong link in the first place. 




 Goddammit!!  I lost! 




 Heck, everyone knows you can drive 5 mph above the speed limit and still not get pulled over. 




 I absolutely hate it when someone stands there and holds the door when you're 50 feet away yet.  It makes you feel like you should go faster since they are holding the door, but at the same time it pisses you off because you can't walk at your normal lazy pace! 




 You'll read anything on the cue cards.  And I mean anything! 




 If we were living 100 years in the past, then we wouldn't be able to read shit like this on the internet! 




 I'd say it's worth the risk of jail if it's already been censored for everyone. 




 So is the guy on the left his translator then? (I'm aware it's not Jackie Chan, so that answer is not necessary) 




 It definitely beats drinking at the bar the entire night.  Especially when you're going to be with the same group of people regardless where you drink. 




 I wonder how many facebook friends God has? 




 Bi-force? 




 You are very strong willed if you can wait until Christmas for all 3 of those games! 




 Is the guy in the bottom left supposed to be Canadian? 




 Team America!  Fuck Yeah!! 




 That would be fun to randonly run up to a mime like that and act like you ran into something.  Probably would catch him a bit off guard. 




 It looks like a shoe according to Family Guy. 









 I hear ebay calling for this little gem! 




 This is so true!  And then you don't even have to clean the dishes when you're finished! 




 I think concept 2 looks the best. 




 Wait, Gamestop was allowed to sell another game aside from MW3 during the launch? 




 Better learn some Austin Powers driving moves in order to get out of that situation! 




 And once one light goes out, they ALL go out!! 




 When my parents buit their house (in 1992) the entryway closet is where he put the switch for the outside outlets.  Although, they still take the lights down each year. 




 Yes, I'd say I agree that the method "works" better when working on inanimate objects. 




 He must not be very big.  Her mouth isn't open very wide. 




 So cussing up a storm to try to get something fixed doesn't work?  I never would have thought that. 




 Totally agree with this.  I've given up on even thinking that I'll actually do something in the morning before work. 




 With the lighting it sorta makes it look like a cult waiting for the time of ascension. 




 So the princess is in another castle then? 




 Some day I will have my own DK Arcade machine! 




 I'd say definitely good job for a last minute costume! 




 I like how the Rep says they have a rule saying they do not do refunds on downloaded games.  Then immediately following that statement says they will refund you with credit and remove the downloaded game from your account. 




 But it's always better on the original system compared to a ROM! 




 But it's worth it when you kill someone in a shooting battle with your last bullet that you just loaded into the gun! 




 Sorry, I meant it was after the system first launched, as in the first 6 months to a year.  Not just the actual launch titles on the first day.  Later in its life the prices decreased overall though. 




 I recall most 3rd party games being $70 when the system launched and 1st party games being $60.  May have been a few that I saw that were $80 though.  And later in the systems life these went down to $60 and $50 for the most part. 




 Good costumes.  Although you're missing the best driver....Donkey Kong! 




 Couldn't they have at least made the game a color version? 




 Hmm, so that explains why people have to wait so long to get actual assistance for Battlefield 3 problems. 




 It must come with free controller converter cables that aren't visible in the picture. 




 Oh, I see what you did there! 




 Same here.  Someone wanted me to join so i did just to check it out.  What am I supposed to do, write the same exact stuff that I put on facebook for the same people to read? 




 Looks like they just wanted to use you as a test dummy to see what would happen beyond the corner. 




 I can't stand it when people do that either, even when they aren't my games.  I'm glad I trained my younger brothers years ago that games need to be put back in cases and regardless how mad you get, you shouldn't throw a controller on the ground.  Or else you may face a week of not being able to play.  Now a days the game collection is in great shape and everything still works like new! 




 Is your wife's name Sheryl by any chance? 




 Holy balls, that is sweet! 




 Looks pretty interesting.  A slightly different take on a game that actually might require some thinking. 




 That is 2 1/2 minutes of my life gone.  But I'd say it was worth it. 




 More like a double crime since you technically took 2 great games down! 




 When he said 64, he may have been referring to a Commodore 64.  Either way....fail! 




 Must be a pretty exciting game if they don't even want to use the chairs right behind them! 




 Hmm, I must say that after almost 2 decades of playing the game I never noticed a difference in speed with the coins.  Of course I always use DK Jr when I play, which would be a faster top speed than most of the others to begin with.  I might have to do some testing to see if there is a noticable difference with coins now. 




 Sorry, only TWO people can have the same joke.  You're the third unfortunately. 




 That seems like the most logical way to go about this. 




 You just made me lose The Game!
http://www.losethegame.com 




 You got me.  I guess you get your free punch on my arm. 




 Don't forget to wash your hands!  You wouldn't want those shit particles accidentally being posted onto reddit! 




 On the older versions of the game the blue shell goes after the person in first at the time it's fired.  On the Wii version it changes targets to who is in first when it gets up to the front of everyone. 




 I don't think the coins made you go faster if you had more.  The point of the coins was so when you got hit by another kart you didn't spin out.  Each hit would make you lose a coin and when you were out and got hit by another kart you would spin out. 
























 Looks like you forgot to list Steam in the pic. 














 Vendor: Can I help you sir?
Me: Yes, I'll take a Big Dick and a Fuck Cunt please.
Vendor: That'll be $2 please.
Me (thinking in mind): Why haven't I come here before for this stuff? 









 My brothers and I still play Wrestlemania 2000 over No Mercy.  For some reason that game just stuck with us better. 




 Looks, good, but I think it would be better if she would have dressed up as Samus! 




 I was looking for Leo walking in the background. 




 The Cubs actually win the world series in BTTF.  That's who you need to bet on in 2015. 














 So um, how did it taste when it was ready? 









 The best I've ever found that was thrown out was a PS3 controller.  It needed taken apart and cleaned up, but it works just fine! 




 Good lord it's the loch ness monster!! 




 I was thinking the same thing in regards to people saying it's a relatives first meme. 



















 Haha, good one! 









 I always hope for this to happen when I get a friend request out of nowhere.  Never does though. 









 So apparently black clothes was the choice for the picture.  Looks like Will didn't get the memo. 




 And that means a lot more coming at the end of the year as opposed to the beginning. 




 At least the comic doesn't tell them about the arrow to the knee.  That could ruin the entire game for someone! 









 She could probably get the abortion at Costco. 



















 Doc, I think we've hit 88 mph! 




 But since this is random just for the sole fact that Ellemeno pointed out that is should be random, does that make this random pic relevant? 




 That's a start! 









 I agree on overhand on being the correct way too.  But it can vary per person. 









 And here all these years I thought you were supposed to bend backwards when playing limbo. 




 Holy crap, I had to do a double take with the picture.  My parents have a setup almost identicle to this one.  Except, they actually did put up a christmas tree in a different spot. 



















 That selection looks about right. 




 Why would you stop in the first place if it's only going to make you mad that you have to wait on a person crossing the road?  And it was your own choice. 




 When I was in college cars would stop on a regular basis and they were the LAST car going by.  Doing this only made things take longer for me walking and the driver. 




 I lost mine about a year ago.  GGG kept the cash for himself as a reward, but was kind enough to return everything else at least. 




 Oh, I get it. [Filmsy](http://www.filmsy.com/) 




 And then goes to the bar! 




 You could hang out a lot in freshly stacked haystacks with people who need hay... 




 Although I have never seen or read any of the Harry Potter's, I still find this pretty amusing. 




 SIMPSONS DID IT....er wait, different episode. 




 I see what a person is doing when paying a homeless person like this.  But lets say someone paid a homeless person $5 just to do this.  To justify that money you would have to be gone for more than $5 worth of parking in that spot. 




 A ticket pulls in more money than an extra $.50 in a parking meter is probably the main reason. 




 Since a little over 10 years have passed already , you actually only have just a hair over 12 years left to wait.  That time will fly by! 




 Ah, I guess I missed the really small one above the plate before.  I'd say it's small anough it shouldn't count anyhow. 




 Watching 6 movies with only 5 screens.  Wizardry? 




 They're going to get neck cramps looking up like that the whole time. 




 So why is he questioning his answer yes? 




 Makes me think of Wrestlemania 2000 on the N64. The game came out in 1999, but it lets you input dates for when you win a belt back to something like 1955.

 




 6 months?  So did Easter get moved back, or Christmas moved up? 




 I believe the blu ray release that is coming out next year for the 30th anniversary is putting the guns back in again. 




 So no one washes their face with soap?  Because when you do that you're also cleaning your eyebrows in the process.  Unless I've been fooling myself this whole time. 




 So where do I place my order? 




 My plan was to buy the book from the store and use it until the last day for full refunds.  Then order the book through the library and use that copy for free the rest of the quarter. 




 Problem 4 on page 87 has been changed.  Because of that, wecan't use the previous version anymore. 




 I kind of feel like I have a connection with each of you just because I work at Ohio State!! 




 She must be an avid Portal player! 


































 [FALSE!](http://qkme.me/3p6rjm) 




 Wha...what's the point of taking all the time to make this when you're just going to eat it a few hours later? 














 Only 303 views of the video as of me writing this, but 555 comments on here?  So apparently only a few people on reddit even watch the video before commenting on it? 




 "How does a human notice that" - Wouldn't it seem more natural to say person instead of human?  Or is the comment from some alien race? 




 There was a time lapse video on yahoo this past week showing the entire progress of the tower.  It was pretty cool to watch. 














 Should have used obtuse instead of stupid. 




 It's a rug, not carpet. 




 Purchase bullets for each shot made in game. 




 My co workers are this way.  It's impossible to get a sentence in as a response. 









 I was referencing one on the advice animals front page using cats that I know has been used before.  As I'm sure mine has been used before too. 









 My brothers and I wonder what we're going to do with our title belts after 2049 for Wrestlemania.  That's as far as the pre programmed dates go. 




 And Miners Cave for me! 









 So who else looked real close to find the one country that said something other than "people"? 









 So you are showing her that prayer actually does work? 




 I loved the original game, but unfortunately never played through it all.  The time and amount of load screens was unbearable.  I would love a remake it that was taken care of! 




 But why did you each make a full sandwich on your own and then put it on the earth?  You should have each just used 1 piece of bread with toppings on one side and put that on the ground.

 a brief history of [Playstation controllers](http://imgur.com/1GHkf). 




 I was always aware that running at an angle was faster, but how do you know the speed difference as being 1.41? 




 I beat him this way as well since I didn't know about the controller port change. 




 One could only hope that is what his activities involve. 









 Good luck making that cash.  That comes out to 62.5 smudges you'd have to average per minute.  so roughly one per second. 




 Sorry, I don't watch the show myself, so I'm not sure what websites might have it posted for you to watch. 




 Now if you use this at work, is there a way it can block your internet browsing activity from the company too? 




 New episode this coming Wednesday after the new South Park actually. 









 Looks like OP spelled Taco Bell wrong. 




 Had the same thing when I was younger.  Now I've got the dvd in place of it. 




 I know it's no building, but an [elevator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_elevator) is a start. 




 Repost, of course. 




 I have never worked at a small local pizza place, but I agree with you.  I grew up in NW Ohio where all the towns were small (~1,200 people) and the price of pizza is around what you are saying. 




 So was OP sitting in a shopping cart also when taking the bottom picture? 









 He doesn't look very happy.  Must have to go to work for the day. 




 Why did that show ever have to end? 




 TMNT - Turtles in Time 




 Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo 




 Donkey Kong Country Returns 




 Did you say [2-ply toilet paper](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EE01Sbb8CU)?  It's at the very end, just wait for it. 




 True, the opening sequence would show it before each episode, but we were thinking in the actual show. 




 My brother and I were wathcing an episodes of King of the Hill last night and he brought up the fact that he couldn't think of a single episode where there wasn't at least one alcoholic beverage (usually beers in the alley) drank.  He's more of a fan than I am of the show, but I was trying to think of one as well and could come up with an episode.  Anyone know if there is a way to verify something like this? 




 Mario Kart 64 









 Just start clicking and eventually you find your way to safety at the end and everything is finally explained about what happened. 














 If Midway's building was on fire, this would make sense to all of us. 









 Read this on my phone and kept rotating it to read easier. The damn meme kept rotating with the screen and I couldn't win! 














 Exact same thing I was thinking. 




 Michigan....sorry to hear that. 




 You mean the long long ago. 




 Everyone has to start at the bottom! 





























 Yeah, the difference in controllers were because of different [regions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamepad#Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System.2FSuper_Famicom) 




 Actually, it's "R" and "ZR", not "Z1".  But still no R1 either. 




 With the strength of 5 gorillas! 




 No it isn't, but Miracle Whip is.  Next question. 




 If it was a Buffalo Wilds Wings commercial then they forgot to make the game go into overtime. 




 All that technology, but they can't put arm rests on the seats? 




 The only flaw in your argument is that the top and bottom of the stall are open to release the gasses you speak of.  Therefore, the crack is not necessary. 




 So who else wanted to click on the OK button? 




 So why did the Wii's price inflate by $35 since launch, but the PS3 deflated by $30 when they were lanched 2 days apart from each other? 




 Ohio State does that. 




 That's why Harry and Lloyd drove across the country in Dumb and Dumber.  Much cheaper. 




 I like to think of Jesus as little baby Jesus. 




 At first I thought it was just a fat co worker going to get some food.  Then I later learned of the real danger I was actually in. 




 And I got mad when my brothers messed up a box that the N64 game was kept in. 




 There could be anything in the mystery box.  It could even be a boat!  You know how much we've wanted one of those! 




 The Big Lebowski, actually twice.  Dude - "I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off."  And again the Dude - "I mean we totally fucked it up, man.  We fucked up his pay-off.  And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything.  Huh?

 









 Thanks, I'll try there! 














 Oh sure George Costanza, always leave on a high note! 




 Would you like some gum to make you feel better? 




 I have the copier room to duck off to in my office.  If people are in there I just act like I'm looking for something that printed, then seemed baffled when my paper didn't print for some reason. 




 I loved Burn After Reading.  But several of my friends watched it and just said it was dumb and won't give it another watch through.  Because I think this is a movie that needs to be seen more than once in order to get everything. 




 I love this movie too!  Even my brother who doesn't care for Star Wars gave it a watch and he enjoyed it too. 









 Wait a second.  How did you take a picture of the chair full of clothes if you are asleep? 




 I am guessing he just painted those games.  But I don't think he said for sure. 




 In the original post he states that they are actually all old sports games and they printed off labels of the games you see.  Otherwise this would be tragic to waste that many copies of a good game. 




 I always thought loading bars were to let you know how much time you had to drink until the game was ready to play? 




 I think guys standards go down with age.  This therefore makes the attractive girls looks that much better in perspective. 




 I think so.  Maybe someone should combine the two movies and see what happens with no sight or hearing. 




 Some others I can think of would be:
Clerks 1 and 2,
BASEketball,
Ghostbusters,
Tremors (only the first one),
Big Lebowski,
See no Evil, Hear no Evil,
UHF,
American History X 




 This works until they are digging through dumpsters for bottles and half the trash ends up outside of the dumpster by the time they are done. 




 So you've seen the movie even though it hasn't been released yet?  How is this possible? 




 I hate to say it, but I kinda agree with you. 




 Nope, not Brandon. So you can cross that name off your list of possibilities. 









 This is how I imagine it would be for me to try to get a decent picture of something while on the road. 




 I was just kidding when i worded it that way. 




 I'm not sure I can justify $4,000 just for karma on here. 









 A little anti-aliasing would help out his tie. 









 Am I the only person who actually kept my games in the boxes they came in? 









 Did he finally get arrested by the cop and is now sitting in jail? 




 I'd say it's a springboard from Portal 2. 




 Ha, thanks for the approval! 









 The question is, does he do this every morning too? 














 Is [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestar_Runner_Characters#The_Poopsmith) who you're talking about? 




 I'd say more like overly attached wife in 25 years. 




 I think it's the fact that as you grow up you actually expand your horizons. 




 That would seem like a simple choice.  The PS2 will play any PS1 games for you.  So why not save $10. 




 Well, you didn't want to leave a surface uncovered in case that was the one area you needed to place a portal. 









 Hope you brought an umbrella.  Otherwise the rain will get you all wet when you get out of the lake. 




 My name is Voit, dumbass. 




 Tommy Pickles?  Oh wait, wrong show. 




 And with the small trophy presentation have the Karate Kid music "You're the BEST aroooouuuund" playing! 




 I'm not sure if you spelled BLEEEUUUUUGHRRGHUUUUGUUHBL  correctly. 




 My dad is the janitor at my local high school.  For some reason he seems to be the favorite employee for almost all of the students.  He usually dones't say much and almost never smiles at people.  I ask others what makes my dad so likable, but they don't really have an answer.  But whatever it is, it seems to be working. 




 And so would your little sister. 




 Really? 





























 I honestly don't know why people say this was so tough.  Maybe it's because I grew up playing the old DK and DK Jr games.  Although it was mostly on the NES. 




 Bond sure has changed a lot since Daniel Craig. 




 Lesbian seagull 




 Am I too late to have a comment that hasn't been taken and will be recognized? 









 Agreed.  Weekends are OK though since there is no work. 









 Although Back to the Future would be a good direction to point them.  I think in this case the South Park episode where Cartman freezes himself for a Wii would help explain things better. 









 Thanks.  We weren't looking to sell them.  Just curious if they did have any value but we couldn't find anything online since the box was blank. 




 My dad got these out over Christmas while the family was home.  The figures are each about 1.5" tall.  It has 2 figures of JFK at the end of it.  The box isn't in the best of shape, but there isn't any information on it to even try to look up. 









 I took these numbers as total profit made since Nintendo got into the video game scene.  Same with the Sony and Microsoft numbers. 




 Hmm, that could make it interesting for me to try watching it then. 














 Me and a friend were sitting in our living room watching tv.  We realized that there were 2 shows on later at the same time that we wanted to watch.  My friend calls my roommate (who is upstairs) to ask him to set his VCR (yes, before dvr was the norm) to record one of the shows instead of one of us walking up the stairs to tell him. 




 Big Lebowski, Toy Story, Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, Jurassic Park 




 Not sure if I'm missing something, but why is the gold N64 only $149, but the standard one is $199?  Am I looking at something wrong? 









 That was my standard day trying to study when I was in college.  Be at the library reading for about half an hour, take about an hour nap at the table, then study for about another half hour before finally going home. 




 At least you lived long enough to post the picture. 




 Wrestlemania 2000 is the one that gets played to this day with me and my brothers.  Although we do have No Mercy as well. 




 So what does owning a construction company have to do with this? 




 The 2 digit number on the bottom of an anheuser busch can lets you know what time of day it was produced.  Every 15 minutes is an extra digit for the number.  Example: 2:00 am = 08 









 He was way ahead of his time. 




 I have jumped in the lake for the past 10 years, and it has only snowed once during that entire time.  So it seems pretty rare when it does snow. 









 It all depends on who sees it first in r/new if you ask me. 




 Guitar Hero was on 2 games ahead of Rock Band because the first game came out 2 years ahead of the first Rock Band.  Not because they came out with multiple full fledged sequels that often.  But you are correct with the spinoffs that Guitar Hero put out in a short period of time. 




 It's been a while since I've played this, but I thought it was off by one.  So to get the star, you'd actually press the button when the mushroom before the star was in the center of the screen.  and all three rows worked the same way. 




 Are there only 5 levels to the DK Arcade game?  Or are you just throwing a number out there?  Because I have not been able to get through the arcade game myself. 




 And I still read it the correct way on here too. 




 As a bonus, Tom Hanks is still listed as being in the movie! 




 I'm probably one of the few people that actually played through the entire game. 




 True 




 Can't say I'm beta spaghetti pants.  So it looks like the bill would be split 3 ways. 









 Although they are delicious, I'd say that sour patch kids are one step better. 









 And for those who want the [sound effects](http://nooooooooooooooo.com/) with it. 









 I really wanted to see Richard Duncan out there debating! 









 So this is like the Cleveland Show?  Except instead of the bear living next door, it lives with them? 




 TBDBITL! 




 The summers were great for me back in those times.  My dad is the custodian at my school and during the summers he could take a computer home with him and a copy of each of the games.  That way the computers did sit around dormant for 3 months straight. Hours upon hours of Number Munchers, Miners Cave, Odele Lake, etc. 




 So why are you digging through your neighbors trash to begin with? 




 The black one with the big X on it is what I'm referring to.  That would be Xbox. 




 [This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Call) is what I was thinking of.  But I really doubt it's referring to the same thing as the article on here. 




 Why does the Xbox controller look so pissed to be with all the others? 




 I think it's sending the signal to space to hopefully contact [aliens](http://qkme.me/3raohs) 




 I'll have to take some time to look through these to help get ideas for this year. 




 But why is he in timeout and sitting in the corner? 




 Woops, I guess I didn't even look at it.  I was looking through posts regarding Ohio State doing a video game themed show from this past weekend and just assumed it was that same show.  My bad. 




 Yeah, Ohio State does do a different half time show every week.  It surprises me how they can learn that stuff so quickly.  3 weeks ago they did one honoring NASA and Neil Armstrong which was pretty neat too. 




 From what I read a few months back, I believe they are going to remain their own country and won't be considered part of Fuji. 




 I think tv executives have already taken care of this question. 




 I went to a public school and had 61 kids in my class.  A neighboring town has around 35 for an average class size. 




 So piss comes out of the faucet? 




 Will Smith and Matthew McConaughey?  How did they get on here? 




 [Stunt Cycle](http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=1280 st=2) is what I had.  And I actually still have it in working condition to this day. 




 I just assumed it was another day when they were there, and not immediately after all the destruction. 




 I was a little afraid to click on it when i read "chat roulette" in the title. 




 Amen to that! 
























 So why do these people "like" Xbox on facebook if they're just going to do this? 




 I answer my phone with Ahoy-hoy, just like Mr. Burns. 




 In regards to physical media, how do I lose my games if my Wii U quits working on me?  I can still just buy a new system, just like I would have to do with the PS4 or Xbox1, and play all the games I previously purchased. 




 Can't say I've ever seen Father of the Bride.  But here's [Animaniacs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy6_b0qhjpg) episode it's also in. 




 Hell yeah, Animainiacs reference!! 




 Makes you feel like you're defusing a bomb with all those colored ends. 




 I'm pretty sure it was asking what the worst game you've ever played was.  Otherwise you're just going off of what other people have said. 




 I have mostly stuck with just watching the Star Wars movies. But my friend said his 10 year old daughter asked this question about characters names in the Clone Wars. I tried doing some searching myself but can't seem to find anything. 









 Hey, I actually beat someone this weekend then with my 105! 




 All 5 of those guys are above 20 on ESPN so it has to be a different site. 




 I'm still surprised that Benny Parsons and Red Byron haven't been inducted yet! 




 I honestly think 5 per year is too many.  In 10 years the requirements to be on the ballot are going to be pretty low if you ask me.  Nascar doesn't have large teams like other sports do which gives them more options to pick from each year. 




 I'm still surprised Benny Parsons hasn't been inducted yet! 




 Two of my favorites are "Hold on" by Korn and "Lose Yourself" by Eminem.  I tend to prefer more upbeat paced songs for my entire runs too. 




 I've been there several times and as long as you're about 20 rows up or more you can see the entire track fine pretty much anywhere.  From there it's basically what part of the track you would prefer to sit near for the different action. 




 So are you trying to deplete all your funds within the first few races?  Haha 




 I don't see Gordon doing a part time schedule along the lines of Mark Martin.  If anything I think he would be in just a handful of races a year if he did go the part time route. 




 I had that about 2 years ago with a group of kids about 10 years old.  I thought to myself, "do they even know who Forrest Gump is?" 




 Would this be it?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSOI1nvXuJQ 




 To go along with this, if a number is slanted forward on the drivers side, then it will be slanted backwards on the pasengers side of the car.  They keep the standard look of the number regardless of where it's placed on the car. 




 I'm pretty sure Jeff Hammond is just FOX's bitch and they send him to the worst spots around the track to do a 10 second segment just to fuck with him. 




 I don't mind Bowyer myself, but for some reason my brother just hates him. 




 That's true, but if you think about it, while the air titans are on the track that would most likely mean that the surface is too wet to even want to have the cars out there yet to help dry it. 




 I wish I was BIG!! 









 Ha, now that would be interesting to see. Actually I just want to see Jr. Wreck. 




 Thanks. That's what I was looking for. 




 I know Hamlin would get the points for the race since he starts, but who,s name would actually be listed as the race winner? 




 I agree.  If he wins 2 races he'll essentially be in the chase since the guys he mostly racing against for 20th are second tier teams.  And the past 2 years with the wild card only had 1 driver each year with more than 1 win not in the top 10. 




 I went with 2 of my brothers last year and we got there around 3pm.  It would have been sooner, but my brothers aren't too motivated to get up in the morning and our hotel was in downtown Charlotte.  We didn't have any trouble with parking.  It was about half a mile south of the track in a free lot.  I would recommend getting there sooner though if you feel like walking around and being able to check out a good amount of the stuff there. 




 When someone says that NASCAR isn't a sport because it's just cars driving in circles, I usually bring up the fact that they are just dumbing down what is actually going on.  If you explain basketball or football like that, then both of those sports are just running up and down a court/field tossing a ball around.  Doesn't sound too exciting that way.  Same with baseball, it's just guys standing around 95% of the time scratching themselves with someone throwing a ball every once in a while.  At least in NASCAR there's action going on 100% of the time during a race.  Granted some of the action is better than other times.  But essentially no other type of sport can make that claim.  Another point I'll make is that the majority of the NASCAR driversa are just as in shape, if not better, than a lot of athlese in other sports.  If this doesn't get through to them to at least acknowledge you have to be athletic to race, then they are just being ignorant. 




 I would say pretty much anything by Pantera except this song.  Mostly because it's the ONLY song by them that a radio station will play. 




 My brother and I still think of the rocking chairs that FOX gave both Mark and Rusty in 2005 for their retirements.  Rusty has been rocking away in his chair just waiting on Mark to retire and finally use his too. 




 I noticed this in the Texas race results too.  Except Dave Blaney was one of the 4 in a row. 




 Can someone tell me why Truex was penalized on pit road earlier? I thought the announcers said it was because the crewmen weren't over the wall before he left the pit stall.  But I've never heard of that before. 




 Brilliant! 




 I didn't think they were picked as the random car for inspection for the races after Talladega.  I thought NASCAR said they were going to inspect his car along with the other standarad cars that get picked. 




 I'll be down there this weekend for my first Martinsville dogs. 









 I think it's entirely possible.  Through 5 races he currently has 145 points, and Ryan Newman in 20th has 121 points.  If you figure the person in 20th roughly doubles their points over the next 5 races that would give them 242.  So Hamlin would only be maybe 100 points out of 20th when he returns.  He will need 2 wins for sure, possibly 3 to get a wild card spot in the chase though. 









 I would have to say the [T-Rex](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkEVKzZNQDY) is the best demo on the original Playstation. 




 Hopefully it's not rain for the entire day.  Then we can finally see the new track dryers in action! 









 You have an initial budget of $100 and need to buy 5 drivers.  You can either try to buy 5 guys in the middle of the pack to have an overall good group.  Or you can spend the big bucks and get a top driver or two, but then sacrafice it by having to pick at least one lower level crappy driver to be able to afford all of them.  If your driver's value goes up, then you can sell them at a higher level than you bought them at and your entire salary cap increases.  For example: You buy someone that costs $20 and after 3 weeks they now are worth $21.  If you sell them, then your total salary cap will go up by $1.  But the same is true for drivers who go down in value.  You can sell them at a loss and take a hit, or you can try to ride them out and hope their value goes back up.   




 Walmart almost decided to become a primary sponsor for Jeff Gordon just a few years [ago](http://aol.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2010-08-24/walmart-in-negotiations-to-sponsor-jeff-gordon).  Not sure on the reason off hand for why the decided against it. 




 I doubt walking from the track to call a cab would make much difference.  At least I wouldn't think so from the way things looked to me last year. 




 My brothers and I went to the All Star race and Coke 600 last year for the first time.  Our hotel was downtown Charlotte and we drove to each of the races.  Basically for driving I took it easy to drive back each night.  Cooler sized for the track are 14" cube and it can be a hard or soft cooler.  As for leaving, once the race was over we hung out around our poarking lot for about 45 minutes which is about when traffice was starting to get thinner in our lot (still a LOT faster than Michigan takes to clead out).  So a cab probably won't work the best for leaving the track.  If your hotel is in the track area, you may be able to just walk the distance depending on where it is of course. 




 Wow, I don't know how I never realized that from all the times I've watched it.

 It's plumber action man! 




 Not really a big party or anything, but about 12 or so people were in my apartment drinking when I was in college.  The outside doors were closed since it was fairly cold outside.  Someone came in and went straight to the kitchen fridge.  He heads back out the door with our ketchup in his hands and says "now all I need to do is find a hot dog" and left.  We were all just kinda in shock wondering what the heck just happened. 




 Women shopping for groceries. 




 Agreed.  I was thinking the same thing. 




 I agree the new setup is terrible.  I use Jayski.com and msn.com for most of my news.  And for some odds and ends stuff I go to racing-reference.info

 While I find this stuff interesting, can anyone explain how a telescope like this can be focused on such a specific area for hours as the article mentions?  Wouldn't the rotation of the earth have an effect on it? 
























 AFTER FURTHER REVIEW OF GORDON'S WIN LAST WEEK NASCAR HAS MANDATED THAT HE GIVE HIS PIT CREW OVER TO THE 48 TEAM TO FINISH THE YEAR. 









 Hot dog on bread with peanut butter!  Learned it from my dad when I was younger. 









 No worries.  I know you're just doing what you can on here. 




 Does anyone else read insanity wolf memes in a deep, loud yelling voice? 




 Looks like Team Hendrick has some competition in the give away department.

 THAT'S A LOT OF ROOM TO CHEAT! 




 I was there for the spring race and parked directly north of the track on the north side of Clover road and it was free.  Drive time in was about 45 minutes for the last 2 miles coming from the north.  As for leaving we tailgated a bit and left about 2 hours after the race and there was pretty much no traffic. 




 I BET TONY STEWART USES THE SAME BROKEN LEG EXCUSE AGAIN THIS WEEK TO GET OUT OF RACING.  WE ALL KNOW IT'S A COVER UP FOR HIS LACK OF RACING TALENT. 




 CHEATER KNAUS WILL HAVE SOMETHING NEW UP HIS SLEEVE! 




 Well, at least she's *happy* doing what she does now. 




 You're welcome!  And thanks for all you do on this site! 









 Never owned a Naomad myself, but I did get to try one when I used to work at a game store and someone traded one in.  Definitely enjoyed messing around with it. 




 It's still surprising that neither of these systems took off better than they did.  I thought they were both better than the Nintendo handhelds that were out during their respective times. 




 Can't say I have a bet where we pay up each week like yours, but that would be fun.  But I have probably 8 different NASCAR bets with friends that run throughout the course of the year.  Overall it's looking like I should get around $120 and about 2 cases of beer from the winnings. 




 As tsr6 stated, the money now goes to the NASCAR foundation.  Before 2008 the money was redistributed amongst the teams with the season end winnings.  I'm not sure how they decided on redistribution amounts, but I know each team didn't just receive what they paid in during the season.  Otherwise there is no reason to charge them to begin with. 




 I would agree if it's something like a fight that earned the fine, then the individual would most likely have to pay it on their own. 




 I agree that there definitely isn't a catch all answer for something like this.  But thought depending on what the situation was for the fine maybe there is a precedant that teams usually use for if they would compensate the driver'crew chief back.  Of course, as you mentioned, there are different variables that could play into this too. 




 I second the weekly give away!  Considering I forgot about my cake day over the weekend :( 




 I understand that when a team is caught cheating that either the driver or crew chief are usually fined and responsible for paying the fine themselves.  But do the team owners end up essentially "reimbursing" them for the fines after it's paid? 




 If at a social event when you finish your beer/beverage just say you have to go get another one.  Usually works pretty good. 




 So during the race today my brother thought of something in regards to NASCAR's new rule that drivers give 100% effort all the time.  With the restrictor plate race some drivers say that their plan is to stay in the back until the end of the race.  By doing this aren't they actually giving less than 100% effort to try to win the race?  So shouldn't that driver get a penalty for doing this?  Just curious what your thoughts are about this. 




 So should the site now be called Goldit? 




 On tv you don't really see how much they hit off of each other while driving that fast.  You can definitely see it in this video before the wreck. 




 For example, if there's a street with a speed limit of 35 mph, but normal traffic flow is 40+ mph, does it catch your eye when someone is actually driving the speed limit?  And to add to this, would the time of day make a difference, such as mid afternoon compared to 1 am? 




 I'd definitely give one a try.  Just like the funnel baconator at Charlotte Motor Speedway.  That thing was amazing! 




 I agree.  In past seasons when he did hang out in the back it seemed like it almost never worked out for Jimmie.  This year he's actually been running in the front of the pack and it shows with the results since you're less likely to be caught up in a big one if you're in the front. 









 I think Allmendinger is scheduled for one of the remaining races with JTG, but the rest should have Labonte. 




 I'm at work right now too....in Columbus, Ohio. 




 If only they still made multiplayer games with split screen. 




 He HAD backward legs?  So they're corrected now? 




 Hi Chad, you're doing a great job with the team!  I'm looking forward to you winning that 6th championship this year!  In regards to the 48 team haters referring to you as a cheater.  Do you despise them calling you that, or does it make you stronger inside and want to win more just to show them who's boss? 




 Yeah, I'd imagine that would be a bitch to try and crack the cubes once frozen.  When I was growing up we had the single ones, and I recall having to run some water across it sometimes to loosen it up in order to open. 




 So you want one of [these](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en site=imghp tbm=isch source=hp biw=1440 bih=738 q=old+metal+ice+cube+trays oq=old+metal+ice+cub gs_l=img.3.0.0.1981.4976.0.6126.17.10.0.7.7.0.117.936.3j6.9.0....0...1ac.1.27.img..1.16.991.HsBHFRghg4U) old school ice cube trays? 




 How about tacos....that shit ice cream? 




 Was this town festival in northwest ohio by any chance? 




 I'm a JJ fan and I have a brother who's a Hamlin fan and another who cheers for both Biffle and Keselowski.  So needless to say, there's plenty fo smack talk between us.  Especially when we go to a race together. 




 I was a Rusty Wallace fan previously, but became a Jimmie fan back in 2003.  Basically I knew Rusty wouldn't be racing too much longer and Jimmie just caught my eye.  So I had 2 drivers for a while there.  As for giving up on Hamlin, I don't see why someone that's actually a fan of his would give up so easily.  He'll be back and contending for the Chase/Championship next year. 




 I was expecting to at least see the Big Lebowski on the list. 




 I don't like the elimination idea because if someone has problems out of their control, like and engine failure, in the first race they are screwed from the beginning.  They can go on to win 6 of the remaining Chase races and it won't matter because they were already elimited from something out of their control.  Besides, with the points structure there's already an elimination factor with the Chase.  It just takes several races to get into it. 




 So how many coats of paint are on the side of that building by now? 









 Articles I've read estimate this year's attendance at just 75,000 though.  That's fairly low for almost any track on the circuit. 




 Yeah, that could make sense.  They definitely don't go into much detail about how it got there.  But throughout the movie you realize that Tim Robbins has a good amount of connections he uses for help. 




 So I just watched Arlington Road for the first time last night.  Overall I enjoyed the movie and think I understand pretty much everything that happened.  I just have 1 question though.  At the end of the movie, how does the bomb get into the trunk of Jeff Bridges rental car?  Did Tim Robbins know which car he was going to get and had it planted in the trunk beforehand?  Because I believe the only scene where Jeff Bridges isn't in the car is when he's fighting Tim Robbins in the warehouse building.  But I doubt that would have been when they planted it in the car. 




 The standard small talk question "How's it going?"  You really can't say anything aside from "good" unless you want to have a conversation about something being wrong.  Even if there is nothing wrong at the moment. 




 but I can recite the landline numbers of my best childhood friends *parents* 




 Regarding the cooler, do a google search for pocono raceway cooler sizes to get the exact measurements.  Most tracks are around 14 inch cube or so, and a lot only allow soft sided coolers.  A few still allow hard sided ones though.  Along with carrying in a cooler, most allow a clear plastic bag to bring other items in with you. 




 Yup.  On Jayski they posted that only 7 races will be on NBC and the other 13 will be on NBCSN. 









 Labamba's is where it's at for a good burrito! 




 Don't forget to hold the Y button the whole time too while going through the level.  We all know it helps too. 




 While I see your point, there's also a reson for buying a vowel in the case of the word "the".  If there are a lot of other letters missing on the board and you're not really sure of what to guess, then buying an "E" is a way to keep your turn along with seeing if there are other "E's" on the board to help on your next spin. 




 Wow, thanks!  That will definitely make it easier to navigate through and compile! 




 Yeah, that's pretty much the information I was looking for.  Probably be pretty tough to find a site that has penalties bad further than 2001.  Thanks for the help though! 




 I am essentially looking for a website that tracks the penalties that different drivers/teams receive over their career.  More along the lines of points penalites handed out for inspection failure, and not in race penalties where they might have to do a drive through pit lane.  If it does happen to have both stats, then that's even better.  Searching online so far hasn't been much help. 




 Yup, here's the [article](http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2013/06/28/james-finch-to-sell-sprint-cup-nationwide-team.html) I'm talking about it.  So we'll find out who the buyer is in a few weeks. 




 That's true, but isn't there someone buying the team from James Finch?  So it may just be switching hands essentially. 




 And I thought I was bad for taking the codes out of used games at a store.  But I never take from the new games.  That'd just be wrong. 




 You have 6th graders who have students of their own? 
























 Big Lebowski, Clerks 2, and Tommy Boy 




 That's kind of what I figured, but thought I would see if there is a possible designation. 




 After going to the Darlington race this past weekend, my friends and I started wondering if there was a difference between the 2 designations for a track.  Most of the tracks NASCAR goes to are noted as Speedways, but there are a few that are Raceways.  Or is it whatever the hell the track owner feels like calling it when they name it? 




 I'd say it affects me for some things.  I prefer to go to Lowe's, but am not against going to Home Depot.  Also, smaller items like certain food products will persuade me more if there's a picture of a driver on the product.  Depending on if I do or don't like them it will persuade my purchase. 




 I THINK EDDIE GOSSAGE IS TRYING TO COMPENSATE FOR SOMETHING WITH THAT NEW BIG HOSS TV!

 Yup.  Saying "Hey" back to this is usually a good response.  The other person doesn't actually care about how you are doing.  They are just using a different phrase to say hi.  Still kind of annoying though. 




 Kind of surprising Josh and Wise aren't each bigger than they are. 




 Nice catch! 




 Where I grew up in the U.S. you never even had to get out of your car to buy alcohol.  We had drive thru carry outs to get that stuff.

 DENNY HAMLING USED THE EXCUSE OF METAL IN HIS EYE LAST WEEKEND BECAUSE HE WAS HAVING BAD FLASHBACKS OF WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR!! 




 I didn't see the pre race, so I don't know what song was played.  But is it possibly [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGBLlFMn9Xc)? 




 In regards to this game, does anyone else have have friends that disagree with the order that the items are said?  As I grew up it was always Rock, Paper, Scissors.  But it seems anyone that is roughly 5 years younger or more order it Paper, Scissors, Rock.  I'm wondering why the change in the ordering. 









 SUMMER AND WINTER OLYMPICS APPARENTLY BOTH PLAY A ROLE NOW. 




 I've got Johnson, Edwards, Keselowski, and Allgaier as my current 4 starters on Yahoo. 




 OSU grad and current employee of theirs here! 




 Norm from Cheers!  Who didn't like him? 




 I think it's just really steep banking. 




 In 2004, 2005 and 2006 there were 5 drivers with a shot at the championship going into Homestead each year.  Unless your talking about pre chase years with multiple drivers having a shot.  That I'd have to look into a bit more to see. 




 You made me go back and check that actually.  Matt Kenseth most likely would have won.  He got 2nd and Jr. got 3rd at Homestead.  But you also have to take into consideration if Jr would have been eliminated after the first round with his engine failure at Chicago. 




 Agreeing with pretty much everyone else that this Chase format is a terrible idea.  But aside from the top 4 drivers going for the championship, are the remaining 12 that were eliminated from the chase essentially finishing in points in relation to where they are to the other 11 eliminated drivers at the Homestead race?  It says when someone is eliminated their total is reset to 2,000.  So does someone eliminated in the first round have their points reset to 2,000 after every 3rd chase race?  




 148 




 18 




 This sounds more like a first place problem than first world. 




 You need to get over the bad things in life.  Shit happens! 




 Thanks for the pictures.  Those seats don't look too bad.   




 Some friends and I are going to the Darlington race in April and will be ordering the tickets in the next week or so.  We are thinking of getting seats in the Pearson Tower section near the top.  So we'd be essentially near the entranace of pit road.  Any opinions on these seats or others?  This is the first time going to this track for all of us. 




 It's amazing how almost all of the stats end with a 5 or a 0 for the amounts. 




 Anyone else read the thank you in Mort's voice from Family Guy? 




 Yup, that's what I would say he is thinking of too. 




 Jimmie! 




 WHAT WHAT IN THE BUTT! 




 IT'S GOOD TO SEE THAT DALE SR. IS RETURNING TO THE CUP SERIES NEXT SEASON IN THE 3....OH WAIT. 




 I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE HIS OTHER IS AND WHAT IT'S DOING. 




 Way better than the actual commercial if you ask me!  Good job! 




 I completely agree! 




 I still think they should have reduced the number that gets inducted each year from 5 to 3.  NASCAR doesn't have the depth within the teams like other sports do in order to have that many people inducted each year. 




 Kyle Larson of course. 




 Aside from the lack of Dale Jarrett, why are all the countdown posts 1 day ahead of schedule?  Isn't today actually 89 days until Daytona 500?  Or am I counting wrong? 




 Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, mother fucker, and tits! 




 He has 4 top 5 finishes in the Sprint Cup series.  So there's that stat.  Don't think any were in the 93 car though. 




 Damn, if I lived in the Charlotte area I'd definitely have to stop by this. 




 Kind of odd that her middle name is the same as her first name though. 




 This is a pretty good idea.  But shouldn't today be 96 days until the Daytona 500?  Edit: Never mind.  I just saw your new post for day 96. 




 Twist, the spotter does speak English, but is British. 




 FINALLY THINGS ARE GOING TO RETURN TO NORMAL WITH OUR CHAMPION BEING JIMMIE JOHNSON AGAIN! 




 It gets me right in the feels. 




 When my friends make fun of NASCAR in regards to gas being wasted I usually bring up MLB teams.  They play 162 games a year and one of the teams has to travel to each game.  How much fuel does it use in a year for all of those teams to travel? 




 My brother bought one about 3 years ago at a garage sale. It's fun because you have to think back circa 1995 for what the answers actually are. 




 YOUR DRIVERS ALL SUCK.  ALL HAIL OUR OVERLORD JIMMIE JOHNSON! 




 YOU JUST WISH IT WOULD COME WITH SPRINKLES ON TOP! 




 People saying they got cheap gas.  Who the fuck cares? 




 And it takes a long time to count that high.  Just counting to [1 million](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Harper) can take 3 months. 




 Thanks.  That's what I figured, but could never find the answer when searching. 




 So I know the scoring for rookie of the year is based entirely different from the points received for the championship.  The highest finishing rookie receives 10 points, second 9, then 8, etc.  On top of this there are points for attempting to qualify, getting a top 10, and a few other things.  Along with this, only the 17 top finishes per rookie are considered for their points.  My question is, out of those 17 finishes that are taken into account, how is a rookies points calculated if that race was a top 17 finish for them, but wasn't a top 17 for any other rookie?  Here's hypothetical example with Ricky and Danica.  Ricky gets 23rd place and Danica gets 25th.  Ricky has 17 other finishes higher than this race so this isn't taken into account for his rookie score.  But for Danica it is one of her top 17 finishes of the year.  Does this then only count for 9 points for Danica?  Of course with only 2 drivers it's not a big difference, but when there's a larger rookie field it would have more of an impact.

 ACTIONS DETRIMENTAL TO STOCK CAR AUTO RACING! 




 DON'T WORRY, JIMMIE WILL REPAY THE FAVOR SOMEDAY....MAYBE....WELL PROBABLY NOT. 




 [SMUG ALERT!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxuwXczWQC0) 




 MYTHICAL...BUTT SEX THAT IS 




 DON'T WORRY, THEY CAN LEARN. 




 COUNTING YOUR OWN FLAIR MULTIPLE TIMES DOESN'T MEAN THERE ARE 4 DIFFERENT USERS. 




 AS ALWAYS, JR CAN'T WIN SOMETHING ON HIS OWN AND NEEDS HIS TEAMMATES TO SANDBAG IT TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE. 
























 There was also a passing play where the refs would call pass interference every single time if you passed to a certain reciever.  It would give you 25-30 yards every time. 




 Over the past 2 years I've lost just under 40 pounds with just exercising and not changing my diet.  I'd say I've been averaging about 25-30 miles per week running and 45 minutes of weights 3-4 days a week.  Of course changing up my diet would have sped up the weight loss process, but I didn't want to have to change up my eating and drinking habits in order to lose the weight.  So it is possible to lose weight without eating less, but it will take longer to get to your goals. 




 How does Jr advance instead of Logano?  Logano beat him 2 out of the 3 events. 




 Maybe you're at the wrong track. 




 Is he even sitting on a bench or just hovering in a squat position? 




 Maybe you're thinking of 2006?  He missed the Chase, but won 3 of the races out of the 10. 




 Dilbert, don't end your sentence with a preposition. 




 Whoa, the 21st century!  I wonder what other advances in technology there will be? 




 I don't think you need a tab open.  Most people will start one while they are there of course though. 




 I was at Darlington and the June Michigan race this year.  Darlington had maybe around 15 tents there and Michigan had several rows to go through.  The Saturday morning at Michigan I spent about 3 hours going through those things, and easily could have taken longer. 




 As I run past another person that looks similar to someone I know, I usually think of an imaginary conversation with that actual friend for the next few minutes. 




 Jayski posts the old non chase points each week. After last week he actually would have been up to 10th. So possibly even higher after his 6th place finish today. 




 Before DVR's were the normal thing I called my roomate who was upstairs to ask him to come downstairs and set the VCR to record a show on later that evening. 




 Other 2 should be Talladega in fall of 2000 and Pocono in June 2012. 




 And it looks like you have a window in your office.  Why shouldn't you.  You've been here 10 minutes. 




 I don't think Titanic was initially released in China.  Which is why it made so much money over there with the re release. 




 Especially with all the different flavors available now. 




 I prefer to buy all of my movies on blu ray or dvd.  Depending on how much I like/want to see the film is what I base If I want to get it right away or wait until the price drops a bit.  I just need to have a physical copy for some reason. 




 Carpet? 




 His?? 




 Hopefully this means one of two things.  Some kick ass games are on the way.  Or their next system will actually compete with Sony and Microsoft! 




 I would almost think quite a few people would still be standing just from the start of the race.  If so you wouldn't even notice any differnece for people sitting/standing for these 2 laps. 




 Clerks 2. Hands down! 




 Titanic.  Except the iceberg sinks instead of the boat. 




 I'd be fine with the next day or two.  So that could work. 




 I'm going to be moving to a new place in the next week and won't have FXX any longer.  Is there any good place online to be able to watch the current episodes of Wilfred? 




 Looks like the N64 even comes with a game. 




 Jimmie got second last today and last week. Has that ever happened before? 




 Why does he have to put so much emphasis on the H? 




 Ha, wow.  I guess I should use all the digits in a number next time I try to correct someone. 




 Or it's actually 147,198 cubic feet 




 Or you could try watching the first episode of King of the Hill to get my joke. 




 Ford stand for Fix It Again Tony 




 He should get one of his daughters racing in NASCAR.  That'd give Danica a run for her money! 




 But then Kyle Busch will have to miss the Chase on purpose just so he can keep winning in the lower series? 




 I believe Hamlin is signed through 2015. 




 But when you look at the fact of what their ages were when they each started, the comparisons aren't that different in wins.  Jeff Gordon took 8 years to get up to those 55 wins and Jimmie did it in 10 years.  Just think if Jimmie had been around when he was also in his early 20's! 




 Good question.  I would also like to know about this. 




 I wasn't aware of what they did until I read about it. 




 Regular Wii remote you can press B under the controller for the power slide.  So you would keep holding that instead of RZ when you let off the gas. 




 Got 149 for the month.  One of my better amounts over that amount of time. 




 I'm probably gonna hear it about this one, but I'd say Dale Jr. 




 For the interval running that I do, I usually use a treadmill so I know I'm staying at the higher speeds when doing them.  But as HDRgument says too, he/she prefers to do workouts outside to be in the environment they normally run in.  So I could see that being beneficial too if you are able to keep the pace you want. 




 Cast Away 




 Thanks for the explanations of the different types.  I'll have to test some of this out over the next few weeks and see how each of them go. 




 I've been running for several years and around last October I initially began increasing my speed for short periods during one run a week.  This turned into a sort of interval run for me where I alternate between 1/2 mile at slow pace and 1/4 mile at the sprinting pace and then the final sprint I push myself for .4 miles.  Over time I've been increasing the speeds, and I can definitely tell it's helping.  My natural pace went from about 7.1 mph to 8.0 over the past 6 months.  

Recently I started wondering if trying out a different system of interval running would be beneficial, or if it would essentially be as effective as what I'm currently doing.  I was thinking of possibly a pyramid interval in order to try to get longer distances in during my sprinting portions.  I don't really have a specific goal that I'm working to attain.  Aside from natural buildup for better speed and endurance.  Just wondering if there would be any benefit by changing things up a little bit. 




 Sounds like my co worker that I share an office with.  She plays music through Grooveshark on the computer and has a playlist with about 12 songs on it.  Been playing them over and over for the past 4 weeks now.  She must not realize there are other songs available on the site. 




 I believe you're right.  I thought the off from Bruton was only for one year. 




 Ahh, that would make sense.  For some reason mail in votes didn't even come to my mind. 




 I'm curious how the votes used to be accounted for before it was done electronically.  Or was it decided in a completely different way?  Also, how was Bill Elliott able to win so many of them?  I know most fans didn't mind him, but I wouldn't think he would be able to be considered the most popular for so long. 




 Redditors of Reddit:  What is the worst Askreddit question you can come up with? 




 I would say it's a good starting point to go from.  I started running more regularly about 1 1/2 years ago and started around 4 miles initially and increased about 10% per week.  Once you do enough weeks you'll be able to gauge if you are able to add more or if you should stick with what you are doing. 




 Not me, but my friends dad has been going at least a mile every day since Jan. 1, 2000.  I think that's damn impressive! 




 No idea.  His wikipedia page says he hasn't raced in a major competition since 2009. 




 Yup. Good job! I only know about it because my brother is a Hamlin fan and I use this stat to make fun of him 




 131 




 Nope 




 What driver made his only Sprint Cup start at Pocono and finished higher than Denny Hamlin in the race? 




 Last week I set out to run all 7 days and get 50 miles in and was able to accomplish it.  Usually I would run about 4 days a week and get between 25-30 miles in.  Made me feel good from accomplishing it! 




 Got third in a 5K just over a month ago.  Didn't think I would be anywhere near the front of the pack before the event.  Made me feel pretty good. 




 It's like a kick stand! 




 I was in Charlotte 2 years ago and it was a good time.  If you do plan on going to speed streets, I'd say do the other stuff first, then use that for your night time entertainment.  Also plenty of bars in the downtown area too. 




 I thought bananas were the standard unit of measure? 




 The reason why race wins in NASCAR aren't really comparable to wins in other sports is because in other sports you only have 2 teams competing heads up.  So you have 1 team getting a win and 1 team getting a loss.  In NASCAR you have all 43 teams competing in the same event at the same time.  So to use a win loss record in NASCAR you would actually have 42 teams getting a loss on their record each week regardless if they finished 2nd or 42nd.  To sort of relate it to your comment here about playing it safe, you could technically say if a driver finishes 7th they lost to 6 teams, but won against 36 others. 




 So doing it in Hawaii lets you get really close to the fish? 




 For that damn safe to be opened up! 




 Thanks,  
I never knw that either! 
























 That's what I was thinking, but they never really acknowledge it beyond the phone call conversation. 




 True, but I wonder if he just says that to Marty and it's not actually true.  Otherwise, why would Doc be so confident standing in front of the Delorean while Einstein is being sent ahead 1 minute?  Doc and Marty easily could have been ran over if the experiment with Einstein failed. 




 So at the beginning of the first movie, Marty shows up at Doc's place and all of the clocks are being shown.  While Marty is talking to Doc on the phone the clocks all ring 8:00 am and Doc says "That means my experiment worked".  Referring to the clocks all being 25 minutes slow.  What experiment is Doc referring to in regards to the clocks?  Did he possibly time travel already himself?  If he already time traveled, then that would make sense that he knows Marty will be at his place at that time.  Otherwise, why would Doc call his own home if there shouldn't be anyone there to answer? 




 He only has 1 win. That's why he isn't locked in yet. 




 Yeah, it would have to be for wide release.  I know Grand Budapest Hotel was over $200,000 for its opening weekend.  I'm thinking that's the highest ever, bud something may have beaten it since it came out. 




 My cats breath smells like cat food. 




 Old North posted a picture the other day on facebook with their craft beers.  It had all of them for $5 a pint.  It didn't list the domestic beers, so not sure what those will be aside from cheaper than the craft beers.

 Harvick is apparently getting enough top 10's between this year and last year that Outback put a stipulation on it.  When hearing the advertisement on the radio for one race they mentioned a limit of 1 per table.  I don't think they had that in the past. 




 Burninator! 




 And of course they left the entire category for the end of the round. My brother and I thought for sure that Richard Petty would be one of the answers before they even started. 




 Lucas knows you made a typo in the title. 




 I was down there in 2012 and stopped by Hnedrick the Friday before the 600 and they had a bunch of stuff going on.  Inflatable things and I think a few small rides for kids.  Concession stands and small games to play.  Drivers talking and some autographs.  They didn't have anything extra opened up for the garage area or shop/museum though.  We actually had to park in one of the lots for the track and they bussed people in and out of the place since there wouldn't have been room for parking there. 




 Has anyone thought that maybe John not being human isn't actually a spoiler?  It could be something that's made known at the beginning of the movie and everything goes from there.  Maybe there's a human John in the future that the machines have captive and they send the cyborg back in his place?  Just a thought. 




 Wait, so Boris is 52 years old?  Or is that date wrong too? 




 Help us Obi Wan Nintendo.  You're our only hope. 




 Marvel did make the movie because they had the rights for using Hulk.  But the 2003 movie doesn't intertwine with the story of any of the current ones.  The 2008 Hulk includes Nick Fury at the end to connect it with all the other current Avenger characters. 




 And then they give the call to start the engines for an Xfinity race and no one hears a sound.  That'd be weird. 




 Nope.  It doesn't have any tie ins with the current movies.  The Hulk starts with the 2008 movie with Edward Norton. 




 Actually less than a decade.  These Marvel movies began in 2008, and we're getting the 11th and 12th ones both in 2015. 




 Yup, that's exactly what it is. 




 I wouldn't say the Wii was the least popular version of the game.  RB 1 and 3 sold more on the Wii than the PS3 and weren't much behind the 360 either. 




 For the first round of the Chase each driver gets 3 bonus points awarded to them per win of the regular season.  So in the example, Harvick would start the Chase with 6 more points than Johnson. 




 Go is definitely a good one here. 




 The other 2 for Jimmie are Chicagoland and Kentucky.  Last year he finally crossed Michigan off his winless list. 




 They are already planning on releasing 4 in 2017 though.  I believe with the same main toys. 




 The whole lineup of Cinnamon, Frosted, etc. are definitely the best EVER! 




 Not possible.  I don't have one. 




 Yup.  Jayski only has those 2 listed for penalties from last weekend. 




 Would that rule be changed since the post Bowyer spin debacle though?  After that NASCAR said drivers have to give 100% or risk being penalized. 




 **Jimmie Johnson**  After you were eliminated from the Chase last year, how much were you guys using the remaining races to prepare for the 2015 season? 




 I don't believe you.  I'm 35 and drink/get drunk regularly and I never get hangovers.  They went away during my college years. 




 Thanks.  This is just what I was looking for! 




 If not an app, then is there possibly another way aside from me manually putting them all in my phone? 




 They are each at the end of the months you listed. 




 Don't listen to the others. I'm 34 and basically since college I almost never get hangovers. And I drink every weekend. So there is hope that they get better instead of worse for you over time. 




 It's probably the Biff borrowing the firesuit.  He just wants some attention. 




 Last year I just wore my coat the entire time.  It didn't seem to get too warm with it on in there. 




 As lawnmower_of_destiny said, compared to other generations, the gap isn't that large.  PS2 was at 150M+, compared to GC and Xbox both in the lower 20M range.  PS1 was just over 100M compared to N64 with just 33M.  SNES compared to Genesis is a bit closer at 49M to 29M.  But regardless if you look at the percentages of sales, the Wii over PS3 and X360 is considerably smaller than any of the previous 3 generations. 




 I wouldn't call it a large margin.  Wii has sold about 101 million compared to about 85 million each for PS3 and Xbox 360.  The Wii jumped out to a huge lead initially, but then slowed a bunch after a few years while the other 2 were still selling really well. 




 Lesbian seagull? 




 I see a new super hero movie coming out....The Human Calculator vs. Numero Uno! 




 He looks so content with his beverage now.  Like a little kid just wanting their blanket. 




 Where are you buying enough oil for a vehicle for under $10?  Quarts of oil are over $3 a piece.  And pretty much any vehicle requires 4-5 quarts.  Even if you buy the larger 5 quart container it isn't much savings.  Either way, I'm agreeing with you that it isn't worth doing it yourself for the price it can be done at a store.  Maybe a $5 savings by doing it yourself for most vehicles with standard oil. 




 Tyler Perry's Madea goes to Space! 




 I personally would go with the shirt.  As ForwardBound mentioned, your legs don't really get too cold.  Especially after you start the run. 




 Since when are people allowed to bring their phone/camera into the emergency room before a surgery? 




 Believing advice found on Reddit. 




 I got a lot of problems with you people! 




 I definitely understand where you're coming from.  It would make more sense to call his titles Winston Cup titles.  Or at the very least maybe leave the sponsorship out of it altogether.  Just say he won 7 Cup titles and leave it be. 




 It makes it sound like he just keeps on winning more titles! 




 True, they can see if the 5 lugs are glued to the rim before being carried over the wall.  But it's still possible for one to fall off in the process of putting the tire on.  Maybe the tire changer would just skip the one that fell off and only use 4.  And you're right that the RR tire can be over the line and still be a legal pit stop.  The RF would not be allowed over the line. 




 The change didn't say anything in regards to being able to have less than 5 lug nuts on each wheel.  They still need all 5 on the car, they just don't have to be tight.  So there will still be 43 officials out on pit road to see if all 5 get put on each wheel.  Plus they have to check to see if the car is fully in the pit box.
Edit: Typed Loose instead of tight initially 




 I never really understood how an offical is able to tell if a lug nut is fully tight or not from their view.  What specifically did they look for to be able to see this?  Because if it's screwed on 80% of the way, but just not tight, wouldn't it be pretty tough to tell that it's loose? 




 NASCAR would still need an official at each pit stall.  They'd still be checking to make sure 5 lug nuts were put on each tire (this article says they just don't have to be tight, doesn't say they can be missing), the car is within the pit box, tires aren't just freely rolled back to the wall, etc. 




 DENTAL PLAN 




 You'll be fine.  I went from 20 years old to 30 between visits.  They didn't jusge me and I had no cavities!  So I'm good for another 10! 




 I agree with you that it needs to help Nintendo sell systems.  But for the current install base it's a good start over just 3 days. 




 Considering there are only 3 million Wii u's in the U.S., that's 1 out of 6 people who bought the game in the first 3 days.  Doesn't seem so bad in that regards. 




 And it put them on the map! 




 So it'll definitely be lower than the previous two for the whole weekend then. 




 First see if 4K home technology catches on before worrying about something like this. 




 Yeah, the robots fighting is definitely the main attraction for the movies.  Acting, not so much. 




 The company wasn't trying to make an evil transformer to accomodate the bounty transformer.  They were making transformers to assist with stuff along the lines of military use.  The problem was that they linked it to Megatron's memory and that is what made it evil.  From there Megatron/Galvatron was able to control the other transformers created by the company.  In regards to the bounty transformer, he was working in secret with whatever the government agency Kelsey Grammar worked for.  Their job was hunting down any hiding transformers.  The bounty hunter was working with them in order to capture Optimus for himself. 




 I don't recall reading anything specifically saying it only applies to the final 4. But I assumed it will be that way and other drivers still get bonus points for their finishing positions. 




 Bought Korn's re-issued latest album in August at Best Buy.  It was an exclusive release through them. 




 That makes sense.  Thanks! 




 During Gordon's interview he called Brad a dipshit and it was aired on tv.  I know it's been a while, but back in 2004 when Dale Jr won at Talladega (I believe his 5th time) he said "shit" during an interview and was fined and docked points for saying that during a live interview.  Jr was fined 25 points, which would be about equivalent to 6 points today.  Why wouldn't Gordon get penalized for the same thing? 




 Drivers licenses do expire, at least in Ohio.  It says right on it "Expires on" and then has the date.  They expire when you turn 21, and then every 4 years afterwards.  And a bar can legally turn someone down if they are trying to use an expired ID even if it says they are clearly over 21. 




 Doubtful that NASCAR was popular since the 1930's, considering it didn't exist until 1948.  However, racing in general was popular since the 1930's in the southeast. 




 The odds of that are approximately 3,720 to 1. 




 Correct! 




 Here's an easy one.  What's the only track that Jeff Gordon has finished 43rd at?  And he's actually done it twice and this track.
