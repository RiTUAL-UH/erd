 Can someone explain what he did? I feel like what he is saying is that the illegals that cross the border are bad people. Is it wrong to say because most of them aren't? Is there a border problem where drugs and gangs from Mexico are bringing crime to the U.S.? Is it dangerous for Americans living there now? He didn't call all Mexicans rapists like people want to claim. Did he cross a boundary by even bringing it up when it's not a problem at all? Where can I find this info? 
























  e made up some bigoted, xenophobic bullshit to feed the mouth breathers. You seem to have bought into the bullshit.

 I was just asking for some insight since I didn't feel like studying up on all the figures and didn't see any comments discussing the facts. All I get is your bitchy reply. And another guy who says he called all Mexicans rapists.  
























 Not that what he said was right or factually accurate but I don't understand how people think he thinks all Mexicans are bad people. Or even most. He just thinks there is a huge border problem and a lot of the illegals are dangerous. He might be wrong. But that doesn't mean he is racist. I think a lot of people are being unfair and not even trying to understand him. I am willing to say he is your typical narrow minded republican. 
























 The way I see it he thinks Mexico is dangerous because of gangs and corruption. Whether true or not this is a governmental issue not a race issue. He is willing to say many nice things about Mexican people so it's not like he doesn't like them just because they are Mexican. 
























 What are you saying? It IS dangerous or not? Very curious about this. 
























 Yes but what does he mean by Mexico 'sends' us bad ones? I find that weird. 
























 Please explain. What did he imply? That the illegals are mostly bad people? I think your right. He said the wrong thing, but people are taking this far. It's Donald Trump and he said something stupid. I don't think he hates Mexicans though. Just possibly overreacting and exaggerating about the border problems. 
























 I am just curious what part of the rant is racist. Because I think he is just ill informed and his mouth is too big for his head. He genuinely believes that there is a huge problem. He thinks the  country is the problem but not the race itself.  
























 Thank you for that very interesting reply. This is helpful. I know it's weird that I am defending him at all but when I hear people talk like he is evil, I have to disagree. I just want more discussion and less blind followers who just agree with everyone else. People accuse me of being racist just for asking these things.

 I can see him reading about the crime from the Mexican border and getting all worked up and I think what he said and what he thinks he is saying are two different things. He just wants to emphasize the border problem. Yes he is stupid, but I want someone to really explain to him why what he said was wrong and not just say racism.  
























 put grape on poison and poison grape on mouth 




 I would like to purchase some history, math, and language text books like the ones you get in school.  




 Do you think Trump should have been more careful and said more specifically who he was against and what worries him. He knows Mexicans are hard workers. So if he generalized all of them on accident then that is the issue.  




 lol 




 I don't see enough discussion going on, just accusations. I understand peoples worries about issues even if I disagree with them. 




 The only people giving republicans bad names are themselves if they don't challenge Trump on what he is saying. I meant stereotyped, narrow-minded republican maybe.

 




 They don't even ask good questions. You have to specifically ask him if it is true that most immigrants from Mexico are criminals. Don't just say, would you take back anything you said? That's a cop out. They don't want to get involved with the mess.
 




 Saying all people from anywhere are rapists is factually wrong and ridiculous.
 




 Good information. Thanks.
