 Who is your favorite character in any show and why is it Oberyn Martell? 




 No problem man! I agree with your thoughts on the "lack of realisation" by peers. I always feel like I'm the only one actually contemplating this stuff whilst everyone else is caught up in things like religion as you say. I am not trying to offend religion or say that God does not exist in any way but I feel like a lot of people get scared of stuff like this and religion or the idea of a God is an easy solution. You've gone the hard route by truly contemplating one of the scariest things which is the mere meaning of existence. It is not at all irrational to have this anxiety. I think curiosity and contemplation of the universe should take form in awe and excitement rather than anxiety. Just because its uncomprehending doesn't necessarily mean its scary or a bad thing :) 




 Yeah! It's when you think to yourself "I'm really tired I'm just gonna have a quick lie down" that you always end up napping. I mean I never lie down whilst tired and then after 5 minutes go "Okay, thats that done!" I always end up waking up 2 hours later feeling like death. 

This thread actually reminded me that when I got my first panic attacks when I was younger it was always during/after naps. I would go in this kind of delirious/ sleepwalking state and walk around the house saying really weird stuff like "where am I?" to my family whilst crying. They would try and calm me down then I would wake up later having no recollection of it. 

I guess napping wasn't built for everyone! Anyway I actually think its a good thing because it makes you more productive. One of my friends naps all the time and never gets anything done, also makes him stay up later at night procrastinating. Its good to have a stable sleep cycle.  




 bro! I have the exact same thing. After watching that video with the new picture of amdromeda where it slowly zooms in i felt like i was gonna have a panic attack. It seriously puts everything into perspective making u feel extremely insignificant yet at the same time significant by your mere existence. I also find it funny because most people on this subreddit have things like social anxiety or health anxiety yet I also have this like existential anxiety, its usually worse at night when you're lying in bed just questioning everything. It is literally the most terrifying thing when you truly sit down and try and comprehend your own existence and existence of anything in general. Even typing this now I'm beginning to feel a bit weird.

HOWEVER. At the same time its fucking awesome that we are all in this crazy boat together. I mean in the complete and utterly incomprehensible face of it all, we still get up every day and go about our business and try and lead meaningful lives. 

The way I look at it is that you are not an insignificant thing INSIDE the universe but you literally ARE the universe contemplating itself. You are this big badass scary thing, that is you! 


I'm literally going on a tangent here just getting excited about all this crazy stuff :) One last thing though, I seriously recommend you listen/watch some Alan Watts videos. He is like a psychiatrist for all existential induced anxiety. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I -Thats a good one. 

:) hope u feel better 




 Dude! Every time I nap I literally wake up in physical pain. I get so jealous of my friends who always can take naps but I literally can't. I wake up feeling like I've been in a coma or been knocked out, I have no idea where I am, my teeth feel horrific and even if i brush them they still feel weird like they are covered in sugar and i get a pounding headache.It literally will make me feel bad for the rest of the day until I actually go to sleep. fuck naps bro! 




 That was way sadder than I was expecting :( Is there no like ending to the book? I feel like all the stuff with the mice was just dropped.  




 Whats wrong with the 5th book? 




 I am about to finish the fourth book in the hitchhikers series. While I loved the first few I feel like they have gotten progressively worse. I feel like nothing even happens in the fourth book. Is it worth reading the fifth? What are everyone else thoughts? 




 If you could have one thing now that would make you happier, what would it be? 




 You look like Christopher Nolan. 




 This truly made me feel the significance of that quote about whether or not we are alone are both equally terrifying. I mean after looking at that picture how can you say we are alone? That is one glimpse of one speck in the universe and it seems utterly and unfathomably gigantic. Yet at the same time, the thought that even amongst the sheer size of the universe, we are alone makes me feel like I could explode from incomprehension. I am one of 7 billion. 7 billion. That number is so small in the grand scheme of things that it practically does not exist. Trillions of stars and billions of galaxies. I actually exist. I am one of the 7 billion and I am proud to be part of the 7 billion. 
























 Sorry for the late response! I loved Korea. Soeul is so much fun. I'm really into hip hop and it has some really cool clubs that just play rap music. Food was amazing, people were nice and I really wanna go back! I flew with Korean air which is a really nice airline.  




 i just flew to korea on a 12 hour flight! Okay so if the anxiety is about plane crashes, there is utterly no reason to be afraid. Even taking into account the plane crashes of 2014, the odds of your plane crashing are unfathomably low, they aren't even worth considering. Flying is literally one of the safest modes of transport compared to driving etc. Also, long haul flights are always in big juggernaught planes that dont take no shit from heavy turbulence. literally feels like ur just in a room for 12 hours.  




 You need to have more confidence in yourself man! Nothing bad is going to happen. For all you know she is more nervous having invited you over.  




 Fuck the king! 




 So would you recommend I just don't read it and accept the ending of Adam's version? 




 Okay so I have two questions. Was it the Vogons or the Grebulons who destroyed the earth? I don't understand which did it. In the wiki here http://hitchhikers.wikia.com/wiki/Mostly_Harmless it says  "Earth is destroyed by the Grebulon commander." But I thought it was the vogon using the new guide to destroy every possible iteration of the earth?

Second question, is it worth reading and "And Another Thing..." or is it not considered part of the series because its not written by Adams?

Thanks! 




 holy shit man... That was really well put! The analogy of the butterflies and the garden. Makes me really want to focus on myself and feel happy. 




 Thanks for the response, you kinda changed my perspective. I guess I do get so caught up in seeing all these happy couples that I forget the other side of the coin. I will try to focus on being happy regardless of my circumstances :) 




 Don't really know where else to post this so I thought id just write about it here for therepeuatic reasons. So yesterday was valentines day and I went out with my sister and her friends. Whilst out I couldn't help looking at couples and feeling so envious. I am 19 and I've never really had a serious girlfriend. I feel like being in a relationship is a huge aspect of life that i simply haven't experienced yet. I'm not socially awkward or anything. I just feel I've never really built a relationship with girls that I know. Tonight I decided to go to a coffee shop and get a coffee and read my book to relax but I'm literally just sitting here feeling utterly lonely. On the way over here I kept walking past restraunt windows and seeing happy couples eating and it literally just makes me feel like I want that so much. The whole situation reminds me of that George rr Martin quote about how being lonely at a party hurts so much.

Anyways I just wanted to write this because I feel writing makes me feel better. Have a great night.  




 I'm the same. I sometimes convince myself i have diseases because diseases always happen to the unwary and unexpecting. If I believe i have the disease then the chances of me actually having the disease are lowered. I especially say this about stds. I'm crazy 




 Haha dude I'm the exact same. The left side of my head always throbs and feels like there is pressure building up inside but I've had cat scans and everything and it's fine. My neck is also riddled with lumps, my glands are always swollen, I have a lump on one of my testicles etc... I've had it all scanned and it's fine but my body is literally proof that it's never as serious as you think. The funniest part is my lumps only rose after I would be constantly pressing my neck worrying about lumps. Anxiety has a way bigger effect on your body than you realise.  
























 Just read that you passed! Congratulations! :) Knew you could do it!  




 Since summertime last year, I have been feeling extremely anxious literally all the fucking time. The past 9 months or so have really been the toughest I've ever endured. I've felt more and more not like myself, constantly worrying and fearing everything. If one problem gets resolved, I'd just move on to something else to worry about. I always feel sorry for myself and imagine terrible things happening to me. 

Yesterday I cracked, finally. I just lay down on my bed and started crying. It felt so good to cry and just let it out because for the past 9 months or so I've literally felt like things are building up and I'm just gonna explode. 

This evening, I decided that I've had enough. I've simply had enough of anxiety and depression and all the other emotions I feel. It was pouring with rain and dark and I went outside and just did a workout session. I worked up a sweat and just got soaked and muddy. I have to say, in the past 9 months I've never felt so good as I do right now. It feels so empowering just to say "you know what, I don't care about what happens to me, I don't care if all my darkest and most horrible fears become real. I love myself and I'm going to just going to say fuck it, go outside and get dirty".

The funniest thing is, I always see reddit posts about doing excercise and how it changes your frame of mind and makes you feel better but I always just say "fuck it", It probably won't make a difference to me or make me feel worse. But I have to say, I just feel so alive. Now all I want in the whole world is just to keep this feeling going and gain momentum to get out of this rut that I'm in.

Anyways, I just wanted to get that off my chest. To all people who are like me and read posts about doing exercise but never actually do it, please just do it. Just do one honest, hard session. Get dirty and sore, muddy and wet, just do it! 

Thanks for reading! :) 




 You are an evil person.  




 Thanks so much for the response. Means a lot to me :) 




 Don't look at it like you need to pass and if you make one mistake you've failed. Look at it like you've already failed and you need to just drive well in order to pass. Don't concentrate on any mistakes you may  make. I thought I'd definitely failed mine but I persisted and it turned out I passed. No matter how bad a mistake, just imagine you've already failed right from the beginning and it relieves the pressure.  




 Although he was under for long we usually say around 15 minutes is the limit in an avalanche. This person was rescued relatively quickly.  




 I'm a 19 year old guy currently on my gap year (year break before college/university that we do in England). I've been travelling around quite a lot during my year off and I feel like my anxiety/depression is just getting worse. I never have panic attacks like I used to but I constantly just feel anxious. 

The big thing for me is my health. I am always worried about my health, primarily stds. Last year I did something stupid with a girl I didn't know and i literally convinced myself I had HIV. I went and got tested and I didn't have it which was a huge relief. But then at new year i got blackout drunk on a night out and lost some of my friends. Since then I have been worried that I have it again. For some reason I just feel like my drunk self is a total ass-hole who will completely fuck up my life given the chance. I have no reason to believe i got infected, I'm pretty sure i didn't have sex or anything but I just feel like I did something that made me get a disease. I've told myself that I will get tested again after 3 months but even if I come up negative again I don't think thats going to be the end of the problem.

I feel like I always have to have one thing that I'm worrying about. It used to be a brain tumour and then I got scans and after everything came out fine I would switch my anxiety and focus on something else. But there is never a time where I'm just not worried about anything. There is always one thing that I'm fretting over in my mind and it's usually a disease of some sort. 

I just feel so insane. I feel like nothing good will come of me and i will end up as a tragedy, dying young of a disease with stigma attached to it through my own fault.  I've never been to a doc or therapist about my anxiety/hypochondria but I'm starting to think I should. I mean, its nearly been 3 months since new years and I am still constantly worried about having ruined my life over being blackout drunk. That just can't be normal. I feel like I don't like my inner self who is revealed when I get really drunk with friends. I have no self control and I just feel ashamed of myself. The worst part is I didn't used to feel like this. I used to love myself and be proud of things I did, I used to be my friend but I just don't feel that way anymore. I honestly look in the mirror and see someone who I'm afraid and ashamed of when I look into my own eyes. I mean how fucked up is that?

Anyway, the reason I feel like I haven't talked to a doctor or therapist is 1: Because I'm always away and 2: Because I don't actually know If I'm having real issues. Some days the anxiety will still be there in my head but I will be distracted, I'll hang out with my friends and feel happy and I don't know if I truly need help or I just occasionally feel "Sad" because im a young teenager with hormones in me.

But every night I will go to bed and while lying there I will feel scared. Maybe of nothing in particular but just scared and filled with dread. 

Sorry for the rant I just feel I really need to talk about this. Any responses would mean the world to me.  




 A tragedy but all these people are good looking as fuck! 




 Whats the song? Is it from halo? 




 That was fucking cute. 




 Yeah true that. I only wrote "Ecstasy of Gold" in the title because I assumed people know thats Ennio Morricone.  
























 Remember that even in the darkest times you are loved. I love you. Everyone in r/anxiety loves you! You can push through whatever it is you are going through. 




 Please respond to me.  




 Hey! Don't go do anything crazy friend. Wanna talk?  




 I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain. - Frank Herbert, Dune

It's more of a quote than a short phrase but it's always helped me. 
 




 Yeah, I agree.  




 Yeah, I remember after my test driving became a lot easier. No pressure when your by yourself.  




 Most TED talks nowadays are like this. 




 Holy fucking shit dude are you me? You pretty much explained exactly how I feel. I am constantly scared of HIV. I had a drunken night with a shady girl, got tested and was negative. Yet now after a night of drinking wherein I got blackout drunk, I am convinced that I somehow got infected through a needle or something. It's like no matter what happens, I'm always going to be anxious about having a serious disease. My lymph nodes have also always been enlarged. I feel like I get all the exact symptoms of HIV. It's crazy. It's literally my worst fear to get it. 

The point is though, we don't. We simply don't have it. If you were to get tested, you would just move on to something else to worry about. The problem isn't HIV, cancer or meningitis, the problem is your anxiety. I feel like a lot of the time you get fear mongering advice like "always get checked, found a lump? get checked. GO TO THE DOCTOR IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO YOUR BODY". You know what I think of that advice for people with hypochondria? fuck it. That type of advice is for people who never worry. When you have anxiety or hypochondira, the only thing you can truly do to sort yourself out is to go to a doctor and get your anxiety sorted out! It is literally a mental illness and it will fucking ruin your life way worse than any disease would. 

I'm in the same boat as you dude. However I try to realise that anxiety is the issue here not the diseases. This quote is really meaningful to me http://sadmoment.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Walter-White-Quote-On-Spending-Your-Whole-Life-Being-Scared-In-Breaking-Bad.jpg. 

Hope you read this! :) 




 Chapter 19: Worrying about chapter 20 




 I BE RUNNIN THROUGH THE 6 WITH MY WOES. UNOHOWDASHITGOES 




 That's exactly like how I felt. Your mind just feels so clear and unclogged. I'm clearly no expert but I feel like anxiety is a problem that only modern society really ever gets. There is no significant biological difference between humans now and humans for the last few thousand years but humans for the last few thousands of years have actually had to do physical activities just to survive. Whereas now people sit down on a computer working 9-5 jobs and then go home and watch Netflix just feeling miserable. Biologically, we need to do physical activity to stay healthy. Technology has just fucked it up for us which is why you got to find the time to do exercise outside of work. 
























 Then watch netflix and cuddle with your dog! And don't say you are a burden. You are not a burden. You are good enough. You don't owe anyone anything. You can get groceries or job hunt when you feel up to it but you are going through a really rough time and you are completely justified in just taking a time out. Does someone with an awful fever say they are a burden when they are lying at home? No. Depression and anxiety are mental diseases. Therefore if you are suffering from them, you are no more being a "burden" than you would be if you had the flu or a broken leg. 

You have to understand that it's not your fault that this has happened to you and you should NEVER feel guilty about not doing mundane tasks because you feel this way. It doesn't matter what anyone else says you should do. Concentrate on the over-riding problem at hand rather than tasks like shopping or job hunting which take an infinitely less priority than your well-being.  




 I think you need to take a day off just to relax. Hide under some blankets and watch a tv show/film that you like, meditate, take a hot bath, just do anything that you know will relax you. When your fiance gets home tell him how you've been feeling and ask him to be with you. You don't have to talk about it or anything but I think you could use the company. It's rough being alone at times like this. I hope I've made you feel at least a little bit better. :)  




 No problem. What do you like doing to relax? Any tv shows or books you're into at the moment? 




 And tell me how it goes. 




 That's okay. If you can, go grab a big glass of water and drink all of it. After that, fill it again and come back to the computer. You should absolutely call your parents if you feel terrible. The fact that they are on vacation shouldn't stop you from doing that. If they knew you were feeling bad they would want you to tell them.  




 Do you have any friends or family you could call right now to talk to and tell them how you feel? If you keep stuff like this bottled up to yourself it can literally drive you insane and it doesn't need to be that difficult. It feels so good to talk about it. Literally call someone who you know will listen, and just let it out. Cry if you need to. Get someone to come round and just open up. If you feel comfortable, talk to your fiance but if not thats fine. If you have no one to talk to, I'm not going anywhere. 




 Okay. Firstly, you have to understand that the state you are in right now is not permanent. You haven't slipped in to a point of no return where you can never feel good again because that simply isn't how depression and anxiety work. This is merely a phase and you will get through it. Its really good that you have already tried to conquer these issues by seeing a psychiatrist so well done! I can't imagine how tough it has been for you this past week but it is going to be okay! have you told your psychiatrist about how you've been feeling recently and is there a way you can get in to contact with them now? 




 It's more than likely that you are just suffering from anxiety. Feeling disorientated and things like that are text book symptoms of becoming over-stressed. Have you ever been to a doctor to talk about how you feel? Are you on meds or anything? 




 That really sucks man :( Im sorry to hear about all that stuff. But first things first. Things like your house being dirty do not matter at the moment. Discard any worry about things like that. Prioritise your mental well-being. So have you felt dizzy for a while or is this a recent thing? 




 Kali. That's a really nice name. So whats the problem? Why are you feeling so down at the moment?  




 Hey! Thanks so much for responding to me. I really wanna talk to you. I wanna make you feel better. My names Isaac, what's yours?  
























 Hows it going so far friend? 




 It exists and you WILL get to it. Imagine how incredible it will be. Finally feeling content and free. You have to put your heart and soul into climbing out of hell. Practice meditation. Seek psychiatrists. Do everything you can. You get one life. Its worth fighting for even for 10 minutes of bliss at the end.  




 Haha. I also always get really existential and upset with the idea of non-existence at night. Don't worry, its usually a night thing and tomorrow morning you will feel fresh and fine. 

https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=alan+watts+death

Watch any Alan Watts video on death and it will make you feel a lot better. Death isn't something to be afraid of. Realise that you are the universe. 




 Hey! Don't worry you will be fine. Go make a glass of water and fill it to the brim with ice. Make it so cold it almost hurts to drink and then drink it. 

Relax...It's only an exam. You are not dying. Imagine you have been fighting a war for the last 5 years. A gruesome horrific war. And all of a sudden teleported to you right now about to take an exam. You think that person would care about taking this exam? Who cares if you fail its only an exam. Of course you'll do your best but it doesn't matter if you don't. 

Also change your mind from "I'm going to fail this exam" to "I'm gonna do as much as I can to pass"  




 Is it night time where you are now?  




 Yeah I completely see where you are coming from. You should work really hard in the next few days and try and get into med school then (but with the mind-set that no matter what happens you will still be happy). Don't under-estimate yourself. Of course it's not an ideal situation but its still possible. Do what you can with the cards in your hand :) 




 As a 19 year old guy who is a HUGE game of thrones fan. I can 100% tell you that your boyfriend does not watch it for the boobs. Also the first few episodes may make you feel like there is always nudity but it really gets less and less frequent as the show goes on and got more popular. The show is amazing and you should absolutely watch it if you are interested.

I think the real issue here that you need to address is the  fact that you get jealous at the thought of him looking at boobs. There was a really good video posted a while back where the guy explains scientifically why a guy might look at another girls breasts as its biologically programmed in men but also that literally 95% of the time if you were to ask them about that girl later on in the day they wouldn't even remember them. A guy is biologically programmed to look at breasts. Yes he might have a "hah boobs!" moment for about 5 seconds but after that he will forget about them and in no way should you feel jealous because he wants to be with you!

I'll actually try and find the video because it was really interesting.  




 Sucks that you are stressed! Exam season is always the worst. Nikosi Johnson said Do all you can with what you have, in the time you have, in the place you are. Whenever I feel bogged down with feeling like i'm "too late" or I've "run out of time" I change my perspective to one based off of this quote. It's not about what you haven't done in the past but what you can do now. Imagine you have a clean slate now and your just going to try your hardest in the time you have. Almost imagine a God-like deity coming down and controlling the body of kirbias for the next 4 days. Ask yourself what they would do in that situation and do it. 

Also, from my own personal experience. Don't panic and work extremely long hard hours and burn out. Work smarter, not harder. Stay hydrated, energised and happy. Take regular breaks and study in small 20 minute bursts. Also look up the syllabuses or previous exam papers and see what questions/topics are most likely to come up. 

Most importantly though, relax. Although exams can seem extremely important at the time, almost as if your whole life revolves around the next week or so, this is not the case. If I were to ask your older self about that stressful exam period you would either not remember it or say that you wish you weren't so stressed at such a prime, young and happy part of your life! :) 




 Once you're out you'll feel better! The sun is amazing for making you feel good but you have to actually leave the house for it to have an affect on you. Within 10 minutes you'll feel great. Go ride! :) 




 I play enhancement shaman and hunter, always nice to speak to fellow wow players :) 




 Also, when you do feel up for doing some of these tasks, do them one at a time. Don't look at it like "oh no I have all of this to do how am I gonna do it!?". Get a piece of paper and physically write one thing that you are going to do at a time and take it slowly. Break down complicated goals like "I'm going to get a job" into individual steps. It doesn't matter how minuscule these steps or progress is as long as you are making progress no matter how small it is! :) 
























 Hey guy/gal. Are you at uni? Also try, "Mindfulness by Mark Williams". Its an audiobook about meditation. I think it will help you A LOT more than yoga and it actually gets prescribed to people with anxiety and depression. The last few chapters are the actual meditations themselves but listen to the whole beginning of the audiobook as it really teaches you why you are feeling bad etc... It's really good!  




 Did you watch any yet? Thoughts?  




 I just want to say that a lot of people on this subreddit make a post stating how awful they are feeling and how they feel like they are never going to get better. I'd just like to point out that you deserve a congratulations for even posting about your current problems! Discussing something that a lot of people really don't want to talk about because you want to get it fixed is a first step in itself and something to be proud of! You aren't just lying idly and not attempting to get it solved. You are actually reaching out and putting in work despite feeling so awful. That is honestly one of the most motivating, beautiful things. Literally just saying "fuck you" to anxiety and speaking about it, talking about it, getting help.

So to all those who post asking what they can do to get happy or un-anxious again I just wanted to say that you already started doing it :) Love you all  




 Also you're brave. You had the nerve to actually talk about something that makes you feel horrifically awful and nearly gives you panic attacks instead of burying it into your conscious!  




 Also, don't say you want to die. There is so much to live for. You are not back at square one and you can be happy with people. But in order to love others you have to love yourself! Write down (pen on paper) everything that you are proud of doing in a big list. Seriously don't not bother. Just do it. Write down everything you are proud of and that you like about yourself then read it.  I can already think of the first thing for your list. You care. Saying things like "I don't deserve happiness" show that you are a human being who cares that they might have upset others and that's so good because there are so many people who don't.  




 I've read your post history and you are not at all a horrible person. The problem is, people compare their behind the scenes to other peoples highlight reels. You are a completely normal human being. You are not terrible despite what you think of yourself. I also often consider myself a bad person inside but I say fuck it - As batman said "It's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me"

Your "mistakes" are utterly minuscule and you need to learn to love yourself no matter what :) 




 I'm sorry but there is no way in hell she had anxiety for 2 years and just "learned how to turn it off". This person is toxic to you and you should not let her make you feel bad. You should confront her and tell her that anxiety is a serious illness and if she can't accept you for who you are then she can leave. It may be hard, but in general, ridding yourself of toxic people will make you so much happier in the long run. You need a firm base of supportive and loving people behind you to help you improve and get better. I'm really sorry that this person has said these things to you and I love you :) If you need to talk I'm here :) 




 Hey! Internet hug :) I'm sorry you feel bad at the moment but one bad episode is not a "setback". You aren't at all back at square one. Just because you have a few bumps on the road up doesn't mean you are going backwards. With all progress you will get "setbacks" where you feel everything has been undone but it simply hasn't. You have a week of success and then one anxious night. Thats a good ratio and something to be proud of :) 




 It's actually terrifying to imagine you are trying to escape and this dude just spots you and manages to get to your boat at the speed of light. 




 That was quite beautiful.  




 Yaaay! I'm so happy :)  
























 Just send it son!  




 yay! Congratulations. Telling people about anxiety makes you feel amazing. Like your no longer carrying the burden alone. This is the beginning of improvement friend! You are on the path :)  




 They wanted a futuristic robot in a film so they...literally built a futuristic robot... 




 No but I will :) I'm glad I could give you some motivation however brief :) 




 Hey! That's awesome man I really wanna get good at it. As for feeling like you want to delete your comments, fuck that. Be proud of anything that you say. Don't regret it. Being an honest person is honorable and nothing to be ashamed of.  




 I'd read it! Also, writing doesn't even have to be a public thing. Sometimes I write just to myself to let it out. Feels a bit weird at first almost like you are incriminating yourself and you almost feel shy about writing your deepest darkest thoughts despite the fact that its only to yourself. But once you do, oh boy do improvements start happening. Once you can acknowledge and talk about your deepest fears in a casual manner and actually analyze them as mere thoughts you are literally making yourself more powerful by conquering your fears.  




 Fuck that man. You can do it. Its time you start making decisions to make yourself feel better. And talking about your problems no matter how bad you don't want to is the first step. 

Also, I see you like rubiks cubes. I solved my first 3 by 3 one the other day. Never felt so proud of myself :) 




 Thanks so much for opening up :) Its so good to talk about these things because now it isn't something stuck in your head for you only. You've shared it and now people who read your comment will know of your problem too so it feels less like something you've got pent up inside you as you've actually shared it. You say you are exhausted with being worried about things happening to your family. If it will give you any peace of mind, nothing bad is going to happen. You have to ask yourself, whats the point in being sad about what hasn't happened when you could be enjoying time with your family now? You need to practice being in the present as opposed to worrying about the future or thinking about the past. (Look up 'Mindfulness' by mark Williams) Relax about the exams, you will try your best and if you don't do well so be it. 

As for the OCD, I think it would really do you good to just pay a visit to a doctor or a psychiatrist. Don't do this on your own, people want to help and it feels so good to share the burden of anxiety by just talking about how you feel. It makes you feel 10x more normal. 

But above all. Seriously well done for sharing. Because before 10 minutes ago your problems existed solely in your mind but you've begun sorting shit out now by actually speaking about it and that is seriously something to be proud of. :)  




 Yay! Good job! :)  




 It's such a shame too because it shouldn't be something to have to do anonymously. Mental health is so serious and the fact that people can't open up to their families and loved ones but instead prefer to talk anonymously online really shows how backwards society has it at the moment. I really truly hope that in the future it will be something that people would bring up and talk about to their families like having a cold rather than having to hide it and talk to people they do not know for help. 

But at the same time, it's kinda beautiful that all these different people who are struggling from the same thing come together in a community wherein people completely open up and others actually care and respond despite not knowing them. :) makes me feel all warm and mushy inside :') 




 Are you kidding?! Every couple and every person has problems, some a lot deeper and more fucked up than yours! When feeling down its easy to look at others and assume they have it all figured out and everything is perfect but that's the point. You don't see their behind the scenes. Its completely normal to have problems. That's not to say its right or you should do it  but you shouldn't feel un-ordinary about it. Watch the film "American Beauty" if you haven't. Not only is it a great film but I feel it gives a good representation of a what goes on in seemingly "perfect" relationships or families. 
























 It went well actually. The doc wasn't a psychiatrist or anything but she referred me to a psychiatrist and a psychologist she recommends. I think the anticipation with that sort of thing is way worse than when your actually with them. However, because it was only a GP, I didn't go into much detail about the anxiety, I just told her about it in general. So I feel more nervous about the psychiatrist and psychologist :O 




 Oh no :( what happened at yours?  




 Sitting in waiting room. I'm scared for what to say, how to sum up how I've been feeling for the last few years in a 15 minute appointment :/  




 "Don't let perfection destroy the good". I sometimes have to tell myself this. I might be on the verge of giving something up because I know it won't or can't be perfect. This is wrong. You can't let the idea of perfection stop you from doing any good just because it isn't perfect. If you always thought like this, you would never get anything done or make any progress. 




 Yeah I'd like to read The Dark Tower series. I'm put off by how long it is though. I mean it's almost impossible to write a series that long and not have it drop off in quality at some point. Is this true or is the whole series good? 




 Oh boy was that a good book. Laws yes. A few points I'd like to make:

1. Character development was absolutely phenomenal. I read the uncut edition so I don't actually know how much was added in but I felt the character development, especially in characters like Stu and Larry was fantastic. 

2. The bits towards the end with Tom and Stu literally had me tearing up. The Christmas day singing :'(. By that point I realised my heart was just invested in these characters. 

3. Once the mystery of the dark man was lost I felt like the story kinda lost something. It's like in Lost, once the mystery of the Island gets figured out, it's no longer that spooky which is why I'd say season 1 is the best. In The Stand, Randall Flagg only really stays spooky until he becomes an actual antagonist. When King starts writing in his perspective, although it does give us a lot more insight and story in the west, I feel like it detracted from the kinda mystery elements of the dark man. 

4. Ending was kinda predictable but thats not necessarily a bad thing. However I didn't like how the nuke exploded. 

Overall though I loved this book for character development alone. It's so bloody long that when characters die it literally is like "holy shit". That was the first King book I read, where do I go from here? :) 




 This is really nice thanks for posting :)  




 Thanks so much for the effort you put in to respond. It's really nice knowing that there's other people dealing with the same shit. I really agree with your point on honesty being key and I've always wanted to tell my family completely honestly what I'm going through. They know about the anxiety part but I've never explained the root of the anxiety as obviously it's a lot more embarrassing. How do you think I could tackle this problem?  




 So this is a long story and it might be a long post but I need to talk about it. 

Okay, so I am a young dude, 19 years old. Last August I was in Amsterdam and on a drunk night out I ended up having protected sex with a prostitute. The next day I literally felt unbearably ashamed and scared for my life. I was terrified I had contracted HIV from a silly mistake I made when drunk. I started fixating on symptoms and around a month later I had a really bad fever, a classic symptom of the disease. After the three month window period for hiv to show up in your blood stream I immediately got tested. Just before Christmas my results came back and I was so relieved. 

Soon later at a new year party for 2015, I got blackout drunk and ended up wondering the street. I hardly remember anything except trying to talk to girls and people on the street. The next day I woke up and got the strange feeling that the night before I had made an active decision to infect myself and asked someone to inject me with it or something. Despite it being irrational and completely ridiculous, I just had this feeling of dread like i made an awful decision to infect myself. Another 3 or 4 months passed and I had developed a white tongue with a red patch towards the back, I googled it and it was another symptom of hiv. I got tested and was convinced that I was gonna die. 

But before my results arrived through text message I went travelling to Thailand with my friend, the beginning of the trip was absolutely awful as I was completely convinced I had the disease. On another drunken night in Bangkok I decided to visit a massage parlour with the obvious intention of receiving a handjob. The driver of my cab ended up taking me to a brothel and I thought fuck it. I've had a terrible night and all I want is a handjob not sex. So I went into a room with the girl and she told me to use a condom and I told her this was unnecessary because I didn't want sex. She kinda just got naked and rubbed herself on me giving me a kinda body massage and then ending the session with the handjob. The next day I didn't think much of it. I told myself that I only received a handjob and you can't get hiv from that. A few days later I got my text message from my previous std text and it said I was negative for everything. I felt absolutely incredible and started crying. I actually was fine despite convincing myself I was infected. This feeling lasted about 2 days before I started remembering and fixating on the night with the prostitute in Thailand. This girl was high risk and I remembered that at one point in the massage she tried to give me oral sex, I remember quickly grabbing her head and lifted it up but I'm pretty sure her mouth might have touched the head of my penis. I started googling symptoms again and saw rash, fever etc.... About 2 weeks later I started convincing myself I was gonna get a rash, I stared at my arms all the time and convinced myself I had rashes. Then I took off my shirt to change t shirt and funnily enough there was a rash on my chest, this is a common place for people to get rashes after hiv infection. I pretty much accepted that I had it and my life was over. I ran home and lay in bed all night trying to stop a panic attack, the next day I woke up and the rash was gone. I was so happy because hiv rashes usually last longer. So I was kinda feeling okay for a bit but still worrying about it all the time. Two weeks later I got huge glands and a sore throat, more symptoms of hiv. It made me incredibly depressed and it lasted around 5 days. Since then it has been another 2 weeks and I have kept telling myself " at least I never got a fever, that's the most common symptom". And now for about 2 days I've developed large painful glands again and am getting shivery and hot at night. I told myself it's because I've been drinking and partying too often recently but I'm not sure. 

I've never felt so bad and ashamed in my life. I don't know why I put myself in situations related to my worst fear but what's happened has happened. I just feel like I will be a tragedy no matter what. I will upset my family and end up terminally ill or something. These are literally my worst fears and I just wanted to write them down, I would be surprised if anyone reads this but if you did, thanks and I hope you have a great day! :)

 You gotta start practicing again. Do small things but most importantly just stop giving a shit what people think of you or whether they will think of you negatively. Say what you want. Be who you wanna be and if thats someone who is brave then do it.  
























 I definitely feel like this book is marmite, people either love it or despise it :/ 




 So I saw this book recommended on Reddit countless times and decided to read it. I'm 124 pages in and I have to say I'm not really enjoying it. I feel like the main character is really self absorbed and annoying and I find that I don't actually like him. 

The problem is, I've only really started properly reading recently and I have terrible OCD with finishing books. I'd feel dirty if I was to put it down without finishing it, especially considering it gets such high praise. Maybe I just need to be more open minded about it? But then  again what's the point of reading if your not gonna enjoy the book. Does anyone know if this book picks up or gets better or should I just move on?

Thanks! :) 




 I suffer from terrible health anxiety also so I can relate. It's extremely tough being optimistic with obsessive negative thoughts related to hypochondria but I guess thats the challenge ahead of you. You will be fine though. In an anxiety book I read, the author stated that the two classic characteristics of an anxious person is that they expect the worse and they under-estimate their coping abilities. You will be fine regardless of the outcome, trust in your ability to deal with shit. Anticipation is the worst thing.  




 https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/3cw8g6/i_am_a_hypochondriac_who_has_recently_found_out/ Read that thread 




 Also, I once read a quote that I really wish I could find now that went like "how empowering it is for your deepest fear to become a reality, only to discover you are still okay" As a fellow hypochondriac, I really hope the best for you but always remember, even if it does happen, who cares. It won't define you, it's better not to worry and then get something than to worry your entire life over what ifs. When I was worrying about mine, I almost didn't care if the diagnosis was that I had cancer because I was so sick of worrying and being in the weird limbo stage. :) 




 Dude. I've had big lymph nodes in my neck for over 3 years. I'm also a hypochondriac and I'm pretty sure they originated in me constantly fiddling and worrying about it. I got scans and everything and it was nothing. You have no idea how powerful the mind is. Especially when you are a hypochondriac. Every time I worry about a disease I will look up the symptoms and then proceed to get every single one. And I'm not even kidding. I've had every symptom of every serious disease. My neck is riddled with lumps, I've had them all scanned and I'm fine. I appreciate the sentiment of your post and i think you are right, but I absolutely would not give up and assume you have cancer because you still probably don't if what happened to me is anything to go by.  




 Yeah I think he's part of a party who were following the boy and his dad throughout the book.  




 Make her lucky to know you 




 Think for yourself dawg!  




 Didn't the guy who shot at them with a bow and arrow take a flare to the face? Yeah I like that quote too.  




 The actual copy doesn't have quotation marks either. It's something I had to get used to and sometimes I found I got the characters speaking mixed up. If you can get passed that I recommend giving it another shot! 




 I can imagine. I'm young myself so I guess there's a whole new dimension to the book once you have kids. My only regret whilst reading it was that I didn't do it like you did and read it in much fewer sittings to get the full brunt of the bleakness in one go.  




 Thanks for the suggestion! I mean to. In most threads related to The Road I see people recommend Blood Meridian and No Country for Old Men so I want to read both of them. Although I might have a break and read something happy before delving into Blood Meridian.  




 Spoilers below.

So I just finished Cormac McCarthy's "The Road" and overall I'd have to say that I really enjoyed the book. I'd already seen the film which I absolutely loved but I don't think that took much if anything away from the book and I love both formats of the story. 

Some of my favorite quotes: 

"Go to sleep.
I wish I was with my mom.
He didn't answer. He sat beside the small figure wrapped in the quilts and blankets. After a while he said:
You mean you wish that you were dead.
Yes."

"We used to talk about death, she said. We don't anymore, why is that?
I don't know. 
It's because it's here. There's nothing left to talk about.
I wouldn't leave you.
I don't care, it's meaningless. You can think of me as a faithless slut if you like. I've taken a new lover. He can give me what you cannot. 
Death is not a lover.
Oh yes he is."

"Rich dreams now which he was loathe to wake from. Things no longer known in the world. The cold drove him forth to mend the fire. Memory of her crossing the lawn toward the house in the early morning in a thin rose gown that clung to her breasts. He thought each memory recalled must do some violence to its origins. As in a party game. Say the word and pass it on. So be sparing. What you alter in the remembering has yet a reality, known or not."

"In the yard was an old iron harrow propped up on piers of stacked brick and someone had wedged between the rails of it a forty gallon cast-iron cauldron of the kind used for rendering hogs. Underneath were the ashes of a fire and blackened billets of wood. Off to one side a small wagon with rubber tires. All these things he saw and did not see."

There are loads of more bits I love but I don't want to write all of them out :)

So I know some people complain about McCarthy's writing style and at the beginning of the book I felt inclined to agree. I found that the pacing and short paragraphs made it really hard to actually gain some momentum to read. So it took me a few days to get into it as I was only reading ten or so pages at a time at the beginning. But once I got more hooked into the characters and imagery it became a lot easier and I ended up really appreciating the short snippet paragraphs that the book is written in. I feel like it suits the style of the book. These characters are lost and confused living in a chaotic world therefore the writing style is similar, each paragraph isolated and separated from the rest with little continuity. I don't know if all of McCarthy's books are written this way but I felt for this book it really worked.  

I loved the way in which dialogue was written. The short phrases and sentences between the boy and the man. Although they are not actually saying a lot. It feels that each segment of dialogue is brimming with meaning. I also found the dialogue quite refreshing because I'm quite bad at understanding or painting an image when reading descriptions which there is a lot of in this book. 

I liked how short the book was. It felt concise and not needlessly long. Having just read the uncut version of "The Stand" it was nice reading a book that was way shorter but still as good none the less. Makes me realize that length isn't everything in books. 

Lastly, I loved the dark themes of the book. McCarthy doesn't really hold back on anything. He's a master at making you feel utter despair and hopelessness with the suicides, cannibalism and general shenanigans going on in post apocalyptic america. 

Anyways, I'd love to discuss more so if anyone has any opinions about what I've said or what they felt after reading the book please comment :)


 




 Are you exercising? Because Exercise regulates adrenaline and helps keep it consistently lower. If you find time in the day, go for a run or do anything for 20 mins. Then afterwards have a cold shower. Guarantee you'll feel better afterwards.  




 I'm sorry to hear that :( Must suck when you don't like a doctor or you get nervous around them.  




 That's actually a good idea. I feel like I can't just say everything as soon as they ask. Would need a few days to actually think and remember how I've felt and make a list so I don't miss anything out. I want the diagnosis to be as close as possible. Thanks for the advice :)
