 Unfortunately, he is the inexperienced one in our relationship...he is not taking advantage lol. 




 It isn't just about a threesome! It's about the whole situation, the threesome Was one example. Obviously I'm not asking for advice on how to say no to a threesome,.I'm asking how to maintain such a dominant relationship! p.s. please don't patronise me due to my age! 




 I want to make him happy without making myself unhappy...I don't want a threesome, and he does. I want a negotiable solution. 




 We've been together for 6 months, nearly 7 and he is the most dominant man I've ever met. I find this hard, because I'm extremely opinionated and won't back down without a debate...it causes issues to say the least.

 He likes to be dominant in the bedroom, which I'm fine with but now is slightly pushing too much at the idea of having a threesome. It's feeling a little to pressuring and I'm not sure what to do. How to I give him what he wants, without degrading myself or ruining the relationship. Also, how do I maintain a relationship with a guy who is obsessed with threesomes!!!



   
**tl;dr**: How do I make my guy see that I'm not going to back down to his every need? He is too dominant and I'm not submissive enough.  




 She only has a single bed, whereas I have a king size. Literally the only reason 




 I'm not lol! I'm Italian heritage... 




 I stay out every weekend at my boyfriends house, and whilst I do my sibling uses my bed as her shag pad...and then I sleep in the filth without knowing. 

What are your opinions on how to stop this, or how to make it known known that it is not ok!!!!! 
























 I always struggled with not being able to touch myself! It did get worse with a full bladder, and also if I read anything or watched anything was sexual content. The ache would be there, unless I completely forgot about it by doing something else. I'd take photos of myself to please my OH and make him aroused. 

Also, cumming without touching is a very tricky skill that needs to mastered!

Good luck! 




 Elastic bands tied around the nipple for a short time, careful not to leave on for too long due to blood circulation.

Nipple suckers, try getting some suction cups and then play with them when suctioned, should be ultra sensitive. 

or if you are my adventurous, buy a milking machine and have your partner milk them! ;)  




 My partner (23 M) and I (18 F) have been together for 6 months, I am experienced with BDSM and have been for a long time, unfortunately the bdsm I experienced was mixed with abuse and so this does cause problems with kinks..My partner would like to experience things such as threesomes and having someone watch us, however I have bad experience with both of these and so am not so into trying them again. I feel by saying no, I am taking away his kink and I feel guilty for doing so. Does anyone have any advice for overcoming fears caused by bad experiences?

Thanks.  




 If you have nothing nice to say, please leave! I think the set looked lovely.  




 I didn't think there were many VS shops in UK either! 




 UK ladies, where do you buy your lingerie from? 




 Thank you, finally someone realises what I'm asking lol. :) 
























 I enter this often, and sometimes even become completely unresponsive and my partner often stops in a panic and checks I'm still ok to continue. We have safe words, and hand gestures for when I am gagged, but never feel I have to use them...but it's always best to have one just in case.  




 Well, best of luck...maybe steer clear of those conversations or just sit in and see others reactions and responses. 




 I have been doing this for a while, and started on FL. I have only bean to one munch, and realised it was not for me. I find people at munches to be a little too sociable than me and it did make me nervous. I stuck to meeting people one on one, because it was less overwhelming and I didn't feel under huge pressure. I'd say to just go to a couple, see how you feel and decide after that. A good London one to start with would be U35 weekend drinkies, or perhaps Camden crunch as they are pretty sociable and less shocking lol. 

Don't worry about not being sexually experienced, most guys and girls there are newbies looking for a bit of advice and help on the scene. However don't feel you need to become a social butterfly, just because people on this site are. Do your own thing!

Watch out for safety on FL though, such a photos with your face in (if you are concerned about your career) and also, be wary of the usual posers and fakes! Always send out and ask for a personal photo perhaps with a sign with their username by their face or something. 

Good luck!:) 




 Lines, sexual deprivation, sleep deprivation, canings, tickles :( :( 




 Taking a break is good, but also staying around friends on FL is good. Choice is yours, maybe take some 'me time' 




 You're very welcome...good luck! 




 Picture things in your mind, usually his voice is enough to set me off! Um, but mostly just really daydreaming about it! 
























 I cover my teeth with my lips, and I like to flick my tongue against the head whilst he fucks my mouth. I usually grab his bum, or play with his balls as well. 

Focus on his enjoyment more than focusing on whether you'll hurt him. If you do accidentally nip him, it won't be a complete turn off...just continue going with a little more care but don't let it put you off!  




 Ours is "watermelon"....something I'd never say randomly aloud. For slow down, we use y"yellow" however I rarely use these, and have never had to use my Safeword. 

The only time we don't use a word is if I'm gagged, we then use the key method...he puts a set of keys in my hand or my teddy paw to hold and I'll drop it if I need to stop playing.  




 Well done! That's great news :) 




 I say "you're very welcome" and it takes the sarcastic twinge off of the end, however I do sometimes Say "no worries!" Because it seems a bit more friendly :) 




 Buy some new lingerie, or something new to make me feel more feminine. Send some pictures to my OH and he makes me feel so much sexier. 

Doing my nails, or trying a new make up skill makes me feel better too   




 I'm in the same situation, I am sick of the day to day routine. Mine usually is wake up at 7:30, start work and then finish at 3ish. Then eat, bath, sleep. The only way I enjoy my days are if I'm distracted from the reality. I spend all week wishing it was the weekend, and I absolutely hate hate hate my life routine right now. In the past few months, I have been diagnosed with severe depression, and I suspect in the next week I will be diagnosed with borderline personality disorder which explains my lack of enthusiasm these days. Some days I want to just stay in bed!

The beat way to deal with it for me, was to have things to look forward too! Spending time with my boyfriend, buying a new book to read which would distract me for a while, even buying my favourite foods helped me. Don't sit around alone, and try not to think too much about why you are the way you are. Do things you enjoy, and when you feel down, go and spend time with your family, play music or even go for a walk with some music in your earphones. 

Good luck, and PM if you need any more help :) 




 Some people realise what they are when they are even younger, but may not know what the correct term is. For example, I knew I was submissive when I was younger, and most of my older partners had also known they were Dominant when they were around 16/17...It's just a feeling. 

It's similar to when a female child feels she is in the wrong body, and has the wrong gender...she knows that from a young age and although BDSM isn't as extreme as that, it still is very similar. I knew I was submissive because I naturally enjoyed having no power in the bedroom, and I hated taking lead...I prefer to be a follower :) 

  
























 Your reply was pointless.... 




 Is it that strange to want to talk about a future? Plenty of people so nowadays... 




 OH is other half...but thanks anyway  




 Make myself less depressed, and a lot more happy.  




 Yes, I like to know everything before I get myself into a deep, serious relationship. I'm not too bothered about announcing it to people, but I'd like myself and my partner to know where we are heading and if it is the right direction.  




 We've been together for longer than 3 months :) I understand how that may be annoying! 




 Other half...sorry will make it clearer 
























 Thanks so much, sorry I forgot to mention that I go to weekly therapy, and I am on my third different batch of anti depressants so already a step ahead ;) 

Thank you so much :)  




 Hi all. 

I've recently been diagnosed with depression, and am hoping to be diagnosed with borderline personality disorder which will make my condition easier to treat, and understand. However, in the process of weekly therapy, anti depressants and doctor appointments, I have lost my sex drive. I have gone from masturbating daily, to only doing it once a week or not even that. I feel I need to wear sexy lingerie to feel good about my body, and my partner constantly reassures me. 

Unfortunately, my diagnosis came around when I was a young teen after being sexually, physically and mentally abused and sometimes this effects our sex life but we have this part under control. However my partner doesn't want to feel like he's forcing me to have sex with him, although he isn't, and so sometimes he goes without sex. 

I just want some help on how to recover the drive, and spice things up a bit. Please keep in mind that this a serious post, and I'd appreciate if this was kept serious too.   




 In the shower, in my/his bed, we once tried on a wall outside his room but that was an epic fail. Lots of car sex too. 




 Truffles 




 Do you hate me for letting the vet cut off your balls? 




 I have recently been diagnosed with depression, and prescribed anti depressants. In the next weeks, myself and my SO are hoping I will finally be diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, as it with really help us understand every thing better. 

In the meantime, I no longer initiate sex or anything sexual. I wear lingerie, purely because it makes me feel sexy and I find it hard to orgasm by myself. My sex drive has dropped from 100 to 30 in the space of a few months, and it is horrid for my.partner and I. 

Any suggestions on how to get back the drive, or even advice on how to spice things up a bit.  




 I cry a lot when pleasure is too much, for example when my SO pounds into me, I cry as it is too much pleasure. I cry during spankings, canings and sometimes just cry because the adrenaline has passed my body and emotions overwhelm me. Crying is my way of releasing, if I don't cry then I'm not being pushed enough. 

I've met people who giggle, or full blown laugh through scenes, not because they are ticklish but because they don't know what else to do!  
























 I quite like chest hair, and the snail trail under the belly button but cannot stand a hairy back! 




 I cam from time to time, and it shocks me how if you aren't attractive enough, then nobody will pay to watch you no matter how horny or willing you are. Personally I get quite a lot of attention whilst on the site, but I still get the odd men who click on and off without so much as a 'sorry, but you're not it for me' and it makes me think men are so much more shallow that I originally thought. Also it seems that once they've had their fun, they leave without so much as a thanks, bye. It's quite upsetting! 




 Thank you :)  




 Usually me just overreacting and being dramatic. Never about anything serious.  




 I've been depressed for a very long time, and I've been with my boyfriend for quite a while now. It's been a a tough time, I won't deny that, it has not been easy and we often argue. Very recently, it's been amazing but last night I spent a few hours laying awake whilst he was dead to the world, and just looked at him and my mind was rattling on about how he should be with someone stable, someone he doesn't have to look after and deal with all the drama. I am actually worrying about whether I should let me go and be with someone 'normal'. I feel like I'm holding him back, and I know I need him, and am completely head over heels for him. I do try hard, but I don't know how much longer I can fool myself with thinking he's actually happy with someone like me. 

I don't know what to do :(  




 I have a very balanced diet, but there is always room for more fruit and veg!:) 

Thanks :)  




 Tell him what you want and want to try, maybe create a checklist of things you'd both enjoy or would enjoy trying and then a list of things that are a complete no no. I usually rate the activity out of 5 when doing checklists so then my SO knows what I enjoy more and what to do regularly. 

I introduced my vanilla boyfriend to this lifestyle by showing him what I liked, showing him techniques and giving him a pain rating every time he hit me. Also, I'd you have an abusive past that he knows about, that could be why he is hesitant...reassure him that it is consensual and you would tell him if boundaries were crossed. 

Initiate things such as put your hair in his hand, lay across his lap in the spanking position, kneel at the door when he comes into your bedroom...

Good luck :) x 
























 I'm very petite, and weigh next to nothing. I don't need to lose weight, and he doesn't have a condition. We've checked...So please don't be rude.  




 My boyfriend has claimed he has a low sex drive recently, which is so strange for me because this has never been the case. He's always constantly wanting sex, and now he doesn't. I have tried laying around naked, wearing nice lingerie and he just doesn't stop to look. I find myself drooling over him when he walks around naked, yet he never stops to tell me I look good, or anything. I'm not very confident about my body as it is, so I am trying and I just feel ignored. Him having a low sex drive just makes me feel disgusting and extremely insecure. So how do I make.myself feel more.sexy when he isn't interested? 

UPDATE: I am not overweight or underweight, he claims he is still attracted to me, and I'm not going to get rid of my long term.boyfriend over something that could be fixed...thanks.. 




 Thanks all :)  




 Thanks!:) 




 Hi!

I'm a very anxious, and paranoid female and have been diagnosed with depression. I am taking anti depressants but I still find it hard to be wind down and relax.

Please let me know of any good methods and ideas you use/have. 

Thanks :)  




 I've had a very low time, and I'm becoming fearful about how much longer I can live like this. Nobody around me cares about me, aside from my boyfriend but there is only so much he can do. We can't even be together during the week, and its the Times I need him. I'm not dealing so well at work, and my family do not give a shit about me. I really am struggling, and nobody seems to want to help me. 

I don't know what to do anymore.  




 If he's a sex god, then yes. 100%. 
























 Your vagina is very compact - my gyno 




 I've drowned myself in a bottle of wine tonight. I feel so alone, i just want to get away from everyone and everything. I can't help myself anymore.  




 Thanks x 




 Hi all, I have just purchased some John Frieda volumising shampoo and conditioner and some hair mousse. I have only tried it a few times, and had not much change so was wondering if anyone had any ideas onto a to create more volume in hair. My hair is bum length, red/Brown and never coloured before, it's quite dull and flat too. 

Thanks :)  




 Thanks everyone. You've all really helped :) 




 Thanks so much xx 




 Thank you :)  
























 Touche!! 




 For once I would like someone to take care of me, to tuck me in and wake me up with breakfast. 
For once I'd like someone to miss me when I'm not there, and think about me when I'm not around. 
For once I'd like to be spoilt, like I should have been when I was a child, spoiled with cuddles, kisses, cuddly toys, wine and anything else!
For once I'd like to stop pleasing other people and have someone just impress me. Take care of me. Love me. 

I'm fed up of taking care of everyone else and not getting it back. Right now I deserve to be looked after. I hate being depressed.  




 It was a very fun night!  














 I'm struggling to keep it together, I cannot deal with any pressure right now. Things have been great for me recently but I just can't do it anymore. :(  




 What do you mean?  




 I've been depressed for 8 months (diagnosed) and around 4 years undiagnosed. I'm a female, and I work full time. I Still live at home, and I hate my life. I come home after work just to be a slave to my parents. Doing all the things they should do but don't bother. My parents and siblings constantly berate me and tell me I'm not depressed. They refuse to understand why I may be upset, why I take strong anti depressants. My mum refuses to come to the doctors with me so the doctor can explain it. I break down weekly to my therapist about it. I find it exhausting to continuously come home and be asked to wash up, dry clothes, clean up, vacuum. It's frustrating, and physically tiring. 

Eurgh. Help.  




 Well hope things improve! :) 




 Harley Fae after a book series called Possess. it sounds so magical :) 




 Oh :( the gym is good! I do that too, therapeutic. 

Numb isn't the nicest feeling, but I'd rather that then be close to psychotic. I don't enjoy being emotionally unstable.  




 I've suffered with depression for a long while, and the worst.thing my SO could ever say is that I'm an attention seeker. He has made the mistake a few times and it breaks my heart as he doesn't realise how it affects me.  




 Appreciative and caring. Nothing beats that.  




 I've been on anti depressants for 6 months and I've tried so many different ones like sertraline, citrolopram and another th at I can't quite remember. I work best with citolopram. I do find sometimes I feel numb, but it doesn't make you happy. It just balances out your moods! You can still be happy and take them, it really just balances the serotonin in your brain to make it better balanced. Maybe see a therapist or a councillor whilst taking the tablets. There's no harm in trying them, and stopping if you feel wrong. 

Best of luck.  




 Think positive, and perhaps if you feel yourself getting irritated, take yourself away from the situation and calm down.. take a breather. I get really moody, but people around me know my situation so know I can't really help it. Good luck x
