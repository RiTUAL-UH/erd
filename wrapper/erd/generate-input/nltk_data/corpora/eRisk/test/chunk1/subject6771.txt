 i saw an article the other day but i thought it was a hoax but today RebelScum.com has another article confirming the find from another reader. I'm still on the fence about the validity of these findings. Have cancelled figures complete w/ cardbacks ever made it the sales floor before? And they're selling them at 20$ a pop. 


 Following our earlier story, Brendan sent in detailed [images](http://www.rebelscum.com/2015/Found-In-The-Wild.jpg) of the Legacy Collection Droid Factory figures he found at retail. Looking at the date stamp on the card backs, these figures were produced on October 10th, 2012. They were found for $19.99 each at a Go! Calendars outlet in Pooler, GA, which is promising for everyone in the U.S. interested in finding these figures since it is a nationwide chain.

 taking the rebel flag down is a good thing but ultimately ineffective b/c it's not going to fix gun control but it does give ppl a tangible outlet for them to focus their energy into and that's a pretty good distraction. 

 




 special treatment? http://i.imgur.com/iIOJ0X7.jpg

this dude shot 16 ppl. not trying to compare bad apples to bad apples but i don't think there is any special treatment going on. just look at all that white privilege.

if they did have have anything in common it's that they were both obnoxious baby-faced racist sociopaths who liked killing.

 to be completely fair, it was an accident.

yah i see your side of it. 




 Thank you pashaMad for your submission! Unfortunately, your post has been removed for the following reason(s):

***It breaks rule 1:*** **Use the correct title formatting.** Titles should be to the point, and all extra information or context should be added in the comments. 

Here is how you should format it - 

Your artwork - "Title, Medium, Size" 


Also remember no extraneous information in the title means do not state that it's your first time using a medium in the title, or write 'Hey Reddit', 'What do you think?'

 it wasn't a matter of the post getting removed. i could care less about that. it was his wording and bluesmoke's comments the other day that leave me thinking theyre attacking me.  




 am i not a user too? whats the deal with the new mods having a hard-on for me? 

  There's no excuse for you to have missed it.

accidents happen, things get overlooked. i did scroll the front page but i didn't see it. 

edit: i love a good cutaway, you can't fault me for that

double edit: i remove reposts all the time in /r/art. but i don't get bent out of shape about it.

 i'm wondering if they repair the broken section and kinda of force it back into place like a bicycle chain. seems highly unlikely tho w/o a make-shift crane to lift the chassis up.

 while researching your pic i found this: https://www.reddit.com/r/AbandonedPorn/comments/3bf5o5/japanese_machine_gunners_nest_on_iwo_jima_that/ 




 A heavy machine gun, possibly a Japanese Type 92 Heavy Machine Gun, lies abandoned in a bunker overlooking the landing beaches. There are still dozens of these bunkers all over the island. Most of them were destroyed during the battle. This pillbox still bore the scars of the fighting. It was pockmarked with bullet holes and the inside was blackened. I imagine a flame thrower was used to clear that pillbox.

 she painted this on a canvas. no computer programs.  




 hands 









 so long and thanks for all the fish... 




 source is nsfw: http://www.anna-art.com/paintings/anna_razumovskaya/figurative/12288.html 









 

Anna magically captures classic romanticism of renaissance portraiture, figurative forms while creating art that is completely modern and original. Anna is inspired by the graceful elegance of the female form, at turns, classically alluring, demure and provocative. 

Some words from the artist: 

  "My art is a reflection of my life, a reflection of myself...
"...If an artist were asked what he was thinking of while creating his work, he would hardly give a reasonable answer to that question. This process can not be analyzed. It is like a miracle. "

More about this particular piece: 

 She stands before us, half-exposed and half-mystery. We chase her for evermore inspiration but never exhaust her complex character. She continues to surprise us through her eclectic taste and individuality. Her wild arrangement of fabrics stands as evidence of her raw character.

source is nsfw: http://www.anna-art.com/paintings/anna_razumovskaya/figurative/12288.html but i highly recommend them if you like this piece.

 i've always enjoyed [this PS](http://i.imgur.com/5FmnxrU.jpg) of him. 




 under US law; farmers can still use a small amount of chemicals on their crops and still call them "organic". Truth. 

no such thing as natural b/c the FDA allows company's to take advantage and embellish what *is* really natural. Hydrogenated Oil's are not natural. But you'll often find them in food products labeled to dupe the consumer while still offering a product at a responsible cost to the consumer but also maximizes company profits *b/c they use cheap ingredients*.   




 only the devil could survive two heart-attacks and still be alive. 




  Still doubt it, our military is pretty much the best. 

that's a pretty good reason, why we're going broke.

 Gouqi Island belongs to a group of nearly 400 islands known as Shengsi Islands, and form a part of the Zhoushan Archipelago, located outside of Hangzhou Bay. It is the largest archipelago of China. Traditionally Zhoushan had relied heavily on its primary industry, which is fishing, given Zhoushan is the largest fishery in China. Nowadays with the development of the secondary and tertiary industries, Zhoushan's economic base has been largely diversified. Ship building and repairing, shipping, light industry, tourism and service industry grow to be the major contributors of local economic output. Consequently, many fishing villages have today become abandoned. Some of the best preserved villages are located in Gouqi Island.

The Shengsi Islands are a popular tourist destination and is still an important fishery area that attracts more than 100,000 fishermen every winter.

 are you looking forward to hitting puberty?  




 i'm sure that would mean alot to her especially coming from such a prolific and creative artist such as yourself.  




 you look like Spike Lee's retarded, less successful bother.  




 so how many of your ex boyfriends have you killed so far?  




 your forehead is so big, i could play the game of Risk on it. 




 is this mf a girl or a guy?  




 I can't tell if he's Italian or black?

Cant. Understand. Normal. Thinking. 




 b-l-o-w-j-o-b 




 lol keep telling yourself that!  




  It is a relief. Her own mother commented that she didn't know how I put up with her bitchiness. 

birds of a feather tho??? 




 this is exactly what i think of when i see in the news that an old man killed his wife of so many years. I guess they just finally snap from all the verbal abuse.  




 You just need to add the "Size" of the piece in title. You can't edit your submission title so you'll need to resubmit. Let me know if you have any more questions.

Some words from the artist regarding this piece:

Rusaka is a slavic female demon usually appearing around lakes, ponds or rivers. She deceives men and drowns them. I wanted to show her as a dead corpse that uses a charm, so that she looks like a pretty woman when out of the water.

I've had some voices wondering about the swastikas on the rims of the guys shirt. So to make it clear. I have no connotations with any extreme right wing parties nor do I keep any nazi or racist oriented beliefs. Swastika has been used for hundreds of years in Poland, before Hitler stole it and spoilt it for everyone. The action of the image takes place in 9th or 10th century. If you want to know more about swastikas just wiki it. There is a really broad and interesting article written about it.

 i used all 300 characters. can anyone tell? 

 Torre Abraham Lincoln, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Construction on the two circular 36-story towers remains empty and unfinished since construction was halted in 1974. Conceived as the centrepiece of Lucio Costas modernist plan for the region, the Torre Abraham Lincoln buildings were intended to be the first in a series of 76 individual towers. The plan was eventually abandoned due to poor material choices and the inability to secure enough of the projects land due to private ownership. 

more additional pics and history of the failed project: http://paraisoocupado.com/?paged=2

note, there are two of these that stand side by [side](http://img.weburbanist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/abandoned-skyscrapers-torre-barra-rio.jpg)

i feel like these top mods forgot that these subs are not even our's/their's to begin with and we're all just guest here. Disappointing top mods (who we rely on to be rational individuals) would make such a hasty, irrational response to close their subs. 

the actions of the top mods that closed their subs are *not* the path of a jedi.

***It breaks rule 1:*** **Use the correct title formatting.** Titles should be to the point, and all extra information or context should be added in the comments. 

Here is how you should format it - 

Another artist's work - "Title, Artist, Medium, Year" 


Also remember no extraneous information in the title means do not state that it's your first time using a medium in the title, or write 'Hey Reddit', 'What do you think?' 'A ____ I did' or any variation or be subjective in the title ("awesome work," "amazing piece" etc). Also do not mention your 'cake day' or use karma-bait titles.

 Thank you for your submission! Unfortunately, it has been removed for the following reason(s):

* It does not include significant context in the title, such as the artist's real name (not their pseudonym). The name you are looking for is "Kevin Lee Broberg".



Feel free to resubmit the image with proper context. If you have any questions, please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FImaginaryFutureWar). We apologize for the inconvenience. 




 no, i still consider it art but there is a better place for it. We exclude fat art because they would eventually take over the sub. /r/alternativeart would like this. 




 Ahhhhh. Good call and good job  




 it's prolly the trans-fat and saturated fats that make it taste so good. you'll never be able to replicate that unless your a chemist.

 omg. i can feel the sarcasm coming through your words. that's a really unhealthy pie.  




 you don't have to explain yourself :) i'm the same way. I'm sure you've already read the ingredient listing on the back? Sometimes i write to these companies via email and act concerned about allergy info. you could always try that.

 we have "rotating" banners. click your refresh to view others in random. 




 it's actually kinda coincidental you posted this and then we implemented new banners a day ago. when i've had them done for over two weeks now. 

i think it looks great as a banner dont you think? 


edit: we're always looking for new mods that want to contribute to the network on a regular basis. ;) 




 Yes! Mos def thank you very much for the plug. We're very gracious.  




 my apologies. i thought we were talking about /r/imaginarymindscapes. i was confused.  




 *uggggggghhhhh.* i'm sorry. 

 




 no, i didn't draw this. and you've commented on plenty of my submissions to know that i'm just another ordinary user on reddit like everyone else. but i am interested in knowing how you feel about the sub.

unlike some other stuff I could link.


could you elaborate and explore this statement for me? I'm very interested in hearing your thoughts.


do you feel like the sub has changed since it's initial offering?  




 /r/disappointedboners??? 




 prolly from one of the links i posted :P 

another hidden gem sub, if you ask me.

 The bust of the late Philippine strongman Ferdinand Marcos lies badly defaced Monday, Dec. 30, 2002 at Mt. Pugo, La Union province in northern Philippines, a day after it was ripped in a powerful explosion shortly after midnight Sunday. The explosion ripped off the eyes, nose, ears and most of the upper part of the bust but did not topple it from the top of a cliff overlooking the South China Sea, where it was erected in the 1970s, allegedly to immortalize the strongman who was toppled in a near bloodless "People Power" revolution in 1986.

 automatically saying it was a Muslim/Arab is very racist. this sub and most of reddit is very progressive. 


self-education will allow you to break the chains of stereotyping ppl. 




 come'on dude. it's common knowledge that American's since 9/11 have committed more acts of terrorisism against other americans than Muslims ever have.

 another failed building project from Brazil. Abandoned in the 1970's. As though it was miraculously transported from a more urban area, the abandoned Viaduct Petrobras rises out of the lush South American jungle, a testament to mismanaged government spending.

Construction on the Rio-Santos Highway began in the 1960s and by 1976 the stretch of road was due to be linked to the existing highway. However, the plans were altered at the last minute so that the existing road was linked to a coastal route and the newly constructed, but never used viaduct was simply abandoned. Over 40 meters tall and 300 meters long, the elevated roadway features tunnels, retaining walls, and a massive concrete foundation all being slowly taken over by the surrounding greenery. 

While the abandoned civic project seemed wasteful at the time, it is now a popular tourist attraction for travelers looking to do some rappelling and bungee jumping. The abandoned Viaduct Petrobras can be accessed from the Salesopolis Caragua neighborhood in Porto Novo via a thin country road, but the structure must be approached on foot or motorbike for the final stretch.

 ahhh. another trustworthy individual to work the mod quene ;) welcome. 




 i'm sorry about that. it tells me the same when posting to 2 different subs that i've never submitted to before and I've almost been here for 4 years ;_; 




 no way to edit the title. You'll have to resubmit.  




 I highly recommend Brotherhood of Shadow: Solomon's Revenge mod too. It's only for the PC tho. and there are some other good ones.  




 try pasting in this: http://tylercreatesworlds.deviantart.com/art/A-Kings-Demise-329384788 




 this links to an album instead of a specific piece of work. did you mean to do that, OP?  




 It might very well be 




  commercial landlord

what properties do you manage or own? 


 bitch and moan- GO. STAY AWAY. Stop breathing my air.


what a fucking dick. you should respect the opinions of others. 


 What I do hate about our system are those fucking machines. Having to stoop down to use an awful UI that takes minutes instead of seconds. And then having to go BACK and put the slip on the dash. 


tells us not to bitch.....then goes on to bitch. yah okay buddy.

 Please be nice to your fellow redditors. It's a must to continue to participate here.  




 Hit the "Report" button so we as moderators can address the issue appropriately. thank you.  




 i don't think it's HDR. it's some god awful filter tho and really takes away from the natural beauty.  




 floaty island thingys, def why this sub was created.  




 I *could* fix it if only I could get it apart. :( 




  I'm not sure what you're doing here, but it looks a lot like self-promotion. Also, all the art I see is fan art, which we

**Spam Warning issued.**  




 did we? how long ago did this take place?? i went back through the mod logs and couldn't find anything.

 def not a combative thing to ask but you've been on the defensive since you showed up to "pile on". **it's fine.** **it's okay.** there are other subs on reddit that i can post this to (and I have already) and def other places on the internet. reddit is not the *friendly* bastion it wants to perpetuate to the masses. 


god forbid, moderators actually do their job of moderating and *actually moderate.* so what if you had to remove some ugly comments. Guess what: You. just. did. your. job. instead of coming on the scene in the defensive manner as in you did. I'm not even a freaking troll but you treat me as if I'm a cancer upon your fine subreddit. Don't worry I'm not even fighting the removal at this point meaning you do not have to comment back b/c I'm done with this. the other mod did great, you did not. suggesting that i only shared the question to start drama is why i'm mad. and if you could think of another way of stating it in a less combative wording then why didn't you do so already.  




 or does this exist in other 1st world countries? In 2nd and 3rd world countries the families live together for their entire lives. Why is American culture different or I am wrong??  




 or does this exist in other 1st world countries? In 2nd and 3rd world countries the families live together for their entire lives. Why is American culture different or I am wrong?? I want to post it b/c I know from exp. that "we" americans share these same communities with many other english speaking nations and the diversity of the question is absolutely required for an acute answer to my question.  




 removed for that god awful title and for fanning the flames.   




 it's really an honest question b/c my wife and I have always said our kids can live with us their entire lives.  




 i....i...didn't mean to cause any drama. I'm not very active in this sub so forgive me it this question in the way you explained it "would cause drama". In no way was that my intention. i've lived in the south-east of America most of my life so I'm a little self-removed from other cultures.  




  Since you've already said that you were a parent (and it's visible in your wall)

wait.... where??? i'll go and delete it right now if that's the case. my apologies for my super heightened sense of paranoia.  




  You just need to update your post to say that you are a parent


that was teeth gritting. like i said, "i don't want the average redditor to know the personal details of my life". i don't think i'll choose to participate. "we" as moderators sometimes are caught in between a hard place and a rock when upholding the rules of the subs we govern and i understand this and this is just one of those very rare times. thank you for your time and have a good weekend.  




 hello i am. i just don't shout it to the heavens like most parents and b/c i do not want just the average redditor know my personal life. can i pm or send a mod mail pic verifying who I say I am?? I'm a mod for many subreddits and this is mainly the reason i do not want the average redditor to know my personal life. it's truly a sincere question. 


please let me know what i can do to fix this b/c i adamantly wanted an answer :)  









 Your probably right but I'm still trying to gage the community. I had a vision that this sub would cater to "all" art and not be fractured like many other subs on reddit. A place that welcomes all art.  




 don't forget that /r/ImaginaryJedi exists. and exclusively caters to fan art all day long.  




 i need some help getting apart my 3.75 scale talking r2-dr from EP 3. it is seriously glued and constructed too well for me to work on. I could solder or replace and bad connections, problem is I can't get it apart :(  




 god, i hope not. this is same user that collects downvotes and harasses other users occasionally b/c he get's pissed about some fucking lego art or something trivial of that nature. if he doesn't like the direction of the sub then i highly recommend him going and creating his own sub. in my exp. you don't run off good submitters/contributers. good submitters are a mod's wet dream come true. /u/jsk23 plez read over this.
