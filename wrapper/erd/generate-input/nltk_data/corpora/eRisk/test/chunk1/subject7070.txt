 I'm a keen climber. Indoors, specifically - I like ropes and crash mats. You cannot undo millions of years evolution by not being afraid of falling. When you are clinging on by your fingertips, your heart is racing to pump blood in to your forearms and core muscles, but also in anticipation of a slip. Unbeknownst to your mind, your body is preparing for trauma. Your hands sweat, your breathing becomes short and sharp, and your calves seize up as you stretch for the next hold. It's exhilarating. When you reach the final hold - usually a jug, allowing you some comfort and the ability to grasp with both hands - you plant your feet flat against the wall, breathe a huge sigh of relief, lean back and let go. The rope is taut, and you abseil down to your partner.

My climbing partner, Mathew, got me in to climbing 3 years ago. I needed a hobby to throw myself into after my partner committed suicide. We try to climb at least twice a week, and every year we fly out to a different location around Europe to try out different climbing centres. There are some sensational places, but I've never been comfortable climbing outdoors. The wind and elements, the loose rocks, the protruding faces... they all make me nervous, which leads to me seizing up on the wall and retreating down a broken man.


Climbing is a social activity, and during a typical 3 hour session there is plenty of rest time to talk with your partner. Mathew is a fellow redditor, and oftentimes we talk about what we had seen recently on the website. Three weeks ago he mentioned an Askreddit thread that asked for posts detailing what odd event or occurrence defines your town or city, i.e. what is the strangest thing that has ever happened there.


"It has to be the spate of suicides," he declared, "wasn't there like 12 people who killed themselves over a few months?"


Now, it is important to establish the facts here. Our hometown is just that - a town. Not a city. Its population is about 50,000. The series of suicides that Mathew was struggling to recollect the exact numbers of began about 13 years ago. The Wikipedia entry states 'as of February 2007, there have been seventy-nine known deaths since January 2002... [and] of 25 people who killed themselves between January 2002 and February 2004, all but one died from hanging'. The victims were as young as 13 years old.


Mathew's suggestion was sound - 79 suicides over 5 years for such a small populace is very peculiar, and indeed it dominated the news at the time.


However, I knew something that Mathew did not know. That number was originally 80.


A boy named James Craddock, commonly known as Jimmy Craddock, was found hung in the woods near my house. This was 2004, when I was 15. The local kids started calling the area where he was found 'Craddock's Paddock'. The name didn't make much sense, but kids often never do. I remember the story as it was told at the time - that he was found by a dog-walker one morning, hung by a makeshift ropeswing. Jimmy was 13. I knew the woods well, having played in it since I was old enough to leave the street with friends. I knew the tree that Jimmy was hung from - a classic British oak tree. It was well-known, trademarked by the nostril-like bark at its base and its position on the edge of a small clearing. It had a thick trunk, and had no branches low enough for easy climbing. It was often seen as the main tree of the wood, based solely on its popularity as a hangout spot for youths. Jimmy was found on its lowest primary branch, that stretched out in to the clearing.


Stories often embellish themselves when they travel around adolescents, and talks of murder and the supernatural were thrown around like classic horror stories. I guess the woodland setting and childlike imagination make for interesting tales, particularly with a real-life victim to add realism.


What made Jimmy's story so different, though, was his removal from the record of suicides. I could not recall why it happened at the time, but my curiosity piqued enough for me to look in to it in a bit more detail. If the verdict was not suicide, then was there a murder case?


Unfortunately media coverage was stopped by the police 'in an attempt to prevent copy-cats', so as online news and archiving started taking off, the coverage ceased.


However, on the weekend just passed I was back in my hometown visiting my parents, and had a free morning and afternoon. I was in the town centre, which should have been busier. Numerous regeneration projects have so far failed to inspire a resurgence in the town's fortunes, and respectable shops have vacated and have been replaced by poundshops and betting premises. To my surprise though, the town's library was open. I had thought that the cuts to public services would have been the library's end, but my guess is that either the council or the local government is fronting the cost. I had only ever been in the library once in my life, and I wondered how much it had changed.


I entered, and the drab interior did not suit the impressive stonework of the building. I guess I should not have expected much. There was a bank of computers on one side, a kids' corner, a few aisles of wooden shelves, and a librarian who could have reasonably been working there for 40 years. What caught my eye, though, was a sign above the photocopier - 'Please note that newspaper archives are to be viewed for no longer than one hour at a time'.


"Which newspapers do you have archives of?" I asked the librarian.

"Oh, not many. There's The Gazette, The Recorder and the Echo, and maybe a few others," she replied, "Why? Is there something you're after?"

"Well," I responded, "I was on the front cover of one of the newspapers when I was in school. I was wondering if you may have it. I think it was in The Recorder."


The Recorder was a circular for the town itself and had no distribution in any other areas. If there was to be some small story about Jimmy Craddock, then it would surely be in there.


I felt guilty asking the librarian to fetch a few stacks of newspapers, but I convinced her of my mother's wish to have a scanned image of me winning the local maths challenge.


It did not take me long to find the story I was after.


*January 3-9 2004.*

*The town's recent trend of suicides continues with a boy, 13, found hung by a rope in Cariad wood.*

*The boy was found by local resident, Martyn Smith, who was walking his dog in the early hours of Saturday morning.*

*Upon finding the boy, Mr Smith called for help and received it from Linda Evans, whose back garden backs on to the wood. Mrs Evans of Somerset Lane was tending to her washing when she heard Mr Smith's cries.*

*When interviewed by The Recorder, Mrs Evans said "I just heard a man yelling for help, and well, instinct took over and I dropped my washing and went to the back fence. He said he had found a hanging body and needed to call the police. I ran inside and called the police straight away and they arrived shortly after."*

*"It's horrific" she added, "apparently the boy had cuts and bruises on him, too."*

*Following the interview, The Recorder sought a statement from the police at the scene of the crime. The police declined to comment, but at that moment there was a commotion as the forensics team seemed to have found a knife nearby.*

*The Recorder has requested a statement from the police to this regard.*


"Cuts and bruises"; "a knife". Yearning for more information, I searched the other newspapers, and found no stories. I picked up the next week's The Recorder.


*January 10-16 2004*

*The Recorder would like to apologise to the Craddock family for misrepresenting a story. Despite our best journalistic intentions, we appreciate the tone set by the article may have been misleading. We would like to go on record saying that without a statement from the police, no conclusions can be drawn about the death of their son, whom it can now be confirmed is identified as James Craddock, a pupil at the nearby St. Anne's High School. We would like to extend our condolences to the family.*


That was all that was written. In all of the newspapers, just a discovery of a cut and bruised body hanging by a tree in Cariad wood, a knife being nearby, a subsequent apology for the speculation.


I looked back at the stories I had heard when I was younger, about it being a murder. I remember going around the area with my friends thinking that we would find a murder weapon. It never crossed my mind that they may have found one already. But if it was a murder, why would the murderer choose to hang the body? Wouldn't there be fingerprints on the weapon? DNA evidence?


After scanning the newspaper entries, I sat down at one of the library computers. In the UK, we can publicly access most criminal court case records. I searched their database for the case and found nothing, so either the case was held in secret, which is used only in rare circumstances, or there simply was no criminal proceeding.


I felt lost. When you invest so much thought in to a case and cannot conclude it, you try to force ends to meet. Maybe he did commit suicide but there was not enough evidence to suggest he had? Maybe he was murdered but it was ruled as suicide then later removed from records? Frustrated, I left the library.


I had some more time spare before my evening's commitments. I decided to visit the wood.


The wood has changed a great deal in the past 10 years. What was a mud path before is now a cleared walkway; what was a felled log over a stream is now a wooden bridge; what was a wiry garden fence is now a brick wall. Still, the air felt familiar and I noticed a few old checkpoints. The wood felt smaller, but more open. It felt like a very large back garden rather than a deep forest. I imagined coming across Craddock's Paddock and it being a scene of cinematic excellence, but instead as I noticed it from a distance, still to the edge of a clearing, it seemed mundane. Its nostril-like base was smaller than I remember, and its old imperious position as the head tree of the wood seemed nonsensical.


Placing my hand against its bark, I anticipated a connection - a connection to the past, to my childhood self, to Jimmy Craddock and his fateful day when he ceased to be. Instead, I just felt a cold, rough bark. I'm not sure why I did, but I gripped on to the bark as best I could, testing the tension in my fingers. Before I realised it, my right foot was elevating itself up on to the tree's base. The branches were out of reach, so I pinched in to the bark, pointed my toes inwards like a pincer and suspended myself against the tree. With my limbs held solid, I extended my right arm up, pinched again, raised my right leg, stabbed it in to the tree, launched my left-hand side up the tree and pinched hard, stabbing my left foot higher. A few short bursts later, My left hand extended and wrapped around the primary branch. Leaning back, I stretched my right leg up to a secondary branch, hooked in and pulled myself up. I glanced at Jimmy's branch. I looked up, and suddenly the oak seemed like a giant. A slumbering, dormant giant with stories centuries old. I climbed further, the sweat protruding from my hands being absorbed by the bark. Sap collected on my clothes and twigs collected in my hair. For the first time in my life I was not afraid of falling. The free air gave my spirit the kick it needed, and without a rope I felt like nothing was holding me back.


I reached the highest accessible point of the tree - the top of its trunk as it spreads out in to weaker branches. I sat atop for a moment, looked over the woods and realised how small it all seemed from such a height. I felt relief like I've never felt, and a breeze that could lift all unhappiness from a person. As I rested, I padded my hands against the tree, feeling the physical and emotional connection with this long-standing stalwart of the forest. As I did so, I noticed something against the thickest of the treetop branches. An engraving.

Suddenly everything fell in to place. It was all so obvious yet I had not seen it as a possibility. The knife, the ropeswing, the hanging. It all made sense. There was no suicide or murder. I thought initially Jimmy was going to have a happy ending, but I realised that Jimmy, after the greatest of achievements for a 13 year old, would have seen out his life hanging alone, slowly choking out, knowing that none of his friends or family would hear of his achievement. 
























 Thanks!

I'm not sure if it's customary to reply to comments, but it's my first submission and to hear someone enjoyed it means a lot to me.

I'm especially glad you were pleased with the ending. Maybe more of a thriller than a horror!

If you have any critique I would be very open to hearing it. 
























 I think I would only offer pure speculation at this point.

Maybe I could go back to the library and do some more research. 
























 Thank you for your kind words. Especially on my first submission, I am really happy to have had such wonderful comments. 
























 - ... hey

- Hey

- ...

- Let's get the awkward question out of the way first, shall we?

- Err, yeah, I guess...

- What're you in here for?

- A crime I didn't commit...

- Hah! That's what they all say, right?

- I don't know. I just got here.

- Murder.

- Sorry?

- Murder. That's what I'm here for. Murder.

- Murder?

- Yeah, stone-cold fucking murder.

- Shit, I err...

- That must make you a murderer, too, if they've gone and put you in here with me!

- Well... sir... with respect I didn't do anything. They didn't catch the guy and I was the only one around.

- Alright, fella. I hear you. You "didn't do it". I understand that.

- ...

- So who didn't you kill?

- I don't think... I don't think I want to discuss it with you... if you don't mind... sorry...

- Hah! Alright. We got plenty of time together anyway to discuss it. Could be useful, talking about it, you know?

- I don't think so.

- ...

- ...

- Well?

- Well what?

- Aren't you gonna ask me who I killed?

- Well, I don't think it's any of my-

- My whore wife.

- ... business...

- My *whore* wife. Fucking bitch. Caught her with another man. Came home from work early, opened the door and noticed some prick's boots by the door. 'course I didn't yell or any of that shit - didn't wanna give her time to react and make up stories. Just went upstairs, heard all I needed to hear, and waited in the bathroom.

- ... please I really don't want to hear this. I just got here and I-

- I stood in the bath behind the curtain. I waited and waited and waited.

- Please!

- Shut up! If you're gonna be with me you'd better get fucking used to it!

- I just-

- I was in the bath. After about an hour he left. Southern accent. Said he'd see her in the office. Wife's a lawyer.

- A lawyer?

- Yeah, a lawyer. Fucking property or some shit, I dunno. Who gives a shit? She's a dead fucking lawyer now.

- I just...

- Save me your stupid questions, yeah?

- Sorry...

- So she obviously needs to piss at some point, right? I don't have to wait long after he's gone. I hate waiting. I'm an impulsive guy, y'know? I don't think - I just do. So she comes in. I let her piss. Give her the satisfaction of knowing she didn't piss herself as she dies. She flushes. As the cistern fills up and the tap's running, I pull the curtain back and step out. Her reactions were quick, but not quick enough. A quick slam in to the mirror, yank her back by the hair, in to the bath. She kicks her feet but she can't do shit in the bath. She looked real fucking stupid. She knew she'd been caught. I still remember the panic in her eyes - a stare right through my gaze, looking for something inside me. "Please, please", she said, "Please don't".

- This is too much, please...

- I grabbed her throat as hard as I could and didn't stop squeezing. Her eyes bulged and everything went red... No last words... Not even a last breath.

- For fuck sake! Stop!

- Hit a nerve?

- This is bullshit... this is crazy... someone's having me on...

- No one's having you on. This is reality! People do stupid shit and people fucking die. Whores die.

- No, not... fucking hell.

- Jesus, man, I dunno why you're all wound up.

- I... I...

- Spill it. Speak!

- My wife was a lawyer. The story cut too close to the bone.

- Oh, she's a lawyer, huh? Who gives a shit?

- Please...

- So she's a lawyer, and you know what you are? A pussy.

- Excuse me?

- A PUSSY. A fucking pussy. Listen to yourself. All please this, please that, don't do this, I won't like it. Wah wah wah! Fucking cry-baby. So you killed your fucking wife.

- What?

- You said your wife *was* a lawyer.

- Yeah.

- So you killed her.

- No, I told you they didn't catch the guy. I would never hurt my wife.

- Everyone says that, until one day you catch them fucking some other bloke.

- She wouldn't...

- Why wouldn't she? Married to a pussy like you. You'd probably forgive her. Accept her stories. Take her back. No! What you need to do is stop taking shit from people. You didn't even tell anyone about Uncle Jack.

- ... w-w-what? W-who... H-how...

- You are such a fucking pussy.

- W-who... who are you?

- You really are a worthless piece of shit. I'm you. 
























 Furthermore there is an intention to explore if it's more than simply good vs evil - an exploration in to what parts of your mind are repressed due to psychological trauma, and how the absence of some emotion, or indeed outright repression, can lead to consequences beyond your sanity's control. 
























 Thank you. 
























 Thank you for the feedback, but I feel that restricting the dialogue to between two parties is an essential component to the narrative. You can interpret it as a physical prison, but also as a psychological one. redacted. The narrative structure is a device allowing a more open interpretation.

EDIT: Redacted a statement per subreddit guidelines. 
























 But not of the avian variety. 
























 I just think of the proverb:

 If buried in peace then the dead can speak their story, but if buried in unrest then the dead are mute and fight to be heard

I see it as my fianc trying to contact me however he can, which was to taint the fruit of the tree he was buried under. He wanted to send me a message, just like the others who have been buried in those grounds. 




 I need to tell someone this story. I can't go to the police. I fear for my life and need help.

It started a few months ago. I recently moved across Mexico to Palenque with my friend Javier. We managed to wrangle ourselves jobs for a few months at a spa hotel - a real high-class place, popular with American tourists. I'm from the states, myself, kinda - my parents moved to Seattle from Northern Ireland when I was 5. We went to Mexico most years on vacation. My parents loved being treated like royalty, but personally I loved the culture. I remember being 11 when I first scaled the pyramids at Teotihuacan, and during my adolescence I had a fascination with the Day of the Dead celebrations. In the UK and US, we don't tend to have any real celebration for the dead - it's more like a sadness and reflection on the anniversary of a person's death, rather than a celebration that they had lived.

My fascination for Mexico stuck with me, and while growing up I learned as much as I could about the Aztecs and Mayans, and indeed other ancient cultures of central and southern America. So, when choosing what to study in adulthood, it was only natural for me to pick ancient history, and eventually I specialized in Mesoamerican history. I was lucky enough to get a year of study based in Mexico City, and well, life was pretty sweet for me. I was doing what I loved in a country I adored.

So a few months ago my studies ended for the year. My parents were expecting me to return back to Seattle and pick up some bar work or something. Instead, I wanted to explore a corner of Mexico I had not been to yet. I had become good friends with Javier while in Mexico City, and together we were a good package for the hotel - both fluent in English and Spanish, not looking for long-term work, and just looking for some decent tip money to waste on mezcal.

I wouldn't say Javier and I had a drinking problem, but we certainly enjoyed a drink every night, and indeed on the weekends the drinking would get quite heavy and the parties more and more crazy. Once we awoke after a veterinary friend's party with shooting pains in our backs. It turns out we had been electronically tagged with some GPS tracking devices that they use on dogs. "We can't help you if you lose your mind, but at least you'll never lose your body" our friend quipped.

When we arrived in Palenque, it felt like the sort of place we could find a corner of and feel right at home. There is a decent amount of tourism in the area, including animal sanctuaries, Mayan ruins and - if you're in to that sort of stuff - the waterfall from Predator. As a fan of all three, I felt right at home. Javier is right at home with anything to drink, so we were perfectly content.

On one of our afternoons off, we were sat having some lunch in the town center. I remember there being a newspaper stand just opposite, with the front page emblazoned with news of 'another disappearance' in the local area. Newspapers in Mexico do not hold back any detail, with any gang violence completely uncensored on the front pages, so a 'disappearance' did not seem that extraordinary. We ate our food, until a crunch interrupted us.

"What the fuck?"

Javier spat out some food back in to his bowl. He was eating an assortment of fruit.

"Snuck a nut in, did they?" I asked.

"No... it didn't feel like... what the fuck?"

He picked at his bowl, scooped something on to the end of his spoon and held it up.

"It's a fingernail" he said.

"A fingernail? How the hell did that get in there? Call the waiter."

We called the waiter over and showed him the nail. He froze up, stepping out of reality for a moment before recovering and saying "sorry, sorry" and taking the bowl to the counter. He did not show the owner, busy preparing food, instead opting to just throw the contents of the bowl away and bringing us a fresh lot. Javier's appetite was not affected, and we went about our day.

A few days later, we went out to view the nearby ruins. I had to drag Javier there, of course, but I was not going to miss an opportunity to go. We caught some lunch along the road on the way back, and near to us was a stall selling refreshments. These sorts of stalls are everywhere in Mexico, but again what caught my eyes was a newspaper headline - a 'fresh disappearance'. When our waitress came over, I asked her what the story was. She was a little hesitant to answer, but said in Spanish, "I don't know, but in Palenque they say that if someone is buried in peace then they will be able to tell their story".

Her proverb interested me, and upon researching it I learned she only told me half. The whole proverb goes: 'If buried in peace then the dead can speak their story, but if buried in unrest then the dead are mute and fight to be heard'. My research showed that The Day of the Dead established a connection between the living and the peaceful dead, allowing the peaceful dead to rest knowing they are remembered. However, those buried in unrest do not get a connection, and go mad from beyond the grave, resorting to demonic and unholy methods in order to be heard, seen or simply noticed.

The waitress simply hoped that the missing people, if dead, were buried peacefully, so that their loved ones could connect with them on the next Day of the Dead. If there was any malpractice then there would be no saying what horror could occur, and through sheer coincidence, a moment later while eating I felt something like nothing else in my mouth, and as I clamped down on it it almost disintegrated. Fighting back the urge to vomit, I spat out everything on to my plate. As I gazed at my plate, it appeared to gaze up at me. An eye, discolored, but unmistakably an eye. Unmistakably a human eye. I feinted.

I awoke to Javier urging, "we need to get out of here". It felt like a good idea, and so we headed back to the hotel. We spoke at length. Javier wanted to go to the newspapers. He spoke of the mystery and how we could get enough money to see us through more trips like this. "Imagine if we didn't have to work while we explored the world" he would say. I just felt like returning back to the US, but we compromised and decided to just ignore what had happened, and return back to normality.

Normality would never resume, though. They came that night. I was awoken by the door being knocked in with an almighty crash. There were no voices. I looked at Javier, catching the fear in his eye. Then a kick through our bedroom door. Masked faces rushed in. I was knocked out cold.

I awoke in the back of an open-back truck along a bumpy road. I could not see much except for light and dark through the bag on my head. I could make out the moon and the stars, and figured where the cabin of the truck was. I laid still and listened, and quickly established I was alone in the back. Two men were in the cabin, their muffled voices talking of burying us and earning a paycheck.

I had one thing in mind - survival. I maneuvered down to the end of the truck, and hurled myself as best I could out the end. I didn't care that I'd be hurt, and it did hurt like hell. But better that than be killed. I managed to get to the side of the road, used a tree to scrape the bag off my head, and spent some time wrestling my hands free of a fairly makeshift bind.

I took a large breath of air, and snapped back in to a panic. Javier. He must still be in the truck. I continued up the road. I had no idea how long I would need to travel, but I told myself I would find him no matter what it takes. I could wrestle someone, take a gun if they had one. I continued for what must have been two hours, until I reached the end of the road, and some grand gates. La Huerta Blanca. The White Orchard. I noticed a security camera and a guarded post. I don't know what I expected.

Tired, and in less of a reactive mood, I thought it best to go to the police. I returned to our hotel, and must admit I cried a great deal. I looked around the room and saw that nothing had been taken. Only us. This was not a burglary, but an assassination, but why weren't we killed? I picked up my phone and-

My phone! Of course my phone! I remembered how Javier had a tag. Probably the only time of my life where some drunken lunacy would prove to be useful. Going to the police would take too long, and clearly the disappearances are not being solved. Time was of the essence, and I packed up all of my things, and went back to the orchard.

Scaling the outside wall was easy. I guess the guard was just a formality, or to stop any trucks entering. They would likely not care for the occasional scrumping. I loaded up the tracking app on my phone, and noticed the expanse of the Orchard. It was huge. It seemed like I walked through almost every type of plant and tree. I was getting close to Javier's signal as I walked among the orange trees.

300 yards. 200 yards. 100 yards. He should be here, somewhere. I looked around, and could see nothing. My feet were muddied on the soft ground, and my legs tired from the walking, but I found energy, manically whispering his name, calling for any noise or tremor. No response. He wasn't there. I could not explain the signal. I sat under one of the trees, and cried, and cried, and cried.

I went in to hiding for some time after that. I imagined they would be looking for me, sat at the bus station. The bus station is a second-class one, with no security barriers. It would be easy to pull me in to a van and 'disappear' me, too. I walked out of town, told a village local I was a scientist studying the local flora, and ate at the same cafe every day.

Now, this morning I sat down for breakfast. The cafe owner gave me my usual - a pastry with an orange on the side. Basic, but will see you through to lunch. I ate my pastry, and took my orange out to the nearby forest. I sat on a log and peeled the orange. I split the orange down the middle and something thudded to the ground. I look down and see a finger. But there was something about it that I immediately noticed. I knew that finger. I bought that ring. I flashed back to the moment he accepted it. I burst in to a fit, fell to my knees, and wept. 




 That's what I believe. I cannot know for certain, but I imagine he slipped, and with the rope stashed around his neck and the stick/wood seat of the rope-swing susceptible to being caught on something, I think it was just an unfortunate accident. 




 I assume you are referring to commenting out of character. Let me pose you a couple of questions: Who am I? Who is the narrative about? After experiencing something, learning something, or being told a story, subsequent to recreating it yourself for an audience, one needs to consider what style of narrative to use. *Kiss of the Spider Woman* showed me a narrative style that would be befitting of this story. That is what I meant by its influence - simply how I chose to present the story.

I hope that clears things up a little. 




 My inspiration for the narrative came from Manuel Puig's *Kiss of the Spider Woman*, which is fantastic. If you ever get a chance to read it, do it. 




 Thank you for the kind words.
