 During school I am perfectly fine, I laugh (Well... giggle), smile, and am generally a positive person. I get all my work done in class, I never have homework, I help out people when asked. I try my best to just help. But when I get home I am instantly having suicidal thoughts, I fight with my girlfriend, and I just overall hate everything.

I feel like I'm just a horrible person, I believe I have let my father down. He wanted a smart child who likes what he is into, But I'm not smart in my eyes, and I don't like sports and NASCAR and all of that stuff, I tried to play sports to please him but after I cracked my head I said "I don't want to play sports again" and I haven't. I like games, and girls...
I've never heard my parents say "I love you." I know its hard to believe but I just haven't. They don't go out on dates, or kiss or anything. I feel like its my fault.
People think, "Oh Travis, You have it was easy you get what you want and can do whatever."
But getting what I want isn't fine. My parents do not have a college savings account for me, nor my brother. My brother (who is smart) got a little bit of a scholarship and it makes it easy for him to go. I, however will not get a scholarship, I don't get 100% on tests and I don't do the best work.
So, I don't know what I'll do for college. I don't want my family to take out another loan. I would like my parents to just go out on dates, and act like a married couple.
I take medicine but the dosage seems to be too small, if I take 2 I'm happy all day and everything is fine.
I noticed myself getting depressed after a break-up, I tried so hard to make everything up and talk to her, I wrote a 6 page letter to her, and she just ignored it. Awhile later I had tried to search our home for a pistol we keep for safety. I searched often when no one was home and could never find it, and I'd usually end up sitting on the bed and crying.
On my birthday, sadly, I had tried to OD. My birthday wasn't good.

I don't want to die, and I don't want to have these thoughts, but they won't leave me alone. I just want to have my parents be a couple, I want my my father to say hes proud of me, And I want to be happy.

Help? 




 Ah, thank you. And one last thing, do you know how much a Gold Botkiller Rocket Launcher is? 




 Thank you, so its 20keys or a bud? 




 Thank you! 




 What are the prices on these?

 For the love of all the is tasty, I need a box or two. D: I miss them! 




 But... But... I want some too.. 




 I'm from Arizona, we don't have much but if you like any Arizonian snack and you happen to have some Oreo O's, I will gladly try my best to get the snack you want! 




 Can/Will/Does anyone have Oreo O's that they can ship to Arizona, USA?

I was way out in x 800 z -3000, in giant open fields and no town near, and I starved.. so please put animals in.

 I did Nazi that coming. 




 Too soon it seems. 




 Reason why I own Photoshop, is for things like this. 









 Thanks man :DDDDD 




 Hell yeah! :D 




 I put it on the pandas forehead, seeing as it wont go to the bottom right D: 




 Simple is special ;) 



















 Its fine, I understand that some people don't have the money. 




 I was wondering if any of you fine non-zombie people would actually donate to make a DayZ Lingor Island server in the US. I know a person who is whitelisted for a spot by the Lingor Hive. The only problem is we'd need money to host it. It'd be the only US server.

So, would anyone actually donate? 









 Ah, didn't see. Thanks :D 




 Except for sex. 









 I think this would be an amazing map to play DayZ on. 









 Honestly, its all good. You can keep trying to kill us, like the [NC] Clan. We're waiting. 




 Come at me bro. 




 Thank you for the hour long fire fight, deaths, and walk backs to the hill. I'm sorry a hacker had to come in a ruin the fun, hopefully we can fight again. But why would you have a camp up there in the hill? 




 Back when you spawned with a Mak, I shot a kid for lols. 




 I jumped... 




 Well, you gave me a good impression of the game which led me to buy it. :D 




 When you spawn in it'll say "Day x" (x being the day you've been alive) 




 This is what you get if you upload the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXIpPORrOKo 




 Uploading the video to YouTube at the moment. 




 lol its alpha 




 It was my first character ever made in Day Z, I spawned in Cherno (Though I didn't know that was its name). I had somehow found a friend, who was new as well and thought me how to use voice comm. We went around the building and found the hospital. I stumbled upon some Anti-Biotics and headed up the roof. I called for my friend to come look at the view and I made a dash for the ladder to see if he was coming, I ran off the roof and died instantly. 




 Oh, you fancy huh? 




 LOL 




 Yes. Yes. Yes. 




 wow, we're all in Chandler!! 




 A girl who likes me sent this to me, it always makes me smile.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0Ohl3MMq0o

Shes an amazing girl.

I mean really. 




 lol dont join unless you like to get raped by the AI 









 ART! D: 




 Russian server, very peaceful. 




 Welcome to the dark side, we've been expecting you. 














 I'm sorry, I don't have enough money to gift you it. Hopefully someone else will help you! I'm sorry. Have faith! The reddit community is full of good, friendly, and kind people! Hope to see you around DayZ sometime, hopefully soon ;)! 




 I know what I'm going to do now...

I keep reading this, its just so good.. 




 It'd be amazing getting a free copy, I could play with my friend who I literally do everything with, It'd just be nice to finally play a survival game with her and not play WoW all the time. Thank you for being super generous. Have a wonderful day. 




 I feel like I've killed you before... 




 Most of the day. 




 I did this today as well. TX20, It's very fun. 




 Contact me here or VIA steam. (test_subject7776) 




 Amazing shot. 




 fags. 




 LOL
Oh god, Olive, you, you're a funny man. 




 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVvxCdNv2vc 









 Ah, thank you both very much! :D 




 I was wondering what Add-on you need in order to have high quality skins and such? Any help would be appreciated! 




 Must have. 




 T'is a big bitch. 




 We're not mad. :P 




 So we were playing Day Z (7 of us) and we were in an open field checking a deer stand (of course it had nothing), we heard a shot and one of us died, we all proned down and DC'd. (Yes wussy move, wanna fight about it?) We reconnected to a new server and messed around in the field recollecting ourselves and healing our injured. The moment we were all ready to go we heard another shot and again, another friend got shot and died. We all hit the deck and now we're just waiting it all out.

Now I'm scared. 




 AHHHH THIS GUY! 




 You lead our group through the thick and thin, but in the end you just couldn't get to the ladders fast enough... 









 It's pretty sexy :3 




 I tried to get a real screenshot, but eh it takes pictures of my wallpaper instead. 




 lmao. 




 So I spawned in, found a house and a nice pair of Binoculars, I took them and then.. well these just randomly spawned. I can't pick them up, and they don't look like hatchets and crowbars... 









 How old are you? 




 priceless. 




 Oh god, this is amazing. 




 I'm on -7 time, but I'll play! 




 Anyone? 




 Steam. test_subject7776

 I came here before for them and no one gave, and I read that and came back again. lol :P 




 bold move, motherfucker. 




 Totally. 




 Hey now, what you think is gross i may find delicious. ;D 




 But its not like in Korea where you can't get certain things you want.
I'd rather help someone who needs/wants it.
Then someone who just wants to make a buck. 









 But I want to help someone. 




 I know that they only are sold in South Korea, but I would really love it if someone could send some my way. I live in Arizona and if you need my info message me.

I would be willing to send well, snacks, or anything you might need.
Ex: toiletries and the box of chips like [this](http://i.walmartimages.com/i/p/00/02/84/00/04/0002840004026_500X500.jpg)

So if you live in South Korea and can get them, please, do contact me!

EDIT: Still looking for some. :) 




 Ill do it for some Oreo O's.

Just tell me what you want and I'll try and find it! 




 Fuck you. 




 SOH

 I'll test whenever you want, I'll try and pm you when I get home. 




 I thought it said "hitler potato" so I kept waiting for the potato, and then I went back and say it said "photo", I am not a smart man. 




 I'm impressed. 




 Chandler, Arizona?

Sir, I will probably see you around or have seen you.

 So ass then, eh mate? 




 What a brave ass cat. 









 Annnnnd, My names Travis. Great. 




 I'm numb. It hurts. Oh god.  




 I shouldn't be laughing while fapping.. But her face.. 




 I feel like people don't understand it's an alpha.
I understand that's no excuse, but come on.
It's been out for maybe a week and you're all already bitching. 




 Touch 




 My name is Travis... Do I get a picture? 




 I want to, but then I'll feel like a pedo... 




 I'll say it.

Nice breasts. 




 I know I'm slow :( don't make fun of me. 




 Call me slow, but the Dota 2 "Sniper" has a line that says
"Thanks for standing still, Ganker"
just like the TF2 Sniper has a line that says
"Thanks for standing still, Wanker"

 Bought Legend. 




 Well lately my father has been getting paid less and less as the company he works for might lay off people. So in hopes of keeping his job now, he gets paid 1 week out of the month.
I've played the beta for CS:GO but as it came out, I have had no money to purchase it.
If anyone has a spare they can give me, that'd be amazing. Thank you. 




 Go home reddit, you're drunk. 




 I love to sleep. I'd come home from school and go straight into my bed. I like the warmth the blankets give off, sure it's not like a humans but its better than nothing. I also have cute purple panda stuffed animal who sleeps next to me.
But on Friday, the 28th, it didn't happen this way. I had done something I shouldn't have ever done. I sent a nude to a girl while I'm currently with someone else.
(Note: I did this before in my last relationship and, well you can guess the outcome.) I am the worst when it comes to keeping thing like this a secret. The guilt was eating me so I told my girlfriend what I had done. Needless to say, she was pissed. Now, I've only had depression or at least enough to where it stands out enough to be noticed and medicated, since my last relationship. I should have learned from my mistakes, but hey, I'm a teenager! Since I'm a teenager I jumped from point A to suicide. I'm the type of person who just wants to die all the time, and this whole mess just messed me up. I do already have my own disabilities like ADD and so on. So anyways any moment where my downstairs kitchen room was clear I would run an take some pills. In all I had taken 15 anti depressants, my last 2 ADD pills, and about 25ish+ painkillers. To my surprise I didn't die, I only got some pain in my leg, feeling like a baby was kicking my stomach, and my vision messed up for a while. I do wish I had died. I had found the love of my life, and well.. Messed up. Don't get me wrong my current girlfriend is amazing! But I have this connection with the girl I dated first (We will call her Kat). I just always want to be close to her and protect her. Kat actually wanted me back once but I decided to go out with my current girlfriend (We will call her Hannah). Because Hannah has liked me since gosh knows when, she always cares and asks me things, and also plays games with me. Kat has moved on, and of course, to one of my friends. I know I should get jealous ad or upset over these things, but I can't help it. I should be the one she sleeps with her head on. I do not make the best choices. I mean I usually pick the opposite of what's good for me, and I realize that I really wanted that other choice when it's too late. I've spent sometime searching the house where I live, for the gun we keep. But I can never find it and eventually end up sitting on the nearest bed and crying. I've even tried to over dose on my birthday, my birthday!
I just wish I could sleep for the rest of my life. 
If only my pills worked. They're just too weak to give me happiness.
I'll probably make my own post tomorrow, seeing as I can't get on the computer right the moment, as its 2:45am and I haven't slept in 30ish+ hours.
Good night guys, I hope you all have a lovely sleep, and wake up with a smile. 




 I wish I was a kid again. 




 I wish I was asleep. 




 ~ I don't think I could live being med free. If I still try to kill myself on the meds and with them, I don't want to know how I am off them. 




 Good luck, and have fun!
I like seeing things like this, it's cute and reminds me someone can find love.
Makes me all warm inside. 




 You better have fucking bought it. 




 OH GOD. THANK GOD IT'S COMMON TO HAVE INCEST WET DREAMS. 

I thought I was alone and that it was weird.
Whew, thank you OP for this.

I didn't mean to almost give you an aneurysm. 




 See, I was going to go with a 670, but I wanted the 4gb, and said hey.. 680 is the same price as a 670 4gb. And then 690 doubled fps of a 680.. and yeah.. :P

But thank you aphreshcarrot!

I was thinking of getting a new motherboard, put if it can support this card, I'd rather not spend.

So, do you think these two will work together?

(P.S. I have a Intel i5 2500k CPU @ 3.3 GHz)

Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks! 




 This is my current motherboard

Do I even need to upgrade the processor  motherboard, or will just getting the card work. 














 I'll take a shot. 




 Also, someone said I wouldn't play good, so thats why I asked here! :D 




 Ah, okay! Thank you very much mate :D! 




 Yeah, I just bought it and its not showing up anywhere too, I do have the receipt too!

I just want to make sure I have it... D: 














 I'll gladly trade my wrench for a rocket! 




 I am not in therapy and yeah they do. 
























 Touch sir, touch.

Still dicks in my opinion.
You don't have to play a supportive role, but you shouldn't say "it's undesirable" because saying that to someone who already is on the edge can just push them over. 




 They're dicks. 




 I love you.

 Oh my god, I need to play again, anyone know how to sign up? 




 It does suck indeed. 




 I'm glad I live in AZ so I can use 5% dark just looks good with grabber.

 Simply had a more updated version of core than I needed. Silly me!

Is that how this would work?

'Cause I have no idea where to put these and it's just so confusing. 




 Thank you! I will try it and get back. :) 




 How would I go about adding treecap and connected destruction to my FTB 1.5.2 beta server?

 That's perfectly okay. 




 That's disgusting! 




 I traded in all my stuff, and I'll be playing PC until PS4. 




 Gotta test shit somewhere. 




 Damn, so should I just get a PS3 and play them that way, before the PS4 comes out? 




 So, would PS4 have Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2 on it, like in the store? Since I don't want to go buy another system just to play those 2 games.

I know you can't but the disk in, but I'm hoping they would have it available on the store.

Does anyone know? 




 Eh, at least I tried, right?
That's all anyone could of asked for! 




 I'M....TRY...ING.

IS IT... WORKING? 




 Dat ass indeed, brother. Dat ass indeed.. 




 You gon' die.

But in all seriousness, I personally wouldn't sleep and head to the doc, but I am not you, and I have no control over you.
Good luck. 




 It's insane. 




 Plus the Zombie knock down, needs to have a lower chance. 




 Now I don't want to go outside, thanks bro! 




 No one, literally, no one cares.

Also, why are you even stalking him? 




 I hate you so much.... 




 Ah Okay! 




 Thank you. 




 Did your boyfriend beat him to a bloody pulp?

EDIT: Thanks for the Down votes!:D 




 I'm reading that book right now, and that's what I was thinking. :P 




 You're a problem in the world.. 




 Hurts, so much. 




 It doesn't work. There is no point and I hate it. If anything, it makes everything worse.. 




 I helped a girl out of suicide, but when I've needed help, she just ignores me and says that I'm doing it for attention.
It's sad cause I was the only one to give a shit about here and then she turns around and kicks me away.

It's sad, really, really, sad. 




 I think you can get addicted, but that's just me. 




 Happy birthday.

I had my birthday on the 12th, I wish I wasn't here as well. I had gotten out of my second time in a mental/behavioral center for suicide. I even attempted on my birthday in 2012, I just don't care for life. It's boring, and they're making me do out patient shit, which is just large group therapy.

Happy birthday though. Good luck with your life. 




 Idk, torrent maybe? Not on a Computer so I can't say 100% 




 That explains your name. 




 Wow you tried hard.

Okay. Coolio. 




 But yaaaay, you got food!

I'll have u no I graaduatd top of mah navy sealz class.
I wud fuk u up 




 You're a cunt.

Ya I said it, wnna fire 'bout it. 




 Who cares about PETA 




 I clicked it bro, even after I read your comment.
I said to myself, it can't be that bad..

It fucking was. It really fucking was. 




 just whitelist the website? 




 Not that's "K" 




 Why do I go to this subreddit. 




 Dude. 




 Not today with this comment. 




 You lost all the upvotes you gained.
And then some. 




 Oh. 
























 I'm not good with words, but if you need anything, I'm here. I can get you a card and stuff.

Live for your children. You wouldn't want their Christmas gift to be a permanent scar on their minds. Love works as a gift, kisses and hugs, homemade things.

I'm not an adult so I don't have adult ideas on what to do, but If you need money to get them something small I'm totally game for sharing some of my money.

I'm sorry this year wasn't the best for you. 




 Ah okay.

Drop the .jar in the mods folder
If you have a custom config put in config folder

Start server and type /veinminer mode sneak

Tadaa 




 We're good, I figured it out. But it was for my dedicated server.
Thanks though! 




 How would I add Veinminer to a server?
I've opened the FTP and put the .jar in the mods folder and the config in the config folder but it is not working. Any ideas? 




 Just, wow. Beautiful. I'm in absolute awe. 




 Not for awhile I think. It did just come out and it is an early access game. 









 I like more HP and everything, but that would just be a pain in the ass.

Still, looks very clean. 




 Hahahaha, and I hope man, I can't wait until 2015 so I can go to training and start fresh. 




 Marines, try and be a combat engineer. 




 Damn, I'm stupid haha, I read the first sentence wrong.
I know it's not all fun, there are long hours, bad pay, conditions can be shit. I understand its not all GUNS, 'MERICA, 'SPLOSIONS, or fun.
Drill instructors will yell/scream at you for every little thing you do wrong and how you talk.
Which I think is a good thing, I need a new experience, and learn how to get over things, or I'm never going to.
I just feel like it'd be nice to fight for the person next to you instead of yourself, for once.

Maybe I'm thinking about it wrong, or what not, anyways, sorry if my post didn't make any sense last night. That is my bad! :P 




 I hope! And awesome, that's good to know just in case!
Thanks man! 




 Luckily you didn't get prescribed anything (I think), haha, but to me it shouldn't matter if I can take the meds after, cause one thing that makes me feel better is exercise and you have to stay fit to be a Marine so maybe I'll get a lot better if I get in.
Thanks man. 




 I don't know, ever since I was in elementary school I thought that being in the armed services was the coolest thing ever. And there are times where I try and pick a different career path, but I just go back to thinking about being a Marine.
I want to learn skills about how I should go about being a leader, and the bonds you make with the men next to you.
 




 Yeah, I had no idea it was a big deal until he said that I can't join and that no one will take me for a year.
I had to go online and read about it today, which was a surprise.
I feel like I can ween off my mood stabilizers/anti-depressants, and I'm scheduling an appointment to see if I can.
I was getting ready to hit the gym to so I can pass the physical tests too. Well, Now I have a year to get in better shape (not saying I'm in bad shape, I just don't think I can pass the test)
Its one year, school gets out in 6 months, summer is 2 months, so really all I'm missing out on is 4 months. Sure I won't get to go with my friends, but I'll get to go someday. 




 Thank you for serving.

I will look at the videos you have provided.
I have at least another year before they will take me, so maybe I'll think about it harder. People have told me to join as an officer and such.
 




 So, I learned today by a recruiter that any branch of the armed service will not take you if you're on depression medication, and will only take you if you've been off for a year with doctors consent.
So that put a little damper on my parade, I've wanted to join since I was little and I learn I cannot.
Sorry, I just wanted to express and inform people who might want to join some day.

Darn, I was excited too.. 




 Looks clean, nice fogged lights man! 




 I'd love a Metro key if you still have one, never played it but it looks really interesting.

Thanks man, your generosity amazes me. 




 Eh, personally don't like it. 




 Nothing. So I guess, calm. Then afterwards regret cause now I'm treated differently. 




 Couldn't see, not good at side angles. Haha, My apologies mate, thanks! 




 SVT Cobra, or Shelby? :o 




 I like the blackout. A lot. 




 I'm 17 and I want a Cobra.

Jesus, if this happened to me, I'd be so devastated. 




 Fuck. So I'm not alone.

Edit: Yeah I noticed I've gone down a bit and getting up isn't easy.. 




 Exactly. 




 Its actually lighter than 2014. And It does look like it should be on a Taurus. 




 Kinda sad about the style. It just blends in with Fusions and Taurus's IMHO. 




 I'm smiling. Wow. Thats just the cutest thing. :D 




 whoa. 




 Still in love with your car. 




 I'm on mood stabilizers, so there is that option. 




 I'm glad you're at least feeling something different. :) 




 you really had to look through all of his comments.. wow. 




 wat 




 Yeah I'm now just any RDM = 1 hr, come back and do it again 1 day, then after that its perma. I don't have time for 14 yr old kids trying to be Seananners. 




 I used to be relax but more and more I'm becoming stricter. It's becoming a real pain with the RDM. 




 I.. What? 




 Feelin' good with the bit coins I see. Hopefully he uses them :D 




 wat 




 Yeah, for real, thats a sick addition to the car. 




 Its something you wouldn't ever expect to see, at least for me it is. 




 The blue trimmed wheels look nice. 




 Ahhhh jealous. 




 Awesome!! 




 I was being completely serious, thanks for the help! 




 But the question is, do condoms fuck anything up. 




 Believe me, I'm looking for power but sleek and sexiness, I might as well go for the Cobra unless I can find a reasonable Mach 1 with some extra HP from stock. 




 I'm very, very jealous. I'm torn between wanting a race/performance/torch/whatever-you-want-to-call-it red Cobra or Mach 1.

Love how clean your car looks. How much did you get it for/do you have any numbers?

*edit: word 




 Mach 1, but either is actually good. 




 I cringed. 




 Ouch, our feelings... 




 I was open to close friends, and then got sent away 3 times and now people think I'm just acting like it but not really depressed. Oh well. 




 Adorable :p 




 No. 




 I'm alliance, but I would never disrespect the horde, especially one who died.  




 Is that a mustang model car I see....  




 Some people these days... Jeez, I'm sorry you have to deal with people like that. 




 Yes, simply put. 




 Oh thanks so much :D Sorry if it was a problem! 




 Oh my god, if you're still up for it can you do me? If not, that's completely cool!


[This is me](https://scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/1375909_634419609936813_1235110306_n.jpg) 




 It was a sad day for us Huskies.. 









 why put a cobra anything on something thats not a cobra..? 




 Shhhh, don't comment if you didn't read the article. 




 I don't like the front end, but to each their own. 




 Huh, Maybe I'll chose to get a Term instead of a Mach then.. Thanks mate! 




 Nice, out of all of them which do you enjoy driving more? 




 I'm so jealous. I might hate you, but love you.
Sweet Mach and Term mate.
How much was all that? 




 I love it. 




 What Oni said. 




 Unless you hate the color, do it. 




 If you can, that'd be awesome. :) Thanks! 




 Oh dude/dudet, that's so awesome! Thank you very much :D 




 If its not too late, can you draw me :)?

https://scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc1/1176186_623513821027392_1260561400_n.jpg 




 such a smooth gif... 




 I liked my IOP (was for teens), but I wasn't in there long, so I too would like to hear what people have to say and their experiences. 




 Its 7pm, why would we be sleeping. 




 No I got what you were saying. Sorry if it came off rude. 




 I could easily get 100 on BF3, no problems, I understand its the first day, but its so jumpy. 




 Anyone else getting low jumpy FPS?

My rig is:
i5 2500k @ 3.30 GHz
8GB Ram
GTX 670 2gb

and I have the 331.40 Beta drivers installed.

I don't understand, I can't even run this on Low.


(Sorry if this doesn't belong here)
 




 that was.. beautiful.. 




 So clean, looks awesome! 




 Can't wait to see what she/he looks like when it's all cleaned up! 




 Ugh, Mach 1 3 




 That is amazing. Very jealous. 




 The noises I made watching this weren't human.
Certainly WTF. 




 Well, R.I.P 




 Anytime! 




 Not every car has to be a "female" :P, good for you for being a nonconformist! He looks good. Congratulations! :D 




 It's okay, it's just a cupcake in your eye. 




 I just saw a dude fuck a baked chicken and cum into it.

Why does that even exist? 




 It has to be in my town, well then. 




 Ah that would explain it D:, hopefully one day you could give a few hundred more miles on it. It's a beauty!  




 Can someone explain why get a fast car but never drive it, not being rude, just curious why pay 60k for a car you never really drive.
Thanks!
(BTW, looks nice ;) ) 




 PC. You?
 




 Lucky, my family doesn't like to game with me.. :( 




 Awesome! 




 Lovely simple pony. 




 Beautiful. 




 Oh, so lucky. I wish I could find one around here for that. The only Mach 1 is a Zinc Yellow for 15k.
Anyways, very cool car, wish I could have one. 




 How much was it? 




 I am completely jealous of your Mach 1, it looks beautiful. 




 Can I be a fairy too? 




 Ouch, my feelings. 




 Yeah bro, cause a 5.0 isn't much. 









 "Daddy loved you"

Chills and feels.

Glad you're alive, even if its just for now. 





























 As long as its just stating HP, I feel fine with it, It's not like you're saying its a rare model or adding cobra badges to it. 




 I can only dream of seeing one in person. 




 We can all take turns owning it, I get it all of May though. ;P 









 Yeah you do. My friend posted on Facebook from BT 









 Not really.. 
The Bullitt Mustang was offered in only three colors: Dark Highland Green, Black, and True Blue.

According to Wiki. 




 You mean if I actually went outside today I could have seen these? 




 He said no financing on the Fiero since its old. And since me and my friend look like we're 12 he must have thought they just want a joy ride, which if we wanted a joy ride we'd go look at Roush's or GT's, not a 135hp Fiero... :P 




 Do you have 11 grand? ;P

The guy wouldn't even let me and my friend ride in any of the cars unless we had the cash right then. Silly. 




 Welcome to how things are ran. 




 Well, she didn't pass it. So.. 




 Arizona won't let that happen. She's not THAT stupid..  




 Hopefully I can get one sooner rather than later! 




 Jeez, how long have you had it and how old are you now? If you don't mind me asking, I'm just trying to figure out how long it took you to get your dream car :P 




 How much did it cost for you? Jeez, I'd do anything just to SIT in one, let alone own one! 




 You literally have my dream car, a Torch Red 10th Anniversary Cobra.

Gah! Do you have any numbers? I'm so jealous of you right now.
Has it been modified, and if so what ways? 




 I got an email a few days ago saying I signed up for it. The thing is, I've never touched anything to do with BitCoins, and I went to look at what it meant and it had my name, first, middle, and last. It also had my birthday almost to the exact everything, but was off by 1 day. They also had my email. So I went in and changed everything, thankfully they didn't have any proof of ID, so it wasn't a full active account. 




 We can hope it will get struck down, no one here likes it. 




 ooooh something without support fell and it happened to be under your car. WTF man! Wow! 




 yes!

 Yes, 4chan can downvote and upvote.

 Dear god, I love those. 




 Fiber is coming to my state, but is just out of my reach. It's in Phoenix and I'm in Chandler.

I'm so mad. 




 If you have anymore picture feel free to post them at [r/NewEdgeMustang](http://www.reddit.com/r/NewEdgeMustang), It'd be awesome to see more New Edges :) 




 Shes giving more exposure to the world what is happening. Hopefully that bring more people in to help. 




 Wait so they beat the snipers to death? 




 I'll try and get some people, plug in this sub in some Mustang posts if they feature a new edge.

Happy to be here moderating! 




 Torch Red, it's so bright and an awesome attention grabber. 




 We're sorry o' great one. 




 I'd be interested. 




 Stuff like this makes me think if anyone has ever uploaded my early high school pictures.  




 So, you made it look like a Cobra.... 




 Pizza. 




 Tumblr. 




 You mean, someone would lie? 














 Once one opinion in the comments gets some upvotes, it becomes the popular opinion of the entire comment section, and everyone scrambles to make a comment agreeing with the top comment to get that juicy Karma. 




 ITT: Suddenly reddit cares about feelings. 




 Me either man.. me either.. 




 Anytime. :) 




 Looks beautiful. God damn. 




 Its 3 commercials per show. Its not bad. 




 I've learned that every comment on gonewild posts, are just really cringe worthy. 




 Woah dude, nature, WTF man? 




 Yeah, for what I'm getting it at, and how many miles it has, it's definitely going to need a swap. But I'm just hoping it can last a little bit so I can use it to get to work/school, before it dies on me. 




 Yeah, definitely cool. No doubt about it. Not a whole lot of power either, but definitely something different. 




 I know! And Its not like you see them everywhere (at least in my area), and I just got a video of it and WOW does it sound really nice on top on looking good.
I wonder why they're so cheap. 




 You are right on that cheap part, hahaha. I think it looks pretty good stock, I don't know why people try to make things look like how they're not.  




 The one I'm thinking about buying is normal, I mean it has 2 stripes but other than that it's pretty normal.
Does anyone know why the Fiero has a ton of body kits for it, it seems? 




 Civ 3, or 4, or 5, or Pirates! :P

Q. How do you make an egg-roll?
A. You push it!

:) Thanks 




 Thanks man for the giveaway, good luck everyone! 




 They're beautiful in person, pictures can't capture it all. Nice spot! 




 We.. We all aren't.. I have some MLP things too.. 




 Yeah it's something like 50% to get past legality. 




 Yeah. But you get a whole new car basically and a warranty. Still, it's a lot for what it is. 




 Oh he's there already, half shaved head, piecing, all that fun stuff! 




 It was actually just yesterday! They had a open house, free food, drinks, rally fighter rides, Boy Scouts were there, it was quite a lot of fun.
Yeah they added that extension but now it's just inside the building, I got a picture of it! 




 He just uploaded a picture of the book, "The Satanic Rituals" 




 Yeah... well, North Korea reached the Sun, so we're behind. 




 That's probably my favorite front end of any car. 




 [Heres the side view + a kind inside view](http://imgur.com/a/VVtbk)

I don't know how to get a video off of Facebook. Will try though! 




 Its supposed to be about one of the members ex girlfriend, or so I heard. 




 I only have a side view and a video of my ride in one. Its so comfy even when you're in the air. 




 Gotcha. 




 Ah, gotcha, there is a whole Satanic bible talk that's hidden since it got a lot of down votes. Totally skimmed it. My bad. 




 I'm pretty sure he responded to the wrong comment. :P 




 Yeah... 




 No idea, there was a different military truck as well. 




 [A song by them](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MB6mhKQxdHc),
And I don't know how to post a picture/If its allowed since it shows them and him.
But there is a bigger band with the same name as them, and I don't understand why they kept the same name. 









 Oh you should see the "band" he's in.. 









 I'm glad that you are feeling different and make a change and helping others. Hopefully others will see this and want to change too. :) 




 License plate is BRB666 




 What game was it? :o 




 wow nature. WTF? 




 It was amazing to go in when no one was there. 




 I've never used a online currency like bitcoin or anything, but dogecoin sounds pretty cool, and you're giving out free coins, so sure I'll try. 




 Thank you! 




 I don't think we are allowed to assist you in your suicide, but we do want you to know that we are here for you whenever you need someone to talk to.

Think twice, please.. 




 Is there any ETA on this? I cannot wait to play!
Thanks! 




 I love that color on any Mustang but definitely on a Cobra. My god. 




 share some love at [/r/NewedgeMustang/](http://www.reddit.com/r/NewedgeMustang/) 




 You're friends dumb (reference to 4th edit), she probably won't stop using now. 




 waiting. ;D 




 I like it, I just dislike how much empty space is in the rear, See? Different likes. :P 




 Lol, it's cool. We all have different likes. I'll take my down votes with pride. 




 Went to Barrett Jackson on Friday and saw the '15's in person, and its an OK looking car from the side, I dislike to front though. 




 What. 




 Lol, because being rude helps.

"After reading about the chrome and paint coming off, I decided to spray a couple layers of clear coat on them. Made them shine a little more and no peel over time.
Over 12 months installed. Maybe 6 on the road and out of the garage."                                                                          
[item it was found on](http://www.americanmuscle.com/46-supercharged-emblem-black.html) 




 try buying new ones and putting clear coat? I think thats what I saw on an americanmuscle customer review. 




 I'd agree with Mcflyguy, stock or dark smoked headlights are the way to go. But really, it's whatever floats your boat. Looks clean though! 




 Ah okay, thanks man. 




 Probably my favorite front of any style besides the 60's. 




 didnt work still, and lost the link. oh well. 




 ohmygosh, you have natural selection 2 :o
I'd be cool if you gifted it to me, but if not thats fine too. :)

 but it says GT on the side. 




 [here](http://www.americanmuscle.com/46-supercharged-emblem-black.html), 
Thats if you just want to replace it completely, which might be the best option.

Also a comment that might be important to you (found in the comments on the item): After reading about the chrome and paint coming off, I decided to spray a couple layers of clear coat on them. Made them shine a little more and no peel over time.
Over 12 months installed. Maybe 6 on the road and out of the garage.

P.S. : Nice GT man. 




 That's fucking clean. 
























 no need to be rude about it man.. 




 Just put a 5.0 in the Mach and go crazy.
I'm biased though since I like the New Edge look and the Mach look. 




 Beats mine, man. I would kill to upgrade. 




 nope. 




 AWH SHIT, YA GOT ME WITH MY 12 YEAR OLD.
How will I ever survive now.. 




 So cool to be an asshole, jeez man, it's his car. Fuck off if you don't like it. He can do whatever he wants.
I think it's pretty cool, since I've only seen it once. 




 72k miles in 2 years? 




 Is that a bad thing?
-cracks knuckles- 




 Any more pictures? I'm jealous! 




 Just got her. 









 Well, shit.. 




 Fuck yeah man, manual widows! And someone said that there's an auto detailing subreddit, which could help with the paint and stuff, so you might wanna check that out! 




 Yeah, I'm not a fan of them, but it's what I gotta deal with for a tiny bit of time, and it's the least of my worries.
I will check out auto detailing, and see what they recommend! Thank you! 




 I got her for 1750$, which, for what it is, was surprising. I might need to do a new engine in the future, but I think it will last me at least some time, since I'll mainly only use it to get to work which is ~10 minutes away at most.
I don't plan on running it hard. Thankfully! 




 I'm dumb, I read interior.
Yeah, I mean there's some fading, only on the front by the headlights, so it's not too bad. I will definitely try my best to keep it as clean and nice as possible. 




 Yes, yes it does. That was the main thing I was looking for! 




 I feel you, I don't love it, but it's sort of grown on me since after looking for a car, they're all I can find!
I need to deoxy the headlights, touch up some paint, and she'll be a beaut!
Thank you for the kind words. 




 Believe me, I HATE when people try to make a car something its not.
I haven't gotten it up to anything, unless you count 15-20ish "up", I need to go get tags and all that fun stuff since I literally just got it.
I'm quite excited to play around with it! 




 '95 v6 5 speed 









 I was gonna give you a baby for the 5.0.. damn. 




 Please. 




 Oh I know, its one of the the few blues that I actually have interest in, and holy shit, that must be a thing to see. I've only ever seen one Mach in my area and it was a cobra swap, not as cool other than the glass window in the hood where the shaker was and the neon lights. :P 




 Yeah, its definitely a nice crowd, I've been looking at the Machs, specifically the Azure Blue with a new Engine in it. 




 I've been looking at them for so long, just drooling over them. SVTPerformance has so many great termis, that it hurts to log on to it :( 




 Am I the only one who hasn't gotten one yet.
God damn it. 




 They look purpleish-blue to me. 




 Jack/Geoff 




 Fucking lovely.
Nice ride man. 




 Oh I do too, Currently trying to talk to my credit union to see if I can get it.

 Nawh brah, you don't, you wouldn't be player hatin' 




 Its a Shelby Cobra emblem. 




 brah, gtfo, we don't want you anyways. go enjoy your civic. 




 Yeah, that's what I use. Hoping they'll give me enough for a decent new edge. :D 




 Brah, brah, please. I'm trying to get a loan right now to join the cool kids club. 




 Good. Bitch. 




 OP, pls... 




 Thats an insanely clean Saleen, any more details? And Karma? This subreddit gets MAYBE 10 upvotes hahaha. ;) 




 I rarely find colors that I like, but lava really is beautiful, so is Mystichrome but we can't get that nowadays factory. 




 God I love lava red... 




 Come on Heer_, you're making me a bit too jealous. :(

Gorgeous like always, but maybe a bath would be in need soon. ;P 




 You're all in /r/wtf, did you expect ponies and rainbows. Expect NSFW/L, Gore, ect...  




 So he's a GRAPIST too? 




 Thank you for your answer, and I understand it's a stressful job, and they give you no slack. I've been actually doing really fine, no problems, but then again I still have 9 months until I can MAYBE join, so we'll see if anything changes. Thanks again! 




 Ooooh, I get you! 




 That's my bike. 




 But there is also more v6s than v8s, so that kinda helps out v6s in the lead here. Not saying your wrong though, driver error and neglect is a big part, and I was saying that since he's a teen, he's not gonna be the best at handling power, and paying attention. 




 Idk, I've seen some really stupid football players. No offense to your son, or your family name. And I'm not doubting you, I'm just saying! Hopefully he is mature enough to handle that beautiful beast, and tell him I said congrats on getting a ride to college! It's a lot more than I could have done, haha! 




 Awesome! Thanks! 




 You're 120hp lower than him, though. 




 He's gonna crash it, bet ya 10$. 




 Has no one realized, that they shouldn't use Red Box? 




 I like them, they have a lot of special editions in those years, like the Mach 1, Cobra, Crimson red 40th, Roush, and Saleen which all look incredible. In my opinion they have the best rear of any Mustang, but power isn't huge unless you get a Mach, which has the equivalent power of a recent V6, or a 03/04 Cobra since that's 390hp.  




 *oh* 




 I would definitely go back to golden brown, man. 




 I feel you. I'm going for a Mach 1 in about a month, hopefully I'll have enough funds to get it. I really want a TR 10th Termi but that'll run me 22+ for what I want with it. 




 SVTPerformance has them from 17-35 depending on mods/mileage. Pretty good stuff! 




 WHYY! 




 Hahahah! 




 OP pls respond. 




 Hudson River was a Narrow body, OP is talking about Wide body.
Source:All dem comments. 




 She's 15, not 5. 




 ITT: Suddenly everyone cares about feelings. 




 Yeah, the Mach 1s were styled from the 69's and 70's, hence the style of the gauges, stripes (side and hood), spoiler, hell even the seats! I think they look really good TBH, it's way different from the other NewEdges. 




 I know, he takes care of it! And yes they are factory! 




 Ouch dude, that blows. Thankfully you're alright! Hopefully you get what you want out of this, like you said, a V8! 




 Yeah, hopefully! haha. It's beautiful. 




 Nice, a lightning! 




 My god. 




 It looks really good for it's age.
Nice NewEdge man! 




 C'mon pls. 




 Aww, I feel so bad for him. 




 This is 5 days old, I don't know why you thought the input was needed. 




 I give them credit, that was pretty clever. 




 xD!! 2Funneh! 




 What the fuck. 




 PlS dO ThaT!  




 He's "eye" has a small Purple Heart inside of it. He's probably not ashamed by it and decided to not care, I mean if I had a Purple Heart in my eye, that'd be sick as shit.

Yup. 




 I'd love to help! Don't get me wrong, but I need to focus more on my life and helping myself get through and over obstacles. I will return though to help out. :) 




 Yeah, I'd definitely try to see how low I can go. And probably look at terminators too, since they're my dream car. Gonna be hard to find a TR 10th for under 20k :( 




 Thank you, if I feel down in the dumps, I most definitely will be back for a check up. :) 




 Thank you, that made me laugh! 




 Ha! 




 Thank you all for your kind worded comments. I woke up with a huge smile on my face. :) 




 Cool brah. 




 I replied to the guy who replied to you. It was aimed at both of you, and if you'd like you can read it as reply.

Thank you for your input, and I understand where you're coming from. :) 




 It's definitely about how you look at it.
I understand that it's hard, and you get yelled at, which is fine. It toughens you up. I've wanted to join since I was a small child, it is about pride to me and about the benefits of college, friendship, and strengthening myself. My uncles have gone through it all, and one of my only friends has been enlisted for little over a year in the Marines. Whilst another is currently in BT for the Army.

Yeah you can get lonely, homesick, and all that. But that's life, and that's what I choose.

Thank you, and the guy you commented to, for both of your inputs. I greatly appreciate it! 




 Thank you. 




 Cobras are my favorite. If you have more pictures, r/NewedgeMustang would love to see it. :) 




 Idk man, either way she doesn't look like a Chloe. PERSONAL OPINION RIGHT HERE THOUGH. 




 [Idk man, she looks like Ellen Page.](http://i.imgur.com/BSGQ5I1.jpg) 




 Really hoping to get a NewEdge as soon as I land my job interview tomorrow. ;) 









 Thankfully this one only puts down 405, and not 600's like some of them. ;) 




 That a big fucking probably. 




 Ah, now I see! Would love to see it when you have the new wheels! 
























 brb, brushing my teeth 




 Personally, I dislike cowls and two tone paint and chrome wheels, but it's a 66 and isn't the worst thing I see.

We all have our different tastes and in the end, we all like cars, so.
As long as you enjoy it and like it, thats all that matters. 




 Damn, we just went through Cali too. Went to CC and the saleen show. 




 Your friend is me. lol 




 Arizona? Are you part of DSAZ? 




 no gtx 980, 0/10

but seriously, nice. :) 




 Always get breakfast because they have to make it right then and it's always hot. The other stuff can sit in a heated tray for 30-45 minutes depending on what it is, you never want 40 minute old popcorn chicken. It's just hard and blah. 




 Yeah, we just put on tight gloves so they don't fall off. It's close! 




 Yeah we should have blue band aids, since that's what I was thought, but I don't get them, I just wear the ones we've got and put a glove on. Better then nothing. 




 We're not that awesome with our bandaids, we just get any bandaid that will stand out, so sometimes we have hello kitty, other times we have super heros.

I go for the kitty though. 




 I work at Sonic and we're not allowed to use those bandaids since they blend in. That's fucking gross though, and the lady who refunded you should be fired. Shit wouldn't last where I am. 




 Don't play online then. Or play a closed game. Easy. 




 Miles are high, but it looks good. Headlights are iffy, looks like he home did it.
Definitely drive it yourself and have someone you trust inspect it.

I got my '95 v6 for 1.7k, Sure its a POS but its my POS. 




 I watched a video with a lot of those in there, and what's sad is the video with the yellow car, they passed in really early in the video and about 10 minutes later after shooting up multiple car, they chase it and it's just full of college age kids. Super sad. 




 Damn man, that's rough. I hope you're doing/feeling better. One day, you'll get her again. 




 489 




 faceit needs to not pair me up with Global Elites..

 He's dead. 




 Everyones getting new 5.0s, and I'm back here with my little old 3.8...

I hope this get fixed, is this happening to anyone else?? 




 Heer_, everytime you post, I feel like I have to just say that you own the car I dream of.

This is seriously the highest thing on my list of wants, fuck it, NEEDS.

TR 10th, so sexy.. 




 I got one year to get a Termi. Alright. Let's do this. 




 So there's hope?! Edit:I meant to reply, not add a new thread.. 




 That's a sick idea! 




 I envy you. 




 Pls OP. 




 ouch! 




 Saw one at PAVS last night! Really cool! 




 :) 




 I'd go with the Mach 1 set up, but thats me. 




 Every year this happens. When will people learn.. 




 I was a minor and my parents paid, from what I know, it was kinda expensive, even ambulance rides.. 




 I went to a place, food was decent, had groups, had gym time, meds, a room with a roommate.
I never went to groups the 2nd and 3rd time. I just slept, ate, went to gym, and socialized while they played movies.

They're not bad. 




 can I have an invite? test_subject7776 :) thanks 




 Still wouldn't watch again. 




 Personally no, but I see a Mach 1 with an eaton on it all the time at PAVS. 




 If they call it Terminator, I'm done. 




 bruh..
:( That hurts. 




 'cause turbo 









 Correct. 




 So it was a real Shelby GT? 




 Live in Arizona, never heard of it. 




 Best I could find was yellow on black.. http://www.cafepress.com/mf/87038842/ford-mustang-silhouettehistory_tshirt?productId=1275511089

or go for red on white.. http://www.cafepress.com/mf/87038840/ford-mustang-silhouettehistory_tshirt?productId=1252026288 




 I know that the black stripe widening to the hood scoop is the [Mach look](https://www.google.com/search?q=mach+1+lookespv=2source=lnmstbm=ischsa=Xei=tw29U7mKMtaeyASpwIDICQved=0CAYQ_AUoAQbiw=1920bih=1019), but that's it. 




 WOOO! AZ reppin'!
We're not so boring! 




 Quick question, how do I know the appearance difference between the v6 and the 4 banger? 




 He does what he wants, cause he can. 




 god... no.. 




 True, True... 




 Nothing like a Subaru.... 




 Favorite body style. 




 Yeah! 




 No problem man! 




 He had a neon mustang logo on a stand that sits in his car. Hard to see the stand, but it's there! 









 My god, I want it... 




 Wheres your front end pony? 




 You alive buddy? I hope so, you still have so much time left. 
























 Livin' that dry desert life here! 




 Throw same $$$ my way, and I'll wash it! :P 




 It truly is an amazing color, especially when clean! 




 Mustang English lessons, hell yeah. 




 It does pretty good, if there's a scratch, I don't see it. But there is a deep one on my rear fender from the previous owner, but no one really sees that one too. 




 Me and the 15 probably will always be together. 




 If you got 40k, your dick can grow! 




 The stripe really helps. 




 Anytime dude, never actually seen you, just your photography, keep it up! 




 Hey! You liked my post my man! Good shots dude! 




 That sounds better, thanks! 




 Hell yeah. 




 Same my man. 




 It's purdy, aint it? 




 But he didn't wash it, I did. I'm watching it while he's gone. 




 I always thought it always went "My friend and I" so I just put an 's and cars. :p 




 Yeah, never shows dust until you actually touch the car. Plus it shines magnificently. 




 Yeah... I don't know how else to put it. 









 Sick man, enjoy it when you can!! 




 Yeah, the dealership added the stripes, they also did the tinting of all the cars. I was saying that the Rocker stripes are really just dumb IMO, because while yes, it is 50 years from when Mustangs were made, its just the Base GT with the dealer stripes added. 




 I'm sure he figured, Young guy, Brand new fast car, and doesn't want to get chewed out in the Corps for speeding. Since, in the first place he shouldn't have been driving, he got talked to about that before he came back.
Yup, it was literally one exit before PAVS.
I'm not saying he doesn't deserve one, obviously 40+MPH over could seriously hurt someone, and with what we were doing, I'm slightly surprised we didn't actually hit anything. They gave his GF a ticket, which she's obviously upset about, but she was basically doing what we did, on a lesser extent.
If a cop saw us going up to flagstaff on Friday night, woooo, that'd be a funny thing. 




 We went to San Tan, but a lot were Auto, which isn't what he wanted.
And the stripes are sick, until you realize that its not a 50th, and the side stripes are just annoying when you notice that. [This is the one my friend had bought](http://www.bergeford.com/new/Ford/2015-Ford-Mustang-mesa-az-eb8b4eff0a0a0064487c13719b4589bf.htm) 




 Yessir. 




 Agreed. Performance is lovely. 




 Yeah my friend bought his at Berge, he got 2k off a GT, and that was the most wiggle room they could give him, so they said. So he paid 35k instead of 37, but after taxes and stuff it was low 40 according to his girlfriend. They were really nice and kind about everything. They let us have a test drive (which they're strict about, since who wants a "new" car with 100 miles on it already?). They cracked jokes with us and let him take all the time he wanted with buying. 




 Yeah, they now are kicking everyone out after the classic show is over. Which is silly because they're all old and go to bed at 9.. 




 I think I see more DSAZ members here than on the forums, lmao. 




 I love the 15's, Headroom up front is awesome, being 6'0, sitting in the back is kind of a bitch to put it lightly. The new Mustangs definitely turn more heads than any other car in its class. Personally, I haven't driven it yet so I don't know how it handles, but my friend said it handles amazingly.
And seeing him do a slide in a cul-de-sac, I believe him.
Berge Ford in Mesa had a few GT's, if you actually wanted to drive one. They also have a 50 Years Limited Edition, but its a 50k car. 




 Oh yeah. 




 You're bustin' my balls man. It's lightly used! only 150 miles! 




 Yeah it was! Ton of Mustangs, but in total around 500+ people showed up. Way more than PAVS. 




 250 




 Tempting... Tempting... 




 He got it on the 29th, had it for 6 hours, we went to go to an Instagram meet-up held in Scottsdale. The cop said he saw us going fast but wasn't going to do anything, and then he started going faster, and faster, we hit 95, and then the cop got next to him, no lights on and waited until there was room to pull him over, then he talked him.
From what I was told by my friend and his passenger, is that he told him he was following us for quite some time, and then asked my friend what he does for a living, to which my friend told him hes in the Marine Corps, and the cop said "You don't want to die do you?" and "Do you like your car?", he told him to slow down and to tell me to slow down.
Probably passed at least 5 cars pulled over on the way back.
And his girlfriend got pulled over by the same cop a little bit down the road for 84 in a 55, but wrote her for 74 in a 55.

He was a pretty cool cop, I'm glad he didn't pull me over, or I'd be out a car.

And thus concludes story time. 




 Yeah, plus with the stripe it has, it stands out. 




 No idea. Was from Berge Ford in Arizona. 




 My friend had planned to surprise everyone with him coming home Thanksgiving morning from his Marine MOS school. I went to pick him up at 3am and we surprised everyone. We had planned a trip to Flagstaff for that Friday and before we went up, he wanted to see a few Mustangs, as he told me he wanted to buy a new car. There was this one, or an 04 Cobra with 78k Miles. He drove the GT and we left saying "We will be back tomorrow." After we left, its all we could talk about that night and into the next morning. We came back from Flagstaff and even before he went to our homes, we went to the dealership. His mind was made, and he bought it that day. He already had gotten pulled over once in it for 95 in a 55 (construction zone). (Thankfully they went after him and not me!) I'm the only one he will let look after it and make sure its clean, so I get to buff and wax it tomorrow, since there already is a scratch.
All in all, it's an incredible car, and I've changed my mind about it. I'd want one. 









 The mod is better, IMO. More to do, a lot more. 




 I don't understand why this is a thing. I'm not abusing the kicking power. I'm helping get rid of a troll of the team and we all vote to kick him, Happened 3 times.

I get killing team mates, but giving me a cooldown because I agreed to kick someone who obviously can't play the game is just dumb. 









 Hey, It's Inked! :D 




 You get a free car wash! 




 But... The Termi 4.6 :( 




 Fun fact: That color is called Legend Lime!

That wasn't fun, I'm sorry. 




 on point 




 Yes. 




 I feel like I'm the only one who doesn't have a key, lmao. If anyone has one, just PM me it, thank you! 




 If you need a cowl hood, by all means, get one! 




 I wish, they're seat covers, previous owner put them in to keep the leather in good condition. 




 Looks nice, whats done to it? 




 Meguiar's Ultimate Quik Wax! And Thank you! 









 I love that feelings so much. I always try to park so I can see it from my work. 




 Woo! The more New Edges, the better! Nice catch man. I myself just got a 04 Dark Shadow Gray GT, and man do I love it, mines bone stock as well. Time to build it up! Congrats man! 




 rained really hard in Arizona, not used to it, Went around a turn in my neighborhood and put it in second, went completely sideways and almost hit the curb. (This was in my old '95 v6) 




 Right? Got an old sn95 beater and never hit anything. 




 First mod for me, coyote. Lol. Nice car man, love watching the videos you post of it. 




 Woooo! Lets go 40th anni's! 




 I could never fucking getta Cybunny. 









 Yeah! I saw it, instantly sold my car and went for this. I couldn't pass it up. It's really everything I've wanted. Besides it not being a Termi. Lol 




 Thanks! I appreciate it. 




 It's only ever nice in fall/winter, cause then you can actually stand going outside and it's not 110. Lol 




 Arizona! 




 Got it for 10k 




 I was lucky to find it, someone backed out on buying it, so I went for it. Thank you! I'll treat it nicely. ;) 




 Time to get ALL the stickers. 




 It's a 2004 DSG Mustang GT, 40th anniversary, Premium, has 24.5k miles, no real problems besides just some cosmetic things, like oxidation in the third brake light and on the driver side headlight, has a scratch behind the tire and a small dent, and has a scuff on the passenger side front bumper that I plan of buffing out this weekend.

Overall I'm in love with it, its my favorite body style, has all the little doodads I wanted, (keyless entry and power windows are a god send).

I can't wait to start making changes to it.

 Oh it is cheap, my dash shakes, and the door panel is coming off, whenever I drive, you can hear the plastic in the car shaking. It's really quite sad. 




 I feel you there, I got used to it since its the same as my 95's interior, its just a change in the body style. 




 Dude where? 




 I got approved for a 04 DSG GT, we should start a club or something. 




 I think the New edges had the best designs, for really anything.
Roush, Saleen, SVT, Mach, and just the Basic V6/GT. 




 Dude, soon, Hopefully I'll get approved for a DSG 04 GT. 




 Mine just has all of our bread in it.. 




 This and a TR 10th Cobra are my dream cars, someday. 




 No :(! I didn't know there was one! Pretty sure I saw it leave though, it was black right? 'Cause that thing sounded so good! 




 I looked and I just see imitations. :( 




 Damn, nice turn out :O 




 Basically take the folks with fancy cars, or unique cars, and have a giant meet! 




 True, I did see the wheels man. 




 Ah, so the black 5.0 is his. 




 Didn't bring, need gas for the cruise tonight. But I have the POS red 1995 v6. With the loud power steering. Lmao. 




 Yeah man, DSAZ! 









 I own a 95 v6, and damn do I fill up often.. But I like my car, but I do want to get rid of it and get something better. 




 Soon.... 




 I know with my little 95 v6, when I rev, it's mostly engine noise, no exhaust. Maybe he's talking about that? 




 Thats what I'm thinking, but my friend is currently doing Marine training, so hes not here, we're just trying to fix it up for him when he gets back, but I do know its got BBK CAI, Cobra Intake Manifold, Short Throw Shifter, Pretty sure no Muffler that I could see.

Believe me, I'm trying to find the Modlist that he has, Earliest I can know is Tuesday when he leaves MCT to go for MOS school, I can keep you posted! 




 Oh we will, but this is the first time it's started in a while and it was 9pm, we went around the neighborhood and the neighbors came out and told us to stop since it was 9:30. The car hasn't had tags for 2 years so we're working on getting that all sorted out, but once thats done.. Gonna fucking rev the shit out of it. 









 Oh yeah. 




 Found a DSG 04 GT in my area, but I'm short 10 grand. Lmao. But you're welcome man, kinda wanna black one out now. 




 That is a really good looking GT.

One day... 




 Awesome to see other members! 




 DSAZ? 




 NRG, cause, energy 




 Pretty sure its his, check history. 




 Duuuude that'd be cool. 




 Gotcha. 




 We have different tastes, I LOVE the new edge style. But I can see where you're coming from, outside of the mustang group a Termi is just a mustang and not a special car, but a Shelby is a big deal because, well Shelby. 




 A low mile Mystic goes for 30-35k On SVTP. There's one on there with 1k miles and it's about 33ish I wanna say. And you can find a decent 10th anni for 20-25k. If they went for double that, it wouldn't be my achievable dream car. :P 




 I don't know man, SVT Cobras get a lot of attention and they're in the 22k range. 




 Mouth is feels better, I even scrubbed my tongue and used mouth wash. I feel like a new person! 
























 [By all means, here are some pictures of my car](http://imgur.com/a/xBliL) I think finding a Saleen is gonna be hard. ;P, You should deff blend the NewEdge colors for the banner. 




 Oh gosh, the Third Brake light got shitty on you too?
I just replaced it with raxiom's. I never really bothered to see how to fix it. But I've noticed it a lot of NewEdges. 




 I'd love to see a Saleen, Roush, Termi, and a Mach in that! And maybe my car too... ;) lmao.  




 [Me!](http://imgur.com/a/xs8SH) 




  No! 




 That god damn hood, man! Meanest looking car, and I would maybe possibly trade my car for one. 




 Fucking love the Tans Am. WS6, correct? 




 Anything is possible, my friend. 




 Correct, sir! 




 [Imagine this, but with your car](http://i.imgur.com/qTas1lJ.jpg) 




 I couldn't find it.. :( I made it all flarey and purple and blue and stuff.
God damn it. 




 I edited this picture a long time ago, I'm gonna see if I can dig it up! (I did a shit job tho) 




 I love MG!  




 I know. I'm saying I want an 01. 




 I'll just take the 10th Anni off your hands, real quick. 




 NewEdge 4 Lyfe. 




 I NEED one. There was one for sale near by, but 400$, and poor 18yr old = no new bumper. 




 Termi hood, 01 cobra bumper, paint and invisible bra. i'd be set for life. 




 How much did you get, god damn. 




 Stangmods has them, 200$ and MrBodyKit has them for like 160$ he has regular and smoked. 




 Hurry, someone back into my front so I can get an 01 Cobra bumper. 




 It won't be stock for long ;) gonna get an exhaust set up as soon as my tax refund gets here, then lower it, CAI, Gears. Just gotta save money here and there. Things surprisingly quick. I feel like the 0-60 time has to be off, it doesn't feel like 5.4 seconds at all. I definitely am more of a "look good" type of guy. At least at this point, since I went from 145HP to 260HP and it was quick the difference. DSG is easily one of the best colors for NewEdges, or really any mustang. It hides dirt and dust pretty good, it's just rock chips that it shows like no other.  Hopefully you get your GT sometime in the near future. So much fun. 




 I try really hard.  




 Ooo. Is it Torch Red? Cause that shits my fave. And I want a gen 2 lightning so bad...  I appreciate it man! 




 Shucks... Thanks man! 




 Believe me, I didn't either! I had to ask around on IG to see where people got them. 




 Stop, I'm blushing.  




 StangMods has them, and MrBodyKit has normal and smoked. If I found the smoked ones, I would have gotten those, they look really good. 




 And faster ;) 




 DSG 4 LYFE!!!!! 




 Good move. :) 




 Thanks man, I thankfully have a friend whose a great photographer and is easy going.

DSG is the best. That, and Torch Red.. and Mysti.... 




 Hopefully. Maybe he'll start small like the rest of us, I went from a 95 v6 to an 04 GT. 




 Pretty much, only changes are:
Clear corner headlights (Raxiom Elite bulbs)
Smoked taillights (LED bulbs and sequential)
Smoked third break light (LED)

I have smoked fog lights, just no one wants to help put them in, lmao.

I'm buying a Borla ATAK catback in the next ~week or so.
So, I'll post that when it comes! ;D 




 My friend was pretty smug, always saying he was the fastest of the group, and his girlfriend even bought him 2k$ in car parts (Exhaust and a CAI), but thats all gone now, and he has to sell the car.

I'm the fastest now. B) 









 If you wanna see my friends wrecked '15... I can make you feel better... 




 Listened to you for awhile, and now you're big enough that my work plays your music.
Which is so awesome. I'm happy you've grown, you've always been an incredible artist! 




 Ayyyyye DSG 




 Really jealous of you right now. 




 Hey boss, I wasn't leaning. I was uhhh... 




 I've worked at a Sonic. This isn't a common thing. Hell, I couldn't even lean on any table. I guess it really just depends on what state you're in. The East Valley in Arizona is safe, though. 




 How many miles and the such? I got my 04 GT with 24k miles for 9 something. But then it was 2014 Winter. But still..  




 This. 




 This is not my car, it is my friends and I was a passenger at the time of the accident.

Story:
Went to go around a [Con-Way Freight truck](https://media.glassdoor.com/o/40989/con-way-freight-office.jpg), we had just turned onto a new street and were in 2nd, max speed I feel was 50, and when he turned to go into the other lane to pass, he turned too sharp and it kicked out and we went into the curb, then bounced and hit the truck and went under it a bit (rear bumper has a huge hole in it, and the c pillar is smashed and rear glass is all gone). After hitting the truck we went back into the curb and bounced over it, down a ditch and hit a tree.

I think its going to get totaled. What do you guys think?

It only had a CAI and a Cat-back. 




 9 grand for an 03 v6 :O 




 HA. 




 Rest in Peace PJ. It was hard. 




 This car was a PAVS on saturday! Really nice car. 




 Awesome! :D 




 Edit your flair. It's on the right hang side if the page! :) 




 yeah, thats what bugs me the most about this. 




 right? 




 Just leave the outside completely wrecked and make it the ultimate slow sleeper stang. Sounds like a good plan. I'd love it. 




 Jeeeeez. Just do an entire coyote swap! Hahaha, are you going to paint it the original color, or something different? 




 At least you own it man, all money goes to car parts! All my money goes to paying the bank so that one day I could own him. :( And that would be sick as fuck. 




 probably, but it's still a drawing and I still love it.

See [this](http://i.imgur.com/lGepAOD.jpg) for the updated version I had him do. 




 I see! Your flair says ugly POS. But hey, my '95 v6 was a POS, but a Mustang is a Mustang! 




 camera trick, my friend pops light whilst the camera takes continuous photos. Do that multiple times and then put it all together and theres the result! 




 [Updated, final version](http://i.imgur.com/lGepAOD.jpg) 









 It didn't like my friends '15, lol. 




 @the_mustang_artist on IG or " The Mustang Artist " on Facebook. 




 I'm having him do mine too! Can't wait! 




 OH OKAY, COME OVER 




 BUT IS THAT A GOOD IDEA? 




 I KNOW. DO YOU WANT TO PURCHASE ME SPRINGS? FOR JUST 2$ A DAY, YOU COULD HELP A 4x4 MUSTANG BECOME THE MENACING LOWERED BEAST IT ALWAYS DREAM OF BEING. 




 That stock 4x4 status, eh? I do need to lower it. 




 The friendship, then the 'stangs. ;) 









 Yeah, DSG is the best color. My friend got a Magnetic, and I like it but I LOVE DSG. If DSG was an option, I think it'd sell like hot cakes. 




 If only I was in HS back then. :( 




 I try really hard. 









 199.99! :P 




 I'm mad now. 









 Right? I hate my plate. But I ordered a new one. "04DSGGT" 




 Hell yeah! I think DSG is a great color. And no prob man! 




 2004 DSG GT Coupe with the 40th anni Package. And yourself? (Car looks awesome BTW, can't wait to do a Grille Delete.) 




 Bought new Clear Corner headlights for my baby. Also bought new taillights, third brake light, some quarter marker tint, sequential harness, and a shit ton of LEDs and bulbs.

I did buy new foglights, but I haven't installed them yet, but I plan on doing it sometime this weekend, I bought the smoked ones from AM. 









 TKO! Fucking love his car man. 




 When your girlfriend says shes home alone. 




 Would need to see it in a better picture. 




 Thats basically the dip on it right now, it's not hulk green anymore. 




 Correct. 




 Both are dipped by the same people. 




 Its a Cali special, so its a v8.
Its on bags, so she can change her ride height.
It's not cambered. 




 I like her lime green more than her hulk green, tbh. 




 S550s and 4cyl are cool in my book man. 




 Oh my bad! They put nitrogen in the tires. [This](http://www.nitrofill.com/) 




 They added in nitrogen and tint and the stripe, so I don't know how much the stripe by its self costed, but they did charge for it all. 




 I think double stripes looks amazing as while. Definitely has to be black on white. Or some bright color. And the dealer put the stripe on before he bought it,  so it was included. 




 This is what made me love New Edges, such a phat ass. Shaved rear is the best IMO. 




 Check my submit history for a picture of Magnetic with stripe(s) on it. I personally think, the stripe brings the car together. 




 Hell yeah, if I see any mustang, I try and park next to it, or as close as I can. Even if they person doesn't car about the history and community of it. 




 Ill find some owners who love to park next to me, and then I find some who just don't care and park anywhere. Then there's the ones who don't care about the community behind the car, it's just another car to them. It really is just a luck of the draw. My friend gets all the mustangs parked next to him, but that's cause he's got a 15. 




 I love my '04 GT, its fast enough and fun enough for me. 




 driven the tricycle, most fun i've had. 




 And you killed him!? God, man.. 




 I can't remember a lot of things either, Idk if it was the depression, or the amount of pills I've taken all at once. 




 Love the fog, I wish it got like that around my place! Would be sick for some photo-shoots! 




 I didn't make them, my friend came over and took 25-30ish shots of each car with different parts of the car lit up, some with headlights on, some not, some interior light pops, mostly outside light pops. Garage door open, and closed. And he just mashed them together.   Put yeah, probably Lightroom and PS. Lol 




 Thanks man! I do too. ;) 




 I think 47 MSRP is pretty fair. 60+ isn't though. 




 It is 1 of 1964 though..

But the dealer near me has one for 47k, so it's still high as fuck. 









 Yeah.... That's true... Lol 
























 HR Super Sports with no ISOs, low as fuck. 




 But hey man, now you can spend money on your v8. Get some fat meat and lower it. But lower it first. I've seen 315s on stock height, it's not pretty. 




 I mean obviously we all want 18x10.5 for some fatties.  




 Trade.  




 Yooo, and we're both in AZ. Whaaaat! 




 Ayyyyyyyye! Your ride is wicked too man! I seriously want those wheels though dude, like really bad. 




 But... how.. D:? 




 Well ya, m8. 




 Or, ya know... We held the flags up, then shopped ourselves out. 




 Orion? lol 














 I get this reference. 




 Yeah same here! I thought it was just another "Regular Show", but damn, I was wrong. 




 If you could check, that'd be awesome. I'm starving over here for some Oreo O's!  




 And I must say, I never expected to love a show this much. Can't wait to see the new season! 




 Yeah, I've traded to SK before for Oreo O's.  damn, they went up in price... 2 years ago I got 6 boxes..  




 Hello! I'm from Arizona, USA. I am looking for a couple boxes of Oreo O's Cereal, and I know only South Korea makes them. I'm also looking for other random Korean snacks as well.
Just tell me what you're looking for and I will try!
Thank you! 




 Man, I went to my mom and started asking questions about what just happened. Looking back, I cringe about asking her what the stuff was and why it came from there. 




 I feel, brother. 




 My friend drives a Chevy, and we shoot shit about each other.  




 Fuck yeah, I have experience to comment! Where I worked, the franchise paid minimum wage to drivers (8.05) but after a checklist, you'd get a 50 cent raise (8.55) we made 5% on all deliveries, and only delivered 5-8 mins from the store. Not all that bad, can quickly get deliveries since it's all fast-paced, meaning I could do 12 deliveries in a few hours with 3 other drivers (this was at a slow store) so I'd come home with 30-50 bucks for a few hours of driving. (Though I had a V8 and got 13mpg so it all went to my tank) I wouldn't do it again. Not with my car. Management was good, but I rubbed them the wrong way once and got fired. Oh yeah, and the daily beatifications suck dick. There's a list of things that NEED to be done before the day is over and basically only drivers can do it. 




 I wouldn't call them Mustang Cobras, SVT GT500 sure, but SVT Cobras are 93-04 




 Nah, lmao. But that's what people think. ;) 




 Shitty service after you buy a car tho!!! Lmao 




 Nah. It's from it being cold. The photo is from around December I believe. 




 Yeah, right after the bridge. 




 I mean, I guess man. 




 315's. GG 



















 Betta try man. Or get a Cowl with Heat Extractors. 




 No Problem my dude! Enjoy! 




 What's it like living with a celebrity? 




 As far as I know, Gibson does exhausts, I do see new wheels on it though. 




 damn.. lmao, how much did you get? 




 I think just the emblem alone would look nice. 




 An exhaust. 




 I'll bite,
152
FN Orion - which was traded for an FN Road Rash!

And thats wicked, dont ever sell that knife, lol 




 Staaahp I'm blushing. The photographer is actually my friend named Daniel! Every photo I post is basically his! And hey man. We all started somewhere. I started with a beat up 1995 v6, and I loved it. It just takes a little time and you'll get the Mustang you want! I'm not even close to where I want to be, I'll probably slowly trade this up to Mach then a Terminator. And man, DSG, it really is one of the best New Edge colors, on any model! Again, thanks man. I means a lot! 




 I just wanna boost it so bad. I could finance a procharger from a member of my mustang club, he works at stage3motorsports, but it's like 500$ a month, or 5k out right. If rather pay my car off first. And thanks man. You always have something nice to say, which is awesome. 




 I wish I had a Torch Red, so.. Trade? Lol. Thanks man! I appreciate that. 




 Thank you! That means a lot! 




 Yeah, my friend focused on the headlight so the rear is blurry. It's not the best photo but it's something different, thanks man! I appreciate it. 














 Oh most definitely, they are superb at service. Just wish they had Clear Corners.. 




 It's just the headlights, it's about 200$ from StangMods. Though if you go Clear Corner, I'd try to do a Switchback lighting turn signal and HIDs. That amber bulb in a clear light is gonna annoy you. It annoys me so much. 




 I got them from StangMods. I personally don't like the customer service they have. And I now have water marks in my lights. So rip to me. 




 I got mine from StangMods, though I wouldn't recommend them. They're customer service is pretty shot. 




 I'm just dumb, I got it. My b man. 




 You there man? Whats your steam? 




 I got water marks in my driver side light now, so its not pretty. :((( Clear corners are wicked though, right? 









 If only OP would respond.. Lol. If the bread was in the Customer restroom. That's just begging to get in trouble. 




 Do I think it's gross, sure. But it's covered and unopened, I rarely ever saw us put bread in the restroom, sometimes you just gotta do what you need to do. Lol. 




 Ex-Sonic Employee here:
Mine has done this too, You probably were in the Employee restroom, (Which has an entrance from inside the store, and the outside.) We can't fit all the buns in one room so we'd put them in the restroom that no one is suppose to be in, until we could move stuff around and fit them, or the bread man would take them back on his truck. They're usually there for maybe 2 hours tops.

You probably were in the restroom you shouldn't have been, and no one uses it, at least at my old store, whilst food is in.
Plus that restroom looks clean af.
 




 Eh, I sold my first car to use as a down payment on my current car. 




 Hey man, You won! Sadly I can't trade it since I guess you can't trade unboxes until a week later. :/ But send me your Steam and I'll add you and give it to you on the 3rd! Sorry about the mess, I'm just really dumb. lmao, and you're welcome man! 




 Hey guys, I haven't done a give-away in a long long time, so I figure I might as well with the new update!
[It, as of this moment of posting, is worth about 4$](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/StatTrak%E2%84%A2%20USP-S%20%7C%20Torque%20%28Field-Tested%29)
[This is my profile.](http://steamcommunity.com/id/test_subject7776) Comment a number between 1-1000 and I'll pick a winner tomorrow around 6pm Mountain time.
Thanks guys! Have a good one.
EDIT: I just realized that since I unboxed it, I can't trade it ASAP, so I will add the winner and trade you on the 3rd of June (1 week from now) That is my fault, I'm sorry.


**GIVE-AWAY OVER, THANK YOU ALL WHO HAVE GIFTED FOR ENTERING** 




 Thank you man! Flawless everywhere but the usual front bumper/hood.  damn rocks... 




 Also, I know about my horrendous 4x4 status, I ordered some parts, just need to keep saving for the rest. ;) 














 Oh yeah. You start to see them everywhere, even when you're not driving. And when they're going the other way. 




 [The Roush 360R had White with Blue stripes, Looks amazing!](http://www.mustangworld.com/ourpics/news/select54/andrewsdvf4.jpg) 




 I need those wheels... Good wicked! 




 Hot, Looks really good! 




 You won't regret it, Borla's cost a lot, but my god, you are paying for music. And thanks man! I appreciate it, I try really hard lmao. 




 ye, ye. 




 It's just Borla ATAKs. I'm going for lowering springs next, then bigger wheels, and then I'll finish my exhaust. 




 Like sex. It has a drone, but as do all loud exhausts. Borla was definitely the way to go. I have a few sound clips on IG @Lol_You_Looked, it really sounds great when you get on it, in all gears, except 5th, 5th is really quiet. 




 At the moment, just Borla ATAKs, really wanna try and get BBK LTs and O/R H. 




 That actually looks very good, god damn! 














 Bruuuuh, Thats sick af. 









 If this was my house, I'd cry! It's a beautiful venue for weddings and the such. As we were shooting, 3 Disney Princesses went in. Was very tempting to ask them to pose for the photos. P.S. I might be getting lowering springs.  









 Thank god I live in the desert! 




 Booty Booty Booty.
How do you like 315's? I want some. 




 Mineral Gray tho.. ;) 




 A donation buttom would be 100x better, cause it doesn't hurt anyone, and helps the mod developers. 









 Friends '15 5.0 got hit in basically every panel and wheel and it wasn't totaled, so I'm assuming you're going to be fine. 




 Exactly! But winning feels pretty good. ;) 




 Very very true. But I don't feel too bad for losing, compared to how many mods he has. 




 It was a good race, we trash talked for a good week before the race. It came down to the wire, but he pulled a tad bit. :P 115.88 a stock motor isn't bad in my book. I just need to work on launching. 




 [Video of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZbYlPzafk) 









 I think it's a bot. Idek. 




 [Basically r/Mustang and r/NewEdgeMustang..](http://2015-ford-mustang.tumblr.com/page/10) 




 lol @ the person downvoting everyone. 




 I hate when people don't go with reputable exhausts, cause that shit can sound either good, or dog shit. I looked at so many catbacks before getting ATAKs, I was considering Flows or Magnas, but Borla just suits it.
I got mine from CJ Pony Parts, But both AM and CJ hiked the ATAK price up.. :( 847$ is a bit much. 800$ is O.K. I have a discount from a Mustang Club I'm in, so I got it for 760$. 




 [Heres the first ever start-up.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDQGhuYuEpk) 




 I didn't really notice any difference from inside the cabin, besides when I accelerate.. ;) I would recommend ATAKs to anyone who can get their hands on them. 




 This is true! I had heard that people said ATAKs on a 2v were too high pitched, but this is perfect. 




 ;D 




 Thanks man, Definitely turns a few heads now! 














 I promise it will. That bumper though.  




 Good. I'm glad. Cringe man. Cringe like you you've never cringed before. 




 I can't put it on until HOPEFULLY this weekend. So I thought, might as well do dumb shit with it. So yes, I hit make a sexy pose with it. I made my brother take the photo, please help me. And of course I'll post a sound clip. I'm so excited! 




 Brb, stripping my interior! 




 No one needs to talk man! Talking is over-rated. lmao. 




 * Can we g--- **BRWAAAAHHHH!!!**
What?
* I said, Can w--- **BRWAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!**
I'm sorry, what?
* Ca--- **BRWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!**
Fuck it!


Thats literally going to be my car now.
And I'm fucking excited. 




 Ayyyye lmao 




 I got mine from StangMods! 









 Give me the front bumper, and I'll buy you a steak dinner.
