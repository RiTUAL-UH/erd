 Oh... She laughed hysterically after I did some explaining.  




 How is this funny? 




 A few years back, my friend and I were walking through Target and they had some of these up. She literally got super pissed off that they would make something so dumb and useless and thought they were for cats or some other small animal. I had to explain that they were for display purpose only and not for actual use. She felt pretty dumb. It was awesome. I make fun of her any time we come across anything miniature. To her credit, she was a super stoner back then.  




 Yep... I am a parent of three little girls. I would never pull this.  I want to punch most parents nowadays! 




 I laugh harder and harder every time I watch it. 




 OP must not have kids. I would rather wait an extra 10 minutes in the car than get all of my kids out of the car and have to corral them while in the restaurant. Drive through ANYTHING is a lifesaver when there are small children in the car.  




 That's an adorable baby. Also, a great idea for a baby shower game. 
























 Anyone else see a blonde Emma Stone? 




 Will someone please explain to me why shoes like the one the dude is wearing are in style? The are SO ugly. God, I'm getting old. 




 Yes! Nothing Bundt Cake. Sooo ridiculously good. Lemon flavor?  




 Possibly she's a poo-roctologist  




 What... What is it? 




 Wait... I shouldn't have drawn that on her face when she told me I could? 




 She told me I could. 


































 Mr. Owl says, "The world may never know". 




 They accidentally called her Sarah, instead of Jenny. DAMN YOU JENNY! 




 I lol'ed. Quite a rare occurrence lately for me on r/funny.  




 I am going to watch this video over and over again. Is it because I think the cat and bunny are cute, you ask.... Uhhhh sure. It's the bunny and cat that I think are cute. Fucking cute as FUCK.  

               




 Thanks anyway. You have a great night, too. 




 I know. Same thing applies to  humans who are colorblind. Still thought it was funny when I saw it Yahoo images. 





























 You want to know what is wrong with the tea cup ride?! That fact that it isn't a ride that has a height requirement. I want to enjoy the rides that my kids CAN'T go on!  Totally forgot about the restaurant in Pirates. I will have to go there, too! Childless. Yes!  




 Fun fact:
My husband and I are going to Disneyland next Friday for our anniversary... Without any of our 3 kids. Muahahaha(that was evil laughter, in case you couldn't tell)! This way we get to ride the bigger kid rides. Screw the little kids and their stupid Teacup and It's a Small World rides. I am about to make your plot twist a reality! BAM! 




 It's supposed to rain on Thursday in Southern California. Well, this is according to the weather app on my iPhone. So, it probably won't rain after all. I guess I will put my rain boots away.  :( 




 Not smart... or possibly a drunk? 




 Quick... Someone try a laser pointer! 




 Up... Fucking... Vote  




 I fucking love that someone actually took the time to make a video of how to fix that.

***thinking*** 

"HMMM... What should I do today? Oh, know just the thing!" 




 Nope. I honestly made it because I am extremely over all of the posts. None of them were funny in the first place.

 Best. Fried. Chicken. EVER! 




 Why doesn't this have more upvotes?  









 Oohhh come on, you down voters. That line was totally called for. Maybe a bit over used... But so is your mom. HEEEEYYYOOOO!!! 




 That's what she said... HEEEYYYOOO! 




 You rock... Calling now. 




 Super PHAT! 
























 After only reading the title, I came here to bitch about that story being cool but not funny... Then I saw the picture. 

You won this round. 









 This, my friend, deserves an upvote! 




 Who are mostly Catholic that need to go to church... Do they kind of became 1st rudest again?

 I think you need to have given birth in order to have a IUD implanted. Not positive, though.  




 Excuse me... A human. I don't see how it is fair to take that HUMAN'S life. I have been in the "young and irresponsible pregnant girl" place. Now I have a beautiful 8 year old daughter. It isn't my place to have decided whether or not she got to develop from some cells into an actual baby. I wasn't ready to be a mother, but I figured it out.  Honestly, I had to grow up quickly... But I would never go back and change it. I will NEVER agree with abortion. Sorry if you don't agree with me.  That is the joy of being a human and not just a clump of developing cells that doesn't get a say in anything. 

Rant done.  




 Yeah... What a weird hobby. Trying to save an innocent baby's life. SMH.  


































 If I ever see anyone with this sticker, but it is spelled correctly... I am going to secretly peel off the "e" and the apostrophe. That way, all of the redditors can comment on what an idiot THAT driver is. Even though the driver is most likely a grammar nazi themselves. MUAHAHAHAHA--evil laugh. 




 I agree, as well. However, people that place this many "anti-whatever" things in their car, make me roll my eyes. 




 As a republican, people like this embarrass the shit out of me. 




 That moment you are so annoyed that you can't even blink.  




 Oh, fuck yeah waffles.... Oh yeah... Keep toasting... KEEP TOASTING.... OH YEAH, keep toasting...I'M ABOUT TO POP OUT OF THE TOASTER.... OOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHH
OOOOH YES!  Oooohhh yeah... You like that frosting all over you? You fucking toasty little waffle.

 Oohh... That WAS a really interesting video. Now I want to throw up!  




 I just... I just... I just... I can't stop watching it. If it isn't on my computer, it is playing on repeat in my mind. So funny! 














 Upvote, because... Cats.  




 This picture makes me really uncomfortable when I look at it...  




 I was doing a frowny face. Apparently I am REALLY good at a frowny face.  





























 That's it. I am deleting my Reddit app. I don't need to come back anymore. It can't get any better than this...





Who am I kidding... Reddit owns me. I'll be back tomorrow. Or in an hour. Or maybe I will just keep browsing for a little bit longer(4-5 hours longer will suffice for tonight). 




 Uh-oh... Careful now. The wrath of Reddit may come down on you for posting a pic of your kid on Reddit. They no likely. I have learned from mistakes.  




 Woman here... This is an insane amount of shit to bring on a trip. Also, do I really see nail polish remover? Who... Who honestly thinks they are going to need nail polish remover while on vacation?

 Hahaha! That kid's face..."Uuugh .. Fuck!" 




 Oh man... I know that feeling all too well! 









 The first time I saw this on Reddit, about 4 different times ago, it took me WAAAY too long to find what was wrong with the picture. That day I hadz the dumbz. 





























 I was scrolling and scrolling, looking for someone to have posted Anchorman. I almost thought it may have not been posted. Thank goodness you had the good sense to post it!

"60% of the time, it works every time." 




 Haha! I love the "animals doing funny things" type videos. This one is a favorite of mine... 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ExukCRD7gN0 




 I think that was my favorite part, too.  




 Hahaha... Why do I have so many down votes? This wasn't a negative comment.  I was basically saying that I wish this was the first image I saw on Reddit. It is hilarious.  




 I just immediately opened this link in Safari and saved the image so I could share it with like 17 different people(ok, maybe 3 people). Can I just delete my Reddit account and open a new one so that I can tell everyone a year from now that this was the image that brought me to Reddit? This is probably my favorite thing I have seen on here, so far. 




 Yep, Southern California here as well. I bet they were more afraid that there was water falling from the sky.

 Maybe 3rd nipple? 









 I take the same medici... Oh hey, look, a bike. 




 He must have given away all of his spoons... Because clearly he doesn't give a fork! 
 









 "I guess I shall allow a picture after my primping, you puny human. However, you will not be granted my gaze into the camera." 




 Oh my God... Thank you. I can't handle when people do this. A little piece of me dies when someone I love says "seen this" without something like "have you" preceding it. 




 Your mother's behavior sounds extremely erratic. I really think that maybe your dad should push seeing a psychologist or something along those lines. If she has never been like this before, yet all of the sudden is so mean and unsupportive, there could be some much deeper issues going on. I am in NO WAY condoning her behavior. It makes me sick to think that a mother could be that demeaning and evil towards her own child and their spouse. I just think that maybe she could have developed some mental issues that need to be handled by a professional. However, I highly suggest that you have your Dad push the issue of seeing a professional. Until she can control her ludicrous behavior, I that you and your wife should cut off all contact from her. 




 I have done both. Should such occasion arise that I am in need of nail polish remover, I would find a nail salon. A polish change is only about $5. 




 Doesn't she grab the purse to hit the dude with it?
