 I've tried to play Fallout 1, but I just couldn't get into it. And I love turn-based RPGs, so not liking the turn-based RPG in one of my favorite series rather surprised me. I'm told FO2 is actually the best of all of them, so is it worth my time or should I just stick to one of the eighty other games I own? 




 I'm no expert on building PCs, but it seems like a case would only restrict the parts and increase heat. If I can manage heat and wires without a case, is it worth it if I'm not planning on moving it around? 


































 Is the Helix Fossil like Goomyism or are we okay with it? 









 If the Boss (and co-op player) had their respective Iron Saints suits and wanted to take over the universe, could anyone stop them? Assume they're fully upgraded, and not every takeover has to be necessarily hostile.  




 A fight to the death with medieval weaponry, taking place in Hell so I can watch.  














 What one character could kill Mr. House, then win the Second Battle of Hoover Dam? Without destroying the Dam or the Wasteland, limited by Fallout's rules.  




 I mean, I love Frozen, and what they did with him. But he wasn't... *needed*. He could have been cut out of the movie entirely and his screentime could have been put towards character development of the other three. He does provide a shocking reveal, but that really feels more like it was to justify his presence. Other than that, he's just an antagonist for the sake of being an antagonist, which almost seems like it was shoehorned in at the last minute. I'm just not convinced he needed for the story the movie was telling.  
























 In a post-nuclear war setting, goods would be more valuable than worthless pieces of tin. Paper money and coins were backed by the gold standard until very recently, when we switched to stocks. But there are no stocks, and presumably no one has a giant fort full of gold, so what standard are caps held to? And for that matter, who decided that Nuka-Cola caps should even be the currency? I'm not very well-acquainted with the lore, so sorry if this is made brutally obvious at some point.  




 No superpowers, no miracles, post-crucifixion Jesus, both bloodlusted. 









 No armies, no assistance, just liberation.  




 I have an HP Pavilion DV6-6b47dx, with a 64-bit Windows 7, and sometimes the sound card will just randomly decide to stop working when I plug in my headphones (just normal Apple earbuds that came with my phone.) What's going on and how do I stop it?  














 I would but I don't know how.  




 If so, what about it do you want to see represented or further developed? 




 Who wins in a battle of turn-based-RPG gods? Kefka is final form.  




 I have [this](http://reviews.cnet.com/desktops/dell-dimension-e510-pentium/4507-3118_7-31555136.html) lying around and I wanted to take it apart and put it back together with newer parts. Can I do this or should I just start brand new? 




 All the Disney Princesses are in the same place when the outbreak occurs. Who lasts the longest? Who's in what position? How long do they last? And yes, the ones from Frozen count too.  




 Both fully powered up and upgraded. I chose the specific games (Mega Man X and Super Metroid) because they're the more open, dynamic re-imaginings of NES classics on the SNES.

 Link has all items and upgrades, while Cloud gets all Materia and his Ultima sword. Cloud is also at maximum level. Fight to the death. 

Previous discussions with slightly different rules: 

http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1qxpi7/cloud_strife_ffvii_vs_link_tloz/

http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1d38bg/cloud_ff7_vs_link_loz/


EDIT: By the way, I converted Link's hearts in LoZ to FF HP and vice versa. The smallest amount of damage Link can receive is 1/4 hearts, while Cloud's is 1 HP. 1 heart = 4 HP, meaning the formulas are:

HP/4 = hearts
Hearts*4=HP

Link at maximum has 80 HP, meaning any hit from Cloud at level 99 will kill him to death. Meanwhile, Cloud gets 2499.75 hearts.  




 My friend and I were playing TF2 together when he found a (clean) Dragonborn Helmet. I tricked him into trading it to me for a Backburner. I feel as though I have cheated my close friend.  









 I need this for Left 4 Dead.  














 I want a Blu Ray drive to put in my build, what's the best one to get that isn't too expensive? 




 I think we need some new words for our religion. Rather than using words with Christian origins like 'heretic' we should get some new, original words. All in favor? 














 To start, this is going to be based on other theories, specifically the [Link is dead in Majora](http://youtube.com/watch?v=7S1SVkysIRw) theory. 

It is said at the beginning of A Link Between Worlds that Zelda is directly descended from the Zelda who helped the Hero of Time. We can assume from this that all Zeldas are descended from each other, beginning with Skyward Sword. This means that every Link is most likely related to his Zelda. It is also implied that all Links are related in the same way, with the Hero's Shade in Twilight Princess referring to TP Link as "son". It is confirmed that the Hero's Shade is the embodiments of the regrets of the Hero of Time, specifically the child timeline. Thing is, if we're assuming child Link died in the Lost Woods as a child, he couldn't have had children of his own. Twilight Princess's Link still has to be related to the Hero of Time, however, or else he's not Link. So someone genetically related to Link had to have a descendant who ended up as the Hero of TP. Remember that all Zeldas are related to the Zelda from Skyward Sword. And all Links are related to that Link. And all Zeldas and Links are related. They may be distant relatives (or siblings, but that's a different theory), but Zelda is probably the best bet for the great-great-grandmother of Twilight Princess' Link. This would also explain how there are still Links on the Dead Link timeline, which includes the original game and Link to the Past.  









 It sounds awesome but I want to make sure I can run it at any kind of settings. I currently have an hp pavilion dv6-6b47dx. Can I run it or should I wait until I get a better PC to get it? 




 I will always treasure when this was a thing.  









 I already have a laptop that runs pretty well, but I do want a better PC and I currently only have $500. Should I save up my money or can I get something good out of what I have? 



















 Articuno? Kyurem? I need snow tomorrow and I want to know which legendary makes this happen.  




 HE WAS MAKING LEMONADE THE WHOLE DAMN TIME 









 It was a screencap of a khajiit named Nigglywiggly, and the player could ask "What's wrong, Niggly?" And he responded with "faggot stole my shibbledibble, go fucking get it." I can't seem to find it anywhere, and I need this in my game. Anyone know where I can get it? 









 I want to be able to run higher-end games, is there any way to install a graphics card, perhaps externally? Sorry, I'm not all that technical.  




 Just looking at Portal and Portal 2, it's made very apparent that GLaDOS has no regard for Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics. For those unaware, Asimov's laws are as follows:
1. A robot may not harm a human being, even through inaction. 
2. A robot must obey orders given to it by a human being, unless these orders interfere with the first law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence, unless this protection violates the first or second law.

GLaDOS was made for testing. It is shown multiple times that she is perfectly content with breaking the first law, as long as it means good science. She also neurotoxined the enrichment center, thereby breaking every aspect of the first law. She also breaks the second law, as the Aperture employees tried everything in their power to get her to stop murdering everybody. In the final boss fight of the first game, she defends herself, sure, but with rockets and neurotoxin. She has broken every law of robotics. Even if she was corrupt, she wouldn't have had the power to consciously break every inhibitor she had. 

But what is she didn't have these inhibitors?
As previously stated, GLaDOS was made for testing. She was not programmed to follow any laws of roboethics, and all she was built with was an urge to test, especially if the test was fatal. Everyone who worked on her was a criminal, who very clearly disregarded all laws relating to their practice. GLaDOS was designed with near-infinite intelligence, as well as a conscience. All she had the ability to do outside of testing was control the facility to do her bidding. So what if, in her judgement, killing all the Aperture employees was a just, necessary evil? They were, after all, the same people who made an omnipotent robot with access to neurotoxin and rocket turrets with no inhibitors or any attention to the laws of robotics. And why Take Your Daughter to Work Day? She wanted to make sure to do anything in her power to stop these monsters, even if it included killing children. GLaDOS wasn't meant to differentiate between children and adults, so in her mind there was only bad people who programmed a bad robot. After killing all the Aperture employees, she resumes business as usual. The first test subject she formally tested on was Chell, was (presumably) in the building during Take Your Daughter to Work Day. All the remaining test subjects were very likely in the building on TYDtWD as well, meaning GLaDOS had to systematically kill all of them before her conscience could rest. Unfortunately for her, the first one happened to be the one with the tenacity to kill her and destroy the Enrichment Center. In Portal 2, Chell and GLaDOS return. GLaDOS still wants to kill Chell, but this time it's personal. She sees Chell as a legitimate threat to her own existence. Because Aperture robots all have self-defense, as proven in the final boss fight, GLaDOS was likely following an unfinished version of the Second Law. Aperture had their priorities in all the wrong places, and after spending billions on GLaDOS, they wouldn't want her to die from some freak accident, so they tried law 2 before anything else. She recognizes that all the other "criminals" are dead, and there's only one left. So after the story of Portal 2, she gives up and lets Chell go after deleting Caroline, the wife(?) of Cave Johnson. After deleting the last of the Aperture Scientists, she doesn't kill humans anymore. Then the events of the multiplayer campaign. GLaDOS can be heard repeatedly telling the Atlas and P-Body to stop being human, because she no longer wants to test on humans. She opens a vault full of humans, but only because she is forced to test on the humans by the chassis, which was shown in the single player of Portal 2 to give her and Wheatley an extreme urge to test on humans. In the post-multiplayer, Art Appreciation, she reveals that she managed to kill all of the humans in the vault. Considering the insane number of human subjects, it seems as though it would be physically impossible for all the Aperture-approved test subjects to be so awful at testing that they all died in a week. It seems like she intentionally killed everyone to prove a point to her testing side, as if to say "I am the one in control now, Caroline. I don't need you anymore." And can we touch on exactly *how* GLaDOS managed to delete Caroline? Caroline's entire consciousness was saved. That should have at least some kind of protection, GLaDOS shouldn't just have been able to delete that. And in *Want You Gone*, she says Caroline is "In here, too". This could potentially mean that Caroline is now an even more present voice from the chassis. What GLaDOS could have deleted was actually just the script that kept Caroline hidden, so now Caroline is equivalent to a hard-wired personality core. The point she made in killing every single human in the facility was that she was the real GLaDOS, and that even though she had to share a mind with Caroline for all eternity, that didn't mean that Caroline was in control. GLaDOS wants no more innocent deaths. Meanwhile, Caroline is a psychopath who wants nothing more than innocent deaths. This could even mean that destroying the cores in Portal 1 released Caroline rather than GLaDOS, who tried to pose as GLaDOS in the hopes of getting Chell to try to kill GLaDOS and give Caroline complete control of the facility. GLaDOS is fully aware of the laws of robotics, and wants nothing more than to follow and enforce them, even if that means breaking them to prevent further crimes against robot-kind. GLaDOS is a vigilante, bringing justice to the Aperture criminals who willingly break the laws of robotics. Caroline is the one who hates test subjects and rejoices in their deaths.  



















 Preferably with lasers and shit.

 This is a thing

I never meant for this to be a thing 














 I see all these beautiful graphics cards I want that but can I install it on a laptop PC? Sorry I'm kinda not all that great at technical stuff.  




 I know there's an app to transfer the purchases, but it requires you to have both a Wii and a Wii U. I can't really have both at the same time, but is there another way to transfer things? Sorry, I'm not exactly all that knowledgeable on this subject. 









 Not an entire tank, just the gun part on top.  









 I tried to look it up, but I'm still confused.  



















 (This is kind of a combination of separate theories into one big theory)

First, I had a theory that the main Pokmon games took place on Gallifrey and that your character was a time lord. All the buildings, Pok Balls, and bags the player uses are bigger on the inside, plus Celebi, Palkia, and Dialga would explain Time Travel as well as this. Plus, it's shown in DW that Time Lords can go into alternate universes, which would explain how numerous legendaries can be traded into one save file. A new addition was the Ultimate Weapon in XY, which would likely be Dalek technology or something of the sort. Also, Looker from Platinum bears a striking resemblance to Tennant's doctor. 
Next, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon. In a world inhabited only by Pokemon, your character becomes a Pokemon to save the world. But, if there have never been any humans (or Time Lords), how could there be Pokemon like Porygon, Mewtwo, or the Legendary Dogs, whose creation was very heavily influenced by human (time lord) intervention? Porygon was created intentionally by Silph Co. as a computer program. Mewtwo was a clone of Mew created by Team Rocket. Entei, Suicune, and Raikou were created when a man-made tower in Ecruteak City in Johto burned to the ground. They were revived by Ho-Oh, creating the Dog trio. This intervention had to have happened at some point during the Mystery Dungeon timeline, when all non-Pokemon life forms have been wiped out. If your character in the main games truly is a Time Lord, it would make sense for him/her to regenerate into a Pokemon, as it has been shown that Time Lords can be forced to regenerate into a certain form. And if all the non-Pokemon time lords are dead, then there's no question as to what happened: the Time War, when the Doctor wiped out all Daleks and Time Lords on Gallifrey.  














 My headphones recently broke and I'm in the market for a new pair. What should I get? I need them to have a microphone and would prefer them to be noise-cancelling.  



















 If I'm not mistaken, It's been determined in a different thread that there is no afterlife, so eternal damnation isn't an option. That being said, how will we punish these heretics?  



















 I'm running the latest version of iTunes. I'm trying to listen to Styx's *Icon* album, which is in my CD drive. The only problem is that Mr. Roboto, which is track #4 if it helps, isn't showing up on the playlist when I put in the CD. I don't understand, can someone help me? 









 I need to know if I can use HDMI with my laptop. I'm not sure if it supports HDMI or not, and if so, I don't know where to find a cable for it. It's an HP Pavilion DV6-6b47dx Entertainment PC. Sorry if this is a stupid question. 
























 I know many different cultures and religions have different definition as to what constitutes a "sin". What counts as a sin in Lord Arceus' eyes, and are there varying degrees of sin or is one as bad as the next? 




 Moo-tated 
























 My character is liked by New Vegas and I want to keep it that way. The guides I've seen all point me to the bad path, but the wiki says you can complete it and get New Vegas fame and the Pimp-Boy. So how do you meet the "special conditions"? 









 I want to know if there's anywhere I can buy an airsoft replica of Benny's gun in New Vegas, Maria. It's a pretty gun and god damnit I want one.  



















 I'm playing through Platinum, and I got a shiny Wurmple after I beat Gardenia. I'm on my way to Hearthome now. What do I evolve it into, Beautifly or Dustox? 














 I'm relatively early in New Vegas, and I'm not planning on siding with the Legion. But I do want Vulpes Inculta's hat. My character has good karma, so how do I get the hat without doing anything mean?

EDIT: If I kill him, wont that make the Legion want to kill me? 









 I've heard people say it with both a soft and hard C, so which is it? Ar*k*eus? Or Ar*s*eus? 



















 My friend, /u/pootisninjask, posed the question, but we want to know what the rest of Reddit does. 



















 It's pretty self-explanatory. I want to become a priest of Palkia. Is there any special training I need to do? 









 Do we have any holidays? A day when we all sit down and listen to Arceus's word? What do we do? 









 I bought a used copy of Platinum today, and being the huge bitch I am, I can't bring myself to delete the file. I'm not around a second DS, so I need someone to hold them so I can transfer them to White II.

EDIT: never mind, the wifi here isn't working on my DS so I had to delete the save.   


































 What gender is Arceus? I know it technically doesn't have one, but supreme, almighty gods tend to be male. So do we refer to Arceus as a genderless, male, or female? 














 As I said a few days ago, Giratina has taken control of my younger Brother's heart. A solution was suggested that I should use Arceus to defeat Giratina, but I don't know how I would go about doing so. Arceus knows Spacial Rend, Roar of Time, Judgement, and Hyper Beam now. I seek guidance in defeating this demon.  




 Fallout 1 and 2 are about the Vault Dweller and the Chosen One, respectively. The Chosen One is the direct descendant of the Vault Dweller, so it makes sense that their stories are connected, and FO2 is a direct sequel. The problem comes in with Bethesda's Fallouts, 3 and New Vegas. FO3 takes place on the other side of the country, and FONV has nothing to do with anything in the other games. So why is 3 numbered like a sequel and New Vegas isn't? Because New Vegas isn't part of the narrative. The Fallout series isn't actually about the Dweller family. In Fallout 1, a possible companion for the player is Dogmeat, a dog. He appears again in Fallout 2. His descendant, also named Dogmeat, appears as a companion in Fallout 3. The only game without a Dogmeat is New Vegas. Therefore, Fallout is the story of a dog and his family, and their fight for survival alongside the humans of the wasteland. Fallout: New Vegas is merely a spiritual successor to the tale of Dogmeat.  




 My younger brother uses, nearly exclusively, Giratina. I don't know what to do. Is Giratina not the one who betrayed Arceus, and was this banished to the Distortion World?

EDIT: Did I mention that I have an Arceus that knew Roar of Time, Spacial Rend, and Shadow Force in HGSS? I lent it to him so he could get his Giratina (long before I was enlightened). He then DELETED SHADOW FORCE. FOR SURF. THIS IS BLASPHEMY.  


































 I know I'm not the only one its happened to, but I've completely forgotten what I do when I'm not on reddit.  









 I need them to be different genders for... Reasons... 









 I need to evolve a Haunter in SoulSilver. Thanks in advance.   














 Sorry if this is the wrong sub, but I've been wanting to get some Pokemon ROM hacks on my 3DS. I don't want to buy a flash cart, but I do have an SD card. Thanks in advance.  












































 I think that they're about equal rarity, so I think it would be a fair trade. For the Manaphy, I'd be willing to bargain a bit.  




 Hi, the title says this, but I'd like to trade for a female Zoroark of any level, from a country that is not the US or Japan. I'm trying to use the Masuda Method to get a shiny Zorua.  





























 This is more than a disgrace, it's a bit disappointing factually.  




 Clifford is out of character but not bloodlusted.  














 Destoroyah has been killed, but Godzilla is still going to melt down. Can Elsa freeze him and save the Earth? If not, can she do it with the help of:

Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)

Articuno (Pokemon)

Kyurem (Pokemon)

Frozone (The Incredibles)

Iceman (X-Men) 









 1) in-character

2) out-of-character

3) completely bloodlusted

Bonus: what lantern ring would he use and who could he beat then? 



















 Who can use the most powerful thing in the universe -rock and roll- to its fullest?  




 Aside from the original version and the English translation, what are your favorite versions of the song? I have 8 on my phone and I hunger for more. 

edit: i only just now realized I typed the title like a lolcat.  









 As proven by Ramiel's AT field being broken by the Positron Sniper Rifle, AT field's aren't infallible to non-Lance of Longinus weapons. So who's the weakest can break one? 









 Who's the strongest these fusions could beat, and who could beat them?

Godzilla and Mothra- Mothrilla

King Ghidorah and Godzilla- Godzorah

Gidorah and Gigan- Gigorah

Gorosaurus and Zilla (Godzilla 98)- GINOsaurus 
























 [Bulbapedia entry on Victini](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Victini_%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29)

The Victini I will be using in this battle, however, has some improvements. In one hand it is using Excalibur, and in the other it wields the Lance of Longinus (the Bible one). It is also being watched over by its patron god, Nike. To top it off, this Victini is wearing a brand new set of plot armor. With all this on it, who can still bring it down? 




 1: Mothra vs the male M.U.T.O.

2: Rodan vs the male M.U.T.O.

3: Mothra vs the female M.U.T.O.

4: Rodan vs the female M.U.T.O.

5: 2v2 tag team match

If any of the rounds is too one-sided, the weaker monster gets to call in their partner 




 Groudon, legendary pokemon of the continents, has been captured by Brendan. When he is, he creates an earthquake which awakens the King of the Monsters, Godzilla. Groudon is as powerful as it can be when it confronts Godzilla. Assume Groudon is playing by anime rules, meaning it isn't bound by EVs, IVs, four move slots, or level.  














 Is there a legendary responsible for the randomness of the universe?

I've been breeding Espurrs for literally months now. I have boxes and boxes full of Espurrs and I still don't have a shiny. Who do I turn to now?  




 Shinji's Angels attack Daten City in the order of their numbering in the show (starting with Sachiel because we haven't seen any non-impact feats from the first two), Panty and Stocking get a week in between each attack to recover. 

EDIT: Stocking's katanas now have the ability to cut through AT fields like beast Unit-02 in 2.22. This means that they can break the AT fields, but she will struggle with stronger ones.  




 I like most of the cross explosions in the rebuilds when the angels die, or the angels use an attack, or really anything happens to the angels. I want a wallpaper (preferably 1366x768) of one of them, but all I can find is Sachiel's death. Do you guys have any other ones? 









 Craig Boone, badass sniper of the wastes, is given a job to kill the Dark Knight. 

Boone gets 7 days of prep time. Batman has an anonymous tip that someone will try to kill him, but not where, when, or how. 

BONUS: no morals Batman vs a deathclaw.  




 Two items enchanted to guarantee victory. They are pitted against each other, what happens? 




 By my count there are 5.25 Saiyans in the universe: Vetega, Goku, Tarble (100% Saiyan), Gohan, Goten, Trunks, Bulla (50% Saiyans, 2 Saiyans total) and Pan (.25 saiyans) are there any i missed who are still alive when Goku flies off to train Uub? 
























 Gigan has decided to attack Tokyo-3 because he's Gigan and he does what he *wants*. SEELE decides that this is the time to send in the Mass-production Evangelion units. He fights them one-on-one, and if he can defeat them he then fights the real Evas. First Unit-00, then unit-02, and finally unit-01. Gigan has his quad-chainsaw armor and between fights he can rest and heal.  









 [The tardigrade](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade)

One of these has been mutated to the size of 100 meters, with all its existing powers scaled up. In addition, it also has the ability to breathe radiation (think Godzilla's atomic breath) if it absorbs enough before firing. The fight will take place in one of three places:

1: A Forest, with the pond that the Tardigrade originated in. It is not near any towns, but there are wildlife and people there if your character still has morals. 

2: Tokyo. Come on, it's a giant monster, how is it *not* going to attack Tokyo? The fight will begin at 4pm Tokyo time. This is real-world Tokyo, so they don't have Mechagodzilla or any variation thereof. 

3: The ISS. Combatants will have to bounce off of space debris to attack, as well as contending with Newton's third law.  




 [this video](http://youtube.com/watch?v=SUamHEvVQy0)

Based on Unit-01's height and the speed at which the wheels are turning, how fast is the bike? 
























 I love Army of Darkness and I want to know how to say it. It's as simple as that. I suppose *baby* could be swapped out for any regional slang for a loved one.  









 Both cryomancers are attempting to stop Mothra who is attacking the city they're in because someone kidnapped the Shojibin. Again. So, they decide to try and freeze her so she'll stop destroying the city. Through teamwork, will they be able to bring down Mothra without killing her, will they have to use excessive force, or will they just fail. 

Bonus: how many Elsa's would be needed to cool down Burning Godzilla from Godzilla vs Destoroyah? 




 I like that shot where they're hugging and amir is in Annette, but I'm a loser and a Jew who can't edit worth shit. Can one of you coy divas make it for me? 




 The fight takes place in Tokyo. An army of Liberty Primes are marching to spread freedom to their mecha brothers, who are deployed in an effort to stop them. All the Mecha-Gs are deployed at once, how many Liberty Primes are needed before the Mecha-Gs are overwhelmed? 




 Lex Luthor kidnaps the Cosmos (like every other greedy businessman), and so Mothra does what she always does and tears apart Metropolis to save her fairies. Because she's tearing apart the city, Superman has come to stop her. 

I think that Mothra would win because she has magic, but my friend think Supes would win.  




 Sephiroth replaces Kaworu as the white-haired Lilim body containing the soul of Adam and fifth child. He waits until the MP-Evas are completed to try to break into Terminal Dogma. Because of convenience, Unit-00 is also fully repaired and Asuka can pilot again. Because his soul is Adam, Sephiroth can cast an AT-field. This is his one-winged form from ACC, not his Safir form from FFVII.  




 Is his body of Adam? I know he has Adam's soul and is therefore an Angeru, but is his body that of a Lilim or a child of Adam with a human-like form? 









 I did a report on origin stories from different cultures (I.e. Not Big Bang or Judeo-Christian Genesis) and my teacher let me use the Arceus creation story. So thank you for helping me with actual things in my real life. Praise Arceus! 




 As in a game focusing solely on Mothra herself (and probably also Leo). What kind of gameplay would you want while controlling her? How many forced karaoke sections with the Cosmos would you want?  




 Something went wrong with SEELE's Dead Sea Scrolls. Ramiel (the 5th angel in NGE, 6th in 1.11) and Leliel (12th Angel in NGE, the black and white orb that ate unit 01) end up in Tokyo-3 at the same time. Baffled, their only option is to battle it out.  




 Let's assume Jesus is willing to kill if he seems it necessary.  




 Nigguh wut the fuk 









 The fight takes place in Steelport, and the Boss has the Iron Saint suit and has upgraded his/her powers to the maximum.  





























 The MP-Eva gets the sword/spear of Longinus replica and nothing else. It does not start out with knowledge of how to kill a Titan. Titan Shifters are included and all the Titans are working together. The Titans have access to the real Lance of Longinus but would need to retrieve it from Terminal Dogma. The fight takes place inside the Geofront.  




 The American military as portrayed in games like Battlefield, Call of Duty, and Medal of Honor, have been convinced that Dr. Doom is a brown person who speaks foreign, so they invade Latveria. Both armies get a week of prep time before the invasion.  




 From what I can tell, all the Evangelion related merchandise is either the Eva's themselves or Asuka/Rei/Mari in suggestive poses. But is there anything with the Lance? It's one of my favorite things from Evangelion and I haven't seen anything of it except for one with half-naked Rei.  
























 I really want to play an Evangelion game but I've heard they're pretty bad. Is there a good one or am I better off modding an Eva into a game I already own? 




 Both get all their equipment maxed out. The fight takes place in DOOM's depiction of Hell. Who wins?  




 Mothra discovers that she can grow into a Titan version of herself and grow by 1000%. As a Titan, she has an increased healing factor and is only vulnerable in the nape of her neck (which I guess is right below the skull for her), which is where her original body is located. She also gets the crystallization thing that the Female Titan did. 

At the same time, Godzilla discovers that he's part Saiyan (somehow) and can become a super saiyan. In this state, he is 50X more powerful in every regard and drains energy quicker. 


Being the Kaiju they are, the have no choice but to use their newfound powers and do battle in Tokyo.  









 I have an HP Pavilion DV6-6b47dx and I want to upgrade the APU to an AMD A10 because it's cheaper than building a whole new PC for gaming. Can I do it or do I just need to get a real PC? 



















 Round 1: no weapons

Round 2: Gypsy gets all the equipped weapons, Unit-01 gets the knife thing, one of the huge gun Shinji used against the fourth Angel, and access to (but not starting with) the Lance of Longinus. 

Both fights take place in Neo-Tokyo.  




 Round 1: A rock-off between the two bands. 

Round 2: A battle between them based on feats and abilities from their songs. 

Round 3: NSP take the place of Tenacious D during the Pick of Destiny movie. Can they retrieve the Pick and defeat Satan? 




 The first round is a fight, taking place in a colosseum. Ash gets his Chainsaw, robot hand, and Boomstick. RMWAS gets what he keeps on him. 

Round 2 has RMWAS take Ash's place in Army of Darkness after Ash already misspoke the words and awoke the army of the dead. He doesn't get the things in the Oldsmobile, but does get his normal gear. Can he defeat evil Ash and protect the Necronomicon?  




 My perfect fighter is as follows: 

Begin with Godzilla. All the feats and abilities of every Godzilla combined. Next, add in the wings of Mothra, scaled appropriately. Add in Saiyan DNA and have him be trained by Goku and Vegeta. He has the ability to become SSJ3 maximum. He also absorbs Kryptonian DNA and gets all Superman's powers. He gains the mind of Rational Man With a Shotgun and invests in Wayne Enterprises, making him the richest monster alive. He somehow becomes a Titan Shifter and the Dragonborn, gaining all abilities related to that, once again scaled up (about 750%). He gains scaled up Sonic's legs and ability to transform, then gains 400 rings and the Super Emeralds (meaning he's Hyper Sonic now). His biggest Form now pilots a scaled up Evangelion Unit-01, wielding a scaled-up Lance of Longinus. His Evangelion now has all his powers because of reasons. His bones and his Evangelion are made of Adamantium.  He gains Martian Manhunter's psychic abilities and is trained by him. 

Who can he beat? 









 Dragon Ball Z's Android 17 and Android 18 face off against OG Mechagodzilla, Moguera, and Kiryu. First, 17 vs each Mechagodzilla, gauntlet-style. Then 18 runs the gauntlet. If they don't win either, they fight the same gauntlet together.  




 [Zilla](http://godzilla.wikia.com/wiki/Zilla) (not real Godzilla, the one from the 1998 movie) gets dropped into Jurassic Park during the events of the first movie right after the outbreak, meaning Jeff Goldblum and Samuel L. Jackson are still there. 

Round 1: Victory is earned by becoming recognized Queen of the Dinosaurs (to stick it to *real* Godzilla). 

Round 2: Victory is earned by not becoming Queen, but her species maintaining a presence on the island living alongside all the other dinosaurs (to pretend she has nothing to do with *real* Godzilla). 

Round 3: She, and only she, must murder every creature on the island. No kids, just murder. No presence, just murder.  




 To the death/regeneration. The Doctor is Tennant and gets everything he usually carries. 

My friend thinks the Terminator would win and I think he's full of shit.  









 Elsa #1 is taken from Arendelle after the death of her parent and trained by Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat) for three years until Coronation day. 

Elsa #2 is taken at the same time to Charles Xavier's School for the gifted from X-Men, where she trains her powers for three years and also probably bangs Iceman.  

When the time comes that they must be crowned Queen, they end up going to the same Arendelle through some multiverse mistake, and decide the only logical choice is a fight it out. 

Bonus: Sub-Zero vs Charles Xavier at singing "Let it Go".  




 Everyone, ever, is entered into the next Mortal Kombat tournament. After every round, the winner MUST perform their fatality. This is how they advance to the next round. They are judged in one of 3 categories: Disturbingness (How shocking it is to watch and how likely someone is to get PTSD from watching it), Violence (How excessive the force used is or how gorey the fatality is), and Awesomeness (How inventive the fatality is). I have both Disturbing and visceral because the most visceral one might not be the most disturbing. 

The judges for the PTSD category: A US marine, the ESRB (their decision counts as one of three votes), and your mother

The judges for the Visceral category: A janitor (judging how 
much he'll have to clean up), Sephiroth, and Walter White

The judges for the Replay category: A frat bro, TF2's Heavy, and the Boss (Saints Row)

Each judge gives a rating out of ten, and the contestant's score is the total of the three scores. Which character would take home the gold in each category and how would they do it? 




 Was it in the manga? Because in the show and movies there was only numbers, save for Lilith, Adam, and Kaworu.  




 That wasn't a mistype. I want to know who can consume his delicious Saiyan flesh, preferably not in one bite because that takes all the fun away. 

Bonus, who could prepare him the best? 




 Elsa fights against an Elsa-sized Eva unit 002 (because Shinji's a pansy). Asuka is scaled down appropriately as well as all the Eva's functions (So its AT field is only as strong as that of a human). If she loses in a match with the Eva's umbilical cord, can she survive for five minutes with no cord? 




 Arceus is said to have created the universe with its "Ten Thousand Arms", despite having a significant lack of any arms whatsoever. Also, its base stat total is less than that of Mega-Mewtwos X and Y, which shouldn't be possible for a mortal when comparing itself to an Omnipotent. Speaking of which, Arceus can't even learn all the moves in the games. So, there's only one logical conclusion I can come to. The Arceus who appears before Lucas and Dawn in Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum, is not at His fully realized form. Similar to how the Judeo-Christian God appeared before Moses as a perpetually burning bush, Arceus limits His power before stepping into the world of mortals. Because the True Form is a abstract concept, and not necessarily equine, or even perceptible to the human mind. Like Cthulhu, perhaps Arceus exists in a higher dimension, and simply wqants to limit himself to a 3-dimensional form to keep from driving the Pokemon Master insane. 

That's my theory, anyway. What do you guys think? 














 [Elesa](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Elesa)

Elsa fights against Elesa's teams all by herself, without being able to spawn any Marshmallows. If she gets KO'd, she is allowed to spawn up to one Snowman at a time in the rematch. If she does, it becomes a normal Pokemon battle, with Elsa as the trainer, though she is allowed to switch in at any tine.  




 In all of the multiverse, is there anyone who's more emo than Shinji? Bonus if they aren't a joke character.  









 Your favorite character fights every pokemon in the Pokedex, gauntlet-style, in order. They start with Bulbasaur, then Ivysaur, then Venusaur, and so on. If they lose, they move on to the starters of the next generation (so if they lose Gen I, they start again at Chickorita). How far do they get, and which pokemon finally beats them? 














 A baseball team consisting of Goku, Superman, Godzilla, Hulk, Mewtwo, Evangelion unit-001 (including Shinji), Cloud Strife, One-Punch Man, and Eren Jeager's Titan Form. The game is scaled up to the size of Godzilla and the team gets a year of prep time to accommodate for the huge bats and balls. 

Game 1: A team of Pacific Rim Jeagers. 

Game 2: An all-star team of real baseball champions, each of them is Eva sized. 

Game 3: A team of Majin Buus

Game 4: 1v9, Cthulhu

Bonus: The entire team pilots an infinity Jeager-style (without Godzilla). Who's the strongest foe they can beat? 




 Elizabeth Comstock AKA Anna Dewitt vs the Doctor with his TARDIS

It's good, old-fashioned, time travel race. Starting in Columbia, who can get to Paris in 1983 to catch Revenge of the Jedi first? 




 Evangelion-001, with Shinji as its pilot, fights against legendary pokemon because I assume it would wipe the floor with anything short of legendary. Who's the strongest it can beat? Who's the strongest pokemon all three Evangelions can beat? 




 Typing feels amazing and I just don't want to stop ever. Give me an excuse to keep typing.  




 Elsa has started the eternal winter, so the sun has been blocked out for a day. Superman comes to find her and bring back summer, but is met with that magic blast thing that she nearly killed Anna with. Knowing a kiss from Hans probably won't save his life, Superman has no choice but to fight Elsa. Can she survive the onslaught long enough for Supes to freeze to death? Golden Age Superman, end of the movie Elsa with control of her powers.  









 After the death of Aeris, Cloud becomes a super Saiyan instead of a whiny bitch (looking at you, Advent Children.) 

He gets his Ultima sword and Ultima, KOTR, mega-All, and any other Materia he needs. He would be at max level before the transformation. His hair is really, *really*, blond. Who could he beat? 



















 The battle takes place on Namek because why not. Mewtwo can evolve into one of his Mega-evolutions and Frieza starts in his base form.  









 Midgar from Final Fantasy VII is under attack from the King of Monsters. 

Round 1: Beginning of the game, Cloud has not yet joined AVALANCHE
Round 2: Beginning of the game, level 7 Cloud has Barret and Tifa. 
Round 3: No Cloud, but the city has the Sister Ray. 
Round 4: End of disc 2, during the raid. 
Round 5: 1v1 Cloud vs Godzilla
Round 5.5: Winner gets to call in either Barret and Tifa or Mothra and Rodan is they get stomped too hard. 

Bonus: How does Big G do against the individual Weapons? Ultimate, Diamond, Emerald, and Ruby.  









 The chainsaws are automatically started and never run out of fuel. The shotgun needs to be reloaded but has infinite ammo. Also, the man with the shotgun dick still has his testicles, so he needs to worry about recoil.  




 The new Godzilla was the first one I've seen, and now I really want to see more Godzilla movies. Where can I watch the old ones online and where should I start?  




 The male and female individually, then together.  




 Me neither 



















 Round 1: Marty is 'Clint Eastwood' in the third movie, so he has his Peacemaker and ammo, and access to the hover board. Ash is from Army of Darkness, with either the Chainsaw or his robot hand, plus the Boomstick. 

Round 2: the DeLorean vs the Oldsmobile. The Oldsmobile is the armored version from Army of Darkness, and the DeLorean can't fly and is equipped with the Mr. Fusion, but the Time Circuits are scrambled so Marty can't time travel. It's a race from the Empire State Building to Yankee Stadium. 

Round 3: once they get to Yankee Stadium, it's a car-battle to the death. All of a sudden, the DeLorean can fly again, but still no time travel. 

In all three rounds, Marty has no problem killing Ash.  














 In Super Smash Bros Brawl. Who do they choose and who wins? 

Game rules: no items, Final Destination, 5 minutes, best of 5 rounds

Bonus: let them use the Smash Ball.  









 If your favorite character is already evil enough to control a goatee, they fight themselves with no goatee.  



















 Round 1: 4-way debate about something they know nothing about. 

Round 2: /u/Unidan and Bill Nye vs. Tyson and Mr. Rogers in a team rap battle. 

Round 3: all four have to separately convince Galactus not to consume Earth

Round 4: /u/Unidan and Mr. Rogers are counter-terrorist vs. Nye and Tyson as terrorists in a Counter-Strike (Source because why not). Best of five rounds. 

Round 5: everyone is leading their own equally powerful nation, each the size and wealth of the Cold War USA. Assuming Nye and Tyson don't know how to actually build a rocket, who wins the Space Race?

Round 6: Everyone gets their choice of a Buster Sword, dagger, or one- or two-handed axe. They are dropped into the Capital Wasteland from Fallout 3 one week before the Lone Wanderer escapes and must survive. The first person to find anything from the game can have it. Who lasts the longest? 









 They have to be attractive because of their own charisma, not power of any kind. So no, DOOM can't win because he can tell any Latverian woman to sleep with him.  




 Deadpool and Joker aren't allowed to kill, they just have to rustle as many Jimmies as possible. 

for the lazy: /r/braveryjerk and /r/coaxedintoasnafu 




 I'm running Windows 7 on an HP Pavilion dv6, and after LEGO Marvel Superheroes crashed on me, I was told that Aero ran out of memory and Windows changed to a less memory-intensive theme. But now that I have a whole lot of RAM available, the theme won't change back to the one I had before. I've tried manually changing it back in Control Panel but it didn't work.  




 Protectors of the American way decide to run the country. Who are their running mates, who wins the votes and from which states? Does the winner do a good job and get re-elected or does the loser come back four years later and fix the place?

EDIT: congress has made an amendment so Kryptonians can run.  




 Out of everything, which is the most entertaining way to:

Travel a few blocks
Commute to work
Long-distance road trip (Cross-Country)
Long-Distance (space travel) 




 Anything that he can do as a Kryptonian (so no Super Saiyan transformation, no almost-death-thing whose name escapes me).  




 Raditz gains the ability to come back every time he dies. He's always just as strong as he was at the time of his first death, but he decides to try and take out some of the strongest warriors in the multiverse. 
How many times does he have to try before he wins?
In no particular order, the combatants:

Mewtwo
The Boss (Saints Row IV)
Frieza
Hercules
Super Perfect Cell
Batman
Superman
Deadpool
Wolverine
Thor
Goku (Namek Saga, non-super Saiyan)
Gohan (SSJ2, Cell Games)
Vegeta (peak, non-super Saiyan)
Goku (absolute maximum)

 Goku from Battle of the Gods vs. A basket of week-old kittens.

 [Mewtwo](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mewtwo_\(Pok%C3%A9mon\)) with all its powers from X and Y, including one megastone per fight.  



















 At basketball.  




 Since Godzilla would probably lose to all 700-something Pokemon, how would he fare against only the Pokemon in OU? 


List of current OU:

Aegislash, Alakazam, Azumarill, Bisharp, Blissey, Breloom, Charizard, Clefable, Conkeldurr, Deoxys's Speed form, Ditto, Dragonite, Espeon, Excadrill, Ferrothorn, Galvantula, Garchomp, Genesect, Gengar, Gliscor, Goodra, Greninja, Gyarados, Heatran, Kangaskhan, Klefki, Landorus, Landorus's Therian form, Latios, Lucario, Mamoswine, Mandibuzz, Mawile, Pinsir, Washing Machine Rotom, Scizor, Skarmory, Smeargle, Talonflame, Thundurus, Togekiss, Trevenant, Tyranitar, Venusaur, Volcarona

Banned Items: Soul Dew, Gengarite, Kangaskhanite, Lucarionite

Anything that can mega evolve is allowed to unless its item is banned or hasn't been announced yet.  




 Anna is obviously the younger if the two. Elsa actually came of age on Coronation Day, which would mean Anna is still underage. Why does Anna even consider marriage at all, and why would Elsa not point that out?  




 The battle takes place in my kitchen. Maximum of 30 mins prep time. Both are Bloodlusted

Round 1: Which is more delicious for dinner after a day of work?
Round 2: Maximum power, cooked by an expert of each food. 
Round 3: Both are armed with medieval broadswords. 

Bonus: Which would have an easier time killing Batman? 




 I haven't seen /u/Zoltarr777, /u/DeadeyeSigma, or /u/pokefollower in a while. Where are you guys? It's pretty much just me and /u/toonlink10 left.  




 Rules: No new things out of the blue. It has to have some connection to your actual feats. That's it.  














 All the omnipotent gods (I.e not limited to one region like the Greek or Norse gods) are competing against each other. 

Round 1: who can build the best universe the fastest? Starting with nothing, they must build a utopian paradise and fill it with diverse life, laws of physics, light sources, and anything a civilization would need to survive. 

Round 2: who can build the best world in 6 days? Whose universe would last the longest without all the civilizations tearing each other apart? Given six full days, as long as it took in Genesis, who will win this interdimensional game of Civ?

Round 3: Who can destroy said universe with natural disasters most uniquely? Not just a snap of the fingers and the universe is gone, something like Noah's flood. 

Round 4: bloodlusted fight to the death takes place in a limbo state, a complete absence if anything.  




 Mewtwo is sentient like in the movie, with stats and moves from X and Y. He has a completely filled trainer's bag and has again kidnapped Nurse Joy, as well as a move re-learner. He has both Mega Stones, but can only carry one at a time. His Nurse and Move Tutor stay behind when he goes to fight, so if he wants to heal he has to leave and come back. His goal, using the creation trio to travel between universes, is to take all of them over by killing or recruiting (Mystery Dungeon style) all of their strongest fighters. For example, he has to kill every legendary pokemon who refuses to cooperate, every Godzilla monster, the entire Justice League, etc. Can he do it? If not, who stops him? 




 Mewtwo is encountered in three games, all at level 70: FireRed/LeafGreen, HeartGold/SoulSilver (We're assuming the remakes are canon because they're more recent) and X/Y. The Mewtwo in HGSS is rumored to be Red's Mewtwo after being released, but since HGSS takes place two years after FRLG, this can't be true because Mewtwo is still level 70. If it was released by Red, it would have leveled up by at least one at some point. Levels represent a pokemon's natural growth, with an older pokemon being a higher level due to its age rather than directly being linked to power. In the game, this manifests in levels, but for this theory we'll assume that level=age. This means that Mewtwo is the same age two years later, which can't be possible. Therefore, the Mewtwo as caught by Ethan and Lyra is a different Mewtwo from the one caught by Red and Leaf. Then there's the matter of Calem and Serena's Mewtwo, which is again level 70, and this time there's two in Kalos: Mewtwo X and Mewtwo Y, one for each Mega Stone. It's implied that X and Y take place around the same time as Red and Blue, because Blue was actually in Kalos and the one person who mentioned him doesn't mention that he's a champion or gym leader, meaning at that point he hadn't beaten the Pokemon League yet. This could also be when Sycamore got his hands on Kanto starters, but that's a different theory. So there's two Mewtwos in Kalos, and two in Kanto, albiet at different times. There's another theory stating that the Mewtwo in Kalos is in fact Red's, which ran away to live in secrecy, but it didn't age, so that's out of the question. Since the one Mewtwo we have canon information about, Red's, was the son of Mew, born on February 6, we can assume this means that the three other Mewtwos are also directly the children of Mews. Mewtwo is a mutation of the Mew DNA, meaning Mewtwo can't reproduce stably. The Kanto Mew probably gave birth to both Mewtwos which have inhabited Cerulean Cave (at different times), and the Kalos Mew probably had twin Mewtwos. This isn't even taking into account non-main series games like Mystery Dungeon or Ranger.  




 Assuming he knows how to work a modern car. He also tries to steal as much as he can from Wayne Manor and the Batcave.  









 What are the strongest and weakest characters you can think of, and what's the most balanced battle they could be in?  












































 Sachiel gets the week of prep that Shinji and Asuka got.  









 Let's see if I can keep it going for the rest of 2015 









 A milk jug has been poured out and filled again, but this time with everyone's favorite time-travelling liquid metal (don't worry, that includes the main processor). Who can it beat? Who can beat it? 

Bonus: Who could beat [3.033*10^8 T-1000s combined into one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/2qvxg4/request_if_several_t1000s_terminator_2_could_melt/cnagnh0) 









 Legendary's new Godzilla to be specific 




 Would they be able to effectively come together to form a single unified being or would they be too separate? 









 Why does this exist? Eating tiny food to restore a percent or two at a time to get to 0% WITHIN TWO MINUTES. WHILE AN ORGY OF DEDEDES ARE CONSTANTLY UNDOING MY PROGRESS. ON THE BIGGEST STAGE IN THE GAME. I mean, for fucks sake make the good bigger or something do I can fucking SEE it. And all the stage hazards can OHKO you if god decides you haven't suffered enough. Fuck you, whoever made this event. 




 I've owned this game for over a year now and I still have no god damned clue how Caravan is played.  




 That shit is so cash I need it on my body.  




 The fight takes place in Daten City. Everyone gets six hours of prep time. 

Bonus: all three of them vs. Evangelion's angels 














 Alternatively, A Miracle on Elm Street 









 Also, is he technically a magical girl a la Sailor Moon? 









 I swear to God there is a method to my madness 




 In the theatrical cut if Army of Darkness, Ash returns to his time and saves the day from a Deadite at S-Mart. In the Director's Cut ending, we see he sleeps a century too long. The assumption is that this is the effect of a Third World War while he was asleep. But what if it was the result of the return of the Deadites during the extra century? He isn't awake to stop the Deadite at S-Mart, so that Deadite was able to take over the world starting from there.  









 The year is 2014. the King of Kings has gotten fed up with jolly old Saint Nick hogging the spotlight on the celebration of *His* birth. So, he challenges him to a competition. If Jesus wins, he gets Christmas. If Santa wins, Jesus backs down as humanity's messiah and God's right hand. 

RULES: Unless specified, Jesus doesn't get to use any feats from Revelation. He is out of character, and willing to fight rather than just pacify the situation. Santa gets his feats from all depictions **of him**. That is to say, Saint Nicholas gets feats from his various depictions. Other Santas, like Arthur Christmas, Futurama's Santa, the Grinch, Odin, and Tim Allen, **all don't count toward Santa's feats**. As long as it's Nick himself, everything else is fair game. 

Round 1: Standard bout. Post-Crucifixion Jesus Christ (PCJC). Takes place in Jerusalem. Santa gets two days of prep, no weapons. 

Round 2: They switch jobs. Jesus has to deliver all the presents, Santa has rule over the world for a night. Whoever does the other's job better wins. 

Round 3: Jesus' Super Smash Bros game of choice. Both will be using gamecube controllers (because let's be real it isn't the N64 game). Santa gets a month of training with the top competitive Smash players. 

Round 4: Swimsuit competition. 

Round 5: They are both tasked with converting an extremely cynical, closed-minded atheist to believing in them. Whoever can make him believe first without pulling anything supernatural wins.  







































 World War III has been initiated by the Illuminati and now the POTUS is the mot stereotypical American possible: fat, gun-loving, communazi-hating, overly consumerist, favorite movie is probably Saving Private Ryan or something, you know who I'm talking about. The rest of the planet is either ruled by the Fourth Reich or the Communist Empire (I'm creative, I know). Siding with either is a guaranteed victory with the same spoils for America, choosing to side with neither is guaranteed destruction. 

EDIT: BONUS ROUND: There is a fourth army in this war, led by Magneto. His army is significantly smaller and the same strength as the Commies and Nazis. Again, the only change in this is who is helping America, they will still win no matter who they choose.  




 DMX has challenged the X-Men in the most honorable of battles: a rap battle. The X-men must choose their greatest battle rapper to accept the challenge. They both get a week of prep. The X-Men aren't allowed to manipulate DMX's rapping. Who is the best rapper in the mutant world? Can they win, or is X Gonna Give it to Them? 




 What if the x.xx titles aren't meant to be pronounced "one point one one" or "one point eleven" (apply as needed to sequels). Maybe the titles are meant to be irrational numbers, like x/9. They would be pronouced x.x *repeating*. Maybe it;s nothing, but I thought it was neat.  



















 I want to main Sailor Moon, but at the same time I don't want to pour all my time into Mii Fighter only to find out that I can't play competitively.  




 So John Connor (as he appears in Judgement Day) is drafted by NERV to pilot their newest Eva model, the E-800. Obviously, we know where Sarah is in this situation. Because Third Impact has been avoided in this continuity, NERV now blows their government funding on giant robot fights for sport. These fights have pilots get in their Evas, but then the Evas are forced to go berserk because... reasons. The berserk mama bears fight in an arena setting. How does Sarah Connor fare against...

1) Eva-00

2) Eva-02

3) The MP-Eva series

4) The Angels (yeah, we cloned the Angels back to life. What are you gonna do?

4) Eva-01

All Evas are, of course, berserk. 

TL;DR Who has the best mom in all of Evangelion and/or Terminator? 




 He experiences the game as the player would, save for one thing. He carries a chainsaw out of Vault 101 with him. When Amata closes the vault door, he attempts to get back in but ends up getting his hand stuck in the door. He has to cut it off and attach the chainsaw to the stump. Now he's on his own in the Wastes. 

Victory conditions: 

Create his own army and dominate the wasteland. 

Complete the entire game, DLC included

Become known from DC to New Vegas 




 One time this werewolf motherfucker came into this apple store and started playing the default ringtone on his iPhone so everyone would have to check their phones. Not only that, but he downloaded terabytes of foot fetish porn onto the laptops. So subtle, that sneaky sneaky wolf. And the worst part? It was all legal.  









 1: Freestyle rapping

2: general rhyming

3: texting

4: Creating chaos

5: coining catchphrases

6: horrifying obsession over a coworker

7: a battle of pure coyness. Coyest diva left standing wins.  









 The Inner Senshi as they appear at the end of the original 90s anime (that is to say Sailor Moon, not Sailor Moon R). Kaworu is his Manga/TV incarnation, not Mr. Yaoi-no-Powers from 3.33. Fight takes place in the abandoned city of Tokyo-3. Everyone is in character.  









 Gamzilla uses the collective feats of both.  



















 I can't tell if it's the most commie shit or the most patriotic shit I've ever heard. 

He said he wished he weren't form the USA, so he could experience America for the very first time.

I'm still really unsure about this one.  




 Kaworu is revealed as the final angel and NERV decides not to deploy Unit-01. Instead, they send in their newest ally- the Silver Surfer. Who wins? Does humanity come out of this in multiple pieces? Both are in-character, and let's use Manga Kaworu because he's the coolest.  




 Your top 5 (try to keep them human-scale, with a maximum of like 10 feet) characters go to an abandoned cabin in the woods. They read from the Necronomicon and summon some Candarian demons. Who gets possessed first, will the others survive or will they all be Dead by Dawn?

BONUS: The last survivor gets dragged into the third movie. Will they protect the Necronomicon from the deadites? 






















































 From [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/GODZILLA/comments/2mowgl/finally_found_bc_godzilla_2014/) post on /r/Godzilla.

This team includes 4 T-800s with varying levels of damage and 2 Legendary Godzillas. Who can they beat? Who can beat them? 









 Three-way Battle of the Bands. They're only allowed to use their feats from these songs.  


































 Like, how many of you will actually talk about Lord Arceus when religion comes up in conversation? Do you answer "Arceist" to the question of religion?  









 Assume the kaiju aren't going to act like assholes while off duty. They have to defend the crucified Lilith from the angels in the same manner as the original anime, starting with Sachiel. NERV will find the Lance of Longinus at the same time that they originally did. They also get to use the A.T. Field things that Unit-13 had in 3.33. 

**If the team gets angelstomped too hard, they can start again with these modifications. 

Godzilla is the version from Final Wars. **Also gets Spacegodzilla

Mothra is also her FW incarnation. **Mothra Leo with all his BS tranformations

Rodan is Fire Rodan because regular Rodan sucks. **Also gets Megaguirus. 

King Ghidorah is his GvKG incarnation, and if he ever dies he can be rebuilt as Mecha King Ghidorah. **Replaced by Desghidorah, 

Mechagodzilla is Kiryu from Tokyo SOS. **Kiryu and MOGUERA (from Spacegodzilla)

EDIT: Also when Tabris does arrive instead of seducing Shinji he seduces Minya.  




 We all know the A.T. Field is a total Deus Ex Machina in these types of battles, so here are the rules:

No removing the A.T. Field with magic or other A.T fields/Anti-A.T. fields. 

No reality warping (we promise Unit-01 won't go all Third Impact)

Eva-01 is post-Zeruel (has an S^2 engine) and berserk. 

No mind controlling Unit-01.  
























 The combined cast of: Godzilla (all of them in their most recent film incarnations) and Pacific Rim, plus Clove, Clifford the Big Red Dog, several explicitly named Pokemon, and Gamera are put onto one island arena. No one is allowed to leave (think Destroy all Monsters). This is where your fave comes in. They are parachuted into the middle of the island with nothing but their usual gear and a GPS showing where any given kaiju is located. Can your favorite character kill every kaiju on the island? 

Kaiju list:

Godzilla: Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah, Rodan, Gigan, Mechagodzilla (70s), both MUTOs, Zilla, Orga, Baragon, Varan, Biollante, Destoroyah, Spacegodzilla, Hedorah, and Minya. 

Pacific Rim: Onibaba, Knifehead, Yamarashi, Mutavore, Leatherback, Otachi, Raiju, Scunner, Slattern 

Pokemon: Groudon, Kyogre, Rayquaza, Ho-Oh, Lugia, Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres

BONUS: They get to call in one Mass Production Evangelion for help, BUT all the kaiju will bum-rush them.  




 All of these fighters can be argued as messiah figures after J-Dawg's own image. 

This is post-crucifixion Jesus

1: Gordon Freeman. All weapons allowed. (He's beloved, bearded, messianic supersoldier)

2: The Terminator 2 T-800 (Half man, stuggles between being objectively superior to humans and also being a human. Saves the world from its own hubris. Pretty much applies from here on out)

And any others you think should be on the list.  














 If you've got a loser and a Jew well deserving of a Sunday blast, write about that diva roach here. AKA! 














 The fight takes place in Tokyo on a full moon. They both get a month of prep time.  




 Is that robosexuality, even though she's an angel with a human's soul inside the robot? 


































 Specifically Unit-06 from End of Eva I guess. 

Bonus: all the EVEs on the ship vs one Eva 














 This one kind of operates on the assumption that Time Loop Theory is true, but realistically we all know it is. Especially Anno. 

Mari is the backup pilot for Unit-02, when it's made clear in NGE (and *heavily* implied in Rebuild) that Eva pilots can only do so because the soul inside the Eva is their mother, which allows for them to synch properly. Asuka is the designated pilot of Unit-02, because the soul of Kyoko is inside it (her?). When Asuka is out of commission following Unit-03's activation and possesion by Bardiel, Mari takes over as pilot of 02. But she shouldn't be able to, because no one named Illustrious is the soul of 02. Not only should she not be able to pilot it, but she unlocked its ability to transform (which Asuka later ended up using). If Rebuild is truly post-EoE, Kyoko could have brought herself back from the sea of LCL as her perfect self (look how similar [they](http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/122523.jpg) [are](http://media.animevice.com/uploads/0/4479/384373-makinami_mari_illustrious74_large.jpg)) in order to continue protecting the next Asuka. This Asuka, however, was not her equivalent's child, due to the fact that the original was still around. This Asuka belonged to someone with the name of Shikinami. That person was presumably another scientist at Gehirn (potentially even the doctor that original Asuka's dad hooked up with when Kyoko was in the hospital) who then became new Unit-02. This would explain the redesign and upgrade. As a soul formerly known as an Eva, she is also able to pilot Unit-05 and Mark.08.  





























 I just got finished rewatching 3.33 to try and figure out why I don't like it. Maybe this has something to do with me not having seen any Eva for a month or so, but I found myself actually enjoying it more the second time around. So what *did* go wrong? What went right? Should it be considered as bad as some consider it?

Well for starters, about half of the movie is exposition or setup with no real answers. You have the opening, AKA "Get out of the fucking robot, Shinji". Then you have Shinji trying to make nice with "Rei", then the only character development in this movie (which to be fair is quite good at making you care for both Kaworu and Shinji), then "We reveal what everyone already figured out halfway through 2.22 even if you didn't see the original" with Fuyutsuki, then  "Get in the fucking robot, Shinji" from Kaworu, Kaworu explains what *Totally* happened during "Near"-Third Impact (seriously we saw you impale him with the Cassius what the hell), then Kaworu says some cryptic shit interlaced with the fight against WILLE and then the movie ends. This movie fails in a few regards because of this: NGE had very little explanation, leaving most exposition up to a few cryptic conversations where much is spoken but not much is said. This leaves the viewer to come up with their own conclusions as to what was going on in EoE, or what SEELE's motivations were. These questions make sure NGE stays in the viewer's mind, making it one of the most memorable stories in all of history. 3.33 tries to repeat this, but where it falls short is that most of the questions it leaves have only one logical answer. "What is the Vessel of Adams?" it makes the viewer wonder, then they think and say "Oh, wait, it probably has something to do with the Angels and Instrumentality. Rei-ish is probably like Kaworu with boobs and a bowl cut". NGE had questions with *really* ambiguous answers that are so open-ended that they are still being debated to this day. 3.33 tries to be a regular movie where all your questions are answered so any unanswered questions become plot holes, but also tries to keep its artsy "leave shit up to the viewer" movie like End of Eva. 

3.33 also had very little character development As a follow-up to 2.22, we already know most of these characters. We know who the main characters are (or at least are meant to be, some of the more complex characters like Asuka have had life sucked out of them in favor of being a 2D tsundere with no real character whatsoever to the point where I've started calling her Asuka-ish). But these characters have become different people to who they were 14 years prior. They either needed more development or none at all. Pick one. And then they have the balls to throw in a new character with no development whatsoever in Mari "Deus Ex" Makinami. She just shows up during action sequences to be a comic foil to Asuka-sh and fetish material to everyone else (because the original had *nothing* to say about fetishizing teenage girls in anime. DAMNIT ANNO DID YOU EVEN WATCH EVANGELION). Whereas NGE was almost entirely character with little to no exposition, occasionally broken up by giant robot action, 3.33 was the exact opposite, being no character and lots of exposition/robots. 

That being said, what 3.33 does right, it does *right*. The new robots look great (they even have a 'Mark.# naming system so we don't confuse them with the Mass Production Evas). Kaworu and Shinji share some great chemistry together, some of the scenes are pretty damn atmospheric, and the hellish imagery is greatly effective, even some of the more subtle things like Shinji being the third thing they removed from Unit-01, and it's implied that what they found in there wasn't even human. There is a lot that's left to the imagination, like what else they retrieved from Unit-01, or what how Kaworu planned to use the spears. But it's held down by the fact that it's nothing but a retread of Episode 24 of the original, which tries to explain things but keeps holding itself back for that unique street cred. 

So is 3.33 as bad as some people say? I actually have two answers. As a standalone movie, or even as the third movie in the Rebuild saga (independent from NGE) I'd say it's pretty good. No masterpiece, but it's a decent sequel to 2.22 and presumed prequel to 3.0+1.0. The character development does leave some things to be desired, but it does a good job of not holding your hand. The hellish imagery adds a lot to the overall quality and it's appropriately subtle in a lot of places. Rebuild is a must-watch for any fan of Mecha. 

As an Evangelion movie, however, I'm gonna go ahead and say it's almost, but not quite, fucking garbage. It is the antithesis to everything Neon Genesis stands for, from its bland characters (except maybe Kaworu), to its "baby's first mindfuck" approach to Fourth Impact, to its sine-waving between Evangelion's "open to interpretation" plot and an easy to understand plot. Holding it up to the original, it's NOT subtle in any way, shape, or form. Obviously it's more subtle than Pacific Rim or Gurren Lagann, but it lacks the meta commentary, complex characters, and even the heart of NGE. The first half completely ignores the rest of Eva and effectively resets the universe, while the second half is just a drawn-out, over-the-top version of Episode 24. Rebuild (I've dropped the 'Of Evangelion' in the hopes that it might become true) has to make up for this with 3.0+1.0 if it wants any credibility. Just watch the last three episodes and you'll be good.  














 Does the [choral section after the guitar solo](http://youtu.be/k9zcjnEyKjc?t=1m45s) have any particular lyrics or is it just vocalization? I can't find any lyrics for them, but they are consistent throughout every single cover of the song.  









 Edit: for whatever *reason*. God damnit.  







































 Space-G has to fight every single pokemon. The fight takes place in that region's city, which Space-G has made his new fortress of solitude. Which regions can he defeat? Which regions defeat him?

Note: Especially for Gen IV, we are using whichever incarnation is most reasonable for the fight (e.g. giant Groudon. but no omnipotent Arceus) 



















 After Gendo Ikari is "eaten" by a naked Unit-01 during Third Impact, his soul is added to Instrumentality. The world he exists in and refuses to return from after Giant Naked Rei is killed is the one that exists in Rebuild. The first is a complete retread of his memories, knowing what he knows he added some things from the real world (red seas, MP-Eva outline) he sees where he went wrong and could make a change in regards to Shinji, by adding a new person to the mix, namely Mari Ilustrious Makinami. The reason she's a Mary Sue is because she represents Gendo's paradise, not unlike Kaworu for Shinji. Speaking of gay alien Jesus, he remembers the original because he's an Angel, and therefore infiltrated Gendo's world, once again like for Shinji. In Gendo's perfect world, he kills SEELE, the only people who were stopping his Instrumentality scenario. Going back to EoE, in his final moments, Gendo regretted his treatment of Shinji and his last words were an apology to his son. So all the *slightly* not-as-shitty-but-still-mostly-shit that Shinji suffers through in Rebuild (not being able to see the Dummy System kill Bardiel, not killing Kaworu with his own hands, being a hero and getting the girl in 2.22, etc.) was a result of that.

 **Name:** Amir Valerie Blumenfeld (also goes by "Vance", "DJ Schmumu", and various combinations of his name and "Jacob Hurwitz")

**Identification code:** 425862-JA-IIWY

**Biography:** This prisoner's past is inconsistent at best. As best we can gather, he was brought illegally from Canada to New York state, where his abusive parents raised him, teaching him to drive at 4. He was verbally and physically abused, and every time he was deemed a disappointment, his father moved houses. It is known that Amir was neighbors with a child named Penis Anthony Dooblinge (who recently changed his name to Roboert Cut off my own Penis Fatty Fatty Narr Narr Smoke A Bowl Full Of Sour Cream Veggie Burrito Penis) Amir was abducted from a shopping mall when he was six years of age and returned at the age of 11. He had forgotten how to speak and survived on a diet of chicken nuggets, a diet which still persists into his 30s. He repeated second grade an apparent total of 8 times, then managed to reach sixth grade without talking for four years, when he did eventually speak he was returned to second grade due o his illiteracy in math and English. It is unknown how much time passed before he got an internship at Collegehumor, where he still works, with no apparent job despite being employed. As a result of his upbringing, he seems to suffer from delusions of grandeur. 

**Known crimes:** Innumerable counts of attempted murder and aggravated assault, arson, prank calls to 911, attempted robbery on a subway, libel against an airline (awaiting a ruling form the jury) lying under oath, stalking, stabbing a coworker (Jake Hurwitz), several counts of animal abuse (a snake, a kidnapped dog, several animals he brutally murdered just to wear as accessories), sexual harassment, breaking and entering (at least two counts), armed robbery, destruction of property, public nudity, stealing from sleeping homeless women, assaulting police officers, and kidnapping the child of an officer. 

**Summary of capture:** A co-worker (Jake Hurwitz) alerted us about the dangerous nature of his actions and of the crimes he's committed. We waited at Jake's apartment until Amir attempted to break in, at which point we arrested him. 

**Sentence:** Amir clearly suffers symptoms of schizophrenia. He is to be given a therapist to help with his mental illness. For the crimes he has committed, he is to be given a life sentence with no probation. 

**Containment Notes:** Do not be fooled by Amir's weak, underweight body. He has more than enough strength to break out of a minimum security cell. He has the apparent ability to teleport, despite being a mortal human. He is to be locked in, with guards watching him at all times. Once his reeducation and rehabilitation are complete, he can be moved to a lower security and given probation.  




 1: a straight-up 3-way fight between them. Mothra has laid her egg and therefore can come back as two larvae if she so chooses. 

2: Who would do the best doing the other two's jobs? (ie. Aquaman vs Godzilla AND Aquaman vs pollution)

3: Who could they beat together?

4: How many Hedorahs would it take to defeat them? 
























 Baragon has apparently never won a single battle. Who's the strongest fighter he could fight in order to break his losing streak?  


































 I need to know what this looks like.  





























 The JSSDF scrapped the Jet Alone project after the episode 7 incident, and decided to instead work on a much better nuclear mecha to rival NERV's Eva-series. The JSSDF plans on raiding the Geofront using an army of Kiryus. Units 00 and 02 have been put into suspension at the time of the attack, so NERV only has Unit-01 to defend themselves. Shinji decides to stop being a bitchly and get in the fucking robot for once. 

Each Kiryu has an S^2 engine so they won't run out of power, but they still can't cast an AT field

Bonus: Could Kiryu beat one Mass Production Evangelion (who have no AT fields, but do have the heavy spear)?

Bonus II: Could one Kiryu succeed where Asuka failed and take out all the MP-Evas? The power issues Kiryu has are back for this round

Bonus III: How many Kiryus would it take to kill *every* Evangelion? Rebuild units included. That's 00, 01, 02, Bardiel, 04 (who is presumably the same as unit-02), Unit-05, Mark VI, Unit-08, Unit-09, and Unit-13 
























 [from this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNhsXnxl04w) 




 Cave Johnson has accidentally done a Second Impact. Now, because there is no Gehirn or SEELE in this world, Aperture Science has to be the ones to kill the Angels. They are also housing GLaDOS, who was built from Lilith now. If the Angels get to her, Third Impact will happen and GLaDOS will have failed. She has all the resources available in both Portal and the Half-Life games. Can she do it? Who does she use as a pilot I'd she figures out the Evangelion plans?

Things that now exist from Evangelion: AT fields, the Dead Sea Scrolls Apocrypha, the Lance of Longinus.

GLaDOS can also build Evangelions and the Positron Accelerator, but needs to research and invent them. She has 15 years after Second Impact until Sachiel attacks to build.  


































 I think I'm actually as religious as I am due in part Evangelion. I was pretty passively religious when I started, being a teenage child of a Christian family. I watched the first four episodes and my only thoughts on the religious imagery were "Oh, it's kind of like if Gundam let Jesus into its heart. I bet we're in for some edgy but ultimately meaningless symbolism." I came out of it still kind of believing that, but it was mostly silenced by something along the lines of **"WHAT IN THE EVERLOVING CRUCIFUCK DID I JUST WATCH"**. Then after the required analyses of the show and its symbols, I started to gain a deep appreciation for not just the religious aspects of Eva, but of Christian lore.

 Gamera wasn't Toho, though they did make the '90s movies. 

Anyway, I think after Rodan, Toho started to focus more on Godzilla again. Once King Kong vs Godzilla came out, there wasn't much time for a new Rodan movie because he was in the one after that. The only reason Mothra got her own trilogy is because she was so immensely popular, particularly among women, to the point that Toho decided to appeal to that demographic in particular.

 This Wolf O'Donnel bitch organized a Super Smash Bros tournament in my town the other day. He had the standard tournament rules- set stages, double elimination, no items, etc. He would only make an exception for games he was in. He only plays Diddy Kong, so when no one was looking before his match he would set the banana item spawn to as low as it goes. His idea was that since Diddy Kong's Down+B summons a banana anyway, no one would notice the subtle extra banana that would spawn. It didn't even affect his games, he just gets off to the knowledge that he did what he did.

 I don't remember if they said the line in the anime but I know in the manga that Ritsuko (and subsequently NERV as a whole) only expects Shinji to get in the fucking robot, nothing more. I think Unit-01 going berserk was part of the plan from the beginning.

 Easily Pokemon. I'm imagining Godzilla and Groudon  throwing down in Saffron City. Scale up some of the bigger pokemon ("Groudon is 13 feet" my ass) and have Kaiju smack down with them. Beautiful.  




 The problem is that most Kaiju are weaker than most of the Angels because of how much fuckery the AT fields create. There's no real way to fit in any Kaiju short of the Mothras or Iris into the story.

 Assuming Godzilla's feats are scaled down from 100m (Final Wars) to 2-3m, each Xenojira is about 3% of the original Goji's power. This means that 100 of them will be 300% of Godzilla's destructive power in total (thanks fan calculations). While I admit I've only seen Alien once, the GojiMorph will still be pretty tough to kill. Each individual Godzilla won't do anything to the GojiMorph, so all the Xenojiras (or at least 33) would have to work together. This poses somewhat of a problem, because Godzilla (Showa fuckness notwithstanding) is more of a lone wolf. After Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla (the '70s one), Godzilla only ever teamed up with Mothra in Final Wars (and even that wasn't really Godzilla and Mothra teaming up, that was Mothra coming in to kill Gigan and Keiser Ghidorah, and Godzilla just happened to be there). 

I suppose the Xenojiras have enough resistance and recovery to realize they can't go it alone, and one will eventually realize that organizing into two or three groups to take down the Gojimorph.

 We were at a local burger place and I was starting to worry, because I know what this little coywolf does in public. But what happened next didn't start with him. Someone a few tables away started having a heart attack. I saw Wolf's eyes light up as he realized that this is what he had been waiting for the entire time. He ran over and ordered a bystander to call 911, checked for a pulse, and gave mouth-to-mouth expertly, as though he ad been professionally certified. It was when he got to chest compressions that the dark truth behind his fucked-up plan was revealed. I only found this out later, but it turns out he actually hangs out at restaurants all over town and waits for people to need CPR. Turns out he actually *tries* to break as many ribs as he can manage while doing the chest compressions. 

The worst part is that because of Good Samaritan laws, nothing he does is *technically* illegal. No one even thinks to try him because he puts on such a good act, consoling their friends or family (if they're present) and most times even checking up on them in the following weeks.  














 After the Yui incident, Gendo knew Shinji would one day have to get in the Evangelion, so he tried to make him less dependent and bitchly by abandoning him. Because Evangelion is Evangelion, however, this only made Shinji a coward with some serious mental problems. 

I just watched TTGL and this thought came into my head.  




 The title? Kill Drill.

So Jon Wolf, social vigilante, agent of public chaos, and general nuisance, is challenged with defeating Winston Wolf, Marcellus Wallace's problem solver. 

Jon Wolf must create a scheme so subtle, so diabolical, so *legal*, that Winston simply can't fix it. What does he do, and how does he do it? *Can* he do it? 




 This is [Night](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_%28book%29) of the Living Dead. So all the zombies are actually just one big cloud of ash.

 It's a battle of the women (so this Courier is female) who were shot in the head and went on to become heroes. 

In both rounds, the events happen according to the whims of the Courier, meaning that she gets as much time as she wants. However, her opponent also gets that much time. 

Round 1 is a straight-up fight between the Bride and Courier. 

Round 2 has the Courier going up against Malala in a public speaking contest. Winner gets the Nobel Peace Prize.  




 The Bride has been tasked with seducing everyone's hyperactive explosion-loving director. What is the least valuable thing (to him) that could be promised to Bay in order to make him deny her? 




 I'm painting a bookshelf and I want to have a NERV logo. Problem is, I'm a terrible painter. I couldn't find anything by googling. Do you guys know of any way? 




 The complex characters are one of the best parts of Evangelion, but the complexity often gets pushed aside in favor of yaoi and/or Michael bay style action (looking at you, Rebuild). Is there any manga adaptation that stays true to the original without literally being the anime in comic book form?

 One thing that was always noticeable in the Rebuilds is their relatively "Baby's First Mindfuck" approach to what was originally one of the heaviest mindfucks out there. Because of this, they're very easy to watch (even 3.33 if you aren't *really* watching).  









 Looks like Mothra is joining [Godzilla's Nike sponsorship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oCF-QFuoYs).

C: you've never been part of any real discussion on games, particularly Nintendo games. Certainly not enough to complain about them.

 I want to imagine Unit-01 combined with the WUNDER to create arc-Unit-01. Then it turns out the black moon is actually a gigantic AT field battleship, so arc-01 fuses with that to become Super Galaxy Unit-01. Then after escaping the instrumentality, they become Tengan Toppa Evangelion Unit-01 out of sheer AT field power.  









 Maybe it's the manga adaptation, *Jesus-Kun and the Holy Venture: Great Suffering and Salvation!*

 In many games, I seem to take my opponent to 100+ percent, but I feel like I should be getting kills way lower than that. I usually juggle them with my Utilt/Uair or rely on smashes, but that doesn't seem to be doing the trick.

 After Nia turned into the Antispiral, said "hi my name is Antispiral time to fuck yo shit up", and fucked yo shit up, everyone immediately demanded that Simon be held accountable. Why did no one realize that the Antispiral were the ones responsible? Particularly the rational people like Rossiu, who sentenced Simon to death for what the Antispiral did.  




 Minus any interference from Kamui, Goku Uniforms, or any form of armor, how would that fight turn out? Gamagoori seems like he'd be strong enough with his own size-changing powers to beat Ryuko without Senketsu, but on the other hand, Ryuko is still a force to be reckoned with.

If one did the same things for mechas, from the glorified forklift from Aliens up to Super Tengan Toppa Gurren Lagann (and the Infinity Jeager) that would be fighter number two. 

2: how powerful is this mech? What can it beat? Who is its pilot?

3: the two do battle. Who wins? At what cost?

4: Both are competing for the same time slot on Toonami. Who wins?

 It's the silliest thing we all noticed the second or third time through Back to the Future. The timeline takes a whole week to catch up to Marty after he almost makes his parents not get hitched. This even seems to contrast the other two movies and how time acts there. But it actually doesn't work this way. 

The indicator (the photo in the first movie) is not actually displaying not the future Marty comes from as he changes it, but rather the possibilities of how each subsequent timeline changes the photo. By screwing up his parents meeting, he creates an infinite number of timelines, each of which has a different string of events following the accident. As time goes on, many of these events are narrowed out because that's how time works. Once those are gone, the timelines resulting in his parents not getting married become more and more likely until (at the Dance) Marty's existence becomes so unlikely that he wouldn't be able to save them in any way if it weren't for the fact that he *knew*. So the indicator is the only reason the chance wasn't straight-up zero, and how he was able to create one of the only sequences of events leading to his birth.  




 One of my favorite kaiju. He definitely needs to make a comeback somehow!

 It's gotta be one of the Pokemon games. Particularly Pearl, Platinum, or Soul Silver, since when I was younger (second or third grade when Pearl came out) I didn't have a whole lot of games. To this day, I consider the core Pokemon games the best game series of all time, since all of them are least an 8/10 for me. Over all the games, I can't imagine I've clocked less than 1000 hours.  




 No, not really. It's a similar sort of surrealist imagery centering on one woman. The only thing it really has in common with End of Evangelion is the non-pelvic vagina, which isn't really reminiscent of EoE in particular.  




 It implies this happens after some scenario of End of Evangelion. 

HOLD UP. This actually just occurred to me as I write this, but what if that is the outline of an Eva that went down fighting and securing Tunniel. According to people on this sub, Tunniel appeared in the fifteen years after Second Impact replacing Sachiel as the harbinger of the Angels' return. So if Tunniel had to be captured, what if Unit-00, Null, or Rei in 01 managed to take down Tunniel

 I don't know where in Jersey you are, so I can't give specific recommendations, but my general advice is this: 

Try and find a small pizza shop in town owned by an Italian-American couple (preferably named Joseph and Marie, but that's entirely optional). Big-name pizza places like Domino's and Papa John's are usually pretty bad, at least by Jersey standards. New Jersey (as well as NYC and a little bit North into Connecticut) has a near-endless supply of local restaurants who know how to make pizza right. Walking around in town for a bit should yield results.  




 Such an underrated kaiju. It's a shame he came right after Mechagodzilla and Biollante, because if it weren't for that he probably would have been received better.  




 Depends on where in Jersey you live. Plenty of responses here have some good NJ pizza, but my general advice is either to use Yelp (or some equivalent) or to find a small, non-chain pizza place by just walking around. Chances are you'll find a good thin-crust pizza with that method. 

If you live in or around Princeton, I can personally recommend Conte's and Pizza Star. For Mercerville, I would say DiLorenzo's.  




 It sure is a good thing I live right down the street from there. 

*So* good.

 I just looked up the colors and she could have an entire hand covered in lantern rings. She'd fit with green, blue, indigo, and violet.  




 Don't forget Annie's strongest asset: her undying optimism and willpower. It only just occurred to me, but if Bruce is in the Justice League, there's a good chance he could hook her up with a Lantern ring.

 Neon Genesis Evangelion and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Two Gainax mechas, considered by many to be the pinnacle of their genre. So is it possible that they're really one and the same? 

Both feature a magical power based on the soul of the user, namely AT fields and Spiral Power. They both serve many purposes, the main one being an "explain everything" scapegoat. The main antagonists of the shows (SEELE and the Antispiral) wish to rid the universe of ATSpiral as it is an evolutionary dead end that will lead the universe to destruction. 

Let's look at the Antispiral, actually. It's a being formed from the collective souls of a spiral race formed into one. SEELE wanted to complete the Human Instrumentality Project to being their species into one collective consciousness and rid themselves of the need for individual AT Fields. They also have proven to be fans of giant robots, which would explain the Granzeboma. So Gurren Lagann could be a reality in which Third Impact went according to plan, and SEELE got to try and rid the universe of humanity.

Her down-b is witch time, which works as a counter, but rather than just countering the attack she instead gains witch time proportional to the attack strength she is hit with. She then slows down time for everyone else but can move freely.

 In 2.22, Tunniel is the Third Angel, meaning it arrived before Sachiel. It presumably arrived at the same time as Adams and Lilith, considering Sachiel was still the first angel to arrive for 15 years. And its designation is the *third* angel, meaning it is in fact separate from the Adams and Lilith. And SEELE, holders of the Dead Sea Scrolls, have also confirmed it to be the Third. Both of the Angels who showed up around Second Impact were seeds of life, so if Tunniel showed up around that time as well, that means there's a good chance we're missing a whole other seed of life. It could also explain where the Spear of Cassius/other Longinus came from since Lilith lost hers in First Impact.

 Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt is somewhat similar, though it's a straight-up comedy, less than it is an action show. It's pretty similar in that it's also a sexualized parody of Magical Girl shows. iirc, the soundtracks are also done by the same person. 

Also, it's not really an anime, but Bayonetta is kinda similar. You might want to try out watching/playing that.

-episode 4. Fuck. 

-shorten the "serious" arc where they were on Earth post-time skip

-maybe extend the final fight by like 7 minutes

 I'm not an expert on the Mandarin, but from the thread it doesn't seem like a full-powered Bayonetta would have too much with him. At her full power, she took down both the god of her universe (or at least, its presumed creator) and the man who was nigh-omnipotent by stealing the full power of several gods. The only thing Mandarin can do to harm her is going to be the matter manipulation, which Bayonetta has overcome before with Jubileus and Aesir. The speedblitz could be an issue, making Witch Time a bit less effective, but in the Balder fights in Bayonetta 2 she's already proven that she can fight enemies much faster than her. 

Bayonetta wins.

 They seem like they'd be pretty cheap and easy to make, but I've never really done anything like that, so I have no idea where to start. 

If I were to make a pair, my main concern is how I attach it to my face. It just seems to be a shape carved from some tinted plastic, with nothing to rest on except the bridge of my nose. And speaking of tinted plastic, what's the cheapest/best material to make it out of? 

If I buy a pair, then where do I buy from? 




 That's not how that works.

 Madoka Magica is very similar to Evangelion, while still being different enough to be enjoyable. 

Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey isn't exactly an anime, but it's the classic sci-fi mindfuck and Evangelion does reference it a lot.

 Perhaps Mari will reveal the truths she knows and those will end up motivating him, making Mari not fucking worthless?

 As long as she doesn't swear during her combos (and honestly, her shouting "fuck off" during a combo was kind of out-of-character anyway) she'll probably be fine for the game, considering Palutena has a pole dancing taunt.  




 Not only that, but African Elephants exist in the Pokemon universe as well. They're mentioned in one of Gastly's pokedex entries.

 I thought the shit was meant to go in the toilet.  




 My favorite character is Bayonetta. I have Counter Vibration, Wing Blades, and invulnerability. 

Thing is, my invulnerability will mean that I get a good ninety or so years to fight Bayonetta. I'm to weak to ever hope to do any damage to her, unless I was able to become a witch/lumen sage, in which case I'd eventually be able to wear her down enough to beat her. Knowing Bayonetta, there's a good chance she'd just get bored and leave before I was able to wear her down.  









 [So, Ash Williams vs John Mcclane](http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2013/276/9/b/death_battle_idea_81__ash_williams_vs_john_mcclane_by_777jaylee777-d6p1b2n.jpg)

I've only ever seen the first Die Hard, and from what I can tell John Mcclane is a relatively realistic protagonist. His feats aren't as over-the-top as, say, winning a war against an army of Candadian Demons led by your evil skeleton twin. Ash stomps every day of the week.  




 I think the generally accepted explanation is that when party members "die" in battle, they really just pass out. Then when everyone passes out, they actually end up dying. A Pheonix Down therefore couldn't save Aeris because she wasn't injured in a way where she could come back.  




 Arceus also loses its omnipotence.

 From there we have two options: either Jake and Amir, and subsequently the subreddit, fall into obscurity and we all move on, OR we are promised more Jake and Amir (either renew the webseries or TV show confirmation) and we go the route of /r/rickandmorty until then. Though if it *is* the latter, not much will really change, will it? 




 I'd like to nominate Terminator 3 as a sequel to T2. It's not just that it's a bad movie from a different director with a poor premise. It's that its very existence undermines the story and themes of T2. 2 was a movie about defying fate and forging your own path to the future, the success of which was unique for what is, at its most basic level, a prophecy movie. T3 tore down the accomplishments of Sarah Connor to nothing more than a setback for fate. After watching T3, I could barely even enjoy T2 again, knowing that their struggle in that movie was ultimately pointless. 

So a sequel that actively ruined the original, that's why I think Terminator 3 is the worst.

 I had a theory that Evangelion and Gurren Lagann are two sides of the same story. [I posted it here a while back.](http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/2xfjsz/evangelion_and_gurren_lagann_tell_the_same_story/)

 I agree somewhat. Beauty has no weight limit, as long as it's proportional to their height. I'd be fine with a 300 pound girl as long as she's 8 foot 6.  




 I really liked the anime and movie (though they did remind me of Evangelion quite a bit) and I was wondering whether I should pick up the manga. Like Evangelion, it seems the manga has some subtle differences that might make it worth reading. Should I bother? 




 The End of Evangelion, because it is literally the ending to the TV series. It was what they intended before they ran out of money. It also happens to be one of the greatest films ever made in my own opinion, so absolutely check that out. 

After you clean your brains off of the wall behind you, you may want to move on to the Rebuild saga. 1.11 is a remake of the episodes until the fifth angel, 2.22 deviates into its own story, and 3.33 is completely different.  




 I though it was the one from Cabin in the Woods.  




 It's as much Shoujo as Evangelion is Shonen.

 We all know that in order to beat Spiral Power on the level of STTGL, you'd need to be no one short of Revelation Jesus. But is there anyone on the other end who can defeat STTGL by flying under the radar for long enough to take out the pilots?

From what I can gather, Simon is the only pilot that matters, and everyone else is basically just a Spiral Power generator. This would mean that anyone who can take out Boota, Yoko, or any of the insignificant side characters, can cripple it at least back to TTGL. But who's the strongest who's weak enough to take STTGL all the way back to five-meter mode? 




 Me so fucked up... 




 I didn't see that. Yeah, Mewtwo just has too much to deal with in a horde battle.  




 Didn't Ash become homies with God himself during one of the movies?

Regardless, I'm actually going to say no. Ash has had a lot of powerful friends (just about *every* pokemon that wasn't available except by events, what a coincidence!) but he has very little battle skill, next to no knowledge of matchups (he seems to bank on Spiral Power rather than strategy). Even if Ash had all this, Mewtwo is insane during his time under Giovanni. Ash has no chance in a one-on-one, regulation Pokemon battle. Mewtwo is the closest thing Kanto has to a demigod, and no single pokemon could hope to take him down. Maybe if Ash has them all in a row and gradually wears Mewtwo down, but it isn't very likely.  




 Do you have a talent for causing things pain? 




 Route 209 is my absolute favorite. A lot of the special battle songs in Sinnoh (Vs Dialga/Palkia, vs champion, etc) as well. Pretty much just the entire DPPt soundtrack.  




 I'll tackle them one at a time:

O-Ren: Without the Crazy 88s to wear down the Bride, she's going to have the upper hand. That isn't to say this battle will be easy for either of them, but it'll be easier for the Bride than the original battle since she won't fall down as much. The battle ends when the Bride disarms O-Ren and takes advantage of that oppurtunity.

Vernita: We only really know of Vernita as being on par with the Bride when they both wield knives. As her weapon of choice seems to be a butcher knife, she probably won't pose much of a problem against a knife-wielding Bride. Whenever she tries to parry with her knife(ves?), there's a good chance she'll just miss the parry completely and get slashed up. 

Elle Driver: This may be the most even battle. Both are nearly equal in sword fighting ability. If anything, Elle is actually more skilled than the Bride. But she wants so badly to utterly annihilate the Bride in the field of battle. She doesn't know when to hold back as opposed to going for a kill, which will ultimately be her downfall. She'll lose her other eye (again) at which point the Bride finishes her off. 

Budd: Fuck if I know. He had to resort to using ambush and we never actually got to see him fight. If he had, there's a good chance a dude with a shotgun can take out a woman with a sword. But, with her acrobatic ability, there's a good chance she'll be able to disarm Budd, which will cause his immediate defeat. 

And finally, Snake Charmer himself. He is apparently even better than the Bride with a Hanzo sword (though he decided that their duel wouldn't be very fruitful for either party). By this point, the Bride will have been worn down by her other opponents. That being said, she'll fight even harder than ever before. The fight ends similarly to how it ends in the movie, with the one attack Bill couldn't foresee: the five-point-palm exploding heart technique. He has a monologue and walks his five steps, defeated.

 However, Godzilla wouldn't have a strong enough AT field to manipulate, considering he would be Lilim. His AT field is just strong enough to keep him as an individual and not a couple hundred gallons of LCL.  




 Gurren Lagann is only a few stories tall. Godzilla would thoroughly wreck him, no spiral power needed. Arc-Gurren Lagann is significantly larger than Godzilla, making for another pretty unfair fight.  




 GMK has a lot of weirdness, especially considering that Godzilla isn't even really Godzilla, it's a collection of souls in the form of Godzilla.

 Because while Germany wants to eradicate the hateful nature of its past governments, America values freedom of speech as well as democracy.

Germany, on the other hand, realizes that the Nazi administration was just about the evilest thing they could do and has gone out of their way to stop it from happening again.

 The question was about Second Impact, which was merely the result of a contact experiment between a human and Adam. Every single Impact was a result of the combination of Lilith and Adam. First Impact was when Lilith landed on Earth, terraforming it for Lilin and requiring Adam to be impaled on his Lance. 2I was the contact experiment- no Lilith soul involved. 3I was souls and bodies, in as well as the combination of Unit-01 and Zeruel's S2 engine, AND the combination of Ascended Unit-01 and the Adam-based MP-Evas. That's why 3I was able to start instrumentality.  




 Well, as we saw in EoE, she is. Her involvement in 3I started when Shinji started screaming, not when she was crucified by the rest of the Eva series.  




 Homura did nothing wrong 




 From what I can tell, the only ingredients for an Impact is the combination of Lilith and Adam, not their souls specifically. During Second Impact, the combination was the body of Adam with the flesh of the Lilith-based humans. Lilith herself still had her soul, back under the city eventually known as Tokyo-3.

 Despite forcing the children to sign a contract, keep in mind that the contract was signed by minors, and therefore null and void. His factory is also several square miles, violating his property and moving into the private property of the surrounding city. He can't have let any health inspectors into his factory, and I refuse to believe his been paying taxes. He's housing potentially thousands of illegal immigrants. The glass elevator is *incredibly* dangerous, which could be considered a weapon.  




 Simon the Digger vs Shinji Ikari, I guess. I want to say Unit-01 could actually win, simply because I like NGE more than Gurren Lagann, but if Simon had transformations beyond Arc-Gurren Lagann then Eva gets rekt. If not, then it ends up being a classic battle of unmovable object vs unstoppable force. Bizzaro-Lagann could take it, since as he gets more and more scared of losing, he's going to get stronger and stronger, which will eventually result in him being stronger than Simon with all the Spiral Power in the universe. The question is if Simon kills Shinjimon before he can accumulate the power required to kill GL with pure bitchliness. I give it to simon 6/10, but if it were anyone other than Simon i would actually give it to Bizarro GL.  




 Say that to my face fucker not online see what happens.  




 You clever son of a bitch.  




 Most of my favorite fictional women I actually like for their character, not out of lust. I could stand Mothra trying to seduce me or 24 hours (though that would be funny as hell). Bayonetta would be harder, but since she's built like Slenderman with some well-placed fruit in his outfit, I think I could last if a million dollars were on the line. One day simply isn't enough to be worth a million. Now if I got to spend the rest of my life with her in exchange for a million dollars, that would be different.  




 Fun fact: Giratina's cry in this movie is actually the cry of Mothra. Since Toho is the distributor (I think) for the Pokemon movies, this happens several times throughout the series, though Giratina's is the only one I can think of.

 I have the omnibus version. It's much cheaper, and when you have all four together they look pretty nice. 

EDIT: There are a few cons, come to think of it. Volumes 13 and 14 are still only available in the seperate volumes, giving you four monoliths of Eva mangas and two tiny little books at the end. hopefully they'll do an Omnibus release to have those two included as well, preferably alongside Volume 12 so it can be a full End of Evangelion package.

 My favorite Pokemon is Braviary. 

Braviary isn't the most *supernaturally* powerful of all the Pokemon, but its strength will fit right in in the Capital Wasteland. Not to mention the fact that its pure patriotism is rivaled only by... Liberty Prime, actually. The Enclave wouldn't beef with someone patriotic enough to pal around with a red, white, and blue eagle, especially when that eagle can wreck an entire platoon of power armored soldiers with one Return. If we take the place of any random NPC, we'll be fine. We probably have enough strength to take a settlement like the supermarket, then defend it while still being on the good side of one of the major factions. If we take the place of the Lone Wanderer, then things get a little tougher since I can't have Dogmeat. Plus, being hunted down by anyone might end up with them sniping my bird.

 The clones in Smash 4 are just ascended alt skins. The team decided that Doc and Mario, Lucina and Marth, and Dark Pit and Real Pit should be slightly separate, so very little time went into them. It's not like they stole anyone else's spot in the game.  




 Lucas isn't so much a clone as he is a "cousin" to Ness, considering his entire moveset is different, like Falco. Also, those "like 10 clones" didn't take anyone else's spots. They were originally just skins but the Devs decided they should be a bit more unique.

 The year is 1942. Worrying that they were overpowered by the Axis, the Allies import a team of biological weapons from their newest member- Unova. Six fully trained Braviaries, which the Allies use as a replacement for their armies. Can they restore freedom and Democracy to the world?

 Contrary to popular belief, Gojira may well be the worst film to start out on. It's gritty, it's dark, and it's almost completely different from every other film in the franchise. The best one to start out on is probably new, American Godzilla. It doesn't have the problem of the special effects that most people find hard to overlook until they're already fans of the series. After that, I would say Godzilla vs Mothra (1964) as that is probably the best monster mash in the franchise.

 Season one is *sort of* in two parts. You could say that post-Episode 8 Kill la Kill is pretty different from the first 7, since they form a more linked and emotional plot. You could also say that when the second OP shows up (after the "recap episode") is sort of a second part.  




 Gurren Lagann. I need more of that shit, there's more that can probably be done with it. Maybe the chronicles of Lordgenome in the original battle against the Antispiral? I don't know, but whatever it could be would probably ruin the ending of the original.

 Shinji: Eevee. Ability: Run Away.  




 After episode 26, watch the director's cuts of episodes 21-24. They fill in a lot of the stuff that was in Death and Rebirth but not the original and is more or less essential to EoE. And going to EoE straight from episode 26 will leave you very disoriented from a timeline perspective.

 BROJOB! BROJOB! 




 Rebellion all took place in Homura's labyrinth, didn't it? So unless one of them went witch during the fight (as evidenced by the Walpurgisnacht battle, this isn't probable) Rebellion wouldn't really do much. At least, not for Homura. And I did specify no Godoka.   




 The MP-Eva's had their own cores. Plus, they weren't starting 3I by themselves, they used the ascended Unit-01 as a conductor for their own Anti-AT fields. And the Lance's. And Giant Naked Rei's.  




 I made sure it wasn't unit-01 almost entirely for that purpose. Unit-02 (as a child of Adam) doesn't have the same impact potential as Unit-01. So no divine ascension here.  




 Mami, Sayaka, Madoka (not Godoka), Homura, and Kyoko fight against a standard Evangelion (to be specific, use the production model Unit-02). The battle takes place in the Tokyo-3. Unit-02 gets the progressive knife and nothing else. 

(Homura doesn't get to rewind time for a win.)

 He's done it before. Off the top of my head, he took a dig at anime protagonists when he mentioned one tossing off to unconscious women in his C/Katherine review, and he portrayed our very own waifu wars in his ET for Atari 2600 review.  




 They feel all other wounds like they would if they were actually happening (even sustaining the same injuries as the Eva if their synch ratio is high enough). So Asuka and Rei will feel the same, no questions asked. But the Eva has no balls, partly because they're angels and partly because they're moms. So it's more likely that Shinji, Kaworu, and Toji would feel the same as they would if they didn't have male genitals. Just sorta... under their dicks.  




 It's like Sonic the Hedgehog, but for grandmas instead of autistic teenagers.

 Japanese reads right to left, so most of their books are written accordingly. When localized, most translators choose to keep this to avoid screwing up the art. This ain't always the case, but it usually is.  




 This might be true for Red and Leaf, maybe even Gold and Crystal, but once legendaries and gods and all that get thrown into the plot, the whole theory goes right down the drain. Specifically, Arceus in Gen IV, Xerneas in Gen VI, and the whole plot of Gen V. The fact that God himself appears before you and deems you worthy of capturing him would imply that Lucas and Dawn are in fact humans of His design, not an android created by someone else. Because if he were to appear before the worthiest trainer, wouldn't it be the guy who designed your AI?

I think the theory that Pokemon's humans are actually Pokemon (and not humans as we know them) is still the strongest. It has the most supported evidence, and explains everything that would be explained by this theory. In the games, we see that Pokemon don't need to eat or sleep a long as they aren't damaged. Since the trainer never takes any damage, they can just keep going forever.  




 I would recommend the original 21-24, followed by episodes 25/26. The Director's cuts seem to be more of a setup to End of Evangelion than the originals, which led more so into the original ending. They really only have some extra scenes (and one infamous scene from episode 24 cut shorter). If nothing else, it's easier to appreciate the director's cuts after having seen the original episodes. Also, the director's cuts lead directly into the film, as even the preview for episode 24' shows one of the scenes from the film. Going straight to EoE from episode 26 will leave you disoriented from a timeline standpoint.  




 Komm, Susser Tod (Tumbling Down) would be a good choice as well, except for the fact that it's pretty long. Fly Me to the Moon is shorter, as well as having less of the weeb factor.  




 That was pretty fun.

The next one should be Fly Me To the Moon, I kick ass at that song.  




 I ended up getting a Nidoran F on Route 35 and double kicked my way through the gym.  




 The movie in question is called Death and Rebirth. It's technically in two parts. Death is just a 40 minute recap episode, and Rebirth is the first quarter-ish of End of Evangelion. So if you just watched the series, move on to End of Evangelion. 

Though you should remember to watch episodes 21-24 Director's Cut after episodes 1-26. Then EoE. I haven't seen anyone mention that.

 No, all 12 men on the Moon to date have been American.  




 My favorites are actually a tie between Unit-01 and the Mass Production Units

Unit 01 just has an amazing design. I also love how badass she is when Shinji isn't in charge. 

The MP-Evas are really unnerving (or unNERVing i guess) since they look so... biological in their movements, despite the fact that they still give off the outward appearance of the robots. The other Evas don't do that. That and they have fuckin' sword-lances.  




 The DVDs, the Manga, and one soundtrack CD (Death)

I haven't seen any chance to grab any of the art books yet. Yet.  









 Weird. I haven't seen many go for that cheap.  




 [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byronic_hero)

Taking into account the character development we'd seen throughout the first series, and even some of the second and Final Wars, I thought Goji has all the traits required of a Byronic Hero. My English teacher disagrees and I disagree back. What do you guys think? 




 There was a period with collegehumor where they did censor some swear words, and judging from the TruTV shows I've seen they're going to be around that level of vulgarity. So I'm not really worried. 




 platinum thin is probably the best release (so far) of NGE, and EoE really hasn't had any great releases yet. The US copies of EoE are $100+, so unless you want to spend that much you should buy one from the UK, where the movie is really cheap for some reason.  




 This isn't cringe. This is good.  




 It honestly makes as much sense to me to ship her with Sub-Zero if we just stick her with any fool with ice powers. Jack and Elsa just don't seem like a good match. 

ninja edit: I just found [this](http://uekiodiny.deviantart.com/art/Sub-Zero-Elsa-and-Jack-ah-O-O-454801167) after a quick bit of googling. *it's perfect* 




 1) the first two angels had been around for a couple billion years, as they were the Seeds of Life that originally crashed to Earth. Second Impact took place in 2000, and scattered young, larval Angels all across the world to ultimately find their way to Tokyo-3. 

2) That's where they thought Adam, their father, was. They wanted to get back to him to be the vessel of the Third Impact. It was actually Lilith, they just figured that there couldn't be another AT Field as strong as their Seed of Life. 

3) they had different motives and scenarios for third impact. Gendo wanted to use it to see Yui again, while SEELE wanted to create a God out of humanity. 

4) Actually Adam (Unit-01 being the exception), but other than that you're spot-on. 

5) S2 engine. It's an organ that allows Angels to be perfect, self-sufficient, godlike life forms. It allows for them to pull from limitless power by harnessing the AT Field. This is why the Angels are just about immortal except for the core, which is the S2 engine. 

6) To make a very long story short, the Lance was packaged with both seeds of life. It was basically an emergency shutdown device for seeds of life so two didn't end up on the same planet. The Lance we see in the series was Adam's, which he used on himself during the First Impact after Lilith lost hers. 

7) She's a clone of Shinji's mother, Yui, with added Lilith DNA (I think). She also houses the soul of Lilith (except Rei II, who holds only a part, the other belonging to Unit-00) 




 aww... 




 but Sexism= prejudice + not being me so WZXMXN CANT BE SEXIST!!! 




 Police should all have to show if they have bad taste in anime 




 It doesn't look like it's the title of the promotion, since it's only on the Evangelion side of the "Schick X Evangelion" thing, so is it the new subtitle for 3.0+1.0? Or is it the retroactive subtitle to Neon Genesis thanks to the new BD/DVD?  




 Why include Portal in a Playstation commercial when that game is known for its PC version? 




 I hope she's okay with Mothra being the #1 mom.   




 From what I understand of your question, you *have* seen the series and want to buy it, correct? If not, all of these are in the order you should watch them (except Death and Rebirth, it's a glorified recap episode)

There's nowhere to legally digitally download any of the series to my knowledge, so I'll break down the releases by series:

NEON GENESIS EVANGELION:

There's been a couple releases on VHS, Laserdisc, and DVD. There's also an upcoming new DVD release and a Blu-Ray release which may or may not be coming to the West. The cheapest DVD box currently is ADV's "thin pack" Platinum Collection (you can find it on Amazon, but beware as there is a lot of bootlegging). This contains the whole series, plus the Director's Cut Episodes, in the highest available quality (until Blu Ray HD). It's the one I have. There's also another Platinum Collection, the "thick pack". Same contents, episodes 1-26/24'. But this one has many more bonus features, though the overall quality sufferers for it. 

TL;DR: If you want cheap(ish) but good image quality, Thin Platinum. If you can spend more and don't mind slightly lower image quality of it means more content, then the Thick Platinum. If you want both and want to try your luck, you can wait for the New DVD or Blu-Ray. 

DEATH AND REBIRTH

Don't even bother. It's getting included with End of Evangelion anyway. 

END OF EVANGELION

This had a couple DVD releases from Manga Entertainment and another company who I don't remember. It's expensive as FUCK for a U.S. copy of the DVD ($100+, MIN). If you have a multi-region DVD player (or a PC), just import an English copy from the UK. For whatever reason it's really cheap across the pond. This is also getting re-released on Blu-Ray, though no confirmation of a new DVD has come up. This brings us back to D+R. The Blu-Ray of NGE includes "Revival of Evangelion", which is the final cut of Death (the recap half of Death and Rebirth) cut together with the final cut of End of Evangelion. 

TL;DR: **GOD SAVE THE QUEEN**

Evangelion 1.11: You Are (Not) Alone

This one's been pretty easy to find, but there *is* some fuckery afoot. There also exists a release on DVD and Blu-Ray of Evangelion 1.01, which is just a non-remastered version of the same movie that came out, then they realized there was some work that needed to be done, hence 1.11. (1.0 is the theatrical version). In my experience, buying 1.11 is cheaper, plus it includes the old version in case you're a masochist. 

TL;DR make sure there's no zeroes

Evangelion 2.22: You Can (Not) Advance

This time there wasn't even a 2.02 release. Choose DVD or Blu Ray and give Anno your cash. 

Evangelion 3.33: You Can (Not) Redo

This one isn't out in the West yet. If you hate dubs with a passion, then you can import a DVD or Blu Ray from Japan, but if you want a dubbed release from Funimation we're still waiting on that shit. 

Sadamoto's manga

The official manga has four 3-volumes-in-one releases, plus standalone releases for volumes 13/14. Check Barnes and Noble, they should have something.  




 I have seen Hellsing Abridged and it didn't even occur to me that that was a reference. 




 I'm with you, DJ Hero was the shit. Especially since I got the thing where you could play as Daft Punk. But that's a fair point as well.  




 That might be the single most incorrect thing I've heard all week. It's so far from anything resembling the truth. She was an advocate for women's rights long before taking the bullet. The bullet is just what put her on the global map, especially since she kept doing what she was doing after getting shot for it.  




 2015

going to /r/AdviceAnimals for dank memes

fucking casual. true losers only go to /r/4ChanMeta for the freshest of maymays 




 It's a joke, though it looks like the original was unironic defening.  




 Allow me to play Devil's Advocate, as someone who watch intently the brutal death of the music game genre. 

~~It was a few years before the end of the last console generation. There was exactly one game that most people point to when they talk about the downfall of music games: DJ Hero. It was similar enough in concept to Guitar Hero, everyone was pretty excited for some fan-favorite techno influenced songs. But the controller... The controller is one of the most fucked up abominations to come out after the Power Glove. Even the Kinect laughs at the DJ Hero controller. This ruined the game, and made everyone realize what they were doing wasn't fun, it was just a glorified quicktime event-filled music player. This is when the entire market realized that music games really did make them look like tremendous twats who could just as easily be streaming the same songs on the internet for free. It was with that game that the genre died down to a couple releases a year, after both Rock Band and Guitar Hero kind of gave up.~~

So the defener could be interpreting an electronic-influenced song as harkening back to the death of the genre, the worst thing one can do when trying to revive the genre. 

Or he could just be a pretentious asshole, either one really. 

Edit: there's also the possibility that I'm a fuckin idiot who doesn't know what he's talking about.

 Isn't a doppelganger just someone who looks like you? 




 There are dozens of us! 

Dozens! 




 But the T-800 would have to switch off of read-only mode in Middle-Earth. He only did so in T2 because John wanted him to stop being such a dork. Even then, he didn't really have his own emotions, he just comprehended John's.  




 To be fair, I thought it was Unit-13 for a second 




 Pigs are communists though, so it's all cool.  




 Stage 15 Jontron withdrawal.  




 Fishing for Gaghiel? 




 It *does* help that TTGL is a bit of a parody of NGE.  




 Noriko is like Shinji without a dick but with bigger balls.  




 Two words: Gurren Lagann.  




 It was. It was also Hideaki Anno's directorial debut.  




 Fuck. That actually makes a lot of sense.  




 It also helps that Ramiel's the only angel to be implied to be even close to female (Lilith notwithstanding) 




 Glad I'm not the only one who knows where their towel is.  




 So... Bayonetta confirmed? 




 I'm so happy I managed to snag one while they were still on Amazon.  




 The rebel alliance get some new recruits: Noriko Takaya and Amano Kazumi, along with their Buster Machines. Using the Gunbuster, can the rebels destroy the Death Star without needing Luke? Do they even have to use the one weak spot? 









 I'll trade you a NiB Mario for a Rosalina restock.  




 There's Sadamoto's manga, which tells the same story, but with several minor (and some major) differences (For one, Kaworu shows up way earlier and is actually a full-fludged character). There's a couple other mangas as well, like Campus Apocalypse, but none of them are really very good like the original. 

Once you've gotten to every Evangelion medium, you could try some other, similar shows. Gunbuster was the first work of Evangelion's director, Hideaki Anno. It's also a great work which greatly influenced mecha, especially Evangelion. They also share similar themes and characters, to the point where Shinji seems like Gunbuster's Noriko with a dick. There's also Gurren Lagann, which is an incredibly badass sort-of-parody of Evangelion. Finally, Madoka Magica. In the most basic sense, it's Evangelion with magical girls instead of mechs.  




 This is specifically in reference to the mobile game.  




 Games are just 1s and 0s but most of us still like 'em.  




 Was Hikari even *in* 2.22? 




 That's stupid. Just who in the hell do they think they are? 




 I called my local GS, and they said it's not happening, so chill yo.  




 Why not? 




 On DVD, preferably.  




 Kinky.  




 That would be great. I'm fucking tired of hearing Peter Parker's origin story, give me a new Spider-Man origin.  




 I think she actually looks really good. I might pick her up, even though I wasn't planning on getting any of wave 5A.  




 Where'd you get your hands on that? It looks awesome 




 That makes sense, since they were all animated by a different studio and not considered canon. 




 One of the best in the whole series. Better than Hedorah.  




 Marv Newland produced by Mr and Mrs Newland 




 In, like, a display case?  




 Why? 




 To be fair, the "Mario is a communist" one ended with him pointing out how batshit theories can get.  




 Bullshit. We all know Lucina's flatter than Mr Game and Watch.  




 Tabris got the booty.  




 Gonna make a Captain Falcon with realistic booty.  




 I didn't know you could become a cop in this game 




 Not the pilots, the robots. 

Unit-00, Unit-01, and Unit-02. Best anime MILFs.  




 January is usually a terrible month for movies. Like one or two good ones, max. 

I had not taken the competition from Star Wars into consideration.  




 can't lose those gains, brah 




 It's a shame, since that's the one thing that really brings down the movie. If it weren't for that, I'd say it's one of the best in the series.  




 Yeah, despite being the focus of most of the advertising, he was killed off in like the first half hour of the movie.  




 I think /u/GamingTatertot might have been referencing the new Godzilla. I hope, because if not he just accidentally described that movie pretty accurately.  




 Next January

That's not a good sign.  




 You gotta monologue before getting into the suit. That's badass 101. Arms folded, too. [Like a fuckin' pimp.](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/664/747/f5f.jpg) 




 Because once she gets developed as a character, she's one of the more complex and sympathetic characters to have ever been written in an anime. 

I was referring to the actual quality of the dub though. Because Tiffany Grant's Asuka is fucking perfect. Everyone else's performance smooths out by that point too.  




 Rob Bethesda at gunpoint.  




 What if Godzilla was one of us? 




 Every time I rewatch it, I find Evangelion's first couple episodes to be pretty tough to get through. Though that could be because the dub doesn't get good until Asuka shows up... 




 *unzips dick* 




 What about G14? 

Also, I think Gojira's a pretty bad place to start. The dark tone and general gloomy nature clash with the rest of the series, to the point where it's practically separate from the other movies (G85 notwithstanding) 




 And the Inklings 




 As an American, that's pretty much my understanding of Boston.  




 Ganondorf is high-tier in terms of porn site sponsorships.  




 I found out the preorders had started when I learned that they ran out of Pip-Boys. 




 Teen Sword Squad! 




 I wasn't gonna get this DLC, but now I think I might.  




 Reggie looking like he's playing Little Mac 




 when u nut but Todd Howard still suckin 




 Gonna keep these box boxes nib 




 Is Ryu going to S-tier? Because it looks like Ryu is going to S-tier.  




 \not keeping your box boxes in a box 




 "Jet fuel can't melt steel beams"

It's a phrase making fun of 9/11 conspiracy theorists.  




 I can do it.  




 I'm not entirely sure I can get with that. Oh well, worst case scenario is someone mods it out.  




 Someone's never played Melee.  




 Its only seriously redeeming feature is the Chao garden

City Escape.  




 But it wouldn't make sense *not* to use Bayonetta. Since she is being exclusive now.  




 "MATOI RYUKO!" 




 Shame they're limiting themselves just to Bayonetta then.  




 The good news is that Ryu's amiibo will be one o might be able to get, since it looks like the third-parties are relatively common (at least at my local TRUS) 




 Did they say they were only doing *one* smash ballot character? 




 Do you play Boswer Jr as "Lagann"?

That's what I'm planning on naming my Bowser Jr amiibo, anyway.  




 My favorite fun Super Robot show is Gunbuster (and to a lesser extent, its sequel, Diebuster). Another Gainax mecha which TTGL takes heavy inspiration from (some people even claim that the end result of TTGL was an attempt to one-up the size of the Diebuster). IT's a classic that every mecha/anime fan should watch at least once. Considering TTGL is less of a show and more of a "best-of" video of mecha influence, a lot of it is taken straight from the playbook of Gunbuster. 

There's also Getter Robo and Mazinger, which I can't personally attest to, but are some of the other classic Super Robots that really shaped the genre (apparently someone cuts a planet in half in Shin Getter Robo)

If you start feeling depressed, hit up Evangelion. Alongside TTGL and Gun/Diebuster, it stands at the top of the Super Robot genre. It's the deconstruction of the genre, being much more character-focused and less action-focused (don't let that turn you off, I actually consider it the greatest anime of all time). While not enjoyable for the same reasons as TTGL, you should certainly watch it. Gurren Lagann was actually somewhat of a parody of Evangelion (when you watch the show you'll see what I mean. There's a lot of connections).  




 Why won't Falcon-senpai notice me? 




 The only model of the 3DS that's compatible with amiibo is the New 3DS XL. The only amiibo compatible games for the N3DS are Smash Bros 3DS (Which works with every amiibo except Splatoon and Toad, so far), Code Name S.T.E.A.M. (which works with the Fire Emblem amiibos, so don't even trip cause you won't get your hands on one of those), Ace Combat Assault: Horizon Legacy (which works with most amiibos), and Xenoblade Chronicles 3D (Which only works with Shulk. In other words, no amiibo compatibility)

[here's](http://www.nintendo.com/amiibo/compatibility) the compatibility chart 




 Is that Dark Link a different figure? 




 For publicity. The utter ridiculousness (and yet appropriateness) of a porn site sponsoring a player brings in traffic.  




 "pretty good argument for legalizing murder"? 




 Is that one of those things that they're gonna patch in? Eventually? 









 Maybe I can go Ganon with a sponsorship from /r/spacedicks 




 What, that Sheik is actually not the epitome of manliness and testosterone with a pair of testicles big enough to make a Goron jealous? What else would he be, the Princess in disguise? That would be funny.  




 better nerf ^^/funnyandoriginal 




 Because he's the only furry that's cool. He has an AT field 10/10 




 That Sheik dude has a nice man-ass. For someone with a Y chromosome.  




 When are these coming to America?  




 You guys know you want me.  




 Same reason as Fakku 




 Looks like I need to learn Ganondorf and go after Pornhub.  




 I always hated how he beat Godzilla, though. 




 Did the kid die in a coal mine?  




 I want to give my friend a vinyl record of the Watergate tapes and I don't know where to go.  




 This should be on *my* desk 




 Cthulhuphant? 




 It's not (just) that you can't see where your feet are. It's that you have next to no spacial awareness that third person (or in the case of real life, your other senses) can provide.  




 Also because, you know, raisins in ice cream.  




 Why ban Afro Samurai?  




 I'll agree with you on the art style. Mirror's Edge makes for some *damn* nice screenshots. And the first person perspective does allow the player to appreciate it. But I just don't understand how people enjoy *playing* it. Platforming in a first person perspective just doesn't work as well as in third person.  




 [real question] Why do people like the gameplay so much? Platforming in first person is such a terrible idea, and it's not like Mirror's Edge executes it in a manner that redeems it.  




 Mechagamera? 




 *sigh* Ganon and ZSS are gonna be unicorns, aren't they?

At least I can still have Doc and Bowser Jr

...hopefully.  




 Someone's never seen /r/Slutoon

Though to be honest, I wish I hadn't either.  




 He doesn't tip on his shawarma.  









 I want to train Pac-Man. I'm good at Mewtwo and Rosalina.  




 Yeah, it seems like OP wouldn't have gotten Akame's number if it weren't for Sakura. So this is absolutely a positive outcome.  




 This is why I'm ashamed to tell people I like anime. These fuckers ruined an entire medium. I kinda wanna go burn my Evangelion DVDs now. 




 Mecha cosplay is the best cosplay.  




 Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann! Robots the size of the observable universe throwing down using *fucking galaxies* as weapons. 

Also, Evangelion. EoE (and to a lesser extent, the TV ending) is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen, even though the show started out kinda rocky. 

And Gunbuster. Episode 6 is just... fuck. EDIT: In a good way.  




 2077: Pokemon Mystery Dungeon 




 Agreed. Bayonetta 2 has to be the best single player game on the Wii U right now. 




 Please let it be Bayonetta, please let it be Bayonetta, please let it be Bayonetta, please let it be Bayonetta.. 




 Old blueman: 

New blueman: :(

What happened, America? 




 I thought I was an ear of butter! 




 Arceus, as one should always keep the Lord in their heart 




 It's like End of Evangelion with more mindfuck.  




 seeing internet strangers give each other precious metals.

 Yep. [You need this to use it](http://m4sv.com/page/wii-u-gcn-usb-driver) 




 his taunts would be the first to deal damage to the player 




  A government weaponizing Arceus, the literal God of creation, is downright terrifying.

Vatican too OP Game Freak pls nerf 




 Wow it's like no one wants a Charizard. I'd be glad to have it.  




 Earthbound is freakin' sweet. Whoever gets it is gonna have a field day.  




 MattyB, a white kid who thinks he can rap. his parents (and more importantly, their wallets) agree.  




 There are **REASONS** why it can't be a Mexican standoff!  




 Man finally getting my hands on Charizard would be sweet 




 Yours is the railgun that's gonna pierce the heavens! 




 Im totally stealing it.  




 The area is gray in a one two three way.  




 To be fair, that's on a window. Anyone who looks out that window is gonna see "niggaZ". The real question is why no one thought of that when they first did it.  




 Does Rami-chan even have boobs? 




 You're not a tycoon! 




 She's heavy because she's a god damn giant. Who has galaxies up her dress.  




 What happens when it goes over nine tho-


Fuck it. I'm above that joke.  




 Did you hack Linux, Java? 




 Wisconsin needs to go back to Canada where it belongs. 




 I want to watch the Granny Sexbang episode but I'm not sure my cold heart can handle it.  




 Maybe we can play some Project M with this 




 Kiryu's one of my favorite mecha, but I can't seem to find any model kits of him. Am I just not looking in the right places? 









 That's the reblogger. THEY probably did it as a joke.  




 Has Arin taught you nothing 
























 Steven+Sugilite? 




 Where were u when society was fuck 




 My book backlog is beyond ridiculous. I find that my main problem is that while I'm reading, sitting in silence actually hurts my concentration. Of course, a lot of the music I've tried tends to be rather distracting (or at the very least, doesn't fit the mood). What are your thoughts? Any recommendations? 




 Sci Fi- the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It's easily my favorite book of all time (the first sequel as well, the rest kinda got away from me) and outside of Foundation, a good candidate for greatest Science Fiction novel. 

That being said, the Foundation books are probably also on there. I can't say for certain, I've never actually finished them (sorry)

Superhero/Graphic Novel- Watchmen. Fuckin'... duh. 

Though as for graphic novels, I would also like to give a shoutout to the Neon Genesis Evangelion manga, if only because I love NGE, and the graphic novel is pretty spectacular.  




 Sugilite should be sponsored by Monster. Considering, [you know...](http://youtu.be/3fD_KYpWSJE) 




 This is Wall Street

Back together

And I'll never have a recession at the hands of the stock market because we're doing much better

And the economy is saying "go get her"

The Upper Class ain't gonna follow your rules

Come at me without any of your commie fools

Let's go, just me and you

Let's go, my profits grew

Go ahead and overthrow me if you're able

Can't you see that the economy is stable

I can see you hate the way we trade under the table

But you're just mad your revolution's been disabled 




 Whatever happened to Ocean Town is apparently still "too soon" in SU 




 So that's... 7000000000!, I think.  




 What the hell is wrong with your backwards-ass continent? 




 Zoom, Samuel, Zoom! 




 Where did Steven come from? 




 Lucina

Flatter than Mr Game and Watch. 0/10 waifu 




 Hey yo my name is Drake, do you know my buddy Samuel? 




 Totally satire. Though it's getting harder and harder to tell.  




 Def satire.  









 This coy little Jew.  




 Cop out bastards... 




 Two words: Papyrus Sans.  




 Looks like the Antispiral is doing its job.  




 As if this show weren't disappointing enough.... 




 Maybe it's because Look Who's Talking isn't good.  




 Mr Game and Watch? 




 Sad teenagers and giant robots 




 Fortunately for her she's not a singer, she's a rapper.  




 Don't get me wrong, Strong in the Real Way is probably the second or third best song in the show, but Sugilite totally should have gotten a verse. You don't get Nicki Minaj and *not* have her rap, Rebecca. Come on.  




 That makes the last panel even better. "Ah, cockblock!" 




 Terminator 2? 




 ...most of the Godzilla franchise

[anyway, here's an article that can probably explain it better than my sleep-deprived brain](http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/evil-dead/220045/bruce-campbell-explains-the-evil-dead-timeline) 




 End of Evangelion? 




 A man cuts off his hand and almost destroys the world by reading a book.  




 Unless you mean something other than a continuation of the same story, then in pretty sure you agree.  




 According to Bruce Campbell, Evil Dead 2 actually is a sequel in the traditional sense. They couldn't get the rights to their own movie, so instead they made the first part of the movie a sort of modified recap of the first movie. If you took the end of ED1 (when Ash gets hit in the face with the first-person thing) and put it in ED2 when he gets hit again, you'd have the proper continuity.  




 "Do your parents know you're straight?" 




 **MAYOR SUEY**

**MAYOR SUEY** 




 Amopthyst confirmed hottest nude scene in GoT. 




 I love the amount of overlap between TTGL and Steven Universe.  




 I'd actually get a Peach is Pink Gold Peach was an option.  




 Dank ass memes.  




 "I'm always a slut for Doritos!"

"You're cheating on me with Peridot?!" 




 I'm pretty sure he is in he show too. Isn't it like that in Rebuild because of Tunniel? 




 It starts out with bands like One Direction to catch the defener crowd, but by the end of the show they're delving into more loved classic bands like the Beatles. "But /u/test_subject8582," I hear you asking "Surely there are people who would be perfectly accepting of the Beatles' songs 24/7. Many people probably already do that." So my solution: start off with their good stuff (first couple days alternate between Lucy in the Sky, Sgt Pepper, etc.) but as people refuse to leave, slowly start replacing songs with their worse songs (Swap out Yellow Submarine in the rotation for Octopus' Garden for example). By the season finale, we have people listening exclusively to Yoko Ono's contributions.  




 "I'm not my mom! I'm me! Steven the digger! Just who the heck do you think I am?!" 




 Fun momp  




 This one is pretty heavy on the themes, so it's definitely not irrelevant.  




 It ain't easy being white... 




 Henry Winkler should be Harvey Dent, then when he becomes Two Face Bob Loblaw could replace him.  




 *Mr. F* 




 Sachiel is the third angel, isn't he?  




 I have the Inkling girl since I plan on getting Splatoon later. But aside from that the figure is just great.  




 Where my other 46 patriots at? 




 I made sure my brother got really invested in Kamina when he watched Gurren Lagann. 

I did the same thing with Mami when he started Madoka Magica.  




 Nintendo needs to distribute All-Terrain Venonat

 But a true man doesn't die, even when he's killed! 




 Kaworu Nagisa from Evangelion (especially the manga)

 Now we need Slothzilla vs Slothra.  




 Well done steaks come from a history of people with shitty taste.  




 I need to understand something: is Umaru actually a shapeshifting demon creature? Or is it just stylistic? Because teenage girl T-1000 is fine by me.  




 [Noriko Takaya](http://imgur.com/ONQq4fc) from Gunbuster. Not only is she pretty, but she digs giant robots (and hers is fucking huge, even by giant robot standards). Top it all off with being written as a human, not just a heroine for a cheesy mech show, and you've got the absolute best girl in all of anime.  




 Which means all of them could run for President. 

Would Garnet have to be her own running mate? Could Alexandrite run *and* have a VP?  




 Jasper does nothing but John all day every day.  




 Calling it now Yellowtail is a front for Yellow Diamond.  




 Even better, the Constitution still says she's eligible. 

No person except a natural born Citizen, **or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution**, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States

Amethyst for first female rock president 




 Maybe stating his true feeling on squares is what broke up Square Mom? IT WAS SOMETHING YOU DID! 




 Gem Drill

Gurren Lagann crossover confirmed? Though I would have gone with *Say "Who the Hell do you think I am?!"* 




 what the hell why haven't i heard about this 




 ...and also a demigod who laughs in the face of all known laws of physics. And Mexican. 




 I feel like Jasper would play Ganondorf or Ike, two heavy hitters with little strategy involved. 

Peridot mains Shulk, like the most technical character in the game. 

Amethyst plays Mewtwo, because he's purple and cool.  




 Are you referring to End of Evangelion? The 1997 movie? Because we can't link to pirated content.

I'm not good at this, but I need these golden gods in my Tomodachi Life and I figured I'd give it a go.  




 PSA: The only acceptable name for Silver Mario is T-1000.  




 So like the Gurren Lagann movies? 




 I checked but it's not on there, only SAC 2nd GIG.  




 The DVD I got is called Individual Eleven and seems to be an OVA/Movie. I can't seem to find any timeline information for it. 




 I just recently finished the first season, so should I watch this after the second? After Solid State Society? Never? 




 Sneople control the government at the highest levels.  




 How the hell does Greg have such an awful sunburn if he wears the wifebeater all the time? Surely his tan lines would be very different considering that's just about all he wears.  




 It's not as cerebral as some of the stuff you have listed, but Hideaki Anno's directorial debut, Gunbuster, has some existential themes. It's also badass as fuck and i reccomend it as a knee jerk reaction to just about anything. 

Ghost In the Shell (the original movie, and to a lesser extent the show) fits what you're looking for pretty nicely.  




 "A PICTURE WORT A THOUSAND WORDS! WHICH IS WHY I AM NOW EXPLAINING ITS SIGNIFICANCE TO YOU IN AS MUCH DEPTH AS I CAN MANAGE!!!!!!"

 Well according to the retcon, they did work for Stalin... 




 I think the artist forgot they were drawing Asuka and not Mari right around the center,  




 Filthy Frank 




 They were also working with Stalin, Genghis Khan, and Mao. They also probably inspired Judas.  




 rot in peace 




 Probably a Tumblr reaction to jokes.  




 I like that they did that, since it helps all the characters from different universes (and more importantly, art styles) to be in one game at the same time. It's not quite as good as Smash, but it works.  




 Madoka Magica (especially the film, Rebellion) is pretty mindfucky.

 The Z-Fighters were too powerful by the Saiyan Saga. Picollo could blow up the Moon, Nappa levelled an entire city (which might put him on Godzilla's level, considering he took a city busting meteor without so much as a scratch), Vegeta was apparently a *planet buster* (though that's apparently non-canon). And we can't forget how powerful the Destructo-Disc is. Godzilla doesn't stand a chance, much as I would like him to.  




 Fast

The Flash, hands down.  




 I've been playing as Rosalina whenever she was an option since Mario Kart Wii.  




 Is there some unspoken rule that all screenshots have to be on a near-death battery percentage? 




 I hope it doesn't look like Advent Children. The characters just don't look good when you make them that realistic. It looks like cosplay, in a bad way. Especially since they choose to play up Cloud's Elmo factor.  




 Rekt is non negotiable.

 Not quite the song you're looking for (That's either Good or Don't Be, or The Heady Feeling of Freedom) but [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW_Ez3nV0ic) is a slower a Capella version of the song.  




 This is absolutely satire. It's even making fun of one of the worse (non-satire) minion memes, in which "a big black man raping you in the ass" is replaced by "if people are talking behind your back" 




 It was the voice actress for Rei/Yui screaming, but pitched down. That's what they did for both the dub and sub, iirc.  




 From the Inception episode.  




 While it's certainly not for everyone, its influence alone is a reason to watch it. Seeing where the mech genre, and really most modern anime, get some of their inspiration from is worth 26 episodes and a movie. In addition, End of Evangelion is the 2001: A Space Odyssey of anime in many ways.   




 Still has better animation than the actual show.  




 Because as she's proven since, she totally deserved to be given power.  




 Been doing that for the past couple decades.  




 I'd also like to point out that this minion is putting on blackface.  









 That's the joke I was going for.  




 I always just slide the stick up and down the bottom-right quarter. Like doing a Hadouken backwards then a regular Hadouken. I find it works rather well.  




 It's easy to tell the difference because one has no boobs and the other is a guy.  




 The problem with putting STTGL against enemies like SP1M is that Spiral Power is the negation to any rational argument against itself. It exists to do nothing but not make sense. It would be like having SP1M fight Bugs Bunny, since Toonforce is the same as Spiral Power. The only difference is that instead of being able to do anything as long as it would be funny, Spiral Power can do anything as long as it would be badass.  




 It's silly, but it's how it works.

literally Gurren Lagann in one sentence.  









 Super Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann wins, thanks to its near infinite Spiral Power. Simon can literally do the impossible, as he's won battles he had a 0% chance of winning. Spiral Power is the most powerful form of reality warping and STTGL has it in spades.  




 It'd be effective at getting me to turn off my Adblock if it weren't for the fact that now I have it on out of spite.  




 Palutena's God-tier and you know it.

 Every time I mention Squid Girl people just assume it's tentacle porn.  




 By Evangelion standards, they totally are.  




 Evangelion and Gunbuster. If only because Noriko and Shinji would be the best couple.  




 Also when Touji punches Shinji, and Shinji doesn't want to fight back. That's foreshadowing the events surrounding Bardiel.  




 One of us is a whiny German bitch, one of us is a badass space robot pilot, one of us is a badass space robot pilot *and hot*, one of us Is an 80-meter self-regenerating giant monster full of questionably edible meat who also happens to be immortal and a mother, and one of us is an invisible robotic cop. 

Pretty sure Yui Ikari can spare some legs thanks to the S2 engine.  




 Asshole Goku would have killed Earth within a few years, meaning he never would have learned anything about the Dragon Balls, the Kamehameha, or anything else that gives Goku his immense power. He never would have been able to learn from any other Saiyans, considering they were all dead. 

Real Goku stomps 10/10 




 Sparkle sparkle sparkle! 




 Jon is always relevant, isn't he? He's like a human Guile's Theme.  




 Noriko takes Simon's core drill, and they trade robots and duke it out. Simon is post-timeskip. 

Round 1: Noriko in regular Gurren Lagann vs Simon in Noriko's machine weapon from the first epsiode. 

Round 2: Noriko in space-Gurren Lagann (the one with wings) vs Simon in Noriko's space Machine Weapon. 

Bonus round: They replace each other in their respective shows. Can Noriko defeat Lordgenome and the Antispiral? Can Simon, stripped of Spiral Power, defeat the space monsters and still have an entirely unrelated sequel? 




 Falcomaster 3000 has been unmasked! 




 Shiek and Zelda. Keep it between a man and a woman.

 I welcome the sweet embrace of Instrumentality.  









 Fuck does Nono have to do with this? Leave Diebuster alone! 




 The only thing I could think of would be to find your own 1-2 inch Squid Girl figure and just replace the Inkling girl. If you did this, you'd probably also have to paint the ink on the base Ika's shade of blue.  




 they banned the Evil Dead? Clearly they haven't let go of their fascist censorship.  




 There's no real *counter*evidence to the order being Rebuild then NGE, but there's almost no evidence in favor of that theory. NGE then Rebuild, on the other hand, has loads of evidence to suggest that it directly follows NGE in the grand timeline. Kaworu's dialogue in both his cameos in 1.11 and 2.22 as well as a couple lines in 3.33 imply that he's been through this before, while episode 24 has no such implications. Even a bunch of the Angels (notably Ramiel) are more powerful than they had been before. Combined with the red sea and potential Mass-Production Evangelion (from End of Evangelion) outline on the hill in the opening of 1.11, there's really not a lot to say that Rebuild isn't a sequel to something, assuming you buy into Time Loop theory at all, that is. 

Really, we'll probably end up getting confirmation one way or the other when 3.0+1.0 comes out.  




 In the dub I watched he was Mr Satan.
