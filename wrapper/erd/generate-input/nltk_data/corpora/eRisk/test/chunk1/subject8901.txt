 I liked having a tall locker. The smaller ones were hard to get into if the dude below you was fucking around in theirs. I once had a small locker (a bottom one), and the person who had the locker above mine left a sandwich in theirs throughout the Christmas break. The smell of rotten salami and mayonnaise made its way into my locker and stayed there for the rest of the year. The few articles of clothing I left behind over the break smelled, my gym shoes smelled (and not like my sweaty feet), and worst of all my text books smelled. I had to throw out everything except the text books, because I couldn't just replace those --they were way too expensive. I used those text books for the rest of the year, even though they stunk up every classroom they entered.  
  
TL;DR - don't rent a small locker.

 On closer inspection (now that I'm on a computer and not my phone) I can say I'm almost certain that is not a fallstreak hole. What you have there looks like a small gap in a layer of stratocumulus cloud, which is actually pretty common. It could be because of the way the cloud is forming or dissipating, or it could just be that the clouds are moving in such a way as to form a gap. Fallstreak holes usually only occur in mid to high level convective clouds, such as altocumulus and cirrocumulus. 




 Yep, that's a fallstreak hole.

 I remember spending $2000 on a laptop with 70GB of space. That, to me, was amazing. The rate at which we're able to continue cramming more and more data onto continuously shrinking devices is mind-blowing indeed.

 Well, I can't say I was expecting a response like that. I'm torn between thanking you for shedding light on the subject and deriding you for being the worst kind of sexual degenerate.

 Not only will you improve your posture and appear taller, but you'll also strengthen your back and core. 




 Wow, that's pretty tall but this is the internet, so you could be lying and I will never find out. However, you have an honest sounding name. I'll believe you this time.

 Hey, everyone, look! It's the [guy from the Internet!](http://dilbert.com/strip/2015-06-07) 




 I spent years having to listen to ignorant, racist assholes tell stupid fucking jokes like this at work. Thankfully, I'm no longer working in an environment like that. I'm glad you lost your job, because if you're saying shit like this at work then you need to learn a fucking lesson.

Edit: A lot of the replies to this comment are absolutely abhorrent. I'm not sure if they're jokes or meant to be serious. Regardless, it's very disheartening to see so much racism in this thread. I know it's the Internet, but I expected more from reddit. I genuinely hope that despite whatever hateful things your parents taught you, you break the circle of ignorance by not passing down your racist attitudes to your children. They deserve better. The world deserves better. 




 I downvote every comment I see that is edited like yours, and I hope others do the same.

 Just because you did those things doesn't make you a bad person.

Keep fighting and maintain that courage and you'll have no reason to feel guilty. 




 If that's the worst that's ever happened to you, consider yourself lucky.

[Here's another interesting info graphic showing how much water is consumed during the lifecycle of a typical beef cow.] (http://static1.squarespace.com/static/53ddf6b0e4b0219ea2c8b53f/t/5486139ae4b08d78fd1dd863/1418072986569/) And this is the [source for that picture](http://www.swissbiofarmer.com/blog/). 




 Cows are the most land and water intensive livestock to raise. That's why people in many countries eat less beef and tend to eat more pork, goat, and other smaller farm animals that can be kept in smaller spaces. Also, people in other countries tend to eat a lot less of everything than the average North American.

 Amen, dude. Seriously, though, who the fuck "needs" almonds? 




 The country doesn't "need" the produce grown in California. There wouldn't be a problem if farmers there were able to switch to crops that required less water, and people learned to eat produce grown in a more ecologically sustainable manner rather than cramming whatever they like down their gullet.

 Someone recently told me about how an alkaline diet can help prevent cancer. I'm far from being a dietician or a scientist, so my understanding of the subject isn't that great; however, I did a cursory Google search and it provided a lot of information to quickly debunk the whole alkaline diet as a means of cancer prevention. Anyway, I guess what I'm looking for is an explanation as to how the body becomes too acidic or alkaline through diet in the first place, and how it corrects the problem. Also, what are the implications, if any, of having an overly acidic or alkaline body. Are there any cases of people having a disorder where the body is unable to correct an imbalance?  
  
Thanks in advance, guys and gals! 




 In case you didn't know, a major part of the gay agenda is to hijack science and... do something with it. I dunno what that is. Probably make it fabulous or something.

 Came to this sub by accident because I hit the "random" button, saw this post, and was really saddened by your situation. I don't usually give advice, but here goes.
  
Be yourself, OP. Don't try to be someone else by mimicking what you think is "normal" behaviour. Do your best to fit in if that's what you feel will make you happy, but don't feel like you have to put on an act for others for them to like you; you'll never be happy as long as you're acting your way through life. I don't have Asperger's Syndrome, but I know others that do have it, and I never once expected them to "act normal." It's a disability that people should understand and respect. Your family should be giving you the support you need, not acting like there's something wrong with you.  
  
Have you met with a counsellor? If your family have been as unsupportive as your post suggests, perhaps you should find one have have your immediate family members meet with them too.

 Road trip! 




 Shit crop, bro. 




 Fat people are disgusting and I hate them. There, I said it. 









 So, there haven't been "ongoing issues with harassment" on /r/coontown. How does a hateful subreddit like that get to exist? Why doesn't reddit's anti-harrassment policy extend to hate speech? That is something that isn't explained in any of those links. 




 Reddit sucks now and everyone has left. Fuck this place. 









 Keep that neckbeard chilled. 




 Fucking horseshit you're not rich, asshole. 




 Only 3 million redditors fall under the 18-29, English speaking American demographic. I can assure you, that is probably the only group of people posting shit like that. 




 I think you're giving redditors way too much credit. And yes, I am "understanding how many people there actually are."  
  
You sound like someone whose comment might end up being posted on this subreddit. 




 It's scary to think that when I was a kid I trusted adults to know what was best for me. Now that I'm older, I don't trust them to know anything. 




 I did it, reddit! 




 Where are these neckbeards getting their IQ scores from? Seriously, though, there's no way so many people on reddit are scoring 150 and higher. Something like 0.1% of the population has an IQ higher than 145, so I'm disinclined to believe anyone that tells me they have a "higher than average IQ." It's usually the least intelligent or most narcissistic who believe they're smarter than everyone else.
