Topic: Wellspring

Transcript of Recording

Subject #2907: Id like to start with where I think it began. You know, the cassette?

Martin Howard: Sure, why not. Just let me update your status first.

Subject #2907: You werent recording that?

Martin Howard: I just didnt want you to feel pressured, like you had to put on a facade. [clears throat] Patient [NAME REDACTED]

Subject #2907: Please, doc. If you could include my status after I have already left, Id appreciate it.

MH: Well, its like I said earlier - although we can acknowledge that the paranoia exists, we shouldnt give in to it.

2907: I know, I know, but could you just humor me this once?

MH: Alright. So, then, start with the cassette.

2907: Well, as you know, [NAME REDACTED] and I read about geocaching and decided to try it out. Theres so much potential in that area. Its all so wide open, uncharted, beautiful...in places like that, theres bound to be hidden shit. 

MH: Right, of course. Go on.

2907: So, we spent the week doing just that. We didnt find much, just trinkets, really. Kinda seemed like people kept getting caught up in the adventure and forgot to bring stuff to replace it with. So they just tossed out whatever their pockets happened to be carrying. [laughter] We found a penny from the seventies, an empty lighter, things like that. We wouldve been bored with it, if people hadnt made it so damn hard to find.

MH: Thats the point, isnt it? From what youve told me.

2907: Yeah, it is. So we didnt mind. But then we finally came across our first big find. Something that wasnt junk. It was a VHS tape in this tin can that looked old as fuck. I was kind of bummed at first, because there was enough damage on the actual film that I didnt think it would be playable. But I decided to try it out anyway, and after dropping [NAME REDACTED] at home so she could go to work, I popped it into my old DVD/VHS combo.

MH: So, [NAME REDACTED] wasnt around when you saw this? I thought you said she was.

2907: No, no, I just said I felt like I wasnt alone when I watched it. Like there was someone there with me.

MH: Someone like God?

2907: Definitely not. More like I felt like someone was watching me. Shit, I hope God wouldnt make me feel like that.

MH: Why did the tape make you feel this way? What was on it?

[long pause]

2907: You sure I have to repeat this? I thought we talked about it before, when it was recording -

MH: [talking over Subject] We did, but I actually didnt have it recording then, and I figured it would be better to get it now, now that your memories of the incident are a little more clear.

2907: Alright. It, uh, didnt really have anything at first. Just some static-y darkness, like when you first start a VHS, but before the actual film? And then, with those VHS blocked letters, it said 5:55 AM. Then, right under it, it said, SNOW in capital letters. And then the text went away and it showed this snow covered place. It was still lightly sprinkling snow, and you could tell it was late at night. The clouds were doing that thing when it snows, where it just forms one big mass? And no moonlight can get through? So the streetlights and whatnot reflect off it. I liked it before then.

MH: Where exactly was this video taking place?

2907: Near this one intersection. But, remember, there was a shitload of snow and no tire tracks or footprints or anything anywhere. It was a pretty even layer, and I remember that area usually being pretty heavy with traffic, regardless of the time of day -

MH: So youve been to this area before?

2907: Well, yeah. Kind of hard not to, being that its right next to [REDACTED]. I didnt recognize it right away because of the all the snow, but as soon as I did, the camera sort of panned downward and then behind. This person was walking barefoot through ankle-deep snow, maybe higher, and the only sign of, you know, life, were her set of footprints that seemed to go on for miles. Then it came back to the persons point of view, facing their surroundings again, and I noticed [REDACTED] had all of their lights off and appeared closed, which I thought was really weird.

MH: Arent they usually open twenty-four hours?

2907: Yeah, thats what made it so weird.

MH: Maybe they were constructing it at the time.

2907: But they had all of their advertisements up, and it looked the same as it does now, just dark and sort of abandoned. 

MH: Okay, that is strange. Continue.

2907: So this person walks a little longer, almost to the intersection, and they just stop. It was sorta peaceful, like you could hear the snow softly falling, and this persons even breathing. I listened closely to see if I could hear any traffic, just any background noise, and I turned my TV volume all the way up, but I couldnt hear any signs of it. Thats when they turned the camera on themselves.

MH: And who was this person?

2907: You already know. Dont get why youre -

MH: Im just trying to get every detail down.

2907: ...It was me. And I dont mean like Hey, she could pass off as me! or Wow, we have similar features! No, it was me, like I was looking in the mirror. And I was smiling super wide, like I was excited or trying to take a ridiculous picture of myself. They - she - I, I guess? They got the camera pretty close to their face, or my face, and I could see that my gums were bleeding. And all you could see was my mouth when they said, They know about you now. 

MH: They know about you now?

2907: Yeah, thats all she said.

MH: Do you know what they mightve meant?

2907: Nope, havent got a clue. But after she said it she pulled the camera back to show my whole face, and grinned even wider before turning the camera off. 

MH: Was that the end of the tape?

2907: I think so. Kind of. It tried to show some other sort of text, but that mustve been where the tape was most corroded because I couldnt make it out. And then there was a blurry shot of a street name, or a building name, maybe [REDACTED].

MH: I see. Well, what did you think of it?

2907: Are you serious? What the fuck was I supposed to think? It freaked me the fuck out. I called [REDACTED] but then remembered she was at work, so I hung up and texted her. 

MH: Before we move on to what happened next, I just want to clarify a few things. Do you have any memories of recording this tape?

2907: Of course not. Why else would it have freaked me out? Pretty sure I wouldnt be here if I did remember it.

MH: I know it seems pointless, [REDACTED], but I just want to get everything on the record.

2907: Who the fuck cares if its on the record? It doesnt matter anyway, seeing as it everyone keeps saying it didnt happen. If it didnt, why do you keep questioning me?

MH: Im sorry, [REDACTED], you have a valid point. Why dont we give it a break for today? Okay?

2907: Yeah, okay.

MH: I want you to really try to get your memories in order, though, so we can accurately document this. This will be important to your case. Just remember that.

2907: Ill try. But I honestly just want a break from thinking about it.

MH: Then let it come naturally. Just keep in mind that the sooner we are able to identify your problem, the sooner you can be out of here. Lets work on that. Okay?

2907: Okay. 

MH: Have a good day, [REDACTED]. Go ahead and ask for some water on your way back.

2907: Alright. Later.

Re: 	Evidence Needed

 nbsp;

Hey, Will. Sorry for taking forever to get back to you, I was searching the evidence room for the journal. Again. Its been gone for weeks though, and I doubt well find it in this  building. The tapes still dont show anyone leaving the room with any object that hasnt already been accounted for. 

I still have the online copy Mary made, though, so itll have to suffice. Not sure why you need it right now, but Im sure youll tell me later. Are we still down for Saturday? You havent replied yet and Amys getting on my ass. 

Anyway, have a good night. Call me later.

*September 21st, 2013*

If you find this, please dont try to figure out where I am. Take this and run. Destroy it if you make it home alive. Make sure no one ever knows of our legacy.

I know now that there is no god, but for gods sake, burn any trace you can.

All you need to know is that this is our birthright. This is humanitys womb and bones.

 nbsp;

*September 14th, 2013*

We have to find a way out. There has to be an end. We could always see either side, but we never got any closer. Not until last night.

We stuck with one direction, and for the first time, I think were actually making progress. I think were getting closer to the other side.

Well spent one more night in this forsaken tunnel, but after that, well be free. I know we will.

 nbsp;

*September 12th, 2013*

We cant get out. It doesnt make sense. We spent three days walking back and forth in the tunnel. It doesnt matter which side we go to - the exit only becomes farther and farther. Three days spent walking until the blood in our shoes made it nearly impossible, screaming until our ears rang for hours, sobbing until there was nothing left. Three days worth of stomping on that picture, over and over again, trying to deny its existence. It was only a short time ago that she finally ripped it apart. Now, we dont have to think about it anymore. Now, there is only the future.

The horrible, agonizing, unending future.

 nbsp;

*September 10th, 2013*

There was a picture in the middle of the tunnel

It was [scratched out, unintelligible]

Who couldve taken that picture?? WHO

I can feel its eyes

 nbsp;

*September 9th, 2013*

For the first time in days, maybe weeks, I feel hope. We found the tunnel! We have to be getting closer now. I still dont see the road, and the area around the tunnel is just more trees, more forest, but thats okay. She said we might be able to find the road on the other side of the tunnel. I know there was a parking lot nearby that side. It cant be much farther now.

Now that Ive got a grasp of hope, Im not letting it go. 

 nbsp;

*September 8th, 2013*

I cant let that happen again. No. I was so scared and mad, and for what? Not like it did us any good. We probably became even more lost thanks to our hysterics. But I think Ive got control of myself now. The actual time part of my watch is broken - its stuck on 8:27 AM - but the date continues to work, so I know how many days have passed. Its easy to lose count of the sunrises and sunsets. 

We have nothing. They kept everything when they let us go. Our camp gear, our individual possessions, everything has been taken. I hid this book in a safe spot, out in the woods, and it was still there when we were released.

Weve been hiding. I know they told us we could only leave if they couldnt find us, but I dont know if they really meant it. We cant hike forever. 

I write whenever we take breaks. I write instead of sleeping a lot of the time. I found that two hours is just enough rest to keep me sane.

She doesnt say much of anything anymore. Only what she needs to say. I only see her cry when she stares into the fire. I dont know if she knows I can see.

We have to make it out.

 nbsp;

[Undated Entry]

They said theyd let us go. They said! Theyd let! Us GO! And here we are, circling and circling these damn woods. These damn goddamn fucking WOODS! CIRCLING AND CIRCLING AND CIRCLING AND

I hateyou! You said youd let us go! Why the fuck did you L I E? How could you? I know youre hiding us, and I know youre hiding!

 nbsp;

*September 4th, 2013*

Were getting deeper. We found a craggily rock that looked over the tiny creek and sat there for a while. It was starting to get dark, but it felt like the sun was doing us a favor, stretching out its light for as long as it could. It was 7:05 PM but still just a bit past sunset. We really shouldve been setting up camp while it was still light, but we procrastinated, just talking. I dont know why; there isnt much we dont already know about each other. We werent saying anything important, just blabbering about various nature facts and some funny things that happened to us weeks ago. I keep getting the impression that shes trying to put off saying something.

I wonder if shes afraid well die. I mean, obviously she was, but I wonder if that feeling is still there. I want to curl into her fear and make myself at home. Her fear would comfort me, because it meant that she still loves me. Loves herself.

 nbsp;

*September 3rd, 2013: Part 2*

Were here now. Weve been making various signs and symbols for ourselves so we can find our way back more easily. Its mostly just killing time until we actually go into the forest. 

Im going to try to write as we go. Our phones still just barely work, so I need this to keep me from going insane. Im not going to go crazy.

I know this is a terrible idea, but I dont know what else we couldve done. We just want the nightmares to end.

Heading out.

 nbsp;

*September 3rd, 2013*

Were going. Theres no doubt about it.

She woke up screaming my name. I tried to comfort her, which turned into her comforting me. We sat in bed, clutching each other, crying and trying to not look around the room. Every light that still worked in the apartment was turned on, but we never left the bed. After a while we thought we heard the sound of a metal screen door opening and closing. We dont have one.

The morning after she said we didnt have a choice. We need to go. We need to figure out why this thing wont let us go. We need to see what it wants us to see. I was too tired to argue, and didnt speak up until after she threatened to go without me.

I dont want her to leave me here.

Were planning on spending at least one night out there. Its already half passed three and I know we wont have enough daylight. Still, shes packing like were going to be gone for weeks. I keep asking her Why pack this? Why pack that? hoping shell admit to something, but she always replies, Just in case. 

Ive been hiding in the bathroom to cry, but were still sticking to our rules and never let either of us be alone for more than two minutes and forty-two seconds. I dont want her to know how afraid I truly am.

I started a different journal, just in case. I burned the old one, just in case. Now Ill never have to see it looking at me through my dotted Is again. 

Weve got the last of our gear. Time to go.

Hi, Addy. Its Caleb. Ive got more information about that thing you were asking about. Hey, did you know that if you want to out-drive a tornado, you just have to drive 70 miles per hour? I know, its so interesting. I am a [well](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3dnc2l/wellspring/) of useless knowledge. Oh, before I go, I was wondering what youre doing Friday. The roommates and I want to break in the new place with a party. I dont know if youll be in town around then, so just- [BEEEP].

 nbsp;

[Voicemail 2]

Hey man, just thought Id check up on you. Its Caleb. You never responded to my last message - I dont know if your phones being a dick or youve just been too busy, but yeah. A bunch of people at the party said they hadnt heard from you for a long time. Amanda said she stopped by your place but you didnt answer the door and your car was gone. Is everything okay? Get back to me whenever.

 nbsp;

[Voicemail 3]

Addy, where are you? Its been a few months. Jason and the rest of the crew said they were worried. Although, they could just be trying to get me off your trail. Seriously, though, if youre really trying to avoid me for whatever reason, Ill stop calling after this. I just want to make sure everythings okay. Ill be in Laughlin for the next week, so I wont be around my phone a whole lot. Just let me know. Im sor- [BEEEP]

 nbsp;

[Voicemail 4]

I came into town today and saw your missing poster. They chose a nice picture, but it wasnt one you liked. Something you were tagged in a while back. [] I dont know why Im still leaving messages. It sort of makes me feel like theres still a chance youre alive. I miss you. Come back.

 nbsp;

[Voicemail 5]

Addy! Ahhhh god, Ive had so much. My roommate, Trevor? Amazing bartender. You wouldnt - you would not believe. Anyway, just calling to say I love you. There! I said it! Ive always loved you. Besides, you might be dead, so theres no chance youll hate me for saying it! Ha ha! I hope you didnt run off with some dickweed. Byyyeee!

 nbsp;

ADDY! ADDYYYY! FUCKING ADDY! WHERE ARE YOU? AAAAADDDDYYYYY! [indiscriminate rustling] What the...oh god. OH GOD. FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK OH GOOOOD PLEASE NO, PLEASE, NO - [BEEEP]

Subject #2907

Class: Fertile

Topic: Inveigle

Transcript of Recording

 nbsp;

Martin Howard: Anyway, I think we should pick up where we left off. Maybe sometime after you found the tape. Do you remember what happened next?

Subject #2907: Im not divulging anymore information until I can make a phone call.

Martin Howard: Say again?

Subject #2907: Im not telling you shit until I can call someone.

MH: Well, you see, you calling someone would defeat your purpose here.

2907: What, I cant get better unless Im completely cut off from my loved ones?

MH: Its a complicated process.

2907: Look, no one knows how my body responds better than I fucking do. And if that date is correct [sound of chair scraping back], if that fucking calendar isnt a joke like everything else is in this goddamn place, then my family hasnt heard from me in over two months. And Id like to NOT be a shitty daughter for once and let my fucking family know that Im not dead!

MH: [NAME REMOVED], please calm down.

2907: Ill fucking calm down when I get a fucking phone call!

[metal slamming into metal]

[recording paused]

[recording continued]

MH: Do you understand? [NAME REMOVED], do you understand? I need you to respond.

2907: [muffled] Yes.

MH: Good, Im glad we were able to make that clear for you. Now, lets begin again.

2907: Where?

MH: Whatever significant event happened after finding the VHS tape.

2907: I...went back to the forest.

MH: Which part?

2907: Where I found it. By the [[REMOVED]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3dr8qk/languish/)

MH: Did you find anything else?

2907: No. But then I entered the coordinates into my GPS -

MH: What coordinates?

2907: The ones I found under the false bottom of the tin.

MH: You didnt mention that earlier.

2907: You said significant part next.

MH: Yes, I did. [NAME REMOVED], I hope youre not lying to me, or hiding anything from me. 

2907: What? Im not.

MH: Because if you were -

2907: I get it, alright? Im just trying to be as accurate as possible. Obviously my brain is a little fucked after everything that happened, so I may forget tiny details here and there.  Is that okay with you?

MH: Perhaps youre being too hostile today. Should we put you back in your room and leave you alone for another day?

2907: No.

MH: Thats what I thought. What did you find at the other coordinates?

[door opening]

MH: Yes, what do you want?

[UNIDENTIFIED VOICE]: Subject 2907 is to return to her room at this time.

MH: Well, tell them were not finished yet.

[UNIDENTIFIED VOICE]: Sir, by orders of Lieutenant Kernel Harrison, Subject 2907 may only have forty-five minutes of social interference a day. I have been instructed to -

MH: Alright, alright, fine. Take her. Ill be speaking to Harrison shortly. Well see you next week, [NAME REMOVED].

[UNIDENTIFIED VOICE]: Is she not responding?

MH: Shit. Get the nurses, tell them to bring [REMOVED]. Now! 

[recording paused]

[recording continued]

MH: Weekly log for Subject 2907. Subject was uncooperative for most of her session today, but was able to continue after expressing concerns of what she could do to her loved ones. Before we were able to get anywhere, though, her session ended. She was about to be escorted back to her room when she became catatonic, a side effect of the treatments. I do not think she will last long in this facility with how quickly her mental state is deteriorating. We must get her back into the field as soon as possible if we are to reap the fruits of our work anytime soon.

 ANCHORAGE CITY POLICE DISPATCH

October 2nd, 2013

 nbsp;

Dear Will,

Sorry to be so formal about this. Unfortunately, Im at work and these official papers are all I have at the moment, but I thought Id write to you now, while Ive still got it in my head. My [memorys](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3dnc2l/wellspring/) been kind of weird lately. Sometimes I have trouble recognizing my driveway. But Im not writing to bitch about my troubles. Not this time, anyway. I know you mentioned a piece of [evidence](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3dr8qk/languish/) to a weird case going missing. We found something similar on our end. I dont think its the exact same as yours, but it seems similar and sort of follows the same pattern. I thought Id send it to you, just in case. It looks like most of the pages have been ripped out.

Its almost exciting. Nothing happens here. Im sure youll get a call from me before you receive this, so we can talk about our normal man shit, haha. Did I used to wear blue a lot? Whens dinner? Do you think we all go somewhere after we die? I dont think so. I think we just sink into the dark, deep ground, and sink and sink and sink and sink

Shit, you caught me babbling and my boss just got here. Ill hurry up and send this before he jumps down my throat. Also, for whatever reason, the first page of the book has Wasps nest written on it, but in a different handwriting than the rest. Im sure youll get a kick out of that.

Sincerely, 

Adam

Im finally moved in! Addy seems to be a decent roommate so far. Shes pretty clean and gives me space when I need it. Cant say much more than that.

Its still taking a while to get used to. I miss the wide open fields. The smell of the desert on my hands. [Coyotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3dwcp3/satiation/) in the night. Every star gleaming and glittering right in my backyard. The quiet, the peace, the solitude. Here, in this apartment, there is always noise. The washer and dryer might as well be stereos. Our neighbors run their own loud schedule, disregarding social etiquette. Sirens and horns and shouts are constant. It makes you appreciate those tiny moments - the white noise of the shower running, long car drives, cozy blankets. And I feel so silly for being bothered by living in the city because its still pretty far from what I imagine city life to be. For instance, I had to take a different route home because a cow got in the road and was blocking traffic.

Its still weird to call this place home. I think once I have my own space, itll feel more natural. Right now I share a bed with Addy because its better than the couch and she doesnt mind. Its the first time, outside of sleepovers, that Ive regularly shared a bed with someone. I dont necessarily mind it.

 nbsp;

*March 3rd, 2013*

My life is just about as busy as I expected it to be. But there are a lot of things I didnt expect.

Sometimes I wake in the middle of the night and see Addy sleeping so close to me, her face pressed up close, her breathing steady. Shes certainly the least cynical person I know, but she must carry a certain burden during her waking hours, because I have never seen her face so relaxed and sweet. 

Im learning to play the cello again. I feel like when I sit on my balcony, amidst all the noise, and begin to play, everything just sort of...turns off. I like that.

Weve been going hiking lately and always find cool little trinkets. I like to keep them on our windowsill.

 nbsp;

*April 15th, 2013*

I wonder if I can officially call Addy my girlfriend yet. I dont think you can until the other person agrees to. It makes me wonder quite a bit what she considers us. 

I would ask her, but the way Addy is, I feel like she would just tell me. I could feel us growing closer as the weeks passed, both physically and mentally. We started preferring each others company to our own friends. I was making good money but buying my own bed never crossed my mind. And one night, we just started kissing. We still do, occasionally.

I dont know why Im afraid to ask. I shouldnt be, right?

 nbsp;

*April 26th, 2013*

We found something in the woods somewhere

Never mind. I cant write it out. Im too scared. We cant bring it home.

 nbsp;

*May 23rd, 2013*

12:55 AM Saw it crawling from the shadow in the corner. Lots of teeth. Shaking. I think it said my name, but Ive never heard it spoken like that before. 

12:58 AM. I dont remember writing that. I dont remember that event. Heading back to the bathroom.

1:02 AM I dont know where I am, I can feel tile but everything looks like my old home, and I cant get up but I hear my mom and dad and I see it crawling, going towards them, and then it sees me and smiles

1:05 AM. Felt nauseous after that last one. Still dont know what I was talking about but I get a headache every time I try to remember.

1:07 AM its behind me, it breathes downs my neck and I want to turn around but I feel like if I keep writing, I might make it out alive, I just have to pretend

1:45 AM. Addy said I was passed out. She said I wouldnt respond but my eyes were wide open and I looked so afraid. After she held me for a while I fell asleep. I just woke up a few minutes ago. 

Its official, we cannot be alone for more than a few minutes. Well have to do a few more experiments to find the exact time. Addy wants me to stop, but I want to figure this out.

 nbsp;

*June 5th, 2013* 

We have to leave, I dont

 nbsp;

*July 3rd, 2013*

We are on the run. I dont want to say where because I feel like it can still connect to us [somewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3e0tmg/inveigle/). Were trying to find out how this is happening. We want to know if it can be fixed.

Ive never seen Addy so serious. I feel like shes been through this before, but as usual, Im too afraid to ask. 

 nbsp;

*August 7th, 2013*

DONT LOOK AT ME PLEASE PLEASE JUST DONT PLEASE

 nbsp;

*September 1st, 2013*

Im sorry, Addy. 

If you somehow find my next journal, youll know where to find this. I hope it didnt burn too badly. I took out the more embarrassing, horrible entries a long time ago, but I realized afterwards there wasnt much left. Maybe youll find those, too. I havent decided if Ill destroy them yet.

You were everything to me. And maybe I was to you, but I dont care about that. I just want to make sure youll be okay, with or without me.

I have a distinct feeling that we wont make it out of this alive or in one piece. I know youve been trying to convince me to go back to the forest with you, but Ive been procrastinating because I want to make sure things are set. 

Can you do something for me, please? Just for a moment? I want you to think of every good memory you have of me before you read on. I think itll be the last time you truly love me. Just trust me.

I wasnt totally honest with you when I said I wasnt a religious person. I think I always have been, until pretty recently. And I think that little thing that humans have, that thing youre always talking about that ties in with faith, is what got us here.

Theres more to that, and I might add more if I have time. I think youll wake from a nightmare any moment now. But know that when we leave, everything will have been set. Im going to try to make sure that one of us gets out of this alive, even if that isnt me. I made a pretty good bargain, and I think theyll be satisfied. 

I just dont know what theyll do to you, but at least youll be alive, and if I know you well, I think youll regain your own independence eventually. By then, youll probably have found this. Youre smart like that.

I dont know much about them, but I know theyre better than whatever watches us in the dark. I know youll find a way out.

Please remember me through your amber glasses. I think I liked myself best when you loved me.
