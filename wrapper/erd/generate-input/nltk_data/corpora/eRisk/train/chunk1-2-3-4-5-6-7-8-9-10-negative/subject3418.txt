 That really does look like some end of the world shit...black skies and pillars of smoke everywhere. 









 Congrats! It's such a good feeling to go from a closet overflowing with stuff you never wear to a nice streamlined set of clothes. 




 Congrats and welcome! 




 Did you try taking out all the batteries including the backup battery? 




 Congrats! 




 For some reason I always thought a dermal pouch would be awesome. Like I could just carry my keys and phone where my appendix used to be. 




 Hey that was the dictionary.com word of the day a few weeks ago! 




 I think you can but you have to train them to get used to it. Due to their herding instinct they will try to nip and herd you when you run. This makes them a bit of a tripping hazard :) 




 Wow no idea this was a thing. Thanks...? 




 Well if they couldn't find it here in America, I'm glad they found it in Australia.  Couldn't have happened to a nicer bunch of gents. 




 That's a pretty bad ass backdrop to walk away from... 




 Threads of Fate? 




 Trebled? 




 God this is so true...everyday I have the same plan when I get home: workout, clean/do dishes, and get to bed early at 9.

And every night it's usually the same: eat something unhealthy, dick around on reddit for a few hours and then fall asleep at midnight... 




 It almost sounds like "Oh Yeah" by Yello, from the Ferris Bueller movie: 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG_6CopW9GQ  




 Opera huh? It's not Flower Duet by Delibes is it?

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qx2lMaMsl8 

Yanni also made a song based on the melody called "Aria"

 




 If you really want a challenge, I read about a no-junction challenge on gamefaqs that seems pretty damn crazy...

...but if you want to use all the game mechanics, maybe just limit which magics you use to junction. Like maybe only junction the basic level (fire, thunder) and avoid all the third-level (thundaga, etc.). Also stay away from triple and ultima and other crazy-powerful spells. 




 For some reason I always liked "Throw Stone" from Final Fantasy Tactics. It just felt like something I would do if I ended up in a battle somehow; just pick up a rock and chuck at someone. 

Though I also liked Cloud's cross-slash limit in VII...damage + stop was a nice combo. 




 Even though I'm a dude, I always connected with Tifa. I think I've usually got good intentions and feel responsible for those around me no matter what I do. And I liked that she was always trying to cheer everyone up when things got tough. 
 




 Gya haa haa! 




 I liked 8 and my little bro like 9, so there you go. Probably up to personal tastes.

I'd say 8 has a higher learning curve on figuring out how the junction system works, but I thought the story was better. 9 is more old-school in gameplay and probably easier to pick up from the get-go. 




 I played XIII and just got the sequel. I liked Lightning as a character and that's about it. I think XII got a little too "out there" for me in terms of story and gameplay. I'm all for fantastical elements, but I summon Sazh's eidolon and it's a flying race car...what the fuck?

I think the battle system had potential but the story and gameplay just weren't there for me. 




 When I played Kirby I never knew you could push down and swallow the enemies to gain their power. I just thought the only purpose of swallowing them was to spit them back out, which I thought was weird because you could do that with air puffs anyway.. 




 I was think the same thing. What person would intentionally write "I'm a big fucking pussy" in his own paper? 




 Music was great too 




 A sturdy backpack that fits into carry-on. Pack clothing that can be layered like t-shirts,  a fleece,  and a wind breaker. 




 Libertarian  




 That's pretty sweet, thanks for posting. I also thought it was like a little black box with the green-on-black vector graphics on a small screen. 

I also thought that the Braun robot looked like a little coffeepot... 




 For some reason I always thought it would be cool to be Mayor Domino from FF7. Since Shinra runs everything, he just gets to hang out in his library all day and do whatever he wants, but he still gets to be the Mayor. 




 Same here! That made sense to me since my dog just gets to sleep all day and I give him food and treats for free, while 90% of the world has to go work at a shit job just to scrape by. 




 They're doing some interesting work here in Minnesota: 

http://www.d.umn.edu/llo/ 

http://lrc.geo.umn.edu/laccore/

Maybe they can set up a partnership between MN/Ontario like they did to bring the lake sturgeon back? 




 Upvote for the Gopher pants 




 Do you think the US will hit the fiscal cliff, and if so, what impact will that have on the global economy?  




 We lived together for a while before we were married so actually the first year of marriage wasn't all that different. But I actually think it's gotten better over time (married 3 years now, been together for 7). It takes a while to get to really know each others quirks and habits, but I feel like we're closer now than ever.  




 Our honeymoon and vacations to cool places were great, but honestly the best experience is just little things everyday we do together. Like yesterday we made french toast and sat at the table and read the paper together, laughing at stupid things we found in all the ads.  




 By the time you're 22 you don't talk to or care about any of the people you went to high school with, so stop trying so hard to impress everyone.  




 Stop worrying about what everyone thinks about you and trying to be "cool" for your friends or anyone else for that matter.  




 This sums it up. No matter how good you think it would feel to just ditch them, you would only be screwing yourself in the future. Never burn bridges and try to make good relationships. You would be surprised how often you end up relying on them in the future.  




 Totally agree. I'm a big supporter of open source everything, but in my work-life, I rely on Word, Excel, PPT, and others for 90% of the stuff I do. And MS has always be good to us whenever we have questions or problems.  




 Man, I'm only 28 but I feel like an old man seeing calculator games like that. Back in my day we just had breakout and snake on our TI-83's and we were happy with it. 




 It would be hard to narrow it down to just one...but I have a soft spot for the original Age of Empires soundtrack. 

Shadow of Colossus is another great one.  




 3 was my favorite by far. The bosses, the music, the ability to slide... 




 I've always loved the idea of an inner courtyard. 




 I think it was every time I would travel or move, I would realize that I was hauling a ton of stuff that I never used. Like I had boxes of books that I hadn't read in years, but every time I would move, I'd have to box them up and lug them to wherever I was going.

Finally I just decided to look at what I used every single day, and pare down my belongings to just those.  




 Working out- I have one set of adjustable dumbbells and a bench that folds, so it all stores under my bed. 

TV/Movies/Video games- All on my Xbox, which is hooked up to my tv. I used to have a lot of systems and wires everywhere, but sold/donated most to just have the Xbox set up. Also started playing on my phone rather than having to carry a separate handheld like a PSP.

Reading/learning- Library card for books, and I also go to Project Gutenberg to get free ebooks for my phone.  




 It might be slow to take off now, but I bet we will see a lot more place like this in the future as the climate gets more unpredictable. They have indoor beaches like this in Japan and indoor ski slopes in Dubai. 




 Thank you for posting, those shots are great. 




 That's really great, nice work. 




 The longer I live, the more I realize that this is 100% true. 




 That....looks awesome 




 Fuck it, have an American upvote. 




 For the Swarm! 




 I volunteered at a hospital and if we needed security we would page "Dr. Strongman" on the overhead.  




 Thank you for your service, idagernyr.

I'm heading to Kandahar city next month for some civilian work. The problem is my company is cheap and so I'm only budgeted to stay in local hotels, use local transportation, fly through the civil airport etc. What do you think of the ground situation in Kandahar city? 




 I have to go to Afghanistan next month for some civilian work. I'm actually excited about most of the trip, but I have to spend a good chunk of time working in Kandahar city, and am a bit worried about that. My company is only budgeting for "local" provisions, so I'm staying in local hotels, local taxis, no escorts, no military access, etc.   




 I totally agree with you on the Sears catalog! My wife didn't even know what I was talking about when I told her.  




 As an American I support it (so long as it is democratically agreed upon by both sides of course.) I think America is really more than just a country, it is an idea. It was formed by people from a variety of countries, religions, and languages who came together for the freedom to live the way they wanted. If both parties want this, then I say the more the merrier :) 




 Thank you for making an awesome movie. 




 Wow, she cannot look bad even if she tries.  




 I went to a Catholic school and Sister Lust was one of the nuns... 




 Secretary of Energy Steven Chu won the Nobel for his work in laser cooling.  




 Secretary of Energy Steven Chu won the Nobel for his work in laser cooling.  




 Agreed! Why did they stop? 




 Probably a napkin. I always get appetizers on napkins at parties and can't find anywhere to throw them away so I just wad them up. 




 Man that takes me back...i think we had all of them
.
 




 How does it feel to sleep on a bed made of money? I always wondered... 




 Ha, love it. 
























 My thoughts exactly! If they were going to do something about it, they should have acted before it was posted. Now they just look indecisive and incompetent. 




 Wow you look great! Congrats on all your hard work! 




 I think we will still have some way to keep track of resources even in a post-scarcity world.  




 Hey SJU! Class of '07 here. 




 Wow, nice job! 




 That's actually pretty funny. 




 That looks awesome! 




 How does the "character booster" work?  




 From the thumbnail I thought it was a spider and I thought " Why the hell would anyone feed a spider every day??" 




 That sounds like a pretty awesome night. 




 That's awesome! I wholeheartedly support this endeavor. 




 I would totally go for this! A combination of the finest people on Earth! 




 Haha so true! I got the guides to VII and VIII and loved reading through them then picked up IX and was amazed at how shitty it was. 




 Great idea! 




 Congrats and welcome!! 




 It's really great to see such involved parenting these days. Kudos to you! 




 Thank you!  




 Ha, that was my first thought too! Fucking klobb... 




 Man I had no idea there even was a complete edition. Definitely going to have to check that out. 




 Both my dad and grampa had their knees replaced so it's probably just a matter of time for me. Hopefully when I need them, technology will have made them even better. 




 I know there are lots of harder things out there, but I did a no-junction game in FFVIII which was pretty dang hard. 




 Fujin, Raijin, Reno, and Rude 




 It's true. The last 3 games I played on mine were FF6, Xenogears, and Vagrant Story. I don't even remember the last time I put a UMD in. 




 India should be getting 126 soon 




 Congrats! 




 Check out this plot analysis from GameFaqs:

http://m.gamefaqs.com/ps/197341-final-fantasy-vii/faqs/16725

I think the timeline  explains it pretty well and seemed accurate to me. 




 Ha I know the feeling. I used to volunteer helping the elderly who lived alone and one of my jobs was to check their fridge to make sure they were buying enough to eat. Every time theirs had 10x as much food as mine :/ 




 They seem to act more like the Galactic Empire... 




 Pretty much Sonic the Hedgehog 




 Well when you're there, you're family so he was just helping out the fam.  




 Yes! Came here just to see that. 




 Congrats! 




 DC now but Minneapolis previously 




 Congrats and keep it up! 




 To a hawk, bird bath = buffet 




 Thanks so much for posting this; this is really great! 




 That really does sum it up. We need more people to work as Independents outside of the two party system if we want anything to get done. 




 As an American I have to say that those British uniforms are pretty damn sharp looking. 




 VII is still the best game I've ever played. I seriously can still pick up that game and have a great time. 

After that it goes:

VI
X
VIII
Tactics
V
XII
XIII
 




 I didn't have a PS so I played FFVII on the pc as soon as it came out. I still have the saves on a zip disk, although I'm pretty sure I don't have a zip drive anymore...
  




 I think that is the message they want to send just in case shit hits the fan. If the US says that NK is weak and not a threat and then has to invade or retaliate against an attack it makes us look like bullies attacking "weak" NK.

On the other hand, if we say they are a legitimate threat and they start something, then we can say "well we've been saying they are dangerous all along and now they're attacking so it's time to defend ourselves. " 




 Good, now they have two less missiles. 




 Congrats! 




 I had a Minnesota gopher one in college but it fell apart. 

I'm trying to get a phone case that has an ID slot so I can stick my license, a credit card, and some cash in and just use that. 




 The writers' boss must have just caught them surfing reddit so they made up some excuse about doing research for an article and now they had to follow through with one... 

 




 Cute couple. Congrats! 




 That's really cute. 




 The fireworks scene in FFVII was pretty moving. The music really just set the tone.  




 Cait Sith from VII. He just always annoyed me and the one time I used his limit break I got Joker Doom...no thanks. 

[Spoiler](/s "And why was he still around in Advent Children? Did Reeve just decide to keep piloting a robot for the hell of it, even after everything was over?") 




 Good costume, good background,  and gorgeous girl....that's how cosplay should be done. 




 Congrats! 




 Mr. T as Barret 




 I will say that I did like the system in XII of fighting the enemies in the overworld without having to jump into a separate combat mode. I think that added a lot to the flow and is something they should have kept in XIII.  




 While not strictly on minimalism, Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse is a great read. It looks at both ascetic and overabundant lifestyles and finding a balance in life. 




 What I really want is a slim case for my phone that has a slot for me to put my ID, credit card, and maybe a bit of cash. That way I just skip the wallet altogether and just carry my phone with me.

But I haven't been able to find anything good for the Droid Razr... 




 It's so crazy how expensive the East Coast can be. In Minneapolis I had a sweet 2 bedroom apartment with a huge living room right near downtown for $700/month. Now in DC I couldn't afford a studio for that much.  




 And you guys both know The Economist is a British newspaper, right? 




 That sounds like an awful way to die... 




 I'm usually pretty internationalist, but lately I feel like we should just tell the Middle East "screw you guys, I'm going home" and let that region work itself out.

I know it would create a safe haven for terrorist, mess up our oil supply, humanitarian disater, etc. but seriously it feels like it's just going to be a perpetual clusterfuck over there. 




 I kind of want to try one... 




 Whiterun? 




 I didn't have a SNES growing up but my friends did so I watched them play FF6. Fast forward a few years and I got really interested in playing FF7 but didn't have a PS. So I waited until I saw FF7 for PC and picked it up. Still my favorite of the series.  




 Totally agree with "quality not quantity". 

The past 2 computers I bought were the cheapest laptops I could find and they all broke within 2 years. Then I spent a little more on the last one and I've had it for 7 years and its still going strong. To me, that's a lot more minimalist in the long run. 




 I used to have a bunch: flip phone, Sony PSP, Nook eReader, laptop, mp3 player...

Now I pretty much use my Android smartphone for everything, which makes it really easy to just take one thing on my commute. I'm even considering giving up home internet since I can just check email through my phone.  




 DC 




 I agree 100%. Language protection is one thing but when it gets to that level of harassment,  something is wrong.  




 Something that looked like Cloud's Hard Edge from FF7 (short, machete  type) but with a status ailment like Stop and Drain. 




 That's one lucky shot...

Don't see many WWI pics on here. Thanks for posting. 
























 Write my dreams down in a journal to improve lucid dreaming. I'm trying to be productive in my sleep too :) 




 Time to call in the National Guard. 




 I've only played Persona 3   4. Is SMT a turn-based RPG too? 




 This is so true. Thanks for posting. 




 God I'm totally with you guys. I had a great day yesterday, ate healthy, worked out and figured I could do it again today...nope! Had projects galore pop up and will now have to skip working out, eat something fast and work until 9 to get it all done.

The only advice I have is to think of all the work you're getting done as one step closer to improving your life overall. I just log every major project and late night I have so I can bring it up during my review. 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/1anbix/atlas_hood/

This post had some good pics of it. 




 As I'm in the middle of my 1+ hour commute from my 60+ hour a week job, I've have some concerns about the accuracy of that prediction... 




 I love pictures like these...they really tell people are the same across times and cultures. I bet if you went back to Ancient Greece you'd find the soldiers dicking around with their spears. 




 And we can build this dream forever, standing strong together... 




 Wow nice work! 




 I think about this same thing  lot too. I'm 28 and just hoping to stay healthy And alive long enough for those advances to start rolling in.I'm pretty optimistic though since the pace of technological growth is accelerating so rapidly. After the airplane was invented it took less than 50 years for man to break the sound barriers and then we walked on the moon in just a little more than 20 years after that.

So I think if I can hang in there for 50 years we will hopefully be at a point when life can be extended much longer. 




 That's really awesome! 




 I saw Brazil in the title and two big round things in the thumbnail...

 ...Disappointed 




 Pretty clever 




 That's really bad... 




 That's really great work. 




 After watching The Cove I have to say I agree with this. 




 Man that takes me back. I love how your bow sounded like a fucking chainsaw when you had it charged all the way. 




 God it's so true... 




 I'm cool with this. It's 2013, we might as well start building better relations. 




 "Hide the weed! Hide the weed!" 




 I agree with a lot of your points. Triple Triad was probably my favorite mini-game in all the FF series. And I loved Balamb Garden as a setting. I think it would be awesome to have a game that used Balamb Garden as a setting and worked in simulation elements like in Persona 3.

But yeah the story was a little too confusing and the junction system could have been better. 




 Nice! I've been waiting forever hoping it would get added to Netflix streaming without luck. Thanks! 




 I wonder if anyone has done a study on the prevalence of autisim in mixed race couples, who you would think would have less homozygosity. 




 Survey research. We did a study on fears around nanotechnology once so that kind of , maybe counts. 




 Woo Minnesota! 




 The phone book, newspapers, elevator attendants 




 Honor among warriors. When the Red Baron was shot and killed, he was given a full military funeral. 




 Did Bono mess up how to give the finger? 









 That looks amazing. Would love to hang out there for a night. 




 But if only half as many people buy Xbone's... 




 Those damn vegetarians...tofu is the work of Satan! 




 Totally agree. Plus with all the free games PS+ and Xbox Live are giving away, I can afford to wait. 




 Sony did the exact same thing. 




 Thank you! I can't believe I had to go this far in to find a level-headed post like this. Personally some of my best memories are playing Battlefront on my 360 with my brothers, so I'm looking forward to doing it again in the future. 




 Believe me, I've been there many times in the past. But one of those times eventually worked out and now I'm happily married. Nice job taking risks! 




 I was there for 6 months and just took a carry on. Basically just clothes, any electronics, and 1 nice outfit. You can buy pretty much anything there cheap, although if you're tall it might be a little harder to find. 









 Same here. Every kid should have someone to tell that in their life. 




 Wow, that's really good! Nice work. 




 Waking up early is literally the best habit I have. I can get so much done while everyone else sleeps. 




 That's awesome! Just listening to their new album now. Thanks! 




 My phone has taken the place of a ton of other electronics, so I think of mostly as a benefit. My wife and I even got rid of internet at home since we just use our phones for everything. 




 That's awesome! I know exactly how you feel as I'm similarly great when drunk and partying and then terrified to even talk to a girl when sober :) 




 He already looks fast as shit 




 I think fake-it-till-you-make-it can actually work in a lot of situations and I've definately done it before quite often.  




 Well played OP 




 That's so sad! 




 VII for sure 




 In future news Isreal just bombed the shit out of what's left of Assad's army. 




 Congrats!! 




 Went in Minneapolis. Great show and got to seat hop up front at the intermission. Wonderful. 




 Nothing says badass more than having a huge Logitech scanner hanging off your belt. 




 Marry Freya, kill Cait Sith, nail Fran 




 Spot on 




 Spot on 




 Oh Del Taco...I used to have one in a gas station by my house in Colorado. The scent of beef and gasoline was heavenly. 




 Totally agree. Iria was actually the first anime I ever saw and got me into it in general. 




 Congrats! 




 My thoughts exactly. It sounds like the future will be amazing but they need to get crackin on immortality/ life extension so I can enjoy it. 




 My thoughts exactly!  




 That's really sweet 




 Badass! 




 Human breast milk? That's pretty cost effective! 




 Manna is a great one. Got me interested in futurology. 




 Wow she's pretty 




 Or the moon from "A Trip to the Moon"

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Le_Voyage_dans_la_lune.jpg 
























 Wow 90%? That's really amazing how far we've come on this. Just a few years ago a doctor friend of mine said Hep C was just as bad as HIV because there weren't very many good treatment options. 




 That's awesome, I love the idea of Siberia as a setting. Like if global warming fries the world and Alaska/Siberia/Canada become home for the mega cities. 




 I think this just kind of happens to everyone as you grow up. I'm still in my 20's but my wife and I mostly just hang out with each other, and when we do go out, it's usually just with other couples for dinner. There's nothing bad about it, and I actually prefer it.  




 I guess trigger control in the 80's meant controling which direction his brains splattered in. 




 Congrats! That's such a great story! 




 Ha, that's pretty awesome.  









 Thanks for the AMA!  




 Agreed. It's what really got me into futurology in the first place. 




 I highly recommend this place to anyone travelling through the Southwest. Truly one of the most beautiful places I've seen in the U.S.  




 Sorry if I didn't phrase that clearly....

I have 4 data points from 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010. The first 3 years are all significantly higher than 2010, but 2010 isn't significantly lower than any of those 3. How can that be? 




 Really amazing to see how advanced automation is becoming. 




 I bought an "iPod" off of ebay from China. You could load songs on it, but you had to let it play without touching it. If you hit next/pause/back at all, the thing would shut off and you would have to reboot it.  




 From Wikipedia:

In the United States, thousands of wildlife crossings have been built in the past 30 years, including culverts, bridges, and overpasses. These have been used to protect Mountain Goats in Montana, Spotted Salamanders in Massachusetts, Bighorn Sheep in Colorado, Desert Tortoises in California, and endangered Florida Panthers in Florida. 




 Sad...I've been looking forward to seeing this for a year :( 




 A dating sim with all the FF girls... 




 Midgar...of course I live on the upper-plate and not with that slum rabble.  




 I think it's different for each person, but that technique has worked well for me. When I schedule tasks for myself by hour, I find myself more likely to do them. The only thing I would caution about is interrupting flow if you're in the middle of something productive. 




 I'd avoid the Chinese phones personally. Every electronic I've gotten including phones from there have been total shit. I'm happy with my Moto X. 




 Woo Minnesota! 




 Great line. Makes me sad to think that our leaders can't get their heads out of their asses and work together to do something great like that again... 




 Kegels...look at that smile. 




 Well said. 




 What!!! This is the only player I've used since getting Napster 15 years ago! What am I supposed to use now?  




 No way! I totally thought he was just some kind of spirit type thing! 




 Kudos to him. It's great to see the kind of things the human mind can uncover. 




 Seriously, delayed all the time. 




 I've already got a copy, but kudos to you for offering. 




 You should have gone to a midnight opening to buy it. Just walk up to the counter and be like "Please tell me you guys have a Wii U left. I've been waiting all night!" 









 Venezuela doesn't need any help in being destabilized... 




 Badass. Any idea where one could play it? 




 It's my favorite of the series. 




 Nice work! 




 It's like something from Indiana Jones. 




 OMG yes! I was so pumped when I first downloaded the NGE theme, but to this day I still have not been able to get it to work properly. 




 This is really true. I always find that if I can get off to a good start in the morning, the rest of the day takes care of itself.

I also think it's a good idea to get as much done the night before to make the morning easier. I always make my lunch, pack my bag, and lay my clothes out at night. That way in the morning I'm not rushing to get everything ready. I just grab my stuff and go.  




 I totally second this. If I don't stick to a routine every time I work from home, it just falls apart pretty quickly. "Just 15 minutes" of video games/reddit/distractions quickly turns into hours.

So just like u/arrant_pedantry said, I just automatically wake up, run, shower, and then sit down with my computer in a room without a TV and start cranking out work.  




 Hey right by Bobby and Steve's...I used to get personal pizzas there all the time. 




 She's pretty 




 That's so awesome. I love the idea of going to flea markets/yard sales and swapping things for old games. 




 Bummer. Thanks for the response! 




 Sorry if this has already been asked, but can you download the HD collection with all 3 games for the Xbox 360? 

I've seen the physical copy that has all three games (2, 3, and 4) but when I go to the Xbox site or get on Xbox live, it only has an option with two games (and Peace Walker as a separate game): 

http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/MGS-2-AND-3/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d8024b4e0840 
 




 I wonder what the Germans would have thought on D-Day if they saw a fleet of Miata's approaching... 




 This your bush?  




 A warm bed, tasty food, and good company.  




 Just moved up a weight in my dumbbell bench. Now I'm doing 140lbs for reps. Not huge for most people, but the most I've ever been able to do!  




 I would guess jobs related to entertainment and creative ventures, things that appeal to the human side of us. Like machines may totally design and build the gaming console of the future, and may even program the games, I think a human will still have to provide the story, characters, and relationships that make those games so appealing to us.  




 This really is the most damaging effect of all of this, in my opinion. A strong scientific and technical culture is what gave the U.S. such an edge for so long, and now we're pissing it away over politics.  




 This is really great to see.  




 Congrats bro! 




 Damn, where do I sign up? 









 Anyone tried the Chipotle tofu? I've heard good things but I live on the east coast. 




 Wow...that guy sucks at his job. 




 Just to play devil's advocate here, these companies have to spend billions in R D costs to make these drugs. If they don't charge money to recoup their costs the drugs would never get made in the first place. 




 My only advice on a schedule is to do the important stuff, like job hunting and housework, early right when you wake up.

If you start off with "just an hour of games to get me going", I guarantee that it will turn into an entire day on the computer. 




 Say what you will about her, but "Save the Best for Last" is a great song. 




 No picture? 




 Burn 









 They are pretty shabby. Same goes for any of those "all-in-one" gadgets you find from Chinese/Hong Kong sellers. I bought an MP3/MP4 video/music player. The video function never worked and it would only let you listen to tracks straight through. If you tried to skip ahead or shuffle it would reboot itself. Total crap.  




 Yeah actually. FFVII when I was in 8th grade and I've loved it ever since. My 2nd favorite is also the 2nd one I played: FFVIII. 














 Congrats and welcome! 




 Nice job! And with my favorite trio to boot :) 




 Cats really are great. Sorry for your loss. 
























 It's just because they're all in sync with the smooth bass line that is inevitably playing in the background. 




 It's really great seeing all the athletes from around the world come together.

It's also great to be chatting with all you lovely people here :)  




 Haha same here! 




 At least the time difference in Rio is pretty close to the U.S. for the 2016 Games. Hopefully they won't be able to screw it up nearly as much. 




 Canmerica FTW! 




 That's awesome, thanks for posting! 




 Didn't vote for him, but he makes a lot of good points. 




 Woo Wisconsin! 




 Shame about White. But he gave it his best and was a gentleman in defeat, which is all you can ask for. 




 I love the guy in red in the second picture, like "Hey man, look at what this girl is doing!"  




 That's cool. I've always enjoyed watching some of the Paralympic downhill events, but have only ever seen them on Youtube.  




 Flavin!! 




 Haha, I know what you mean. I was watching a special on Olympians working out and the lengths they go to for training...while I was sitting there crushing a Chipotle burrito and cookies.

I felt the need to go do some sit-ups at least...  




 Haha, that's perfect! 




 Some are also U.S. citizens but have familial origins in other countries that they compete for. Like Julia Marino, Paraguay's only athlete in these Olympics, was born in Paraguay but was adopted by an American family when she was just a few months old.  




 100% agree 




 Flat knitting, circular knitting, felting, crochet...they might need to build their own venue to contain it.  




 Good game, kudos to both teams. 









 Congrats to the Dutch! That was some real athleticism out there.  




 That's awesome, congrats! 









 Seriously. The record for playing through the main quest in Skyrim is under an hour, but anyone who's played it knows that the sidequests are what make it way longer. 




 Haha, amazing what  few months can do! 




 As a frequent driver from St. Cloud to the Cities, tell your dad thanks! 




 Woo St.cloud/cities! 




 I never really liked Pascal's wager. Belief isn't like an on/off switch; you can't just make yourself believe something because you want the potential rewards if it turns out to be true.

As far as living forever, it's going to end eventually at some point with the heat death/big crunch of the universe. I have no idea if there is a God, but I figure it's best to just be nice to everyone and live as long as possible with technology.  




 This is great. I'm young but I can already feel my knees starting to go (my grandpa, dad, and older brother have all had knee surgery). This, along with recent stories around stem cell injections being shown to regrow cartilage in the knee gives me hope that I can avoid surgery and use stem cells to regrow what my body needs.  




 wow, nice! 




 PB J for lunch. Every day since Kindergarten to now in my 20s.  




 There was also a story the Russians built a nuke in their embassy in Washington DC. Since diplomatic packages aren't allowed to be searched by customs, the Russians had it brought in piece by piece and had an expert assemble it in the embassy. That way, if things went to hell, they could detonate a nuke right in the middle of DC with zero warning time or chance of being intercepted.

 Thank God this exists 




 I like that European countries got together to make the EU. Yes it has problems and, who knows, maybe it will get worse. But that fact that the people got together and said "It's the 21st century, let's stop messing around with different currencies, trade barriers, etc. and just work together is amazing. It really gives me hope for the future."

Also the people are nice! 




 I love how it's called "Project Cybersyn". 

It's like they sat around and tried to come up with the most evil sounding name they could. 




 What do you think has been the greatest advancement in chemistry in the last 10 years? What do think will be the most important advancement in the next 10 years?

 As I understand it, we don't have the heavy lift Saturn V rockets we used for Apollo anymore, as there hasn't been a need for them. So to go back to the moon, we would need to have a new "super-heavy lift" rocket. The
[Falcon 9 Heavy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy) might be able to, however.  




 Good detective work

 That's a really nice letter, thanks for posting.

 Well said.

 Wow that's great looking! 




 Haha my first thought too 




 Adorable! 




 And Minnesota too! 




 And it's free on Xbox Live Gold through the 15th! Highly recommended. 




 Totally agree. It's crazy to think what we waste money on when it could be spent on this. Life extension would obviously benefit everyone, so why is it so ignored? 




 Thank you for that. Very well said.  




 Put a 45 on your dick before you go at it. You'll build stamina in no time! 




 This would be awesome to use as an interceptor just to mess with people. Imagine some Russians buzzing our coast and having a completely empty plane pull up alongside...

 OMG my wife and I just got to season 11 last night and now a ton of the episodes are gone! 




 Best of luck to them.  




 Agent J? 
























 Man, 5 years captive...I can only imagine how bad the conditions were. 




 They should seriously consider investing in technology like that in California. Every single county is now under drought conditions... 









 100% second this. Doing dumbbell bench and felt a sharp pain in my deltoid. Figured I'd man my way through it...

I was lucky enough to avoid surgery but my maxes have never been the same since. As much as it hurts to have to take a break in lifting in the short-term, it's way better than the risk of doing long term damage. 




 I dunno, I think I just don't like kids in games. They just come across as annoying, like the kids in FFXIII.

 Looks like something a stormtrooper would use. 




 Glad to see they had humorous novelty signs even back then. 




 Dr. Aki Ross from the movie "The Spirits Within" 




 TIL we had a vice president named "Cactus Jack" 









 Is this the gun Indiana Jones uses? 




 For some reason I think Minnesota has a lot of good ones. If you're looking for Brutalist look up anything by Marcel Breuer. Cedar Riverside looks like a vertical slum. And the Guthrie Theatre looks futuristic especially lit up at night.

 Wow, nice job! 




 I love dumbbell bench... no need for a spot, great range of motion, and nice way to work the supporting muscles. Plus (at my gym at least) almost no one uses the heavy dumbbells so I don't have to wait around for them. 









 Jeez that sounds really awful...of course if that formula comes out, criminals will get their hands on it too. Imagine getting carjacked and getting stabbed with a syringe full of the chemical.

 Haha me and my friends would rent this as kids just because of the nudity. But watching it now that I'm older, it's a damn good film. 




 Congrats and welcome!!! 




 He makes a lot of good points. 




 In December 2012 I was on a Saudia Airlines flight and watched an Arabic movie (subtitled in English) about a guy who had sunglasses and goatee. He was a concert promoter or something and got with a girl singer, but then later got bored and got with a new girl he hired. Then he ends up in the hospital with amnesia and the girls get together to trick him and pay him back.

For some reason I thought the movie was Egyptian, but I could be wrong. I also thought the main actor was a comedian named BoBo or BoPo or something like that...

Any ideas? 




 OP delivers! Many thanks! 




 Haha that's awesome! Source? 




 100% agree.  




 Haha, good point. The U.S. would probably donate transport ships to both sides just to watch them kill each other.  




 You should go to [SongMeanings.com](http://www.songmeanings.com )

Look up whatever song you're interested in, and there's usually some pretty good insights by people that post on there. 

You should also do "We Didn't Start the Fire" Billy Joel. People of his generation were being blamed by older generations for their lose morals and other social problems, and the song was a response to say "look at all this shit that's gone on through history...it didn't start with us". Plus teachers love Billy Joel ;-) 









 Ha, that's actually pretty awesome. The olympians always do so well, so it will be interesting to see them compete with each other. 









 P3. It was the first I played and still sticks with me as my favorite. 




 Thank you for the AMA! Love your work! 




 I think Beijing's were some of the coolest...the patterns on the jade naturally vary so each medal is unique.  




 That was a disgusting show by the U.S. They should have stopped moping about yesterday and gotten focused on the game they were in. They got exactly what they deserved.   




 Wow that's adorable... 




 Canada. They've got enough in common with us Minnesotans that it feels cheering for our own. 




 Congrats Norway! 




 Ice fishing? 




 God. Fucking. Dammit. 




 That smile... 




 Yowza! Look at the gams on that bird! 




 She sounds like a really great sister. You should let her know that. 
























 Ha I'm a victim of that I'm afraid. I was at a job making 40k but I was capped at 40 hours a week, no nights, no weekends. Then I got job for 50k which I jumped at...but which also had nights/weekends/and 50+ hour weeks. 

Overall quality of life outranks salary by far. 




 The Benny Hill theme should be playing in the background... 




 Like look at Liv Tyler and then Steven Tyler...she's hot and he's a goblin.  




 Man that was a whole other level of war.  




 As a fan of cyberpunk and cats, I'm loving this picture.  




 I don't have to sleep much...like 4-5 hours and I'm good to go. I'd say a good chunk of my success in life has been because I'm always up at the crack of dawn.

 Any idea if this affects the reserve opportunities at all?  




 Those guys will come in handy when you have to go through the Mines of Moria.  




 That's the best thing I've read on here in a while.  




 "...and lower your upper body *down*"

Best part 




 The Atlantic just had a really good article on images of the tank casualties in Desert Storm. 

[The War Photo No One Would Publish](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/08/the-war-photo-no-one-would-publish/375762/) 




 As a Cold War vet, what are your thoughts on the current situation with Russia?  




 Totally agree. I work for a consulting firm and we see this problem a lot in the private sector too. Companies take their best computer programmer, who loves what he does, and say "Hey this guy needs to be a manager!" Then they promote him to a job he hates and force him to deal with paperwork and HR issues instead of programming. 

If you have great technicians, reward them for being great technicians, don't try to wedge them into a role they don't want or aren't good at.  




 That explains why their insignia goes back to being gold like a 2LT... 




 That is actually pretty helpful, thanks.  




 Most of the places I've been to don't have a min, unless it's a really small independent store. Even then I can just use a debit card.  




 I was about to say the same thing. Here in the US the only time I ever have actual cash is if I'm going to a farmer's market. Other than that, everything I buy is on plastic.  




 100% agree. 




 100% agree 




 I'll admit it, I'm kind of jealous...  




 Not exactly the same, but there was a Time article a while back (that I can't seem to find now) about therapists specifically hired by the CIA for their staff, since they would rather have them working with cleared staff employed by the Agency than private providers. 

It was pretty interesting, a lot of issues unique to that community like constantly obsessing over security details, like a guy who would drive all the way home and then worry "Did I lock my safe? Did I log out of my computer?"  and then drive all the way back just to make sure he did.  




 Ha I was thinking the same thing about Sudan and the DBDU. 




 Well Moldova is fucked if that happens. 




 It might be cool to get him a marlinspike pocketknife engraved with his name. That would be something he could carry throughout his career. 

Or video games. All guys love video games.  




 The only Coastie to win the Medal of Honor, Douglas Munro, did so helping to evacuate Marines during Guadalcanal. One of the men who was evacuated was Chesty Puller, one of the most decorated Marines in history.  




 Wow that was really interesting, thanks for posting.  




 100% agree. Can you imagine playing through that world like it was Skyrim?  




 Ha I'm having the same dilemma...I really just want it for P5. I guess it's a bonus that I can play some other awesome games too...I plan on trolling ebay/Craigslist/Garage sales to pick up as PS3 right before P5 comes out.  




 wow, awesome 




 Wow, so pretty 




 Really in-depth relationships. Not just "oh I maxed out this social link, time to ignore this girl and find another" 




 Congrats fellow American!  




 Reminds me of Quint from Jaws.  




 Crazy that videos from these events are now released in almost real-time.  




 I lived in Chongqing for about 6 months and then in Beijing for a short while a few years later. I think there are definitely a lot of cool elements that you can find around the country, with as big as it is. My biggest impression was that growth and change are so fast that you'll see brand new buildings built right in the midst of old hutongs and a mix of old and new everywhere.

So it ends up being pretty cool to eat noodles from a street vendor cooked over a little charcoal stove, and then walk across the street to a neon-lit club blasting techno and k-pop. 

I'd definitely recommend it, but you may want to visit first or study there before taking the plunge and actually moving there for work.  




 Woo, Tifa FTW! 









 Looks like a heavy metal concert...I was half-expecting Ozzy to be riding the missile up. 




 How funny, I just signed up with Coursera last night. Has anyone had a good/bad experience with them? 




 This is really cool, thanks for posting! 




 That was pretty cool, thanks for posting. The logistics involved for any kind of overseas expedition must be staggering.  




 Ha that's awesome.  




 Franklin Roosevelt? 




 Shovel some more coal into it 




 That's really awesome looking...the white snow against the colorful sign really sets the scene. 




 Is that a PS1 emulator on a phone? Does it run pretty well? I feel like my phone would melt if I tried that... 




 So that's where the Black Sea is...to the north! Thanks bot! 




 That pilot must be pretty badass to stick a landing like that. 




 Wow, cute! 




 Totally agree. France was quick to "officially" chide Russia for the Crimea invasion, but "oh, they still want to buy warships from us? No problem!" 




 Very true. It happened before with Korean Air Lines 007 which was shot down by a Soviet MiG. The pilot even said he could tell it was a Boeing 747 but just said 'fuck it' and shot it down anyway. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Air_Lines_Flight_007  




 jesus, that shock wave... 




 SHORYUKEN!! 




 I think the Asian guy melted... 




 Congrats man! 




 Jeez, they might as well tape a sign to it that just says "Haha gotcha fucker!"

 I'm on my way to Georgia for business for a few days and wanted to pick up some things for my family back home. What would be some good souvenirs to buy in Tbilisi? Also, what is a good amount of money to spend on them? I've heard I should be prepared to haggle...

Thanks! 




 I had a friend who liked the book "Hornets Over Kuwait" but I never read it, so I can't really comment. I think it's more about the author's experiences rather than a larger overview of the war though.   




 Dude that's really awesome. 




 Wow that's really great to see. Thanks for posting! 




 Well they're already up 1-0 on Cote d'Ivoire...I hope they pull through the group!  




 Those are some pretty boss uniforms. 




 NYT put together a nice page with some decent maps and a timeline:

[New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/06/12/world/middleeast/the-iraq-isis-conflict-in-maps-photos-and-video.html?smid=tw-nytimes _r=2)  




 I'm all about mesh basketball shorts; that's pretty much all I wear. Cheap, lightweight, and comfy. I don't really recommend one brand over another, I usually just look for whats on sale and have gotten some great Nike or Adidas on clearance.  

One thing I would recommend is getting a pair that's reversible. I've got an awesome black/white pair that looks totally different when I flip them, so its essentially 2 shorts in one. 




 Ha, maybe it wasn't as dire as initial media reports led me to believe...I can't even remember the last time I played badminton :) 




 100% agree. I actually kind of liked the idea of assuming I was just playing as the main character, and having to work with my allies in battle. It made a seem a bit more "real" if that makes sense.   
























 Congrats man, it's really great work. Can't wait for The White Donkey! 




 Speaking just from my experiences, I definitely felt that way during my first time in China. Most of the people I've talked to who lived in China were students who studied there for a semester (like me) or maybe a year, or English teachers who were there for a short period of time. Since most know going into it that it's just temporary, it doesn't really feel like the "real world" of work or putting down roots. 

In my case I (along with 20 others from my school) were only there a semester. Classes were a joke, everything was super cheap (early 2000's), and we had tons of free time. So I had half a year of no real responsibilities or expectations, which definitely made it seem unreal.  




 I'm meeting with an ANG recruiter later this week but wanted to get your opinions on 2 things:
1. Joining enlisted vs officer? I've heard varying opinions on pros/cons for both. I've got a masters in public policy fwiw. 
2. If I do go the officer route (which is super hard to get into I know) would I go through OCS/AMS and then a tech school? Or is there a different way that officers obtain the specialized knowledge for their field?  




 Sweet, I think I'll wear this to BMT and point it out to the instructors to let them know how hardcore I am... 




 Ha, glad to see so many other Persona fans here. 




 Ha when I was a kid my dad had a book about being in the military and it said something like "the military provides a soldier with everything they need...food, shelter, clothing, etc."
So I just assumed there would be some huge warehouse of clothes and supplies and you could just stop by and take whatever you needed when it wore out.... 




 How was the food? 




 Tbilisi is great. Lots of cool little shops and places to explore. There's an old castle and trails to explore which was fun. The food is by far the best part. Khachapuri (cheesy bread) and Khinkali (meat-filled dumplings) were my favorites. 

 




 I love the red stars on their helmets too...great attention to detail! 




 Sounds like a hell of a guy.  




 Wow that's a good point, I didn't think of it that way.  









 What did you have for dinner? 




 Probably all the cool flavors of packaged food. Shrimp chips, honey toothpaste, spicy hot pot Lays potato chips...

Now that I'm back in the States I still swing by the Asian grocery store to pick some up.  




 Oh awesome, it's getting ready to shoot!....oh, I guess not :-/ 




 I love that the US Coast Guard started [using the racing stripe in the 1960's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard#Service_Mark_.28.22Racing_Stripe.22.29) and it just became a thing for coast guards worldwide.  




 Time to buy that flamethrower I guess... 









 Young kids. Like Hope from FFXIII or Eiko from IX. They really just annoy me and I feel like they take away from the story.  




 Well they just defaulted on their debt in July, the second time in less than 13 years. Several agencies have also stopped accepted Argentina's official statistics on the economy since they are pretty clearly falsified.  




 How funny, I'm in the middle of that book right now! On page 261 he says:

"I tear at my body armor and get it opened. With my right hand on the the sleeve that holds my five-pound front armor plate, I grab the insurgent's hair and ram his head forward, jamming his chin into his chest. He's pinned in place now. All I have to do is finish him.

I beat him with the inside of my armor plate. I smash it against his face again and again and again until blood flows all over the inside of my shirt. He kicks and flails and screams. Every scream gets cut off by another blow from the plate..." 




 "Alright, we need to take this hill....OMAHA! OMAHA!" 




 Yeah I'm pretty sure that's what it is...right? 




 Woo Minnesota!  




 Tell him the original soundtrack to AOE1 is amazing! I wish I could find it somewhere, my old computer is long dead.  




 Wow as if I didn't already feel like a lazy sack for doing nothing this weekend...kudos to your dad on keeping up with it like that. Good motivation for me to get my ass to the gym. 




 Ha that's pretty awesome 




 Damn Libya, share the wealth...

 It's also [Armistice Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armistice_Day) which was the end of WWI so many countries in Europe and others who fought in it, like New Zealand, celebrate it.  









 God that would be awesome to have.... 




 I have the Skyrim station and an overall "Videogame music" station that I use.  




 That's really badass. 




 Anything to calm tensions is good for the populations of both countries.  









 I don't think so, largely because of the USSR. Stalingrad was in 1942-1943 and the Nazis were retreating from the East following that. The Soviets did get a lot of help and goods from the U.S. Lend-Lease so that might have taken a hit if Germany's navy was improved, but the Russians would still been able to supply most of their troops without it.

Still, I think the Nazi's would have eventually been beaten, or at least forced into a stalemate, it just would have been more drawn out and bloody. 









 Man that "slow motion" part at the end is just crazy 




 What was the hardest part? 




 Agreed. Like we use Starbucks packets of grounds in our office, but we get them from an office supply vendor who handles concessions for our whole building.  




 The [USS Torsk](http://www.historicships.org/torsk.html) is in Baltimore. I just did the tour last week. 




 Exactly and that was after he got a waiver for past drug usage AND an age waiver that allowed him to join at 42! Must have had good letters of recommendation... 




 That's badass 




 I can see that. There was an article (that I can't seem to find now...) about drone pilots who were having a hard time with killing targets. When they interviewed them they said that sometimes a drone could be assigned to monitor a house for days or weeks, and the pilots would see their whole family life, when dinner was each day, when the kids played in the front yard, etc. And then one day they would just get the order to fire on one of the people who was confirmed to be a terrorist. Takes a psychological toll, even from a thousand miles away.  




 The content of the article is one thing, but it needs an editor badly. Font size changes, unfinished sentences, misspelled words...it was hard to focus on what it was actually saying.  




 That's a good point...I was just wondering about the kind of people they accept. Like if they only pick a few and they are all prior-service and security cleared, than maybe I should work on building up my qualifications a bit first. 

From looking around online, the only people I could find that were accepted into the program were Jeb Bush's son, Joe Biden's son, and the Mayor of LA... 




 Nice! Now I can't get that theme out of my head... 




 I was wondering if anyone on here had any experience with the DCO reserve programs? I know these spots are tough to get (although it seems like a lot of politically connected people got them...) but I'd love to give it a shot.

I'm non-prior, masters degree, and 10 years in research analysis and project management. My recruiter said being non-prior was probably my biggest detriment.... I was just wondering if I should go through the long application process to give it a shot, or if would be better to enlist and work my way from there? 




 I was wondering how others who joined the reserves handled the time off with their civilian jobs? My work is client-based so even though I'm protected from my company firing me, my clients could choose to leave...

Just wondering if anyone had any tips or advance. How was reintegrating after training/being deployed?  




 Haha my first thought too 




 Love the trigger on the briefcase handle. 




 I remember when the were having the debate about the the new Offshore Patrol Cutter a few years ago, some people said there were considering a design with an [X-bow hull](http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2013/April/Pages/NewCoastGuardCutterSparksFierceCompetitionAmongShipbuilders.aspx) that looked pretty far out...

 




 Helpful to know, thank you!  




 What is the little white square on the display that moves around? 




 Totally agree with you guys. I'm constantly stressed out at work because of people and events that are totally beyond my control. I'd love to just say "Oh well, out of my hands" but I still feel stressed/responsible all the time... 




 That's actually super interesting, thanks for posting.  




 I always thought Yatagarasu (the three legged crow) was pretty awesome looking. 




 Poor bastard...he's probably done it 1000 times in practice and the one time he fucks up it has to be in front of the Commandant.  




 Looks like a pain in the ass to set up. 




 We didn't start the fire... 




 They were in Baltimore just a few weeks ago and I'm surprised there weren't more car accidents. Everyone just slammed on the brakes and was rubbernecking out their windows to see them flying overhead. But as a pedestrian it was awesome to see.  




 I'm prepping to get a grad degree and Calculus is a prerequisite for most of the programs I'm looking at... 

I've used Courser and Khan Academy to build up my knowledge, but it would be great to find an online course that I could get credit for to satisfy the prerequisite. Anyone have any suggestions or good experiences with a specific program?  




 Combining my two loves: Mexican food and french fries .. 




 Thanks!! I've been unplugging my second monitor like an idiot every time I want to PrtScr my main window up till now.

 How small do blades have to be?

Also, nice cat.  




 That's really awesome. 




 I hear you 100%. I feel like dwelling on the past has been my #1 problem in life. I've found it helpful to just keep myself super busy at present on things that will help me in the future. Working hard at work to get promoted, working out at the gym, taking some night classes. All these things keep me too busy to worry about regrets or past experiences and help build a solid foundation for me to be better off in the future.  




 I think a Sailor stationed at Gitmo just did an AMA yesterday. Might want to ask him:

 Ha, it's so funny you mention that. I was searching on Google and Amazon all last week trying to find a decent Loons hat with no success.  




 Do you guys actually brush your teeth with the soap? How does it taste?  




 I can't order "pop" anywhere on the East Coast...however they do have something called "soda" which tastes pretty similar.  




 But what do you want with the detonators, Hans? I already used all the explosives... Or did I? 




 They've been using cats as [firebombs](http://news.discovery.com/history/rocket-cat-warfare-found-in-16th-century-manual-140306) since the 1500s.  




 So he doesn't get incepted.  




 Totally agree. Diet soda has help me shed a ton of calories from regular soda and beer that I would otherwise be drinking. But I still have friends saying "OMG you're going to eat tons more food because of it!" like it's some Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde potion that will force me to eat.  




 Needs more bubblegum 




 Man I know this feeling. Today I had an entire Saturday, and used the whole day to do chores, house repairs, and a report for work...not a single game played :( 




 Guy looks like Junpei 




 Wow nice! Thanks for posting!  




 What a boss 




 My buddy had a PS1 and bought MGS right when it came out. So after school we'd go over to his house to watch him play and it looked awesome.  




 Congrats and welcome!  




 Looks like he forgot his suit, so he just grabbed a couch cushion and made a jacket out of it.  




 $1,700 bones...I guess I shouldn't be surprised... 









 Whelp that proves it. I'm sure the CCP will issue an apology for the confusion and quietly drop all claims. Nice work boys.  




 You should definitely look into "urban exploration" in Minnesota. Some guys explore abandon buildings and old tunnels, which would make for some pretty cool settings.

 I'd buy it. I also really want to see an Elena + Reno side-story :)  




 A...four button NES controller? *head explodes* 




 Pretty psyched about this. I love MLS and it will be great to finally have a home team to cheer for.  




 It's Yahoo, so they love to blow things way out of proportion. Like they had a story they other day on that Chinese girl who sat in the cockpit of a plane which talked about "International Outrage/Protest/Condemnation"!  




 That was a really great show. 




 Aww yeaaah 




 Wow that is a nice knife 




 Wow, that's a really interesting story. Thanks for posting!  




 Totally agree, I think surrounding peers have a huge influence, even outside of the military. I got married at 25 in a rural part of the country and all my friends asked "what took you so long?" Then I moved to a new job in a big city and I was the only one of my coworkers who was married, and all of them asked "wow, why did you get married so young?"  




 With Persona 5 coming out, this is my plan as well. Doesn't hurt that I can grab Uncharted, Journey, and Last of Us as well.  




 Jesus Christ that's awful... 




 Pretty all much grandparents and great-uncles were in WWII. The impression I got from them and other older folks was "it was just what you had to do". Like there was never really a question about them joining or serving (and they didn't discuss it much), but the country was in need so they did what they had to.  




 47 is too young :(  




 Ah Dreamcast...we barely knew thee. 




 Pilots too. I feel like half the people who have seen Top Gun think you can just stroll up to the recruiter and say "I want to be a pilot. Which way to the fighter jets?"  




 Can't forget [anime Tifa](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20081012225221/finalfantasy/images/e/e9/Tifa_Last_Order.png) from FFVII: Last Order

[Cowboy outfit](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090130001657/finalfantasy/images/9/98/LastOrder-Tifa-Cloud.jpg) 




 Totally agree. Doctor's offices, restaurants, the DMV...I seriously see these things everywhere.  




 
It was the first one I learned and I only remembered it because I thought it looked like a "little helicopter" on top. I had bad luck using the "random point" method of ordering in restaurants, so this helped me to not starve during my first trip through China.  




 Any woman that supplies me with endless breadsticks is wife material.  




 We'd use "flip a bitch" in Colorado 




 [Twin Otter?](http://www.zooborns.com/.a/6a010535647bf3970b0133f37125e5970b-pi) 




 "Come at me bro! I'm standing right here." 




 We were at the Madison farmer's market and were at a fruit stand, when a guy came running up to the owner and goes "Sorry, I bought some apples about an hour ago and gave you a $5 but you gave me back change for a $10, so here's the extra money"  




 Car dealerships are forced to close on Sunday too. That one just blows my mind... 




 Feel bad for the owners...the same thing happened to a shop near me in the Cities. A guy smashed a $1000+ window, jumped inside and stole 3 rolls of of quarters ($30) and a few bags of chips.  




 How do you like the Moto X? I need to upgrade and am deciding between the Moto X and the Razr Maxx.  




 Who won? 




 omg me too! I remember accidentally hitting Select and seeing the square and thinking"what the hell does that do?" 




 "Hmm...yes you seem to have a case of Tiny Leg Syndrome (TLS)...I'm going to prescribe you a regiment of Squats, 3 times per week" 




 That actually wouldn't be a terrible pizza cutter... 




 But the person in the comment I clicked on said they made $8,271 from home last week! Employers hate her!  




 Wow that's awesome looking...I'd love to visit someday 




 No unfortunately not :(  Lots of nights and weekends, especially at the beginning of the year, when clients have the money to do work. Like last week was around 70 hours and this week will be even more. So it's a pretty constant thing.

But it pays well and allows me to take care of my family, so I guess I can't complain. 

 




 I regularly do 60+ just at my job alone. I think the biggest thing for me is that once I'm in my office I do nothing but work until I leave. So maybe it's about picking a location and forcing yourself to go there. It doesn't have to be an office, but maybe go to a library or somewhere where you won't be distracted by "fun" things, and just make it a rule that you are going to spend X number of hours there everyday. 

I think getting into a routine and sticking to it is the biggest thing that helped me.  




 you mean since Prince was on Apollonia? 









 I love stuff like this. I used to keep a folder of all the "real world" Final Fantasy locations I came across.  




 I imagine the recommended way to open this is to grab the bottom rung and do some kind of spin/flip so that the rest of it shoots out to full length in a badass fashion.  




 Oh yeah, I had [this whole set](http://www.cardboardconnection.com/1991-topps-desert-storm-trading-cards) including all the Schwarzkopfs! 

Before the Internet it was a pretty sweet way to browse pictures and facts about all the troops and weapons involved.  




 I was a kid but I remember collecting the Desert Storm trading cards. 









 Yeah second this. I catch my bus at 5:20am so I feel like getting up any earlier would probably be counterproductive.  




 I have the exact opposite problem. I have a huge commute too so I'm out the door at 5am and back home at 7pm. 

I have my treadmill and weights in the basement so it's fairly quiet. You could do a bodyweight routine in the morning which is pretty quiet. 




 "Do you engineers know what the F35 needs? More engines. Did you think about putting one on each wingtip and maybe a few more on the tails? Probably would make it go a lot faster..." 




 Thanks for the reply!  





























 Haha, that's a pretty funny line actually.  




 That's cool, I love seeing old universities like this.  




 Man, with the boots, coat, and googles he's pretty smooth looking. Love old pilot gear. 




 I love Elena as a character.  Glad to see others do too :) 




 nyuk nyuk nyuk 




 God damn that's sad. I enjoyed the comic and she kept posting right up until the end. So young too. Fuck cancer... 









 100% agree 




 Nail bat. Seems like the kind of thing I would realistically be able to get my hands on. 




 Wow, a pedophile and a traitor. What an absolute piece of shit.  




 That must be why their rank turns back to gold like a butterbar... 




 Mazel tov!  




 Congrats on both the run and the green card!! 




 Sushi, J-pop, and anime/Manga all spread worldwide without government help. They should just let culture take its course. 




 Exploration. I think FFVII had some of the best cities and locations in video games. I'd love to explore a huge Midgar, both above the plate and under it. Or run through the whole casino world of the Gold Saucer including tons of games and new areas. 




 Not with VAW, but does it look like the top one [here?](http://www.markstyling.com/e2c1.htm) You can click to zoom in on it.  




 [Salus populi suprema lex esto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salus_populi_suprema_lex_esto) (The health of the people should be the supreme law)

Even the Ancient Romans knew that public health and safety was a primary role of the government.  




 Haha, so true 




 Living in Minnesota I bump into a fair amount of Canadians, and all of them have been great people. Happy Canada Day!  




 Also the mascot of MIT and CalTech since they are the "engineers" of the animal world.  




 Can a sub reactor really go to 105%?  




 FFVII was all about the story to me. Yeah I'd love to have the original combat system (with the option to switch between ATB and turn-based) but at the end of the day I'm sure I'll love it as long as they get the story right.  




 Oh God the roast beef...so good... 




 I love this line 

From [this article:](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/u-s--reaches-women-s-world-cup-semifinals-with-1-0-win-over-china-014630725.html)

Carli Lloyd posed for her Player of the Match photos, beamed into the bright lights and then was asked the difference between Friday night's game and all the others so far.

"Freedom," she said. 




 Woo rainbow! Twin Cities Pride festival is this weekend, and I'm guessing it is going to be awesome :) 




 [Supreme Court Rules In Favor Of Most Buck-Wild Pride Parade Nations Ever Seen](http://www.theonion.com/article/supreme-court-rules-favor-most-buck-wild-pride-par-50768) 




 To be honest, these rulings might be good for the GOP candidates. If Obamacare was repealed, they would be in the hotseat to come up with a functional replacement. And now that gay marriage is "settled", they won't have to oppose it at every campaign stop during the primary and look wildly out of step with national public opinion during the general. 
 




 In my head it was like [this](http://imgur.com/gallery/CtxLIG8) 




 I think the U.S. has had Marines stationed in Georgia for some time to help prepare for [Afghanistan.](https://www.dvidshub.net/news/164650/us-marines-aid-infants-georgia#.VY0rLFVVh0Y)

Of course with Russia acting up, it doesn't hurt to have them there for that too.  




 You should just copy [The Rock's cheat day.](http://imgur.com/r/wtf/2fxYx) 




 Five-foot-nine, I didn't know they stacked shit that high! 




 I know the advertising (and my recruiter) say the reserves is "one weekend a month, two weeks a year", but how true is this? I've heard stories of longer/extra drill periods that come up. I'm more than happy to work extra when needed, but I live a few hours from the closest NOSC so I just wanted to get an idea. 

Also would officers be expected to work more hours/drills than enlisted?

Thanks! 




 30 and just had a kid! Guess I'll have to introduce her to the greatest game ever made... 




 Agreed. I've been saying "I will buy whatever system the FF7 remake is on" for years...guess I'd better start saving.  




 Damn, those countries above 10%...hard to imagine 1 out of every 10 people in your country being killed in just a few years.  




 [This was a pretty good write up of the weapons being used.](http://armamentresearch.com/Uploads/Research%20Report%20No.%203%20-%20Raising%20Red%20Flags.pdf) 




 Exactly. I think this is less of a problem with the UN as an organization, and more a problem with the individual countries that make up the peacekeeping force in Haiti.  




 That is so awesome to read. Really shows how important persistence is. And just think, if you got accepted the first time around, you probably wouldn't have met your wife...  




 That's really interesting,  thanks for posting. 




 So easy a caveman could do it... 




 Pepsi Seiko, check. Kershaw knife, check. Navy-related lighter, check....I think I just found my dream EDC! 




 Let's not forget the best acronym of all: [The USA PATRIOT Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act)

Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism  




 That's awesome! Reminds me of the exercise room on Cowboy Bebop. 




 [Harley-Davidson WLA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley-Davidson_WLA) 




 10,000 F-22s? Oy vey... 




 I bet I can guess which guy failed... 




 These sound useful, unless the targets are ray-shielded, and then they would have to use proton torpedoes... 




 As a parent of a 1 month old, I miss sleep :(  




 Haha my first thought too!  




 That's awesome and terrifying  




 Wait when they say he "hand carried ammunition", does that mean he actually just scooped them up in his arms and walked around on two legs?  




 Totally agree here. I pick up a huge bag of rice at the Korean market for way less than smaller boxes at a normal grocery store.  




 Right, exactly. She is in fact mixed race and she's just as much white as she is Asian, so there's nothing inaccurate about it.  




 I'm white and my wife is Asian. When talking to people about college applications, every one said our daughter should check the "mixed race" or "white" box, not "Asian" just so they'll have an equal shot...pretty sad.  




 How long did it take? 




 Coming up next on Sick Sad World... 




 Could it handle old PC games off of Steam? I'm thinking like Age of Empire 1, Starcraft, SNES-emulator type games.  




 I had the exact same thing when I bought the Persona 3 box there. They had tightened it so hard that it dug into the front of the hardcover art book that was included. Was that really necessary?  









 Good for keeping out Genghis Khan's submarines 









 Perhaps you should check out the [French Navy](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Matelot.jpg) 




 No bear spray? 




 Mega Man 3 for sure. I don't know why but I can listen to that for hours...I even made a CD when I was younger of just that them playing over and over.  




 There was actually a joke blog like this (that I can't find now) that was called something like "I hate Peter Hessler" because every time the author would try to tell his friends some cool story or insight about China they would all say "Oh yeah Peter Hessler talks about that in his book..."  




 Anyone know of a place to get a baseball cap? I've looked everywhere for one, but haven't had any luck so far... 




 Not sure what I love more...the contents or the organization :)  




 I'm sure it's been posted before but [Ben Franklin's daily schedule](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/04/picture-of-the-day-benjamin-franklins-daily-schedule/237615/) had some good points. My favorite is the question he asks himself every morning: What good shall I do this day?  




 I have one in the center console, that way both the driver and passenger can reach it. I originally had it in the door compartment, but I figured if I got T-boned it would probably get damaged or knocked out of reach when I needed it.   




 That was a good read, thanks for posting.  




 Who's the more foolish, the fool or the fool who follows him? 




 Wow nice job! That's a tough process to get through. 




 How has the funding situation been for your organization?  




 It's like the Shagohod... 




 Who is allowed to the computer? Is it a first-come first-served thing, or do organizations pay money to rent time on it?
