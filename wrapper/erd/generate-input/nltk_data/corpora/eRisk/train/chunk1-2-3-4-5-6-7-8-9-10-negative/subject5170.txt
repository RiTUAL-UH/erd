 I think there can be differences of opinion about what the 2nd Amendment is about, but do even those who believe it's about the freedom of individuals to arm themselves against a tyrannical government believe that that right is absolute, and that every person in the country should be able to build an arsenal of every conceivable kind of weapon, regardless of the firepower of the weapon or the criminal history or mental competence of the individual? 









 GalantGuy, I agree that the issue is more complex than simply banning assault weapons and I appreciate your reasonableness and civility. I am in favor of being as reality-based, scientific, and results-oriented as possible in trying to solve the problem. 

Studies have shown that violent video games and movies don't seem to increase a person's propensity for killing other people, as does the common-sense observation that they obviously have those things in countries with much lower rates of violence. 

I don't think it's practical to have an armed policeman at every entrance to every school in the country, plus in school parking lots, sporting events, etc. Even if we could do that, kid-shooters could just go elsewhere, like parks, Little League games or Chuckie Cheese.

I don't go for stop and frisk or TSA style screenings. 

I agree that all these measures are overkill. The whole country shouldn't be on lockdown to guard against a relatively few nuts. I do think improved access to mental health and more realistic reporting laws on dangerously unhinged people might help, but even then you have family members who are enablers or in denial, like Nancy Lanza. 

It just seems more logical to me to make the weapons that are designed to kill a lot of people quickly unavailable. I don't see why anyone outside of the military or law enforcement would need those weapons. Mass shootings would still occur from time to time with non-automatic weapons, but at least the killers would be less efficient and a few more people would live.

If we had a way to prevent lightning strikes, wouldn't we try to do that?

 




 I'll concede on that. 




 I think they are all gun deaths and that is what that particular report was measuring, rather than deaths from violent crime.


 



















 I agree that pro-gun control citizens should get off their duffs and call their legislators too, especially because they are in the majority in this instance. If they don't and legislation fails, it will be their own fault. 




 No it doesn't. No one has to turn in their guns. 




 If I were reading a report on drownings I'd expect to see accidental drownings and suicide drownings as well as any murder-by-drownings, so if I'm reading a report on gun deaths I would expect to read about accidental and suicide gun deaths as well as murder gun deaths. 




 They do indeed. 




 I guess it's the thought of some guy blasting his prey full of holes that seems a case of overkill, literally, and not really sport. 




 "You'll never stop them completely, and it is tragic, but at the same time, we need to realize that very few people die in these kinds of shootings."

Tell that to those Newtown parents.
 




 It's "family's." And they are not. But if you think your family is in as vulnerable a position as the family of the leader of the free world, you either have a very inflated sense of your own importance or you are very paranoid. Maybe both. 




 You're not the first person to ask me that question. 




 I guess those academic and journalistic sources I cited are just making the data up...Look for the raw data by state on the CDC site and then compare them.  









 What kind of gun policy do you support? 




 Are you able to take down your prey with a rifle? 




 Here's a report from Penn that references the CDC sources that are used for this data:
http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/ficap/resourcebook/pdf/monograph.pdf

 




 Man, the thought of guys hunting with rapid fire arms is just depressing.  




 Do you shoot a deer with multiple rounds? 




 Gun deaths are gun deaths. Having a gun in the house makes it more likely that a gun suicide will occur, and that an accidental shooting of a family member will occur. I don't think it's unreasonable to include suicides and accidents in gun deaths. 




 Even if you don't buy the 25%, what about the 75%? 









 Are military-style weapons and high capacity ammunition magazines designed for hunting? 




 All gun deaths, I believe. 




 Your day is over, NRA. 




 When exactly are you planning to start the revolution?  




 Brady Campaign is actually a good suggestion. They have a new guy in charge who seems very sensible, thinks we should concentrate on things the NRA membership agrees with, like universal background checks. 




 But why would you take out the per capita? Isn't that what matters? 

Also here is how the Daily Beast arrived at the numbers I linked to above:
"Our methodology was simple: Rather than measure the number of guns, we measured the measure of gun deaths per capita in each state, using the most recent data available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That counted for 75 percent of the ranking. The other 25 percent was derived from the Legal Community Against Violence's state-by-state comparison of firearm laws, which ranks all 50 states by their relatively severity, incorporating everything from policies on mental-health background checks to whether loaded guns are allowed in bars." 




 No other president has been asked about having armed guards at every school in the country, so we don't know what they would have said. And btw there was an armed guard at Columbine. 




 Actually, Illinois is #43 out of the 50 states in per capita gun deaths. The states with the highest per capita gun deaths are all pro-gun states:

 All presidents get Secret Service protection for family members. You must know that.

 "The negotiating style Obama has displayed in these instances is what poker players call tight-weak. A tight-strong player avoids throwing in his chips, saving them for a big hand, which he plays aggressively in hopes of a huge win. A loose-weak player plays lots of hands, bluffing frequently. Tight-weak is the worst of all worlds  when you have a weak hand, you lose, and when you have a strong hand, you fail to maximize your position."

Ugh. I foolishly thought Obama had learned his lesson. Guess not. 





























 Case-control studies, ecological time-series and cross-sectional studies indicate that in homes, cities, states and regions in the US, where there are more guns, both men and women are at higher risk for homicide, particularly firearm homicide. 




 "The people who fight and lobby and legislate to make guns regularly available are complicit in the murder of those children. They have made a clear moral choice: that the comfort and emotional reassurance they take from the possession of guns, placed in the balance even against the routine murder of innocent children, is of supreme value. Whatever satisfaction gun owners take from their gunswe know for certain that there is no prudential value in themis more important than childrens lives. Give them credit: life is making moral choices, and thats a moral choice, clearly made."

 Yeah, study after study have shown that they do. Here's one from Harvard: 
http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/research/hicrc/firearms-research/guns-and-death/index.html 




 But the mass killings are the specialty of young white males -- is that what you are? 




 "We have to make ourselves better. Otherwise, the story from Connecticut is too unspeakable to bear." 




 And yet all these mass killings seem to be perpetrated by young WHITE men, don't they? 

And why would you take "urban demograhics" out of the equation, anyway? Don't people killed with firearms in the cities count as much as people killed by firearms out in the country? The majority of people in the US live in metropolitan areas, you know, something like 83% I believe.

Yes the US firearms murders are cultural -- the result of a culture in which access to guns is easy.

Personman04, try getting your stats from a source that is not a propaganda tool. 




 Great Silver piece that shows how the right has successfully shifted the terms of the discussion of gun control.  




 not true 




 ""...If they [Republicans] have entitlement cuts as part of this deal, they would make it, through their marketing ways, and theyre better communications operatives than Democrats, that the president would own the entitlement cuts. Theyre not worried about that. They would say the president owns that in 2014 and 2016." 




 "This isn't just cognitive dissonance. It's irresponsible reporting." 




 I hope Obama pays attention: "Recent events have also demonstrated clearly what was already apparent to careful observers: the deficit-scold movement was never really about the deficit. Instead, it was about using deficit fears to shred the social safety net. And letting that happen wouldnt just be bad policy; it would be a betrayal of the Americans who just re-elected a health-reformer president and voted in some of the most progressive senators ever." 




 Let's hope you're right and that the news media is all over this. 




 Silver weighs the polls when he aggregates them, taking into account their biases and various leans and their history of accuracy. Not foolproof but safer than any one of those polls alone. 




 Problems with women? 




 Definitely see the McGonagall comparison.  




 And Mitt Romney just released an ad endorsing him. 




 "First, Romney's story about seeking women applicants was a lie. Second, during Romney's tenure at Bain Capital, there were exactly zero women partners (not enough binders?). Third, during his one term as governor, he invalidated a half-dozen executive orders establishing affirmative action policies for women."
 




 He's afraid of The View. 




 "Here's the difference between Biden and Ryan: whereas Biden has been studying foreign policy for many decades (over which he's made his share of mistakes), everything Ryan knows about foreign policy, or at least everything he's shown us he knows, comes from interventionist ideologues with talking points that test well among the base and bear little resemblance to reality." 




 Actually, Ryan is a member of the House of Representatives, not a Senator, and what are you talking about with 43 days?  




 "[the window display of] Skuby   Co. Lifestyle Clothing store in Spring Lake, New Jersey...includes this photo of President Obama as a witch doctor. The store's proprietor, Bill Skuby, tells the Asbury Park Press, 'We deal with a 1 percent customer; they come in here and shake my hand. My business is through the roof because of this.' 




 "...can you even imagine Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh tearing their hair out over a weak debate performance by Mitt Romney the way that liberals have been over President Obama's? I can't." 




 "This is not a poetic rallying cry, but there is human suffering to be minimized and a new foundation to defend." 




 "The furor over Fridays report revealed a political movement that is rooting for American failure, so obsessed with taking down Mr. Obama that good news for the nations long-suffering workers drives its members into a blind rage." 




 "During his time at GE, the company began a system of tweaking their earnings that eventually resulted in a $50 million fine. But just because he oversaw a cooking of the books doesn't mean that's a standard national practice." 




 That is super mature, and not desperate. 




 Something might get done! 




 Thanks. 




 Occam's Razor. Simplest and least convoluted explanation makes the most sense to me. I also think it's telling that conservatives seem to be interpreting Romney's statement the same way I do --it's not just the liberals who see it that way. But as you say YMMV.

I also think it's interesting that even your interpretation starts from the same assumption Romney does -- that people always vote only from their own financial self-interest.  It says a lot about the way his type of conservatives vote. I can't find the stats now, but read earlier today that twenty years ago 80-some percent of Republicans believed in some sort of government support for the poor, as opposed to 40-some percent now. 

I live in a reasonably high-earning household but I don't support the government giving me a tax break and raising the taxes of the elderly, the young, and the poor so that my family can pay less. I believe in the concept of citizenship and the social compact. The kind of concentration of wealth we have now is not good for our country and will strangle our competitiveness if we allow it to continue.  




 "Those Americans who paid payroll taxes, but had no income tax liability, still pay about 15 percent of their income, higher than the 13 percent Romney pays." 




 "Those Americans who paid payroll taxes, but had no income tax liability, still pay about 15 percent of their income, higher than the 13 percent Romney pays." 




 Here are links to some of the problems commentators -- liberal and conservative -- have had with what Romney said:

http://www.memeorandum.com/


http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/romney-unplugged.html

And btw, this sentence --  Ill never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives" would seem to imply that the 47% are indeed lazy. That is an inference a reasonable person would draw from that sentence. 




 I think the more salient detail of the article is the rapacious behavior of the guy's hedge fund. Unfortunately that is not in the mojo headline. 




 "Mitt Romney says citizens who don't pay income tax will never vote for him. But eight of the top 10 states with the highest number of nonpayers are red states."
 




 "A triumph of fact and reason." 




 Reporters and commentariat:  Please read these charts. 




 While I don't disagree that Congress deserves scrutiny, realistically any changes in seats are going to come at the margins.

The race for president is too close for us to take our eyes off it now. Even if it's true that Reddit is overwhelmingly for Obama (which I see you got some pushback on), hopefully we go out and propagate these news stories and opinion pieces elsewhere as well, in addition to just talking to each other. 

If we support Obama, we should be trying to get helpful articles out there to undecided folk, via facebook or links in emails or whatever means we have. It's about convincing the undecided and about getting likely Obama voters to actually get out there and vote.  




 But the Republicans will appeal. 




 Note this quote:
"Quite simply, the Romney campaign isn't adhering to the minimum standards required for a real policy conversation." 




 I don't really think that's true. The tax returns are not analogous to the birth certificate.

It is reasonable to expect candidates for president to release their tax returns. It's not reasonable to expect them to repeatedly show a copy of their birth certificate.

The birthers are extreme fringe types asking something of Obama that has not been asked of any other candidate. Those asking for the tax returns include his primary opponents, journalists, and members of his own party who are just asking for information most candidates provide.

Romney saying he won't release any additional returns because opponents would only clamor for more is an excuse, not a reason. If he were to release even five years of returns, reasonable people would probably not ask for more. 

There is obviously something in those returns he doesn't want people to see.  




 Obama is still giving away the farm before the negotiations even get started.

 If the amount paid is lowered by an "average" of $2500, that does not mean that every person's bill will be lowered by $2500. Do you know what an average is?  

The article says that some will pay more, most will pay less. Those who pay more will be getting better coverage that will actually cover ailments or injuries they might get in the future. You can be a 20-something healthy male one day and get cancer or get hit by a car the next.  









 Is it an individual policy? 




 Read the article.  












































 Where have we heard that fraction before? 






















































 "Other states considering similar changes include Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, which share a common dynamic with Virginia: They went for Obama in the past two elections but are controlled by Republicans at the state level." 









 Ok, thanks for the correction, I edited my post to make the change. 














 For those saying it would take a constitutional amendment to eliminate the electoral college -- there is another way. 

States are allowed to decide how to apportion their electoral votes. To date, 9 states, representing 139 electoral votes, have passed laws giving all their electoral votes to the winner of the popular national popular vote. 

This movement is called the National Popular Vote Movement, and it is worth working for:

 People who swear and get abusive in their posts are revealing the weakness of their arguments. Military-style assault weapons were developed for use in war, to kill people. They are inanimate objects that are used by people.

"Retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal came out in favor of gun control restrictions in a Tuesday morning appearance on MSNBC's "Morning Joe."

"I spent a career carrying typically either a M16, and later a M4 carbine," he said. "And a M4 carbine fires a .223 caliber round, which is 5.56 millimeters, at about 3,000 feet per second. When it hits a human body, the effects are devastating. It's designed to do that. That's what our soldiers ought to carry."

Said McChrystal, "I personally don't think there's any need for that kind of weaponry on the streets and particularly around the schools in America. I believe that we've got to take a serious look -- I understand everybody's desire to have whatever they want -- but we have to protect our children and our police and we have to protect our population. And I think we have to take a very mature look at that."

So I imagine the general is wrong, according to you. And you know better. 




 If I cared about knowing the total number of deaths by drownings I would include all deaths by drownings. If you only want to look at murders, then find a report that only looks at murders -- that's not what this one does. But from a public safety standpoint, when talking about regulation, all deaths are more relevant than just murders -- including accidents and suicides. 
























 I think we agree on these points.  




 Lack of heritability is not the same as confiscation. And historically guns have not been confiscated from owners in this country.  




 I have not been shooting but do have a family member who is a hunter. 

In my opinion, the previous assault weapon ban was ineffective because NRA-backed members of Congress inserted a lot of loopholes. 

I'm not an absolutist on an assault ban, though, and think we should get what we can on this issue, such as universal background checks and improved mental health reporting. I predict that the NRA will come out as strongly against universal background checks, though.

I agree on the gang violence -- I think universal background checks, and a trafficking provision, would help there. I live in the Chicago area, and recently read that a large percentage of Chicago gang guns are purchased from third parties who buy them in largish batches from our gun-lax neighbor, Indiana. 
 




 So you acknowledge that the government has the right to regulate what kinds of arms people can have, and what types of people should be allowed to have them. We agree.

Also, you realize that corporations and the 1% get a lot of government handouts by means of tax policy, right?

 
























 Word. 




 Tribalism then? 




 Republicans seem to have a lack of empathy that prevents them from understanding or wanting to support a cause unless it affects them personally. 











































































































































 Actually it's Sen. John Cornyn of Texas who dismisses gun trafficking as not a problem. Grassley was the only Republican on the Judiciary Committee to vote to advance the anti-trafficking bill. 

So this headline is exactly wrong.

 I disagree with you about both Taibbi and Brooks, but appreciate your reasonable and civil tone. We'll see what else Mr. Brooks has to say about same-sex marriage. Did your research into Brooks' advocacy of "gay rights" include an unambiguous statement of support for same-sex marriage. 


































 Brooks is an intellectually dishonest disgrace who never has the guts to actually argue in a forthright manner for the right-wing causes he supports. He tries to sneak in his real agenda under cover of a "reasonable moderate guy" persona, but that approach results in his "argument," if you can call it that, being illogical when you actually take the time to look closely. Most of his column's commenters get that and so does Taibbi. 




 Brooks is the most intellectually dishonest hack I've ever read. His standard operating procedure is to pose as a reasonable middle of the road guy and then to slip in his real, Republican-water-carrying point and hope that no one notices that he is really pushing the standard right-wing agenda and not some middle ground at all. He's a loathesome toady, and Taibbi gets that. 

If you think for a minute that Brooks' disingenuous column was in favor of gay marriage, then I guess you're proof that his sneaky approach does work on some people. Guess it worked on j purdy below too. 














 They've also confused Cesar Chavez the labor leader with the late leftist president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez. I guess all Hispanic people named Chavez look alike to them.

 As a former digg user who left and came to reddit for exactly the reasons you mention, I agree with you 100% about the likely sad end of this whole fiasco. 




 @crabnuts--sadly, I think you've hit it exactly, both the methods and the results of these political forums being destroyed by vocal minorities and easily cowed moderators. It's a shame the redditors are so naive. Just let the rest of us know where the good guys are headed, okay? 




 I do agree that eliminating all sources that build on other sources sacrifices analysis and additional insight from the secondary source, but with that caveat, I like your other suggestions. These mods should be acting as mods driven by a transparent policy, not wholesale censors of sources. 




 I wonder if the mods understand what journalism is. Mother Jones is a model of it. 




 I agree, it has crossed from moderation into censorship. A political site that censors sources is worse than useless. 




 Agree 100%--how can these mods not see that they are absolutely killing the credibility of r/politics? 




 @synobal--If the censorship of legit sites doesn't end I'll be looking for a new political sub. How is USPOLITICS? 




 Strongly agree that opinion should be included along with news.  




 The point is that Obama needs to fight for his judicial nominees because these nominations have real-world consequences. 




 Thanks for the kind words. I came to reddit after the demise of digg, where, for awhile, substantive discussion did seem possible. I can understand reddit moderators' efforts to prevent flame wars and self-promotion, but I think you need to be careful about banning news and commentary sources. It certainly makes you look biased, even if that is not your intent.

At the very least, the process of determining which sources are legit, and why, should be transparent. What are your criteria for inclusion as a source, and why? Anything short of that looks like prejudice or a hidden agenda.  




 Agreed. 





























 Honestly, i use reddit to try to disseminate information I find valuable, in the areas of politics, health, tech, and women's issues. I don't think reddit should block access to any news source, frankly. It's members should decide the source's value, via upvotes or downvotes. I thought that was the whole idea of reddit -- largely unmediated access to information by its members. I don't want some redditor, whose agenda I have no clue about, making decisions about what I can see on reddit or what I can post from legitimate news sources. 

You may quibble about Huffpo --I'd disagree with you on excluding it -- but Salon and especially Mother Jones? Really? That looks to me like a conservative or libertarian bias -- and again, bias is just the opposite of what reddit should be. 




 @Burkey -- Now it's starting to make sense. Thanks. 




 @asdjrocky-- Very well put. Agree 100%. 




 @catmoon-- How does banning legitimate, award-winning political journalism sites improve quality standards? Seems to me to harm the quality of the subreddit. 




 @montreal01--Not an open system with this type of censorship going on.

 Tmbisrealcool--no, it was rather quickly determined to be a fraternity sign. 




 @brianhass--the FBI database has been found to omit many police shootings. Also, if the category is "justifiable," that is obviously not tracking those homicides that might not be justifiable.  









 @eatyourbrain -- Why do you say that? They are not drawing conclusions about the police shootings; the "malpractice" is the failure to compile national stats on police shootings. The government certainly keeps stats on just about everything else. 

Here's another piece on the issue by NPR:

http://www.npr.org/2014/08/21/342228794/ferguson-turns-lens-on-police-involved-killings-but-some-facts-are-few
In the NPR story, note what the U of Missouri prof says about the lack of info on police shootings:

"I've actually heard police executives say that they don't want to have a national reporting system because then people will compare and say, well, you know, this police department shoots more people than that police department. And it'll lead to problems"

 You might want to spread the word over at r/journalism, where there is a thread on the r/politics situation and the mod they seem to feel is mostly responsible for pushing the censorship:
http://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/1oxay8/unclear_on_the_concept_rpolitics_mods_ban_serious/ 




 Just found this after reading comments on the r/politics fiasco. Looking forward to an uncensored environment. 




 Exactly. Be moderators, not censors. 




 @PintoTheBurninator--our small business got the same type of letter from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois, offering us the chance to re-up with our current plan for another year on Dec 1 or go with a cheaper plan with somewhat poorer coverage starting Jan 1. The cheaper plan offered featured 80 percent rather than 90 percent coverage but apparently has a meaningful out- of- pocket limit -- our current plan's out- of -pocket limit is so loaded with exceptions it's almost meaningless.

So I'm somewhat worried about what we'll get after next year but we'll see. Our business pays a ton for our group coverage.  





























 I agree that the headline is misleading. I also agree with your proposal. 









 Congrats--your weight loss is definitely noticeable! Great job! 




 Fantastic! Congratulations, you are an inspiration! I need to study the keto board but just wondering what your goals are--you say 20 g of carbs on a 2000 cal/day diet. So those carbs are in the form of veggies, and the other 1900 cals are in the form of protein and fat? Do you have a goal for how many grams of each? 




 This is a great idea. I'm going to try it. 




 Congratulations, I'm almost at my first five lost. While it's great to hear the inspirational stories of people who have lost 100+ pounds, to me as a newbie, seeing a post about reaching those early milestones is really helpful. 




 What an accomplishment! Congratulations! 




 That's great! I've got a bunch of "thin" or at least "thinner" clothes I'd love to be able to fit into! 









 I agree completely. I think there was a power struggle between conservative and liberal mods, and somehow the conservatives managed to ban several liberal-leaning publications with the very shaky rationales you cite. 



















 That is great, congratulations! 




 Gosh, that is great! Congratulations! 









 Agree. 


































 Fantastic! Congratulations, and thanks for sharing your story. 
























 Fantastic! 









 Very impressive -- congratulations! 




 Yay! congratulations! I've yet to reach my first 5 and can't wait for those lairs! 




 Congratulations! I can't wait to add that -5 flair! 




 Congratulations, you handled things so well! And you are right, emotional eating makes you feel good for about 30 seconds and bad all day and then some. I admire the way you are coping-hang in there! 




 Can you buy your lunch at school and get at least one healthy meal there? 




 What Knutes said. Congratulations, you should be so proud of all you've accomplished and continue to accomplish, and thank you so much for taking the time to share and inspire us all! 




 Agree -always cute but now add the heat! 




 Thank you so much for your reply. It's very helpful. The issue of sleep is especially interesting. I've always been a night owl and now at age 60 it's gotten pretty dysfunctional -- I'm usually sleep-deprived. I've read that regular sleep habits, and adequate sleep, are important to dieting, but changing my sleep habits has been difficult. If I go to bed early I just wake up every 90 minutes. I think I'm going to need to tire myself out with more exercise and then walk bedtime back gradually.

Also glad to hear that diet is 80% of the weight-loss equation because I've let my diet plan get derailed on days I can't exercise, like "why bother, I can't get on the treadmill today so I've already blown it."

Lastly, glad to hear your endorsement of MFP and low-carb. I've tried weight watchers online  but I don't think it's a good fit for me because I like to get the calorie and nutritional info. I think calorie counting is a better fit for me. I like carbs so I'm going to need to watch them.

I'm trying to do a serious diet and lose 50 pounds. I'm 5'6" and 200, got up there gradually over the years, topped out at 211 six years ago, have made half-hearted and inconsistent efforts since then. My weight as a young person was low 120s  but I'd be happy with 150 as a goal for now.

Thank you again for your response -- you are very kind and a great example!
 




 Does she have a master's degree in library science? And how about you share with us what those agents were looking for? It's obviously no big secret if they shared it with you. 




 That's fantastic! I've got a bunch of thin clothes in my basement I'd love to be able to get into at some point! Thank you for sharing! 




 I think 50 in four months is a fantastic pace. 




 Congratulations! I'd love to hear what you did, both diet and exercise-wise.

 Great way to support your local library. 




 @purplepooters -- I am a librarian. i work with these systems. 




 @fucktheecrunch -- At most libraries it's possible for patrons to establish accounts with a login and password beyond their library card number. Patrons can use those accounts to compile booklists of items they'd like to read, to do an interlibrary loan or a hold request electronically, etc. I don't think those accounts would be likely to retain a title after the book was checkout out, but perhaps in some systems they can. Since the patron controls the login, privacy would be maintained, I suppose.  




 @EuropeanLady -- Yes, that is an unfortunate result of the privacy policy. It seems to me to be the lesser of two evils. Patrons can always keep their own lists of items borrowed, or save the date due reminder slips most libraries print out, which have the titles of the books on them.  




 @pedrobeara-- if what you are saying is true, your wife is in violation of her professional code of ethics -- I assume she has an MLS? 




 @Razed -- The circ systems and their servers are pretty secure, contained closed systems. Like an intranet, really. 




 @fuck_theecrunch -- Not true. I'm a librarian, and every library system I've had experience with automatically deletes the patron's information when the borrowed material is returned. There is no way to retrieve that information. There is no list of what people check out that individual librarians can use or disable. You say that some libraries can override this system and keep the records, but deletion is always the default setup and I've never encountered a library that overrode that.  




 @Jaydea -- Yes, libraries had to deal with this stuff back in the McCarthy era, and in the 60s as well. The patron privacy policy is longstanding.  




 @jonnypadams -- In many libraries, you can get Netflix-style recommendations based on your search of the catalogue. It does not depend on what you check out, but what you search for (with no record kept).Try it sometime.  




 @purplepooters -- Library systems are designed to delete once and for all. They have dedicated servers and tight networks.  




 @pedrobeara -- Do you work at a library? I do, and you are lying. 




 @That's the whole point of the articles. Identifying info is deleted from the computers when the materials are returned.  




 @imadetheinternet -- Why would they take your computers? it was about civil liberties. If you were a librarian, you should be familiar with the Library Code of Ethics:
http://www.ala.org/advocacy/proethics/codeofethics/codeethics 




 @fleker2 -- A good librarian can make suggestions based on the preferences you tell her, and many library catalogues have suggested books based on your catalog searches (not your check-outs, just the kind of stuff you are searching for, with no record kept of your search).  




 @dagobahh -- I think those cards just had the dates stamped on it if it was a public library. Most "sign-out" library slips were used at elementary school libraries.  




 @rundmcarlson -- Yes, the terrorists are all flocking to the library. They all have cards.  




 @Comeonyouidiots -- You can check out library ebooks from home and read them on your computer or mobile device, instead of contributing to Jeff Bezos. You can also access various proprietary research tools and databases from home, also on that little old computer you seem so proud of.  




 @big_giant_turd -- Public computers at a library are scrubbed nightly. 




 @Col Volkov -- Libraries are funded mostly by local property taxes with maybe a very occasional federal grant. Library policy dictates that when materials are returned, the identity of the borrower is deleted. 

Your fun facts are lies. 




 @toychristoper -- Stop spreading misinformation. Records are deleted to protect patrons' privacy, NOT to save server space. Where do you get that? It is completely untrue.  




 @Tidec -- You can get the same info from a survey. Also, libraries keep records of the number of times items are checked out, just not who checks them out, so you could draw some conclusions by comparing the checkout rates of various items with the publicly available census info on the demographics of the community, or before and after a historical event, etc. A historian can do plenty of research with conventional historical methods, without prying into the identities, incomes, etc., of library users. An actual historian would know that. 




 @UltraeVires -- Actually the government was quite interested in a  lot of innocent people in the McCarthy era, and the Snowden revelations show that they still have quite an interest in collecting info on people who turn out not to be threats in any way.  




 @GannamStylingOnYou -- Unless you're thinking of the stamp with names that appears inside the cover of many school textbooks, if that's really the case, your library was violating the professional ethics of the profession. Way back in the day there used to be slips with due dates, but I've never heard of one with names.  




 @aleister -- Donate to your local library's Friends of the Library group, or buy some treats to send over to your local library's staff as a thank you!  




 @toychristopher --No, you are wrong. Records are destroyed to protect library users' privacy. I am a librarian. 




 Great job! Now you're paying it forward by inspiring me! 









 Congratulations, you are doing a tremendous job --you're an inspiration! 




 @dinosaurdinosrawr -- Thank you! 



















 Trying to finally get serious and lose weight. I'm a 5'6" 60-year-old female who has been gradually gaining weight from my late 30s onward, finally getting into the 200s in the past ten years or so, topped out at 211 about eight years ago, now 201. I'd be thrilled if I could get to 150. 

My goals are to count calories every day with MFP and to get exercise daily. Do people set number goals, in terms of pounds lost per month? 




 That is so impressive! Congratulations! 









 Gosh, you look fantastic! Congratulations! You inspire me! 














 @Pudums -- No, no, you didn't come off that way. Invisibility is an issue you don't really think about until you experience it. The male gaze can be objectifying rather than flattering but it's something we become accustomed to and we notice when it's lacking. And there is nothing wrong with enjoying the fact that you're visible again! 




 Ok, I'm new here, have lost about five pounds through half-assed off and on efforts in the past couple of months. This may be what I need to get me going. Thanks. 









 @niamhd--Really nice post.  




 Glad to see your post, and all the comments in response. My weight gain has been gradual over the past 10 years or so, and coincides with my going from 50 to 60 years old. I know I'm invisible, figured it was a combo of the weight and the aging. I'm actually happy to see it's not all just paranoia in my head and is an actual thing! 

Congrats on your progress! 




 Congratulations -- I long to be where you are!!! 









 This is fantastic advice. Thank you. 




 Maybe start with $5 then? 




 I agree with allieneeds oats above. You are 22 and working. Can you ask your mom if you can keep out even $10 per week to buy yourself some veggies etc?  




 Agree--you are young and your skin is still very elastic. I don't think your goal--40 lbs on a 6'5" frame -- will make your skin saggy. 





























 Congrats on the weight loss. Re your question: from your photo, you look young. In my opinion, weight loss comes faster when you're young. Since I've gotten older I've found it is slower going. Now there's some motivation to keep those pounds off! Great job. 









 Congrats!!! 














 @Bartleby1955 -- Obviously it's worse, or it wouldn't be noteworthy. Here are the NFL's figures, quoted in the New York Times:

"The N.F.L.s actuaries assumed that 28 percent of all players would be found to have one of the compensable diseases and that the league would pay out $900 million to them. Their calculations showed that players younger than 50 had an 0.8 percent chance of developing Alzheimers or dementia, compared with less than 0.1 percent for the general population. For players ages 50 to 54, the rate was 1.4 percent, compared with less than 0.1 percent for the general population. The gap between the players and the general population grows wider with increasing age." 




 @ghost27 -- I think that is great advice. I've been derailed so many times by my compulsive perfectionism, trying to eat only diet food and exercise every single day right from the start. I've recently come to realize that the all-or-nothing approach is sabotaging me.

 So when people cast a vote for Republicans, what were they voting for? 



















 I think one interesting thing about this article is Rich's warning that Hillary Clinton will need to stand for something or she could meet the same fate as 2014's Democrats.

 I know! Me too! 




 This is such a helpful thread. 




 Such good advice, mlloyd. It is going to become my mantra. 
























 Yeah they can be inconvenient. Maybe she could set it to vibrate rather than beep. If she calibrates it though, and is pretty confident in the readings, she can probably do fewer finger prick tests during the day. You do have to confirm with a fingerprick before giving an insulin dose though.

Good luck to you both. 









 The minimed insertion sets will work with animus pumps. If you're thin the angled silhouettes can work pretty well. See if your doctor has a couple of samples or if you can get a few samples from minimed, just to try them.  



















 Dexcom is a brand of continuous glucose monitor: http://dexcom.com/

A sensor has to be inserted like a pump site, and the sensor sends a glucose reading from the interstitial fluid between your cells, every couple of minutes. You carry around a receiver with a screen that shows you the info. My son has found it helps with control but it is a hassle to deal with a second site, and the receiver is another thing to lug around, so he only uses it sporadically. Plus you have to confirm with a finger stick before doing a correction with insulin, because the interstitial readings can be less accurate than the blood readings you get with a conventional bg monitor with finger sticks. But it is a great tool to fine tune control because it also shows trends, like if you are dropping or rising quickly.

He has used the front part of his thighs. And he uses the angled insertion set, the minimed silhouette, so he can get a shallower insertion. He is very thin, and like I said, he has run into too-quick insulin uptake issues there, so his go-to is still butt/hip. 

Hope this helps. 




 He uses a minimed silhouette angled insertion kit and yes, he does use the inserter. When he was a kid I used to do the insertions for him and I agree, the way that thing shoots in there looks pretty violent. But he has always used the inserter and still does. 

When I say hip, I really mean upper butt, towards the outside. So like under the outer side of a back jean pocket. Not on the actual side of the hip, where the pants side seam would be. I would say upper outer quadrant of his butt is probably his most used site over the years. He also uses his thighs, but gets quicker uptake of insulin there so he can potentially have more low bgs with thighs. He uses stomach only for his Dexcom cgm at this point. I know some people use upper outer arm for pump sites, but he does not like the idea of the tubing going up through his shirt. 

Hope this helps.  




 They are not going to regenerate the pancreas beta cells, they are going to transplant new ones in. 

They are going to encapsulate the beta cells in a substance that allows the insulin out but protects them from the autoimmune attack.  




 Same equipment my 23 year old son uses. Agree that it is easier to be in good control now, and this breakthrough makes it easier to be hopeful for the future.  




 Is your gf using the continuous monitor? That can be helpful if your gf doesn't like to do the finger pricks too much. 




 NoFussFred, sorry to hear about your diagnosis, I know it is overwhelming at first. There are many tools that can help you keep good control (pumps, continuous glucose monitors) but this breakthrough can also give you real hope of a future where you are making your own insulin again. Be hopeful. 




 My son's been using butt/hip sites for years.  




 Hang in there. As the parent of a T1 23-year-old son. I'm excited and hopeful we'll see this in 5-8 years.  




 Big pharma is not going to shut this down. Doug Melton of Harvard has two T1 kids and is determined to find a cure.  




 This is not going to happen. The head researcher of the Harvard lab, Doug Melton, has two T1 kids and this is personal for him. 




 Agreed. Not to mention the insurance companies would save the cost of occasional ER visits and of treating potential complications down the line.  




 JDRF is also a funder for Dr. Melton's research at Harvard.  




 Maybe not quite that quick but it will happen. I'd say five years, maybe a bit longer but not much. Dr. Melton of Harvard has two diabetic kids and this is personal for him. I'm sure this will be developed as quickly as is possible, but they have to make sure everything is safe. Hang in there. 




 While it may be expensive, think of the money saved on treating all the complications type 1 diabetics can be subject to later in life, which can include amputations, kidney and heart disease, nerve damage. And treating type 1 diabetes on a daily basis is expensive too -- insulin, insulin pumps, blood glucose meters, meter test stripsSo even if this treatment is expensive, it can save money in the long run.  




 I believe data has been shared. These are two teams using two different approaches. The scientific community will see which approach is better. 




 I doubt that they wonder about that. Just because new ailments appear is no reason not to cure the diseases that people are currently suffering from.  




 My son is 23 and he was diagnosed at age 10. Hang in there, this is potentially very very good news.  




 This is a potential cure for type 1 diabetes, which is an autoimmune disease and usually strikes children -- type 1 is not brought on by sweets, or your diet or exercise level. The type of diabetes that you get from improper diet, too many sweets, and not enough exercise is type 2 diabetes. This breakthrough will only cure type 1, not type 2.  




 That's okay, 5 more years is not that long to wait to make sure it's safe.  




 Hang in there. This is a very promising breakthrough. 




 Here is another account of the Harvard research:

http://scienceblog.com/74759/harvard-scientists-claim-giant-leap-diabetes-via-stem-cell-production/#q4EGcEtqiPchk5dl.97 




 Yes, as the parent of a T1 son I agree, this is potentially huge.  




 Be hopeful. My 23-year-old son has been T1 for 12 years, and this is the first truly hopeful development I've seen. Doug Melton of Harvard has two T1 kids and has devoted the last 15 years to this. 




 That's great! Congratulations! 




 Gosh, you look great! Congrats! 




 Congratulations, that is fantastic! I can't wait for that feeling! 




 I've been there, though I've never lost that much to begin with. When I signed up for this subreddit, I saw that someone had suggested reading Brain Over Binge by Kathryn Hansen. I found it interesting and it has been helpful to me, I think. I definitely have emotional triggers for eating and this book kind of released me from feeling that I had to solve every potential psychological issue in order to lose weight. The book spells out how many eating issues are habit, and that kind of took the power of that habit away for me, or at least enabled me to see it in less daunting terms and as a more manageable thing that I could control.

That said, I also agree with the practical advice others have given here to track calories. My Fitness Pal will break down what you eat into percentages of carb, protein and fat. That's been helpful to me because I found that upping the percentage of protein and even fat as a percentage of my daily calories has helped me feel fuller longer. Some people have had success with keto too, though I am not going that route. To me, logging is a good way to keep the feeling that, while I may fall off the wagon sometimes and be less than perfect, I can keep control and meet my goal at the next meal, or the next day. 

Lastly, maybe you need to up your caloric intake somewhat from 1500 for awhile. That may be contributing to your going off the diet after 3-4 days.  




 How did you lose the first 65 pounds? That is so impressive! 




 This is such good advice. As a beginner who has found it hard to stay on track, I would say that logging is key to climbing back on that wagon when I've fallen off. Keep on loggin! 




 You are cute in both pix but look so much fitter now! Congrats and thank you for sharing your inspiring example! 




 Great job! The up and down pattern you describe is all too familiar to me. I'm looking forward to the 10 pound flair! You are within ten of your goal! Yay! 




 You look fantastic! Congratulations, I'm inspired by your example! 




 Yeah we will! 









 I know exactly what you're talking about, alexsjaan. I'd love to see sz 10 again! I've been an 18W at points in the past, currently at 16W. I think just getting into the regular Misses sizes from the plus sizes will be a huge milestone for me.  




 omg, that is so great! I'm so excited for you! And the shopping spree you're going to have, just four pounds from now! 




 Congratulations! That is wonderful! 









 Thank you! The encouragment helps! 




 60 yo female, 5'6", OW 202, GW 150, CW 197. I was almost afraid to post this because I'm afraid I'll slip back. But putting it out here may be one way to help ensure that that doesn't happen. Another way is to keep reading all the inspiring stories here. Thanks to all for sharing their experiences and helping me stay motivated. I'm using MFP and trying to do the treadmill at least five times a week.  It does feel really good to be under 200 for the first time in years. 




 That's interesting and helpful. Thanks, and sorry to hear about your illness! 














 Do the gallstones have anything to do with rapid weight loss? I had a friend go on a pretty stringent diet a few years ago and she got them.

 I'm back starting over after a grand total of 5 pounds lost and regained on round one. I'm 61, much older than most folks here, and at 5'6" am weighing in at 202. I have put on the weight gradually over the years. I tend to be sedentary and am a stress eater. My goal is 150, using My Fitness Pal and aiming to walk 10,000 steps a day with a tracker. 




 Thank you! 




 I had a bad spell a couple of years ago and ended up going to physical therapy for it. They told me that freezing one of those ridged Ice Mountain water bottles and rolling that under your foot for about five minutes a couple of times a day is helpful, as is spreading and then relaxing the toes on the foot, also for five minutes or so a couple of times a day. I agree that getting lighter is probably the ultimate fix! 



















 Wow, what a noticeable difference, and in only a month! Congratulations! Do you mind if I ask what your daily calorie allotment is? 




 What are you doing for the plantar fasciitis? I had it a few years ago. 




 You're right, that is their standard response -- that and saying that the tax cuts didn't work because they just weren't deep enough. 

















































 Is there a dietician associated with the practice that's treating your dad? Or one his doctor can refer you to? That might be one source of advice. 














 Irrational wouldn't bother me as much as the ideological bias I see. Seems like right-leaning mods have managed to ban all posts from certain publications, and now they are also going after posts that are unfavorable towards Republicans from their list of allowed publications, using laughably inappropriate rationales. 

Pretty ironic for a political forum. 




 This post has been banned from r/Politics, supposedly because Giuliani is a "private citizen" (He's not, he's a public figure) and the column is just nasty old gossip (It's not, it's all on the public record).  




 Here's the mod reply I got when I asked why it was being censored: 

from hoosakiwi[M] via /r/politics/ sent 45 minutes ago
"The entire post is about a private citizen and his statements about Obama. More than half of it is about the personal life of that private citizen (Mr. Guiliani). It is not explicitly political and at best could be seen as a gossip article."

Here is my reply to the mod: 

Mr Giuliani is a public figure. He is still referred to as "Mayor Giuliani" and he tried to win the Republican presidential nomination in 2008. He made the remarks about Obama's lack of love of country in a speech to a political gathering, and the remarks were widely reported by the media. If Giuliani wants to be regarded as a private citizen, maybe he should not speak at political gatherings about political figures, then follow up by talking to the press about it.
In addition, all of the facts in the article you censored are a matter of public record.
Do the mods have a system of checks and balances or is one mod's decision final? This is pretty clearly an attempt to shield Giuliani.
P.S. Learn to spell the name of the "private citizen" you're trying to protect.

 




 You had a pretty face before as well, but now you're a stunner! Congratulations! 




 Yes, somehow not knowing my calorie count with WW always bugs me and the fruits especially can add up. Thanks for your reply, and congratulations on doing a fabulous job! 




 This is obviously censorship on the part of the mods -- happening more and more. Message them bit don't expect a change of mind. 




 You are adorable. One question: how did you do both WW points and MFP? I tried that for awhile and it drove me crazy. Recently dropped WW and trying just MFP alone.

 "Guess it's out with the pointless "healthy" ready meals and back in with elbow grease and proper food!"

Yeah, I come back to that conclusion every time I try the prepackaged stuff for awhile. I also tend to get less tired of the homemade dinners, even if I repeat them often, than I do with the frozen stuff, much of which tastes kind of the same. 




 I think it will turn out to be more complicated than that. 




 Really interesting study -- thank you for posting. 




 People in Montana aren't required to get malaria shots because unless they leave the country they don't get malaria. You include a quote saying that epidemiological studies show that Hep B can be transmitted in daycare. It can also be transmitted from pregnant women to their children, or from close contact in the home.

Hep B in its chronic stage can be symptom-free and can go undetected for decades. Has every parent and daycare worker been tested for it?The Hep B vaccine is safe. It gives immunity for 20-30 years and possibly for life. The consequences of getting the disease are extremely serious. Risk-benefit analysis would seem to indicate that the Hep B vaccinations are a reasonable solution to a threat to public health. 

 




 None of the situations you mention is the same as needlessly spreading a very communicable disease to a vulnerable population such as infants or the immunocompromised. The line should actually be drawn not at smoking outside in my vicinity, or at coughing or having the flu, but at putting others at risk of catching an extremely contagious disease that can bring serious complications or even death to vulnerable individuals -- a disease that would be virtually nonexistent in this country if people would resume vaccination at the rate they vaccinated 15 years ago.

Vaccinations -- and the isolation of those with communicable illnesses -- are not a new idea. Ever hear of leper colonies? Modern medicine has come up with vaccinations, so isolation is not needed much anymore -- unless you refuse to partake, and in that case civil society has the right to protect its members from preventable risks. Here's an article about the legal history of compelling vaccinations in our country from the current online Atlantic:

 Funny! That's just how I feel! 
























 The context is the current MMR vaccine, and the Disney outbreak. Measles is much more easily communicated than the other diseases you keep bringing into the discussion. In logic and debate, changing the terms of a discussion is known as a "red herring." People use it when they can't make a legitimate counter-argument on the actual subject under discussion. 




 Again, the context of this discussion is the MMR vaccine. You keep trying to change the subject. 









 Kids -- and adults -- who are not vaccinated do constitute a public health risk, as the Disneyland case shows. 




 People with AIDS don't pose any danger to the public, and I don't think they are being referred to in the current debate about the MMR vaccine, are they? Although I suppose if they have an impaired immune system, they themselves are endangered by exposure to unvaccinated people -- all the more reason to worry about those unvaccinated people being in public places.  




 AIDS is much less easily communicable than measles. Who said anything about AIDS? Is there a vaccine for AIDS? Are you able to follow an argument? 




 @FlowCannon -- A parent's decision not to vaccinate impacts those in the community who cannot be vaccinated -- infants under one and people getting chemotherapy, for example. I'm okay with people having the freedom to not vaccinate, but then they will need to give up sharing public space with other people, whom they are putting at risk.

 But people should be required to have their children vaccinated if they want them to go to school, travel, or sit in the waiting room of a pediatrician's office with other children. 




 I thought the exact same thing, Eliot_2000. He isn't ignorant, he's an opportunistic, cynical liar who is indifferent to the harm caused by his pandering to the stupid. 




 @Fuzzymuscles -- Infants under one year of age are too young to be vaccinated. People who have compromised immune systems, like those who are getting chemotherapy for cancer, can't get vaccinations either. 

These groups depend on "herd immunity," which is produced when a high percentage of the general public is vaccinated. If more than 95% of a community is vaccinated, the unvaccinated people are very unlikely to be exposed to the disease. 

So by having your kids vaccinated, you are protecting those in your community who can't be vaccinated -- the very young and the very sick. These are the two groups that would also get the most seriously ill if they got the disease, whether it's measles or whooping cough or whatever. Also, vaccinations are not 100% effective, so even a few vaccinated people can end up with the disease if they are exposed to it.

So those people who refuse to vaccinate their kids are not only putting their own kids' health at risk. They are also putting other people's kids (or older relatives with immune problems) at risk too. 

It's a public health issue.
 


































 Very broad interpretation of what is off-topic. Speaker of the House invites foreign head of state to speak, cuts president out of the process. How is that not US politics? 




 Really hard to find a publication that has your take on the matter, eh? 









 I honestly don't know. I put it out there because the banning of five female editors by an overwhelmingly male arbitration board seemed concerning to me. Please feel free to post opposing views of the situation.

There is an article in The Guardian that may be more even-handed. I'll post that. 














 So what is rehosted about this article, mr mod? 




 Conservative mods got MJ banned awhile back. It has nothing to do with rehosted content, really, as you can see from the lack of links or attribution to any other original "host" of the story in the MJ piece -- the publication is just too liberal for the mods. Same with Salon. 














 Well, it was a couple, I think. 




 As you say, testing is a very personal decision. Congratulations on the birth of your son! 





































































 Great job! Congrats! 




 Obamacare has brought health care costs down.
