 * **1. Be open for discussion with your child**
The beginning phase of school is very challenging for every child. Therefore, being a parent, it is your prime responsibility to be open for every discussion with your kids. Always try to counsel them and try to understand their point of view, which helps them to form a positive attitude towards schooling. 

* **2. Share interesting things with your kids about schools**
Often kids go through a phase of dilemma when they start schooling for the first time. They are apprehensive and kind of resistant towards the idea of going to school daily. It is a battle for them to stay away from their home and parents for a long period of time. Hence, you need to make sure that your kids are informed about all the interesting things and fun activities they can explore during their school life to transform their belief towards positivity. 

* **3. Try to make their school homework interesting with your help**
Most of the kids feel negative about school because they need to deal with the burden of school homework every day. It has been proven by studies that parents, who spend time with their kids in daily homework activities, contribute towards development of childrens interest in getting regular with school.

* **4. Celebrate even smallest of the achievements of your kids**
These days, schools organize several types of activities, events and competition in order to offer platform to the students, where they can learn effectively. During these competitions, you should always stand as motivating pillar by your childs side and help them to achieve remarkably. Also, when you celebrate their smallest of achievements, it helps them to build faith in their abilities. 

* **5. Meet frequently with teachers of your child**
Your meeting with the teachers of your child helps you to keep a track of growth and improvement in your son or daughters performance. It also creates a positive impression your kids and encourages them to perform better in routine activities during the school. 

* **6. Motivate your child to read more books**
Motivation is the key for humankind to achieve wonderful results in their endeavors. You should be focused to provide a strong motivation support to your kids since childhood. If they are successful in building the habit of staying self-motivated since school days, then nothing can stop them to achieve big in their lives. 

* **7. Dont put performance pressure on your child**
Mostly, parents make this mistake of putting performance pressure on their children. It is quite obvious for every mother or father to expect excellent performance from their son or daughter but patience is the key to witness ground breaking results. Therefore, child psychologists suggest the parents to stay patient and calm to improve performance level of their kids. 

* **8. Encourage your child to be balanced students**
Balance is virtue for every student. Therefore, parents should not only be inclined towards one particular aspect of schooling. You should encourage your kids to take part in extracurricular activities, sports and co-curricular activities apart from academic performance. This will build up their entire performance in advanced manner. 

* **9. Understand child psychology**
The most common mistake made by elder people is that they consider children psychology same as theirs. But, this is not the truth because children are tend to think in different ways that grown-ups. They are more creative and their brains are fertile. Therefore, they should be treated smartly to ensure a systematic growth. 

* **10. Be patient**
The Chairman Mr. Radhesh Chander Pal of [Rishi Public School](http://www.rishischool.com) tells- Being a responsible parent, your key task is to interact with your children on daily basis and put your efforts to build positive image for schooling in their mind. You should focus on achieving the situation, where your kids start loving school and understand its importance. But, it is important that you stay patient throughout the process.
