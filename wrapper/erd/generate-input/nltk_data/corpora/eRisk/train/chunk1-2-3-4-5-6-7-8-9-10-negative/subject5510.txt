 If you found $//10,000 right now, what would you do with it?

 Dude, I'm pretty much the same. However, I HAVE had relationships and sexual encounters before, but right now they don't interest me. It's not like there are harrowing memories which are causing me to distance myself from intimacy, it's just due to the fact that I can't be bothered, in all honesty. 

Some will say it's weird and unnatural, but it's my body and I don't feel obliged to share it with anyone.  




 Good question! I'm not entirely sure but I can hazard a guess.

Your home is your fortress, your emotional base and safety net. Inviting somebody into your home and showing them around is probably a sign of trust.

 Classic Internet. 




 Good luck! Stay focused :) 




 Yeah, such a shitty thing to do to the people that are keeping you afloat! Companies like this are just more interested in money than anything else.  




 The snuggliest thing ever.  




 Some guy that went I my school. He thought he was the best, whereas he was in fact a total cunt. Silly, arrogant cunt. 

And somehow he was popular and the ladies loved him. *sigh*

 I tend not to complain, purely because I know what it's like to have someone complaint to you, and it can be uncomfortable. 

However, in a restaurant once, my garlic bread was soggy, so I asked for it to be replaced in the nicest way possible. They obliged and I got an extra portion for free. 

I'm more likely to 'politely question' the service I'm receiving, as people are much responsive to soft probing, as opposed to ranting and demanding. If you are kind and explain your point reasonably, most service staff will find it hard to turn down your requests, whether your complaining about the state of your hotel room, or you want your soggy garlic bread replaced. 

TL;DR: Politely question the service you receive instead of complaining. You'll easily get what you want.  




 I'm travelling around the world come January and I want to teach English as a foreign language. I hear that teaching in China is well-paid and sometimes they even pay your accommodation. Do some research into teaching English in Asia, there's TONNES of info. :) 




 I live for adventures and making others happy. I care very little for my own well-being, I am too focused on the world around me.  Life is huge!  




 People that don't understand the difference between respecting somebody's opinion and respecting someone's RIGHT to hold that opinion. 

I respect that people have the right to say what they want, when they want and to who they want. Doesn't mean I have to respect what they say.  




 Whenever the woman doesn't look like she's enjoying it.  




 Absolutely agree. So stress-free; you know where you are going to be at what time, your whole day is planned for you, you know who you're going to see. 

But life is huge! The world is full of wonders. Do what you love, no matter what anyone else thinks or says. Stay chill, stay true to yourself, be kind and be the person YOU want to be.  




 I've slept naked all my life, no matter what the weather is like. At someone else's house: just boxers.

 Yeah! When my mouth is really dry, I feel like cold water doesn't 'wet' the inside of my mouth or throat. I'm rehydrated, but the thirst isn't quenched.  




 I've only used it once out of interest. 

Found a contract killer's site. He charged $10,000 (or the BitCoin equivalent) per assassination; $30,000 if it was a political figure. 

There are also marketplaces for every drug under the sun, guns, stolen goods and even counterfeit money. I found one site where you asked for an item and the guy would go and steal it for you. 

LOT'S of child pornography as well, which is why I don't want to use it again. I didn't actually see any myself, as most of those sites/image boards are flagged, so you can avoid it if you want to. 

I did hear that there's also a lot of very useful and helpful stuff on there, but I didn't stumble across any of it.

 I remember learning about this at school. We got told also that some of the women died as a result of infection, due to the pipes cutting their oesophagus as they were force-fed.   




 I had a good one about some butter. I won't tell you because you only spread it.

 Takes me back to my rent boy days.  




 Shit! I'm actually doing this in January!

Me and my best fucking bro in the world had been talking about travelling the world for ages. About 2 months ago I handed my notice in at work and bought a one-way ticket to Australia. 

We're going to live there for a year with a working holiday visa and then just go with the flow. 

I'm in the process of selling all of my possessions. It makes you realise how much shit you have. One of my friends described it as, 'shedding my skin.'

Take the plunge and shed your skin. You said it yourself, nothing is holding you back! :) 




 I was addicted to getting achievements when I first got my 360. Eventually, I would hear the 'Achievement Unlocked' sound ALL THE TIME. 

Also, playing Gears Of War everyday for 2 years, I would get really angry/upset if I had a bad run of games.

 Speeding is my biggest peeve; as a driver, a cyclist and a pedestrian. 

One time, in a 30mph zone with a speed camera, some guy is driving up my back while I stick to the speed limit. Out of nowhere, he drives up on to the pavement (sidewalk) and overtakes me, eventually dropping back down onto the road, screeching to a halt in the middle of the lane and blocking my way. He gets out his car and storms over to my window, telling me that the reason I've been driving so slowly (AKA: The Speed Limit) is because I've obviously been drinking! (I hadn't). He speeds off and gets flashed by the speed camera. I followed him all the way down the road tooting my horn and flashing my lights; he was livid. 

The town where I grew up was full of boy racers. If you haven come a cross this term, it's the name we in the UK give to youths with shitty cars that they mod with huge spoilers and dampers, then drive around the town all night at ludicrous speeds. Round and round they go for hours in convoy, music blaring, engines 'roaring'. About 6 of them have died in crashes in the past few years. Their own fault every time. 

I hate speeding, it's so irresponsible.  




 Farted today at work and it sounded like 2 drawbridges having a conversation.  




 In return, you have to take my place at work and see if my manager notices.

 I often feel a lot of resentment to my past self. 

I like to think that it's because I'm becoming a better person every day (that is, moving ever closer to being the person I truly want to be).

Then I realise it's because I used to be a little twat.  




 This has scared me many a time. Lets say that at the time of the Big Bang, there was this 'point' that contained everything in the Universe. And one day it explode and expanded and here we are. BUT, where was this point? How did all that matter come about? Where did it come from? 

What I mean is, what was there before? If there was nothing, then how did it become something? Where did all these atoms come from? Where is the beginning of the story? 

That's the best way to explain my thoughts when I think about the creation of the Universe. I've just shit my pants.  




 Yeah, I second this. Looking between their eyes is easy to do, doesn't make you feel weird, and the other person will think you're looking straight at them.

 Holy shit! My friend and I have only recently discovered peanut butter, and we are going through a jar every two days. Our new favourite is Oreos and peanut butter. Also a good one is peanut butter, nutella and banana sandwiches: TOASTED. 

Bonus points for being high.  




 My friend pulled down his jeans and boxers and farted in his girlfriend's face at her birthday party. She instantly gagged and threw her glass of wine in his face. We both collapsed with laughter, crying our eyes out and rolling around on the floor, hugging like little giggling babies. 

Still to this day I'll think about it and laugh out loud. I always tell this story whenever people ask me why I just laughed for no reason. 

Best memory ever. She was a bitch.  




 Thanks! Great explanation :) 




 Why does our brain die without oxygen? What is happening in the brain when oxygen is delivered there by the blood?

 Yeah, it was like this in the UK when some fat, pig-faced cunt called Jade Goody died. She was a D-List "celeb" from a reality tv show called Big Brother. A talentless moron, really. Pretty sure she was accused of racism at one point. Then she got cancer and became the shining role model, a pillar of feminine strength. The papers that had so slated her before practically lauded her as a national hero when she died. Stupid, bald wanker.  




 Fuck me, me friend does this whenever there's a social thing. Considers herself a photographer and then rudely interrupts any conversation/activities/fun so we can all POSE for a photo. I tell her, "Your photos would look much better if we all looked natural." 

I'm of the opinion that if somebody is a good photographer, you shouldn't even know they are there. FUCK OFF WITH YOUR SHITTY CANON YOU STUPID, SNAP-HAPPY CUNT AND COME AND ENJOY THE PICNIC. YOU TWAT.  




 Absolutely not.

 Personally, I don't let my ego dictate my emotional state. Being right or wrong is no expression of you as a human being.

If somebody proves you wrong, or if somebody judges you for something you've done, then so what? People are way too busy thinking about their own mistakes and lives to worry about you being wrong about something. It doesn't make you weak. 




 What's does smh stand for?

 Nice! Thanks a lot. It's been killing me for three days now. 




 Woman holds an art exhibition where she's displaying her pictures for sale. The pictures are based around 'the breakdown of a relationship' or something. The pictures show couples in bed. She's not selling any pictures and an art critic disses her work and leaves. 

As part of the exhibition, she sells her soul to the highest bidder. She then meets the dude that bought it in a cafe/diner because she wants it back. The guy says he has the contract for her soul in his underpants or something. 

Any ideas? 




 I personally don't think girls should be called sluts at all. We shouldn't judge someone, male or female, based on their sexuality and the expression of it. It's totally natural to be very sexually active and people that are should not suffer prejudice. You wouldn't scold the lion that mated the most.  




 Maybe they mean they're sorry to hear that it happened. .

On my bedside table was a mug and a glass. As I was deciding which one to use as my DIY speaker, I said to myself specifically, 'the glass will be better to use.' Picked it up. 

Turned around and checked if my laundry was dry. When I looked down, I was holding the mug. 

Shouted, "No. Fucking. Way". The glass was still on my bedside table.

 You don't have to be funny all the time. I had this problem, always trying to think of a joke. It meant that interactions with people I like sometimes became awkward, or I was stuck in my head thinking of what to say next. 

You don't need to crack a joke every time you speak. Relax your mind, roll with the conversation, focus on what the other person is actually saying and keep the conversation going with leading questions.  You'll find that opportunities for witticisms will present themselves.

 TL;DR: Friend had mole, Peeps would troll, Threats on the doc, Surgery, Mole stop. 

My friend had a mole on his face that he wanted removing. After 'Austin Powers: Goldmember' came out in 2002, people everywhere would point at his mole and say "...Moley, moley, mole." Strangers on the train, people outside the clubs, a taxi driver, his school friends. He used to get in fights about it on a Saturday. Some fella in the kebab shop, havin' it large with the lads. Gets a bit cocky waiting for his chips. Jumps up from his chair and spins to look at his crew. They all look up at him and he starts to point across the room at the mole, dancing a little jig towards my friend with his finger outstretched. More people start to look. Conversations stop. Silence in the kebab shop. One of the kebab dudes actually turned off the spinning meat cooker. Everyones looking at the pointing guy then he announces, "Minstrel." The roof blows off the kebab shop (yet to be found) and my friend has an unwanted nickname for the rest of his life. He said his mole wasn't as big as a Minstrel. 

He got sick of the harassment so went to the doctor to get it removed. They said it wasn't dangerous, "we'll put you on the list." He asked them how long the list is. They said it was two years. He left the Doctor's surgery, mole intact, and tried to ignore the receptionist, who had taken the time to find the 'Goldmember' mole clip on YouTube and was now showing it to that dentist from the adjacent building.

He decided enough was enough and marched back into the doctor's office and explained that the mole was giving him hell and if they didn't operate immediately, he was going to whip it off himself. He maintains he would've. The doctor fast-tracked him to a senior surgeon and they had it off within the hour.

Now he's just a bloke with a scar on his face.  




 Chances are he'll be in a high-security wing away from people that want to kill him. Unless the screws turn a blind eye to child abusers.

I'm glad that there was no Lil Wayne appearance, I'm sick of hearing him every time I listen to Drake.

I just hoped there would be more soulful singing, but I guess this is just the refinement of his sound.

"I'll be there in five minutes" 




 When I was younger I'd say, "haha chair, didn't hurt, I dare you to do it again!" 




 Send 'em  




 Like the scene out of The Matrix but 8 year olds instead of Hugo Weaving. If I had a kendo stick then hundreds 




 My sister once ordered me to stop breathing 




 Fine cheese. And mushrooms I used to hate those 




 E'ery dayyyyy 




 The subject line in an email to herself was "Jesus loves you" 




 Wanker 




 This is how we got forward-facing eyes 




 "Carl with a K" 




 Good point 




 Thats really upsetting 




 Take a spare pair of shoes to change into when you finish. Not essential but it feels so good.  




 True but there was human poo pollution instead 




 In this interview with Vibe he says he has 6-7 albums in the making: http://www.vibe.com/article/interview-mac-miller-talks-new-albums-status-pharrell-ep-why-he-doesnt-want-weed-legalized

I'm stoked to hear anything after Faces and WMWTSO, I love the direction Mac has taken.  




 Yeah that one was really clever 









 Looks like its wearing a paper hat 




 Buffalo Bill? 




 "Remind me later" 




 A timeless classic and it still made me snot a bit 




 That made me have a miscarriage 




 We've dug ourselves a hole now 




 Gears of War 




 His sadnes stems from these bad jokes 




 But I've already paid for the rib-removal surgery  




 I didn't get a corrupt save, it sucks that you did. I felt kind of empty not having any more gems to get 




 That doesn't have anything to do with him as a person and I think the way he was hounded in the press was a shame. 

 




 Loads of fingering 




 I've been trying to get my lips round my helmet for 3 weeks now and I'm not getting any closer

 Cheers. I was interested in seeing the whole game to look at tactics and the like. Will check out the goals here anyway! 




 ok thanks for the heads up 




 Rights that it I'm reporting you 




 Progress breeds progress? 









 Every day, chip away 




 Dart is awesome because the games are so short. And they're so talented it's crazy. The crowd go mental the whole time wearing funny hats and getting pissed and the players are just *ftt ftt ftt* 




 Mmmmicchaaellllll!!!! 




 St Stephen's Tower 




 wikihow 




 Nice Porsche Engineering sticker! 




 This is terrifying 




 Any examples to further explain this?  




 For some reason I'm annoyed that the girl doesn't say thanks. The mother does, I feel like she should have asked her child to say thank you.  




 does she break her left arm? 




 yay lets bomb insurgents

 Haha looks thick as pig shit, she's a cutie though 




 Haha there's a running joke in my family that True Lies is on tv EVERY new year's eve and EVERY easter sunday. But it's not really a joke because that's the only time it's on tv. 




 When my sister was 4 she insulted a family friend by saying, "YOU APPLE-HEAD!" 




 Iniesta ran the wrong side of the ref, he would have been able to cut that out if he ran to the right of him.  




 I watched that about 30 times  




 Dude me too, my dream is to be a house-husband 




 Your comment made me go "hur-hur!" like a caveman but I'm on my own so it's ok.  




 Song Cry is a masterpiece. The emotion Hov generates make this one of those songs you listen to on a rainy walk through the city thinking about old friends and girls gone past.  

-  "We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather, now we fly first class to change the forecast."

- "We was on the block since free lunch, we shoulda been together eatin' Four Seasons brunch"

- "They say you can't turn a bad girl good, but once a good girl's gone bad, she's gone forever, I mourn forever, shit I've gotta live the fact I did you wrong forever."

U Don't Know is a masterpiece. His braggadocious lyrics walk us through his gang-banging beginnings and his rise to the top. I get so pumped listening to this track, makes me want to put on a tux and sell crack in a police station.

- "One million, two million, three million, four, five years later, forty million more." 

- "Put me anywhere on God's green earth, I triple my worth"

- "I'm rapin' Def Jam till I'm the hundred million man."

- "I sell ice in the winter, I sell fire in hell, I am a hustler baby, I sell water to a well."

Heart Of The City is a night-time driving song, a street-beating, atmosphere -soaking, big-pimping classic. The instrumental on its own is a classic. 

- "Young fucks spitting at me, young rappers getting at me, my nigga Big predicted the shit exactly, mo money, mo problems gotta move carefully, cos faggots hate when you getting money like athletes."

- "But the only thing running is numbers fam, Jigga held you down six summers; damn, where's the love?"

- "Ain't no love in the heart of the city, ain't no love in the heart of town"

Shit this album is straight bangers all the way through and Hov's lyrics and flow really take you on a journey. It gets me so excited for... I don't know. The future? The past? You'll be rapping to this for months afterwards without even realising. The Blueprint is what made me fall in love with Jay-Z.  




 Im the foot fuckin' Masta!  




 Thanks! 




 Thanks OP, any links? 




 Say What's Real and Ignant Shit are played endlessly 




 Not quite the same but recently I met some guys from
England and there were lots of foreign people there too. They would occassionally slip into a high-pitched Geordie (Newcastle, England) accent so they couldn't be understood by non-native English speakers. 

There was an American girl there who said she couldn't understand them when they spoke like that. One of the guys turned to the other and said in high-pitched Geordie, "She's got a right set of bangers on her!". 

She totally understood that time.  




 On my days off I love going to a cafe and having breakfast and coffee.  




 Dude this is the kind of stuff dreams are made of 




 *Wily 




 anyone got the tape 




 BALD STEEL! 




 Yeah it's great, mental too 


































 Is she a grumpy big kid? 




 Yeah and I agree, these videos are awesome! It does seem simple so it's cool to see how producers tweak their samples to get the sound they want. Those samples were pitched up 6/10 of a semitone. 









 What's the story? 









 Yeah and I agree, why not just hand the sub over to someone else?
 




 pretty mental huh 




 I've heard it's a bad sign when a dog starts doing that "I'll bite you but I'm not really biting you" thing. It's them testing to see if they can put part of Little Billy in their mouths and get away with it.

Convoluted but - I knew a guy who's Nan had a friend that had a big dog and it started doing this to the new baby. Not really a bite, just putting its mouth around the baby's hands and feet. They walked in the room once and the dog had the baby's arm in its mouth, somehow they thought nothing of it. Next day, the dog mauled the poor bab's face off.   

Edit: punctuation 




 Thanks for the correction, it makes sense that there wasn't a year 0 




 91 minutes and 37 seconds is in the 92nd minute of the game. The first minute of the game is from 0-1minute.

Kind of how the years 1900-1999 are the 20th century. I hope that makes any sense.


 




 Orcas are dolphins 




 When people are cleaning their teeth, there's hardly any foam and they don't spit or rinse. They're scrubbing away and then they swallow and that's it. 




 Dude your dick's tiny 




 Frank Body 




 A guy I know makes a similar product and is set to hit $20 million this year. He created a marketable brand, then he hired a hot girl to follow other hot girls on Instagram and offer free samples. Rinse and repeat. 

It's a numbers game and I'm making it sound easy but social media is a really useful tool for marketing beauty products, especially if the customer uses the body scrub as part of their daily routine. 




 I used to have recurring nightmares about this kind of stuff 




 Yeah they get taken down and re-uploaded. 

Ahh, I thought I recognised the name. It's interesting what you say about them helping to drag you out of a sad mood, they do the same for me, I guess it's a comfort thing.

I'll check out the animated stuff, watched some of it when it first came out. Have you listened to the bonus hour podcast they did, it's my go to! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALGFVxKv2f4
 




 Haha, I've been listening almost every day for the past few years. I go from XFM series 0-4 then rinse and repeat.

You uploaded them on youtube at one point didn't you? I remember a screenshot of Smerch commenting to you on a thread. 




 "You could take a bullet for the president?"

"What... and then shit myself? 




 Just snorted myself into a coughing fit 




 al-oo-min-yum 




 I walk past a homeless man on the way home from work every day and he's convinced I'm [Ronan Keating](http://www.radiocremebrulee.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ronankeating-suited.jpg). I don't look like him.  




 aliens
 




 Thanks for all this, it's interesting! 

  




 Dude please 




 Thanks for the link, this shit's crazy.  




 How can you tell if somethings been downvoted or not?  




 How does one see who's downvoting who and how many downvotes a post has? noob question 




 How do you deliver or receive a rescue breath without water getting in your mouth? 




 Alternate 




 I think it was relief after Mabgalas cock up 




 What's the story here? 




 He goes down still chewing     




 I know it's a joke, but it seems that a large portion of users here resort to penis/ejaculation references to describe their appreciation of something. 

Look at a thread of a good goal or bit of skill, and at least one of the top comments will be "I came" or "My erection just exploded hrnggggg".

That's my observation, I'm not saying this is good or bad. 

Edit: maybe 'large portion' is a bit much, but these penis comments do get upvoted 




 The bottle into the cupboard is total eye candy 




 David Silva controlled the game, MOTM for me. City could've had 8 or 9.  




 hahaha I laugh every time. So sauve 




 Wes Brown had a great game 




 we know 




 I dont believe it
