 I had an ArmaLite AR-10 pattern .308 gas gun and let me just say the aftermarket parts seemed a lot more geared toward SR-25/LR308 pattern rifles. I was very impressed with the overall quality of the AR-10 but it seems to me the LR-308 pattern may have been the way to go. RRA is, as I understand it, different mags and, through my adventures on the web, the least popular option. 









 Shot placement. Shot placement. Shot placement. 




 Doesn't the accuwedge push the receivers apart basically? I know a little play isn't that big a deal but it seems kinda counterproductive 




 I recently picked up a Core-15 M-4 that I'm slowly building into a coyote rifle, I posted a picture of it somewhat recently should you be interested. Currently the core has a 20" fluted bushmaster varminter barrel that I got a screamin' deal on, but I think that additional heft on the front end is exaggerating the slop between upper and lower. JP tension pin or deal with it? I would appreciate input from people that have used the tension pin or found a similar solution that doesn't involve foam earplugs... 




 when i purchased an almost identical troy rail for my AR-10, it came with a section (maybe two, I can't remember correctly) of rail about 4" in length. I used it way out front for a bipod. Not sure if a company would include it if you didn't purchase the rail separately, though. 





























 What is the french police force trained exclusively on call of duty? "we should equip our sharpshooters with submachine guns" makes sense... 




 Check your local walmart. Mine has boxes of 30 for $9.97.
ZQ SS109 62gr. FMJ for  $0.30 a round. Don't help the gougers out anymore. 




 because I myself am not in my mid 70's... 




 just the mun, gotta figure out how to get ol' johnsby home now... 









 check out that ASStronaut 




 Sorry for the disregard, everyone, stopped at the local hardware store and picked up 3 different o-ring sizes (don't ask me which, i just eyeballed them off the wall basically). Slipped the largest one i got on there nice and tight and, what do you know, slop gone. Thanks for saving me the $35 folks. 
























 Thanks for the input y'all. Good to know a cheaper bike still has the power to get around, especially for a bigger rider. Does that legendary honda reliability and workability transfer to the bikes as well? Or is that perk reserved for the civics? 




 Yeah see this is what I've been seeing around. I'm not one to shy away from mechanical work and I think a naked goldwing can look nice and prolly shave a bit of weight 




 I'm a pretty big dude, 6'-3" close to 300lbs. Help me pick out something that I can learn on and enjoy but still has enough ass to pull mine up a hill and to highway speeds. Been snooping around on here, I thought maybe a mid 80's goldwing would fit my price range and be big enough for me, any suggestions? 




 Another suggestion for a "cheaper" upgrade, bed that stock if it isn't already. There's good kits around for easily under $100 that'll wring a little more accuracy out of a factory rifle. 




 Not sure what the handguard in the brownells ad is, but rainier arms makes a similar looking model called the evolution, its a samson product rebranded I believe. To answer your second question, the barrel length doesn't have as much to do with the handguard as you might think, so long as you're using a low profile gas block. If you're using a railed block or one with an integrated front sight post it's best to match your handguard length to the length of your gas tube. These are typically pistol, carbine, mid, rifle and extended. For example, a standard m4 type 16" barrel will most frequently have a carbine length gas system, which would require a handguard in the neighborhood of 7" (from the front face of the upper receiver to the gas block shoulder). This link may help you out some if my explanation was unclear:

 This is why I don't understand the craze. Yes its a slippery slope letting the ATF ban things and its the principle of the thing blah, blah, blah. I don't even like shooting it cuz it can tear up some of my steel targets, and I shoot SP or HP hunting anyway. Ban doesn't affect me too much 




 I was talking more about the accuracy. Actually if you shoot someone with a fmj 5.56(as is commonplace for military and police) its going through and through, small hole. 9mm is much bigger and I believe police commonly use hollow points which expand and create a much bigger wound. 
























 Some universities with an engineering school have a "baja race" team, where they design and build a little buggy from the ground up. That might be a place to start. Look it up and see if your school has a team in Baja SAE, I think they call it... 









 Check out the clarks custom guns carbon fiber free float tube. It's about as light as you can get and pretty simple installation. Granted the carbon fiber look isn't for everyone... 




 Check out the addicted offroad tube bumpers. It's what I'm into this week.... May be big plate bumpers next, who knows? 




 looks sharp, clean as hell. just need a nice bumper for it 




 makes me wanna get my CMP on 




 I've got a '91 z28 convertible, 5.0 auto, red ext. red int. May not be everyone's cup of tea but damned if I don't love the ol gal. I always remember it as the first "cool" car I got to drive. Beautiful vehicle you've got there, brother. 
























 I called and spoke with toyota. A Toyota official recall never expires, limited repair campaigns do. The frame rust issues were a recall, and thus should never expire. As I understand it. I had my frame undercoated just this past year, well past April 2012. 




 I agree with you for sure, love that low end. I'd love to see that little turbodiesel they've got in Australia make its way into the U.S. But yeah the frame can be a problem. Took mine to the local stealership this year and they did a full inspection. Ended up getting a new undercoat on toyota's dime. 




 My girl's a 4x4, but I'm glad to see there's some other 1st gen enthusiasts around, too good a truck not to have some fans 




 Well I can't speak to that, but they certainly are a lot bigger. I always liked my truck cuz it seemed a little smaller than the big three, but now I've got tacos looking down in my windows...manhood takes a shot... 




 2000 Tundra SR5, little spacer lift the old man put on when he bought it a 7k miles, I just rolled over 190k this week. Daily driver, but works well as a hunting and farm truck too, hauls the shit outta hedge posts. 









 Yeah reach out to the national baja SAE folks and maybe some of the advisors/instructors in mechanical and civil engineering if your school offers those specialties. Or even contact some other schools and ask how they got theirs started. 
























 Shrockworks. Addicted Offroad. CBI Offroad. Those are some of the bigger ones I've seen. 




 I feel like that might even be the safe bet. Rebuild the motor how you like and never worry about it again.  




 What a steal. All I can find around central Illinois is $3000 rustbuckets 




 jealous bro. I'm hunting for one for a good summer project. looks like a nice find, congrats. 




 You missed a spot. Something blue on the door. 




 You poor bastard lol I'm lucky mine hasn't gotten to that point yet. Yet. 




 Oh I know, mines starting to bubble over the rear wheels. Tossing around the full bedliner treatment but I love that red too much... the woes of toyota ownership... 
























 $31 a box on their website, but if I have to start reloading maybe a grendel isn't the round for me 




 I'd love to get into a grendel. Any tips for that? Reloading a must? 




 Honestly I think you can get new Core M4s for in the neighborhood of $600. Another prolly $100 in the shitty bushnell scope. All the other stuff has been traded around one way or another so I couldn't really say 




 God damn I guess you do lol 




 Core M-4 with a bushmaster varminter 20" fluted barrel I traded my m4 profile for, recycled A2 handguard and stainless railed gas block from an AR-10, green A2 stock and rifle buffer I traded a CTR for and a hogue grip a buddy wasn't using anymore. Cheapest ammo I can find. My folks were generous and got me the Monarch 3 binos for xmas. Gotta love college.  









 I loved the JP brake I had on my model 700 .308. I can't speak for the person sitting next to me, but let me just say with the large frame model from JP it felt like shooting .223. Expensive, but buy with confidence, they make an excellent product. 
























 Real short, cuz I'm so infatuated with the idea of holding a lot of liquid fuel in the FAT wings. I wish there were a separate oxidizer tank that you could add to offset that a little bit 




 Sometimes I feel like it isn't KSP if everything works like it's supposed to 




 Rapiers for sure, six of em. I finally learned that if you get up to about 12km and really start hauling ass with an air breathing engine you can get into orbit with a lot less rocket fuel 




 First successful SSTO scanner spaceplane, stock parts. Fuel capacity alterations to come. Any suggestions? Similar builds? 









 So down 




 An object in motion tends to stay in motion unless acted upon by an external force. The primary forces that would affect you on earth, gravity and drag due to atmosphere, are greatly diminished and not present, respectively, in orbit.  
























 Thanks for giving my research some direction. My grandmother's grandfather would certainly have been born in the 1800's, but after seeing the pistol I figured it was WW1 Era or later. Cool piece of family history but I doubt it's worth much. 




 Grandmother says this revolver was owned by her grandfather. It's a US Revolver Co. .38 S W 5-shot top break revolver with pearl-looking grips. It's not in immaculate condition but I'd love some more information if any revolver guys could help me out. I have the serial number as well but I'd rather not post that so publicly.  









 I mean, as far as I can figure, you'll spend $200-300 in a decent barrel. Gunsmithing work is up for debate but from the prices I've seen around, installation and truing would put you in the $600-700 range total. And wouldn't you rather add to the collection anyway??? 




 Well in that case it might be a good idea to call an experienced riflesmith and see what they have to say on the subject. Good luck though, we'd love to see the progress 




 Not much personal experience with such major gunsmithing, but I'll offer this: if the accuracy of the T3 from the factory is even remotely satisfactory, just sell your rifle and buy another one in your chosen caliber. There's a lot of work and money that would go into changing calibers. Certainly more money than purchasing a T3, especially if you'd add the funds gained from selling your current rig. Do with that what you wish, just my $0.02

 Backstory: I'm in the funeral home for my grandfather's visitation. This nightmare fuel is hanging on the wall outside one of the rooms. This would be the funeral director, and the dog that he presumably uses to lure people to the well in his basement. 









 Hey you know if you're made of money you could check out the proof research carbon wrapped barrela. As I understand it they're a lighter profile stainless barrel wrapped in a carbon sleeve to maintain rigidity under sustained fire.  




 Well that's good to know. All you hear around is "you gotta do shocks and springs for a bigger bumper." Good to get some first hand experience 




 did you have to get beefier front springs to compensate for that bumper? 




 Let's have the story on that tundra. My first gens in line for some upgrades. 




 No response given, although the $40 has been taken out of my bank account. I'm not incredibly happy, but maybe they've just taken the week after the fourth off? Not sure, out of ideas. 




 Email sent. I'm just kinda frustrated since I ordered a sling from vtac at the same exact time and its here already, whereas the wrap seems to have not even been shipped yet. Granted VTAC is in TN not out west. 




 Yeah I thought the same thing, but I pulled the trigger anyway. Late night purchases and whatnot... 




 Yeah I was thinking give them till the end of the week. Given the wrap was $19.95 and shipping was $20 I'm just a little impatient. 




 So after seeing an interesting handguard wrap on here a while back, I did some research and found out it's temperature protective handguard wrap, manufactured by Orca Arms. I ordered this product on July 2nd, granted it was 11pm here in Illinois, they're on the west coast. It's now nearly a week later, and I've received nothing since the order confirmation email. Am I too accustomed to my Amazon prime 2-day guarantee? Or is this something I should be contacting them about? Anyone had dealings with this company before? (Link for those interested)

http://orcaarms.com/index.php/tactical-gear/t-r-a-p-temperature-reduction-and-protective-wrap.html

UPDATE: I just sent an email to Orca Arms politely inquiring as to whether they were perhaps out of the office over the holiday and asking about the status of my order. 

UPDATE 2: 7/10/15, no response to my email thus far, no further shipping info sent. Frustration intensifies.

UPDATE 3: 7/10/15, gave them a call this afternoon. Fellow on the other end says he was not sure why it hasn't shipped but assured me they'd get it in the mail and send a tracking number this evening. Hopefully can chalk this one up to a simple misplaced box. 




 Yeah I'm aware of the distinction. I doubt I will shoot it anyway. Might have it checked out to see if it's mechanically sound and then just put it up as a conversation piece.
