 not sharp

What do you mean it's not sharp? 

 b w for no reason. F

It is B W, because I think that the picture looks a lot better as in color.

 Just FYI, because I needed to lookup by myself: 400F is about 200C; 420F is about 215C.

Thanks for you being so kind and sharing this with us!

 I know already that IPv6 won't influence my ping. The routing of my IPv4 traffic is different from my IPv4. 

My IPv4 traffic is routed through the DS-LITE Gateway of my ISP and not directly. 
Because of this I don't have a dedicated IPv4 address myself, I'm sharing my IPv4 address with a lot of other users. 

This in turn means that at evening, were more people are using the internet connection, the connection to the DS-LITE Gateway is a little bit jammed, but my IPv6 isnt at all (because it would directly connect to Smite). 




 Hi!

Does smite natively support IPv6? I'm asking, because I wont get no real IPv4 address anymore from my ISP. He only gives out IPv4 via DS-LITE (Carrier Grade NAT). The main disadvantage is that every evening my IPv4 ping raises to about 150ms, but my  IPv6 ping is steady at about 20 to 30 ms.

 The abandoned playground ship was found in a abandoned zoo.  




 Thanks for your answer! 
Shooting from a lower point was unfortunately not possible, because I was not able to get into the ship (I'm to tall for playgrounds I think :D). I shooted from a window like the one you can see on the opposite so I was not even able to get the support column out of the way

I'm looking for someone that could add the first doctor of the current series (Christopher Eccleston) and the latest (Peter Capaldi) in the same way as Mat Smith and David Tennant are in this picture. 




 Thank you for the kind tip. I will try the program :)

 Wenn du nicht willst, dass dein Trackingcode von anderen benutzt wirst httest du ihn vorher heraus lschen sollen.

 Danke! 





























 It's from an zoo in germany that got abandoned like 5 to 10 years ago. It got abandoned, because the tenant had not enough money to pay the rent and the landlord was not willing to lower the rent. The zoo itself was first focused on birds and later it developed to a adventure zoo. The terrain itself is about 17ha (about 170,000m or 1. 829.864 feet)

 I shot it with *f*/8.0 at ISO 100 and 8 seconds exposure time. It was already after 10pm so where was no way arround shooting with such a long exposure 
























 Not exactly. It was build, in WW2, as a bomb shelter.
