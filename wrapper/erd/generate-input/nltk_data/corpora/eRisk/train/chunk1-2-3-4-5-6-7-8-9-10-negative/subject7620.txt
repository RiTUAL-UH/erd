  Forget the tax aspect, and ask a less fortunate freind if they could use a car.If they say Yes, just give it away and you earn some respect in your comunity. If they say no just junk it for weight. Either way you will do better than getting involved with the Gov. or bogus charities. 




 SUHWEEET! 




 Large knife a swiss blade mated to a handlle I whittled from the branch of a chesnut tree. Two hidden pins On the inside are sawed ends of drill bits. Raw hide wraps on the out side.Crack in the handle came from throwing this into the kitchen wall about  1000 times,balace is perfect.
Small knife is an old hacksaw blade worked with a file and the handle whittled from a 100 year old maple that blew down in my yard.One hidden pin sawed from a drill bit and the bolster is cast like an old time knife but with epoxy and coal dust for color. 









 You can use a hand gun against a half dozen crooks with automatic weapons and not think about  picking up the better weapon of the guy you just killed.

 Nothing to cringe at here.He is a sweet animal and well mannered.She takes him traveling with her and her boy friend and he enjoys that.As in most cases, if there is a problem it is the fault of the owner not the animal. 




 Not just the body.He built the frame,suspension and just about everything else 














 He is half German shepard and half arctic wolf. My friend has the pics of his parents and all the documentation on him.She got him from a Specialized breeder. He does not look to humans first,he goes about his buisiness until you get his attention,a definate trait of wolfs.Thanks for the interest he's not mine but he is the most awesome dog I know. 



















 You are the reason I like dogs more than people.

 Just want to add that my dream knife is a Hattori 




 Love my Douk-Douk! 




 Great post,thanks.I'm a chef and love all kinds of knives,At work I've used Dexters,Victorinox,Chicago,ect. for 35 years and I would say these are more than enough for the average person.At home I keep a set of Shuns in a bamboo "shrine" on the wall and only use them for special occasions.My workaday home knives are  kershaw Pure Komachi series.These were made in Japan and are wonderfull light duty blades but don't confuse them with Pure Komachi2 which are Chinese junk.

 Love this! 









 Nieto picnic knife.This is a cool little (about 2" closed) knife.Olive wood scales and AN-58 blades and much decorative work.Fit and finish are not perfect(slight buffer burn on the corner of one scale) but very nice.Build is very tight and solid.Edge needs a bit of stropping to shave hair.Mine came with a very tiny nick in one side of the edge but I think it was just one of those things as the rest of the knife is so tightly built.Not a deal breaker for me.Custom made collector quality? No. Cool little piece of jewelery for about $40 bucks?Oh yeah! 




 Ok,back as promised.From the top down:
Kizlyar U-5:These are hand made in Russia,my #1 favorite.
Helle HE30:This is a work of art,outstanding fit and finish.heavy duty blade is razor sharp,could stand up to hard use.
Lone Wolf U.S.45:Nice utility knife,hand checkered rosewood scales.
CRKT Fulcrum:Nice unusual knife,fun to play with.
SOG Mini Vulan:Love the look of this one,Tight build, solid lock up.
Kershaw double something:Classic pattern with thumb studs and unique single liner lock.
Nieto picnic knife:I like this little piece of jewelery,more on a seperate comment.
Kershaw Scallion:Best pocket knife ever,I use this about 500 times a day.

 As an American: Where are the hookers,crackheads and trigger happy cops? 




 This kind of nonsense really pisses me off. The use of a cutting edge is the single most important development in the history of mankind.
You can survive without fire but you cannot survive without some sort of cutting edge.Every single thing that you eat, wear or use in this world   requires some sort of knife to produce. The first pocket knife used to be a rite of passage for a 10-12 year old boy,now they are taught that knives are scary terrorist weapons  that will not be tolerated.What is the result of this nonsense? I have young nephews that know I like knives and without fail, on some  X-mas or B-day I will recieve a big scary looking mall-ninja piece of shit.I use those to chop weeds out of the yard and shake my head in sadness.

 When I was a kid in the early 70's we thought we were all cool with our CAT knives...they were junk. Turned me off to Mercator for a long Time. Looking back, they were probably  Japan imports which back then were junk. Today,Japan is the same Great Quality as the Made in the USA of yesteryear if not better.Try here http://www.worldknives.com/ I have had good luck with Linder, Nieto, and the French, Swiss and Russian companies. Anything from Seiki Japan is nice. Hope this helps. 




 Great knife for the money,very well made.Carbon steel blade takes a fine edge and is easy to sharpen,has a second detent so the blade will stop at half way closed instead of just snapping shut. Try one out and post your opinion. Thanks for the interest :)

 Another beautifull knife from Helle. Gets my vote! 




 Thanks for the interest everyone. I bought this as a show piece and would not want to ruin that beautifull polish by taking it in the field.I have used it in my kitchen though and it is razor sharp and well balanced.Finger guards? we don't need no steenking finger guards,LOL!

 All these terms are just genaric now and thrown about willy nilly. they don't really mean someone is racist or a bigot or a hater. It's just pop culture.

 It,s already happening here in the US. A few years ago there was a drought and Georgia was theatening to go to war with Tennessee over a shared lake on the border.Meanwhile the Gator-aid plant in Georgia continued to use million of gallons of water every day. It is  illeagal to harvest rain water in Colorado. Ever see a picture of the fabulous fountains in Vegas? A few miles down stream people are starving because what once was a river is now a muddy trickle. Where I live, companies are lobbying for the right to drill for gas by pumping thousands of gallons of chemicals deep into the ground and for up to  a quarter mile or so laterally.In pennsylvania, where this has gone on for a while, people can light their well water on fire and whole towns have been ruined. The gas comany will supply them with trucked in water while they drill, but after they move on they are fucked. This is just in the US,it is 100 times worse in third world countries and the propblem is not the population, it is the corperations.

 Sorry dude. 




 Good point, I too have noticed "bragging rights" syndrome.
It's usually about brands, but what really bugs me is the whole
"super steel" thing. There is no super steel,different steels are made
for different purposes, period. D2 is good for a camp knife while 
carbon steel is better for a butcher knife,VG10 holds an edge forever
but if you use it to chop wood or bone it chips and takes forever to sharpen. 440c is a good all around choice used by Buck and many
custom makers for years. If it's well made and works it's a good 
knife IMHO.

 I am inclined to agree with brightbrightfish. My grandpa came here from Germany in the 30's and while he loved his heritage he never bragged about it. He played harmonica and acordian,made willow crafts, was an acomplished wood worker in the old ways ect, but first and formost he was an American.  if anyone referred to him as a German he would let them know that he worked hard to get here and even harder to learn the language and pass the tests to become a citizen of the USA and he was proud of that.Whatever happened to that way of thinking?

 I think your dad may have it backwards,This is typical of native style construction.Where the handle and blade meet both would be notched,wrapped with whatever open on the blade end, and liquid babbit(a pewter like metal) would be poured in to form the bolster.As an after thought,I imagine this was probably learned from the pioneers as I have seen old tools put together this way.

 Music evolves first from imitation then inspiration then inovation.The blues came from African spirituals . Blue grass came from colonial spirituals.Combine them and write risque lyrics: Rock N Roll! Combine all that with a Europian accent:The British invasion of the 60's. Any musician that whines about another copying his "style" is a douch.Never heard Muddy Waters complain about other artists playing electric guitar,and never heard Hound Dog Taylor complain about George thorogood playing loud distorted slide. 




 Nasty pussy. 




 I agree.That being said, I also feel that a person buying from a breeder should also have to prove their ability to understand the needs of a certain breed and their sincerity to provide a stable home.ASPCA requires this to a certain degree,it should go double  for breeders.Too many people buy pets based on their own vanity then dump them when the responsability kicks in.

 Easy buddy! Not trashin anyones biz or Palatka itself,just a true culture shock story.I didn't name the place and there are alot of bars around there. Had some good friends there and miss alot of things about it, the prices at Millers,take a drive to Hastings and pick up free taters along the road,my friends at the Clock,the river(Georgia sucks!)Palatka song writers,pig races at the fair,tales of the Bardin booger,The Oasis(I got freinds in low places) and so on.But my original post is true,not rumor and not the only story I could have told. It's just how some people were when I lived there.


 




 I lived in Palatka in the late 80's. Was in a bar and noticed there was a drive-up window but no driveway , asked if they were putting one in. "Nah, that's where the the nagers order then they goes n sits in the barn out there."

 I love my Shuns,great steel,great looks and no heel,I hate the heel.
The handles are also a joy. Would I use my Shuns at work in a super busy 20 seat tourist town diner? ARE YOU CRAZY?! They hang on the wall in their bamboo "Shrine" and I use them for special dishes. I also love my original Pure Komachi set,cheap but very sharp and look nice.
I use these daily at home for light duty stuff. My home beater is an old high carbon forged that I had professionally reground. The point being,
buy what you like and don't listen to self professed experts,most of them are not experts.If you like it get more,If not,well now ya know.
I agree Vics are the best buy and always recomend them to my home use friends but they're not for me. "Far better than Shun for less"?
DON"T YOU BELIEVE IT! Those are German brands trying to imitate Shun. As far as the edge holding debate goes,serious Japanese chefs
sharpen their knives on a stone EVERY day. The knife I use at work?
 A gaudy tv personality signature knife that I bought on a whim and turned out to be perfect for what I need at work. Ha Ha! enjoy your Shuns!

 Saw the origanal Lynyrd Skynyrd band back in the day at an amphitheater with a huge lawn for outdoor seating.Security in those days was just some rent-a-cops to keep people from jumping over the fence.this was THE biggest party I have ever been to, probably 16 to 18 thousand people,booze,all the illicit stuff,everyone just having a rowdy good time and Skynrd were spot-on kick-ass JAMMIN!
But wait...there's more! They played just about all their stuff except Free bird and Sweet home Alabama and said good-night,crowd is really nuts with encores, lighters,(remember that?) and rebel yells.
They come back on and do a short set and finish with Free bird then say good-night again.Crowd is now going nuts again and this goes on for about 1/2 an hour, the stage is dark and people are starting to get ready to leave.A loud voice from the darkness says, "What song is it you wanna hear?"and then,dun dun dada da dun dun dada,and the stage lights up like a Christmas tree.A confederate flag big enough to cover the entire back-stage drops and they launch into Sweet home.
I have never seen anything like it, it was raining beer cans, the screaming could drown out a jumbo-jet,just...nuts. One last thing, this was in upstate NY.

 I agree with you on your comment on entry level chef knives, but would like to point out that this kid says he knows nothing about knives. A Victrorinox is good in this case,if I had a Tojiro or a Masakage back in the 70's my nickname would be Stubby and my knives would be rusted.I would advise a beginner to start mid-range and work up from there if they feel comfortable.

 I have a mini-vulcan and a topo meridian and love them both. You have to pick and choose now days as most companies have begun putting out some shit knives along side of their good ones and it is not always easy to tell which is which. 




 I noticed that every time the gov. starts trying to sell us a war, the local country radio station starts cranking out the hyper patriotic,flag waving,911, hero soldier,kick the enemies ass songs. 




 The 877-cash now song,I always sing to it. 




 High end SOG knives like the tom cat or the vulcan come with vg-10 blades and are very well built but a bit pricey.Only have one from CRKT, a fulcrum,that I bought as more of a novelty than a carry. 




 Nice! 




 Time to cash in the 401k!

 That is a very nice classic knife in good condition,You might get $40 or so for it on e-bay. A better plan would be to  store it well,keep it nice,and while you're cleaning it take the time to apreciate some fine old time craftmanship. 




 Better than calling you uncle George or Grandpa!

 I don't think you will be disapointed 




 While I agree with with Weebus that you can get sharper and better performing knives for the same or a little less money than Shuns,I wouldn't say they are vastly over-priced.It depends on what you want.Shuns are marketed toward the home user and you are paying for the look and fit and finish as well as the blade,I have a set of 6 so far and they,re all flawless and better than most crap out there. I also have a Masakage blue steel2 gyuto that puts them to shame edge-wise,same price as my biggest Shun much better blade but not as pretty and needs more care.Want a fast car that will impress people? buy an Aston-Marton.Want to go faster than every one?

 16 years old and not a single dis,dat, sup or nigga,amazing! 




 No lack of quality on this knife,it is very tight and well built. 









 Those are very nice,I'm sure they are collectible.Dollar value depends on many variables.Look on the main blades to see which company made them and google that for a start.Having the sheaths is a big plus. 




 Don't know, I got these from a flea market awhile back just to save them. I actually worked on the Cattaraugus a bit with some sand-paper but that is as far as I got. I shake my head and tear up when I look at the Puma. 




 They are  good knives and come sharp out of the box,just be aware that these are carbon steel and need a little exta care. 




 Top one is my Guy Fieri cheapo beater that I use at work,I like the design of this one. Bottom one is a Dojo brand gyuto wich is a very nice entry level Japanese style knife. 




 Two old classics ruined,such a shame. 














 It came with the knife,nice quality. 




 Very nice,440C and sharp 




 Sorry 




 What the fuck has carpet got to do with a nice knife? 




 I could be wrong but I think they were bought out by Bench Made 




 This is a well done hand made knife,blade is the russian version of 440C.
Came shaving sharp when I got it. However the link I sent you is not where I got this from and I notice that the sheath is a bit different than mine. No problems on mine at all. 




 Sadly, I don't know if these are still available new. I think Lone Wolf is part of Bench made now.

 How about gay wrestling or the gay toss at an Aussie bar? 




 Thank you for adressing my question. I was not looking for a "polished vs rough edge" debate when I made this post,just wondering if anyone has tried a different grit on each side of the edge to improve a cheap knife that will not cut or hold an edge as well as a nice knife.I have some very nice polished knives and they would fit my needs,but I will not use them at my "battle station" nor will I take the time to treat my beater as a high end blade.Once again,thank you for your input. 




 No comments on the way Masakage knives are sharpened yet,just some guy bragging. Anyone? 




 Why would you bother to comment if you did not read my question? 




 Yes it can,but a polished edge meant for chopping will not slice a ripe tomatoe as well as a rougher edge. I use my high end stuff early in the AM for prep, then when we open I throw my beater on the board and have at it. It is a cheap knife and I am looking for the best of both worids.I have made my living with knives for the past 30+ years.Am I doing something wrong? I don't think so 




 Beater means that this thing lays on my sandwich bar all day and gets shoved around and sometimes dropped. Must slice tomatoes,chop mushrooms onions   peppers,cut sandwiches ect...ect. 




 My beater knife must chop and slice equally well, plus take a major beating every day.I recently read a good article on the "toothey" vs polished debate and the author half  jokingly said  "A little toothey at the back ,and polish the rest".I thought Hmmmm?. Then I read that the guy who sharpens Masakage and other high end knives uses a different grit on each side of the blade. Has anyone tried this? any thoughts? Knife in question is a cheap German stainless blade,but a step up from the stuff from sysco ect. 




 What the fuck is a libertarian? Do you mean organized crime? 




 I agree with that 100%. It's not the working class that's breaking us, it's the greedy corps.

 I went to a free concert back in the early 90's featuring "Muddy Waters' guitar player".Was expecting an old blues man to come out and sit in a chair and play some acoustic blues.Buddy came out in a red coverall with a wireless guitar and blew the fucking roof off the place! He was out in the crowd and even up in the balconey,what a showman,been a big fan ever since.

 Then they would set up camp close to where they fell and spend months processing the meat, hides, bones, ect, ect for their own use and for trade goods. After that they would move on to find a winter camp to settle into and in the sping the cycle would begin again.Taking that much game at one time would have been a huge piece of luck and and seen as a gift from the spirits.

 I have a set of the original pure Komachi knives which are very nice light duty kitchen knives made in Japan.They were very,very popular so Kershaw decided to use cheaper steel,shitty plastic handles, move production to China and call them Pure Komachi 2. I like Kershaw knives but that was a shitty move.I would not expect much quality on these.

 Has Sony upgraded Their servers? I always watch netflix on my 360 because I don't have to wait for buffering. 




 HA HA! Hope you are enjoying this one! 




 I've been looking for a knife with very specific characteristics for a long time.First and foremost,it had to chop,slice and do tip-work all equally well.secondly,it had to be light, nimble and easy to use on the fly in a fast short-order kitchen on the 2'/10" cutting board of my sandwich bar. last but not least,it had to be under $100 and not so fancy that I would cringe to beat it up. I'm an old school chef and don't believe in cutting up tons of stuff ahead of time.I use a heavier, taller gyuto knife to make my soups and specials in the AM,then go to this as I do orders.I tried so many of my knives for this and it was always a trade off,a tad long or short, good sweet spot for chopping but no good for tip work,nice tip and belly but no chop spot.Ran across this by chance and I love it!

 I have collected knives and also used them to make a living my entire life,I'm no expert but here's my take:You can drive yourself crazy with edge theory,or any other theory for that matter.If an edge works for you it's good,period. Unless you are a world class wood carver or an internationaly acclaimed sushi chef,you don't need to inspect your blade with a microscope.I hear the same arguments about theory on ham radio,I am talking to a guy in Russia while another guy here in the US is telling me why my antenna wont work.

 Ok then,from the top down: Linder mini hunter, Nieto picnic knife, Spyderco something, Kershaw double cross and Therias   L 'econome. 




 Got it from World knives,it is out of stock now. Mabey E-Bay? 




 Don't be sorry,most of the people that would bust on you for using a good sharpener are just hipsters and fan boys. The only good hand sharpeners in the world are people who have devoted their entire lives to it. 




 As requested,I posted a short review.Thank you for your interest 




 I love that little Nieto picnic knife,comes mostly sharp,could be better. A few imperfections such as a buffer burn on the corner of one scale, and in my case a tiny nick in the edge of the main blade.Not a deal breaker for me as I can easily correct that when I get to it.Build is very tight and right,both blades walk well and have a good snap.Overall I'm happy with this knife and would buy from this maker in the future 




 That would be a  kershaw Double cross,made in Japan by Kershaws Kai division.Sadly, it and it's larger brother the double duty have been discontinued. 









 Fuck you. 




 Their high-end knives are great,the rest just so so. 




 Grew up with that nonsense,we even had "Sacred ash-trays"! 




 Sweet!

 Amen. i've been in the kitchen for years because I actually love what I do.I think some people just see it as a job and become bitter. 




 On my days off after a hard week I like to spend a few hours on video games on easy.I just want to blow stuff up, win races,kick some ass and not be challenged.It is a great way to blow off steam.

 Never went,not in debt. 




 Not sure, but the few times I've tried to get into another line of work I just found myself wandering aimlessly on weekends and holidays wondering what the fuck to do. 




 Yhea,alot of fan boy type nonsense over there. So far I'm very happy with the Richmond.Mine is a 240mm extra tall in AEB-L steel,factory edge shaved hair but dragged a bit when I tried chopping instead of my usual rocking,a few strokes on a ceramic stick did the trick.I do plan on dressing this up with some stones and strops and expect it will take a pretty sick edge that can be maintained with a strop.Handle could be a bit fatter for my taste but not really an issue with a pinch grip.One thing that really impressed me was the nice edge rounding on the spine and below the handle,you rarely see this on a sub $100 dollar knife.Bottom line,I'm happy with this knife,but the saga continues and looking at the second tab I have open,I simply must have one of those sweet looking Northwoods. 




 Ha HA! Thank you for your interest. Yes this is a different photo from the one you saw,I posted this one to FB for some freinds. One knife I use all the time at work is a (GASP!) Guy Fieri knife,a tiny step up from the white handle crap you find  in any kitchen, but the ergonomics of it are great,I love the handle, it doesn't hold an edge well, but I can give it a good edge in a hurry off the back of a plate or a steel,nothing wrong with that, and it looks good to the custumers when they they walk through my kitchen to use the bathroom.I work in a tiny and very busy diner so this is importent. The bottom two in my pic Are what I use the most when we are rocking,these sit on my sandwich board and  chop/slice onions peppers shrooms ect.. on the fly.
I like to give them fresh. I also use a Richmond Artifex for prep before we open.The top knife  is a Masakagi  and it will never see the diner,that one is a piece of art. I carry med stuff because I've had to wrap up too many kids with paper towels or whatever.Thank you again,it was good to get an intelligent response to one of my posts. 




 Recently was thrashed on another sub because I use low to mid-range knives at work and leave my good stuff home.Took this pic for FB and saw that it validates my choice. 









 Every time I'm asked for a recipe I chuckle to myself.Many years ago I asked my first boss,Mr Budini,about a recipe.He said and I quote "If ya gotta lookada recipe ya don know watta f***k ya doin,recipe for da baker ya dumb bastard!"I still laugh about that! Anyway I posted my "method" in a seperate comment,thanks for the interest! 




 I don't really use recipes or measure much but here goes,adjust amounts acording to how much you are making.Brown 2#of sausage links or rope and set aside(brown over charcoal if you want to go the extra mile!).Julienne 1/2 large onion and 2 large green peppers,chop 2 or 3 cloves garlic.Pour 2 cans stewed or plum tomatoes into a bowl and crush with your hand,(I prefer stewed).Saute' onions garlic and 1/3 of the peppers until nice and brown,deglaze the pan with beer,wine,water,whatever,cook of excess liquid and add tomatoes.Chunk up the sausage and add that.Simmer for 2 hours then add Italian spice to taste(I like a little cayanne for some back bite),and the remaining peppers.Simmer 1  more hour or so. Can be served over pasta or eaten on rolls. Hope this helps, thanks for the interest! 




 Use stew veal instead of sausage and you have a delicious old time favorite.This was a staple in italian restaraunts years ago but I don't see it done much anymore. I just buy the bread,flour and i don't get along! 




 Sausage and peppers, soon to be served over tortellini with big slices of buttery bread. 









 Victorinox has good knives in the $50 range. 




 My favorite toy was my mutha fukin fire truck bitch! 




 A modern version of Road Rash. 




 That everything is all about money. That is the bottom line,it's pounded into our heads from childhood on. 




 I know what you mean,I used my Masakagi at work a few times and spent the whole day worrying about chipping it. 




 If $100 is too much then Victorinox for about half that. 




 These are all $100 range and very nice. Richmond Artifex 240mm, Shun Sora 200mm and Kanetsugu Pro M 210mm. These are thin, (about 2mm) laser class blades with nice comfortable handles and good steel.The Shun had the best factory edge but after dressing them up on some stones they are about equal. One note, the Shun has a VG-10 edge and it is brittle, if you drop it it can break the tip.The other two are a high carbon moly stainless with the Pro M being sub zero quenched. Several months use with all three, and I can say I'm happy with all of them.

 Back in the 70's there was a helmet law protest in my home town, about 5,000 bikes showed up for this ride to the capital sans helmets. After some speeches and political stuff everyone went on a ten mile jam down the highway to a state park to party. Oh my God,kegs every where,naked people running around and general debauchery! There were several different clubs there and soon there were drag races going on the road and everyone was loving it. After a few runs the H A organized it and had guys directing traffic, flagging the racers and timing them.Then the city police showed up,guess what? They took over traffic control and let the races go on! Best day ever untill some asshole threw a bottle at a cop car and it all ended in a cluster fuck. 




 Dam! I've been wasting pancake mix all these years! 




 I use my good stuff at home. 




 HA HA! I am drunk now and your comment is making me laugh! If I treated my dick like my good knives I would be fucking high end classy girls. If I treated it like my beater,good lord, who knows what would happen! Thank you for your input and interest! 




 Ever see a kid cut herself real bad on a can lid or whatever,and the "First aid" box is empty as it always is?  




 Good comment,I understand super glue, but cornstarch?? Please inform me. 




 I work in a one man kitchen that can get insanely busy and there is not always time to worry about knife care.That is why I keep a beater knife around. 




 In that time I have chosen 3 knives that get the job done at work and my high end knves stay home. 




 Hey you never know when you might cut your dick! 




 For those interesed,Top is a Richmond 9 1/2" Artifex I use when I have to do a large amount of prep.Middle is a(GASP!) Guy fieri knife I use as a beater,I can throw it around, drop it whatever, doesn't chip or break and the shit steel will take an edge off the back of a plate or a steel.Bottom is an 8" Shun Sora that cuts like a laser. I use this on station while doing orders. Don't really need tongs,spoon,ect...as I gave up saute and night shifts years ago. I'm a chef in a small diner and my work is mostly soups ,stews and specials. First aid stuff because every kitchen should have that. 




 HA HA! I used to work with a tongs in pocket guy,we called him greasy ass! 




 Nope,that's my beater. No way I'm using a $150 Masakage in a 100mph kitchen. 




 Yhea I know,I take alot of shit about that but it's comfortable,takes a working edge off of anything and I can beat the shit out of it. 




 Fuck you noob,I've been in the kitchen longer than microwave ovens. 




 Just basic first aid stuff. 




 I love that little guy! Kind of brittle though,I've had to re-grind the tip twice. 




 Nah,but we have kids working here and there is never a band-aid when you need one. 




 Octopus and minnows and some weeds from out back,YUM! 









 This is so fucking old I saw it in readers digest long before the internet.

 Nope,(pulls out giant Bowie) now that's a knife! 




 My response was,"Yup and you could squash alot of people with your truck,but that's not what it's made for." 




 Show boss my Kershaw scallion,"Oh, you could stab alot of people with that." 




 Dude,you're the cook fer chrisakes!If a server gives you shit,give that person a nice HOT plate once in a while or make their order vanish and claim they forgot to give it to you.If a fellow cook gives you shit,give that person a tap on the hand with your Hot spat,pan, whatever and say"Oh, sorry asshole". 




 Not really.if the knife starts to drag, a few strokes on medium then fine put it right.That is for good steel. When my beater(soft steel) starts to drag,It will take a working edge on just about anything.That is why I use both.This is maintence,all knives need to be sharpened on stones at some point, and questions abought stones and burrs are better asked of someone more informed than I am. Thanks for your interest!  




 It's a ceramic rod that I use for the for the beater knife in the middle,the other two I just strop now and then.

 Very nice! 




 My small town is home to a major hospital and due to my wifes condition we are there quite often .There are  trash cans labled do not touch-bio-hazard in the hallways. They are filled with the sheets and bedding of sick people. Of course the people that change the bedding do not have to wear gloves' and then they go and push elevator buttons,door knobs...ect. 




 Pisses me off, They treat us like shit,  but the scumbag suppliers can have rats and disease running around the wharehouse because they pay off the  politicicans. 




 Wear gloves to serve food,customer then picks up condiment containers touched by the last 50 people before him or her and eats. The whole idea is stupid. 




 The town I grew up in slowley died. 




 Complicated but here goes...Corupt politicians,Wall street and large corps. basicly drove the local manufacturers out of buisiness.Ocar Meyer, Amour, Bush, Bud, Miller are a few culprits I can pull off the top of my head.They all got tax breaks, excused from quality control,got around labor laws,had excessive requirements  pushed into law that small companies could not afford and the regulators of these laws actually work for these corps.The result was that all the local manufacturing was devasted,the plants were closed and the respected brand names sold off to the corps.. Now with so many people hurting what should we do? Why we start importing tons of second rate shit and add that to our rat infested diseased food products that are made by under paid imported labor,then we open a super store! Why would anyone shop there? Because we spend all the money we saved on quality and labor and spend it all on media adds telling people they are stupid if they pay more and they will be much happier if they save save save! and of course out of work people do need to save.Sorry rambeling here,I just get so pissed. And now I must give credit where credit is due: The man who founded Walmart recognized the needs of the community and workers and Walmarts original plan was to treat the workers very well,which they did .When they opened a dist. center up here in NY back in the 90's they offered great pay and great benefits and I knew alot of people who left their job to go there.Unfortunatley the founder died soon after and the first thing to go was the benefits,then the pay, then the time worked so you could get unemployment when they laid you off for the slow season. 




 Sears is a very old and once well respected company based on quality, convenience and cutomer service, so yes, if you got it from sears you knew it was good.I do my laundry in a Kenmore washer made about 40yrs ago,sadly that name no longer means what it used to. 




 Better quality products, more variety,more and better places to shop and a better local economy.Low prices are because they buy the cheapest junk possible in huge bulk lots.A kid could start as a stock boy in a local store, stay with the same store his whole life and make a decent enough living to support a house and family.He would then spend his money at his and other local stores thus helping other kids to do the same,pretty good concept.

 My last comment on this is that I know skilled line chefs that went to culinary school and take the job seriousley and don't make 15 an hour. 




 But you don't have to stay there,learn and move on. 




 So true. Where I work is low pay but we get tips and we are huge busy. Dumb fuckin assholes are too stupid to realise that what they make is up to them. They fuck off, go out to bars and spend all their money,then bitch to the boss that "I make so much more" because I keep a car on the road and pay my bills. 




 True,all the more reason to man-up and move on.

 These people are scripted actors and actresses, the goal is to keep people enraged and divided so they won't wake up and turn on the  scumbags who are bleeding us like vampires.

 Never owned an apple product but yes,they seem to rely more on image and  social engineering  than quality of product. I do love the WOZ, that man is true. 




 Good call. You may start with a shit job, but you learn from it,then apply that to a bit better job and so on.  




 "Eeeasy big fella." Hoss from Bonanza. 




 OK, I'm not a great fisherman but I do know some things.If you want big ass lake trout you need to find a COLD lake that is very deep. Rainbows and browns can be found in streams and creeks with cold runoff,look for deep holes in the bed or undercut banks. Small mouth bass like cold water and stone bottoms with good current ,same like trout they like cover. Large mouth bass,oh yhea the big boys,like warm water and lots of cover,think lilly pads. The south has the biggest.Pan fish: blue gills, crappy,sun-fish. Pretty easy but if you find some clear water and can see a cleared off circle on the bottom that is their nest and just a hook will do to entice them into attacking.Cat fish like warm rivers or at least a current and are bottom feeders. Hope this helps.

Get letter saying that I now owe $400 because of late fees.Pack up all my paper work and go to bank,call them on all their bullshit and no manager would show his/her face. Get letter with a deposit slip forged in my name for the amount they claimed I owed them.

 Back in the 80's my girl and I needed to get out of the coke scene and got a guy to back us as vendors on the Dead tour,no shit! Did pretty good selling beer and french toast off a coleman grill. Ran out of money in Boston and caught a ride down south with a Hells Angel.Car broke down in Maryland and stayed there 2 years working on a camp ground and bought a camper to live in and a car.Got sick of that and loaded everything including my new dog Willy into the car and headed to Fla. with $200 .Got there and set up on a camp ground and had a hard stretch to find work but made it,first into a trailer then  rented a decent house.Back up here since 91 and still with my girl,those were the best years of my life.If you have a job skill and and a set of balls, tits  whatever I say go for it,you might surprise yourself.

Nice fit and finish and the distinct handle gives you a fist full of nice knife.Lovin em,oh yhea saya included.

 Retard 




 Yeah, I am of the same opinion.Just to be clear,I was not looking for advice on what knife to buy for my one and only,just input on this kind of knife/steel from people who actually use them day to day.I have been cooking and collecting knives for decades and if there is one thing I've learned it's that there is no one knife to rule them all.I kind of just "Buy em and try em". The FKMs look real nice  and Mark Richmond gives them a great review,I will make it a point to try one. One question, in the reviews it says they have a 70/30 grind how does this affect sharpening? 




 Thanks for your interest. I already have the 210 and like it alot,the handle is really comfortable and the blade takes well to stropping.These are cryo treated and I would guess about 59r. and a little less brittle than Vg10. 




 Thanks for the input,it was acually a toss up between this and Tojiro. I went with the Pro M because I like the handles and the less chippy steel. 




 OK,http://www.japanesechefsknife.com/ProMSeries.html#ProM I have taken a likeing to these.

 Actually, benchmade uses FRN on some of their knives.

What makes Benchmade so much higher quality other than the name? Forget the fan-boy stuff,you are only limiting yourself on what knives you use and enjoy.

 I got one of these last month and put it on the edge-pro at 15 degrees,very sharp but still dragged a bit.Yesterday I decided to try something  else,stropping with 400 then 1200 sand paper on a mouse pad followed by a regular stropping progression on leather then balsa wood.Worked nicely so I called it a day and sat down to browse Reddit where I saw this post,small world! Took it to work today and while it's no laser,and I,m no expert, I sure perked it up. Enjoy!

 Give it all away to a new guy that deserves it, If you feel you are going to die.Fuck the family,they don't deserve it,I know mine don't! 




 Nope,just an American cook who respects his mentors 




 Yes they are,I put them on all kinds of soups and stews and mostly chili. 




 Fuck you,I love my dog. 




 I use it to clean up racks of ribs ect. 




 I drink at home and buy new knives to play with. 














 Stupid kid put a shotgun under his chin and missed,blew most of his face off and lived. Him and his mother then went on a media campaign to sue the rock band that he claimed made him do it. 




 It finally let me rant about my real hatred of the Swiss,those watch making army knife toting bastards. No one cares about that! 




 Well said. 




 Apparently Larry Flynt has fallen on hard times. 




 Dam that water's cold. Yeah deep too! 




 Baths. Instead of a quick shower I always get up early and soak in a nice hot bath with my coffee. 




 As an American I would say that it is a ploy based on old-time values that people use to try to appear more respectable.This is why the Gov. will ban certain words and body parts from television, but will take money from companies to allow the barrage of condom,dido,sex oil,phone-sex and viagra ads that any kid watching TV is sure to see. 




 True for some,for some others I would call in the whole flock. For the select few I would call in the raptors. 




 Theme song from Looney-toons. Dididaa, dididaa, dats all folks! 




 June Cleaver talking jive!!! 




 Love you Jimmy,you were my big brother,parent and closest sibling. 




 With that one ear up,I would say "Radar" 




 I live in up state NY and anything I have ordered from these sites was here in three days.  http://www.japanesechefsknife.com/default.html  http://www.chefknivestogo.com/ 




 How do you like that Takamura? I have one and call it my little hot-rod. 




 Ok Carrie! 




 Green chromium oxide paste(about 6,000 grit) followed by 1 micron diamond paste. 




 Was bored and just used what i had laying around,works fine. 




 Sharpens covex edges. 




 The Fonz. 




 Jive turkey. 




 Fresh water. 




 Nice dress! It would look great crumpled up on my bedroom floor! 




 dollar bills glued to craft foam and magnet backing, loaded with stropping compounds to maintain a convex edge. 









 Two of my best knives have convex edges. wanted to keep that.here is what i came up with. thin craft foam from dollar store,plus cheap magnet  backing from dollar store, plus dollar bills. Glue them together and add stropping compounds.seems to work quite nicely and much cheaper than special mediums that you see advertised.. 









 This comment gives me an idea of your age and  and i say again,get a life learn your trade.  




 Thank you! 




 Whenever I run out of salt or sugar I always look in the bottom of my knife bag to  see what I can use,NOT! I hate you health dept. zombies. Get a life,learn your trade. 









 The Takamura is a very high performance knife although the blade could be a bit taller and the handle a bit beefier IMHO.It is my"good boy" knife and cost almost twice what the others did. For most general kitchen work all you really need is a chefs knife and a paring or utility. 




 Custom made with classy rose wood handle and R2 blade,that steel is awesome. 




 Kanetsugu ProM 240mm,Takamura R2 210mm,Fujiwara 210mm carbon,Kanetsugu ProM 210mm,Shun Sora 210mm and Richmond Artifex extra tall 240mm AEB-L steel. 




 I use the 240's for prep when I make soups,stews, specials,ect.. the Pro M seems to be the better one for meat,the Artifex is a bit sticky in that regard. The 210's I love equally,each has its own merits and draw backs.Kind of hard to explain but someone who makes  a living with knives would understand. 









 Um...honey? about the 401k... 




 "tobacco" haha! 




 Yeah, 210mm. I actually chose this one because of the recommendation you gave Fujiwara on one of my previous posts.I wanted to try a patina on a carbon knife I could use at work,but didn't want to screw up an expensive knife. Real nice factory edge and a bit of stropping has it razor cutting the loose ends of my hair. Back to work tomorrow and can't wait to try it. 




 The parts about knives and inefficiency were spot on.

 YAY! I'm in! 




 Never really watched him until I saw the video of him boning out a chicken a few weeks back, wow! I just got one his books but haven't read it yet.I like the way he focuses on technique  witch is how I was trained. 




 I have spent my whole life cooking on this concept.Never went to school and was lucky to train under some old school Euro chefs. My food doesn't win awards, but when the contest is over the chefs and judges come to me for their meal. I have asked friends many times, What are the best fundamental dishes of your life? Invariably, their response goes back to food prepared by a mother, a grandmother, a father, an aunt, or some other relative or friend. A main ingredient of those preparations is the love with which they are prepared. Those early tastes remain with you for the rest of your life. I stole that quote from the article but it is true,and I have made a good living on this concept. 









 Thanks for the interest. http://www.chefknivestogo.com/takamura.html    http://www.chefknivestogo.com/mamigy21.html 




 If you have money they give you some drugs to ease your guilt,if not you go to jail and those are the ones you hear about. 




 HAHA! 




 Your dad is fucking with you.ps... your dad is awesome. 




 Anyone who posts stupid political propaganda on FB,it used to come in my e-mail years ago and i had to nasty-gram the dumb fucks! 




 Catch EM and Kill Em, I say. these sick fucks have been around for centuries, have their own secret societies, and are so entrenched that they are accepted in politics,religion and money circles. 




 Free pussy! 














 you get the day off and everyone talks good about you for a week or so. 




 Try Jersey.
 




 Humbly glad to offer my services. 




 Whenever we get a new one I like to put it on my head and staat talkin all rasta mon! 




 Look at the bright side,if you marry the girl you will always have something to hold over your annoying mother in law! 




 I live in a tourist town and every summer I see these douche bag families...Red Hummer with custom wheels parks in 2 spaces,plastic hair fake tan designer dad gets out followed by giant phoney boob Peg Bundy over the hill street walker edition mom, and of course the tween age daughter is dressed like they are trying to sell her on the Arab sex slave market.People actually raise their kids like this! FTW! 




 If I were the leader of a religious chef cult, this picture would be on the cover of my pamphlet about where good chefs go when they die. 




 I,m sure youtube has something about that. 




 No it's not, this is how city folk raise their kids now days. Makes me sick. 




 http://www.chefknivestogo.com/takamura.html 




 Thats a new one for me,thanks! 




 http://www.chefknivestogo.com/takamura.html 




 Yep! Otb edge razor cuts the loose ends of my hair and shaves translucent slices from a free standing tomatoe, mabey just a bit of stropping after a few weeks. 




 Takamura. 




 Sweet! 




 What kind of parent brings a pre-teen to hooters? 


































 They sell these where I live in upstate NY, but they say "Tourist hunting permit". Much funnier IMHO. 




 Love your style;) 




 Shuns paring knife is very highly rated among pro chefs,good choice.For a chef knife however i would suggest something like this for someone new to Japanese knives http://www.chefknivestogo.com/fu18gy.html . This will save you some  money and hold an edge better than a German knife while being less prone to chipping or tip breaking while you get used to the thin blade and steep edge bevels of these knives. Use the Germans as the work -horses and the gyuto for things like slicing and dicing softer veggies and boneless meats. Warning: the first time you slice a ripe tomato and don't see any juice on your board, you may fall in love with these knives. One last thing,learn how to strop,you won't be sorry.
 




 I have never heard of a face being called a money maker.

 Apparently not,that is a girls bike. 




 Douche bag city tourist family in small town diner. Parents let the little kids run wild all over the place,drinking creamers and eating jelly pacs,tripping up the server and disturbing all the customers.Dad is very rude and demanding to the waitress and while she is still standing there, lectures 10 year old son that this is "Recognizing your station in life" . 




 I don't see what the big fucking deal is. If a sub offends you, don't subscribe to it and you won't see it.

 So every time a car in the opposing lane splashes mud or slush on my windshield I'm supposed to pull over to clean it? You are a dumb-ass. 




 Smell of fresh ground coffee makes me tear up remembering my late wife. 




 Hope this goes viral,Cuban kid trumps Star Wars kid IMHO. 




 When I was young,stores could be open on Sunday,but only certain sections, (food,personal care,clothing). As my dad put it,"You can buy a shirt but not a damn hammer." I always thought that was just a bunch of stupid nonsense and was glad to see these laws go,alcohol being the last one. 




 Reeses,take a bight then a sip of coffee and gently swish in mouth like wine tasting

 OP is a fag. 




 Best post I've seen in a while,thank you! 




 In the days when phones were attached to the wall,I picked up the phone to call my friend and he was already on the line. Neither of us heard any ringing. 









 Not to much actually, the big one was $35 and the little one was around $80. To be honest I haven't done any serious sharpening with these,I just play around stropping on them for edge upkeep and they do fine with that although the course one won't cut the super steels very well,(vg10,R2). I guess the trick to nats is to keep the slurry washed off until you get the edge and and then let it build up and thicken as you keep working with less and less pressure, that way one stone is multi grit. One day i will find the patience to try this. For actual sharpening I have a couple Shapton bench stones and an edge- pro, easy peasy quick and easy. Got the nats from CKTG and at those prices I'm sure they are not top of the line,but it's a start. 




 Goko 240 white#1 custom and kohetsu 210 AS. Stones are J-nats with the large one being medium grit and the smaller one extra fine. The Goko is a real beast,drops through product like nothing I've ever seen and I have a number of good quality gyutos.

 That is not a rat rod,that is a nice restoration of an old model A flat head v-8. 




 My go to has always been watching how they handle the tools:if they use a spatula like they are poking a lizard with a stick,grabbing a bread, or worse yet,steak knife to use on the sandwich bar or pulling a pan off the heat to flip the meat, forget them. 




 Maybe we could get Good Will to put those big metal boxes around in parking lots so we could donate this stuff to unfortunate people who have no knives. 




 Yes it was,you reminded me of all the crap I've gotten on x-mas and b-days over the years,too funny! 









 :) 




 Yea,that's a really nice find.There is something warm and comforting about those old tube radios. when I was little my night light was the tubes in an old Sylvania receiver. Good luck with it. 




 There is a HUGE collectors market for Halicrafters,I'd bet it is still worth something even for parts. 




 Fire Fly...It's about time and I can't believe this hasn't been thought of before. 




 That is one sweet looking old radio. Clean it up and see if it works,then google it to find out if it has collector value.

 15 years ago I found a job at a small diner in a busy tourist town. One cook one server start at minimum and split tips 50/50. I'm still there ,have a 4 day week, and make more than the poor bastards putting in 60 hours at the fancy places. Best move I ever made. 




 Spoken like a true Murray Carter fan,nice! 









 Ask this question on R/knives as there are some very accomplished sharpeners there.

 Feels fine for what it's made for which is an office or dress type knife.

 Thought the tip would be delicate but it's pretty beefy. 









 With kitchen knives at least, a dull blade will tend to turn the product you are trying to cut and drag your fingers under the blade. 




 I have been using green (chromium oxide) compound on my work knives for quite a while now with great results,cheap and can be found at Ace or where ever. If you want to go further and have money to burn, try here. http://www.chefknivestogo.com/strops.html . 1 micron diamond paste on balsa and I can razor cut the loose ends of my hair.

 Here in the north east it used to be much worse. Up until the early 60's if you even found a store open on Sunday, certain sections would be dark and roped off because as my dad explained it,"You can buy a shirt, but not a goddam hammer." Only food or personal items in other words. Thankfully blue laws and pay-toilets have long been just a bad memory in NY state.

 Correct on all counts. Stones are J-nats that I got from CKTG. Naturals are usually hideously expensive but these two plus the nagura came to just over $100,not bad. The large one is low grit and the small one is a very hard high grit finisher. I figured that if I'm going to learn free hand sharpening I might as well start the old fashioned way.

 Be thankful your boss is not like that. My boss not only makes the crew portion soup into little plastic microwave containers,it has to be weighed on the scale.She can not understand that a bowl only holds so much and ladles have numbers for a reason.

 I'm so old that I remember the "Blue laws". If a store was open on Sunday,certain sections would be roped off and kept dark because you could only buy food, clothing, or personal care items.
