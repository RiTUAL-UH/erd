 Also tiger  




 NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
 Oda you magnificent bastard! You give us this awesome chapter and then a break for next week. 

NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!




In the meantime ALL ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN! 
























 What a truly fucked up scene. Now I just want to wipe the tears from my eyes, go hug my daughter, and tell her that I love her and Stannis can go get fucked. Theon style.  




 I look at it like the tiger could be a light, quick type attack whereas the lion, crocodile, and ape are the power house type of attacks.  
























 For science!  





























 What a waste of water. Sweet slice though.  




 TRIGGER WARNING  
























 For science  




 Are you lying?  
























 For research  




 As always your stories most certainly do not suck. Kudos and have an upvote.  
























 Mind = blown  




 PITCHFORKS, PITCHFORKS EVERYBODY GET YOUR PITCHFORKS!  






















































 FUCK YEAH!  





























 I literally just watched this episode. 

Damn Hooch is crazy.  














 Fantastic story, I for one would love to see where you take it.  









 Nerf guns. 


My 3 year old daughter and I love nerf guns. She has a few that she can operate on her own and I have some that I have to prep for her. 

We have a hall way with the air intake on the ceiling and it's extremely fun to watch her shoot a balloon that is stuck on it. 

Also cooking with your little girl is one of my favorite things to do. Nothing too complicated, but just enough so that she is learning and feels like she helped. 

Wednesday night we cooked pancakes and I mix everything in a blender.  Her job was to press the buttons. The way her face lights up brightens my day. 

Pixar movies are also a great bet.
