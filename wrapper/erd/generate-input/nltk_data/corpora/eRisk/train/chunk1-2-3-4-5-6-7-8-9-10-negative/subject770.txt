 I have 1 friend I met trough gaming wich i still have contact with but we have met irl and have different stuff to talk about besides gaming, so that is no problem. And yes, some of my friends game and I have no problem with them gaming when I'm around, however, I will always stay on the background instead of joining in (In a FIFA competition on ps3 by example) 




 These are actually really good questions to ask yourself if you're afraid you might have a computer problem, thank you! 




 I never said that drugs and gaming are the same thing, drugs are bad, very bad, they destroy people's life so often while gaming is entertainment, so many people enjoy it. How could it be the same? Well, it can destroy lives aswell, believe me. Not in the way drugs do but in more subtile forms, you start to ignore the ones you love, they get frustrated.. You become unhealthy, hardly see people.. This of course will not happen when you are a casual gamer and there is nothing wrong with that, I cannot stress that enough. But there are times where it goes way beyond that, where you really need professional help in order to get way from it's grip.

This seems very weird to alot of people because they assume you can just 'stop gaming' and it's 'lack of self control'. Well, you can just 'stop drinking' too right? No.. Gaming does not indeed reward you in a fysical or material way like drug or alcohol do but sometimes, with certrain people, the rush of winning, the feeling that it gives, can be just as addicting as gambling I am sure. I'm not the worst case by far, I've seen people in the clinic go bonkers because they were denied internet access. 

I understand that all this must seems really weird for outsiders, incomprehensable even, but let me assure you, it can be really bad and it is in fact, considered a legitimate addiction by authoroties and such. 




 I would say that before anything, just like with every other addiction, you have to realise yourself that you spend way too much time on computers and need to stop. If not, nothing or nobody can help. Once you realised this it's best to seek professional advice, they will explain everything to you and then it's up to you wether to decide if you want help or not. Just one more thing, don't think 'I'm going to calm down on gaming, going to game less.' No. Just, NO. That doesn't work, you have to quit everything, cold turkey and try to last as long as possible. Because if you play 'a bit' you'll fall back into old patters before you know. 




 The irony of me doing this IAmA did not escape me either :) 




 There are alot of people who think the same as you, so did I actually. But it had been proven that you can actually be addicted to internet usage or gaming in the same way that you're addicted to by example drugs or alcohol. I went to a clinic in Holland (there aren't any (good) ones in Belgium who are specialised in this matter) where they only treat this kind of addiction, there they diagnosed me and offered to treat me but i didn't want to be internated, I wanted to get over it on my own, with the help of my doctor and parents. So far, it seems to have worked. 




 I'de have to say i was the most addicted to CoD:MW2 the most, the hours I played on that.. It was really bad. Sc2 and War of Legend (a short period, but really heavy) have been bad for me aswell. 




 Because I was going to start in Computer Science that year and I needed a good laptop to run all the software smoothly. Turns out it ran all the games smoothly aswell, not good.. And I played random so: 1/3rd For the Overmind!! I guess..:p 




 In what way do you want me to provide proof? 




 I know the feeling all too well. I think something along those lines would have applied to me aswell. Luckely, I liked sleep too much to actually get up early to game wich kept me atleast a bit healthy but still, it was pretty bad from time to time. There were weeks in the winter where I realised I haven't seen the sun in days, I was basically living during nightime and blocked out the little sun there was. 




 Yes I have, and I actually did. This was on my old laptop, instead of removing everything I bough a new one (an Alienware, stupid me) and told myself I wouln't install games anymore. This lasted for maybe 3 days and made me realise afterwards that I indeed have a problem.

No, I never got to GM but I've been Top-8 Masters frequently, I think I played too much CoD to actually get promoted (I was #1 5v5 in the esl for almost a year, this made me some money in online tournaments but this was more bad then good, since I used it as an excuse to keep playign since 'I made money with it') 




 Yes, it really is. This is the longest I've been on it in weeks just because I force myself to leave after 15 minutes each session. I love this site but it's so big and there's an endless flow of interesting stuff to find and peers to discuss with that if I wouldn't force myself to get off the PC, I would fall right back into my old lifestyle. But I really wanted to do this IAmA so I cut myself some slack :) 




 I don't exactly how or what made me realise I was addicted but suddently I started seeing that the people around me were right and I was actually spending way too much time gaming and on the internet and I decided that this is not the life I wanted to live. So I packed my bags and went to France for the entire summer with a few mates, spent our days surfing and such but I tried to refrain myself form any form of internet usage. When I got back I forced myself to stay away from the PC as much as possible and that's a battle with myself I still have to fight every day. And like I said, I started working, travel as much as possible, mostly for surfing. And the biggest thing probably, I found a girlfriend who lives a simular lifestyle, alot of travelling and such and that keeps me away from falling back into old habits. 




 Nee, Knokke :) 




 It's hard to tell to what degree since I always refused any kind of treatment or professional help. In the beginning because I tough I wasn't addicted at all, afterwards because I wanted to stop on my own. But it was pretty bad, I would wake up and start gaming just about untill I went to bed, the only thing I would do besides that was go out with friends or see my girlfriend, no classes, nothing. So I don't really know, pretty bad but not bad enough for me not to want personal contact anymore, or see my friend. 
For the 2nd part of the question, yes, I have experienced pain in my wrists (CoD and Sc2 aren't the most kind games for them) but they seem to have dissapeared now, thank God. 




 I didn't downvote you, it was a legitimate question, hence why I answered it. 




 Good question, this was hard at first, because every free moment I got, I felt that urge to play again. But I started working this year and have found some salvation if you like in surfing, I surf quite alot now, also got my coaching diploma. Basically, I try to occupy myself as much as possible with just about everything and it seems to work out. 




 Actually no, I have had a few good, stable relationships. I don't think I'm bad looking and have gotten quite good ad hiding my internet usage over the years. 









 yeah, I really didn't think this post trough I believe. However, it's almost impossible to keep results like this off the front page :(

 As a Protoss player, here is how I see the situation now:

 Thanks alot mate! Just don't expect too much of it ;) 




 Sent you a replay with Twitter, would love it if you got around reviewing it. I'm a bronze P player altough I consider myself slightly above bronze, somewhere around high silver I think, I just don't play enough. All my matches are against high(er) silver players. Thanks! 





























 Hi,

I used to have an iPhone 4s and all push notifications (Facebook, Twitter, Skype etc..) were delivered instantly to my phone. Same thing goes for my mails. I recently bought an iPhone 5 and made it a copy of my 4s but push notifcations come in with a great delay or not at all, untill I open the app. I also noticed I'm being logged out of apps more often.
Does anyone have an idea how to fix this? Make the notifications/messages/mails instant again? Because this is rather annoying. Thanks alot!! 














 Yes, this is the right size, thank you! Too bad the resolution isn't better but this is almost perfect, thanks alot! 




 This is in the perfect direction! Would love the resolution a bit bigger tough, using this as a Timeline Cover would look blurry. But thanks a ton already! 




 So, as mentioned, I would love to use this picture http://www.ilikewallpaper.net/iphone-5-wallpaper/Longboard-Girl/5972, as my FB Timeline Cover but it was an iPhone wallpaper so is way too high. I would love to see it/her shopped into a fitting enviroment or something, with the dimensions being good for FB. 

Thanks to everyone helping me! Willing to offer a small reward if I really like it!

 Alot of stuff on the Deep Web, in particular CP. Especially the way those people talk about kids just creeps me out, they act like it all normal.. 




 Yes, what mdbjd said was correct, Riot has been criticised often because they tend to fall back on nerfing something they feel is too strong, rather then trying to balance it in another way, making alot of the campions feel the same and damaging the diversity. 




 I have got a Razor Blackwidow and I must say, I'm extremely satisfied with it. Not because of any changes in my play really (the keyboard is of course more then perfect for gaming) but just the way it feels when you type, the sound and the feel with every keystroke, nothing comes close imo. Once you go mech, you'll never go back :) 




 So there's just a forth of a pixel? 




 Yeah, not all roles are correct, just made as an example. And you wouln't be forced to put it there but you could, if you chose so.. 




 I think this would be a gread addition because I believe lesser known streams will have a higher chance of attractiong new viewers. Say for example, I main ADC so that's what I prefer to watch. Now, none of the 'big ADC names' is streaming, what I usually do is watch someone else 'famous', wether he plays my role or not.

Now, if this were to be added, I might click a guy I never heard of before just because I'de like to learn from him, and when I like him, I'll probably come back.
So, this will, in my opinion, give more exposure to the lesser known streamers. What do you guys think?

 Hey, I mentioned, when I launch LoL server status says undefinded, however, when I check the website, it says all servers are up. Is it just me or is anyone else having this? Also, if anyone has a fix, most welcome! Thanks 




 IMPORTANT: Subtitle language can be changed in the bottom left! 









 I have a suggestion. Keep the light in order not to make things complicated but make it so then when you actually revive, it kinda looks like the Prayer-cape emote from Runescape if anyone's familiar with that. That would look so sick imo

 This.. Actually, I don't even know if I'de want to know. 
Actually, yeah I do..:p 




 Okay, I'll try to explain this the best way I can (note that English is not my native language). I've been thinking about how awesome/usefull it would be to see all the stats about your life, just for information/entertainment purposes or comparing to others. 
This would go from basic stuff like amount of food consumed, exact time lived, hours slept etc to really specific/weird stuff like times mastrubated, reddits read, high fives given..

Would love to hear you guys' opinions about this and what would be the n1 stat you want to see for your life?

 I worked in a pretty large fish-shop who sells to alot of restaurants. Whenever someone new guy came my boss would send them all the way to the ocean to go and get 'salt water for the lobster'. Everybody, and I mean everybody did this. Just imagine the hilarity when you see them coming back, dragging just gallons of seawater..:D 




 Thanks for the responses! However, I don't really follow Riot in their decision, not having a system like that just makes for the most ridiculous games form wich, imo, you don't learn a whole lot. It should be easier to, by example, tell the bots where to go from the start, so atleast you can decide for yourself in what team you want to play etc :) 




 Not a troll question, recently played a bot game again after a long time and I was surprised they still are retarded when it comes to lane mate. I made a team with me as Graves and then Sona, Warwick, Malazhar and Garen I believe. You would assume me both with Sona, WW jungle (but since bots don't 'jungle', him top with garen), and Malazhar mid.
Now, what happens when I start the game, I see Sona run top with Warwick, Malazhar bot with Garen leaving the mid lane for me.
Now my question, is it really that hard to make bots have some sense of awereness of where to go? I'm sure I'm not the only one who noticed this..

TLDR; Bot games are meant to learn noobs how to play but how can they when they don't come near real game compositions? Is it so hard to learn bots where to go? 




 Teemo is not OP, het gets countered just like any champ, quit the QQ'ing.

 Scared the crap out of me the first time they used it. I like the idea of a voice saying 'GG' at the end of a match, just not that voice.. 




 Thank you guys for all the answers, things are alot more clear now! Keep playing!:) 




 Allright, first of all, I haven't been playing this game for too long now (level 20-ish) and usually play AD carry (graves, ezreal, teemo etc..) Since the beginning I've been playing with first heal-ghost and later heal-flash as soon as I had it. Now, lately more and more people told me to switch heal for ignite. Granted, almost everyone runs ignite these days. But for me, it just doesn't seem right; I feel like as if heal helped me out loads more in games then ignite. And there are so many close call situations in wich I tough, if only i had me heal there instead of ignite. A feeling I hardly get the other way around..

Now, my question is, is it really that bad to run heal? Should I just keep using ignite till I get used to it? Thanks alot! 




 I agree, I don't want to generalise but it does seem like the majority of drama and bullshit is coming from the NA ladder and it's players. Makes me wonder.. 




 Blizzard please buff Ezreal to fix this!! 




 Why does everyone seem to dislike Teemo so much? 












































 For me it had to be when I saw this kid, must of been like 12 or something, come out of the store with his dad holding a pack of cookies. He looked really happy with them. Then he saw a homeless guy and his dog sitting near the entrance of the shop. 
He stopped, hesitated for a second and then went up the guy, giving him his cookies. He also asked if he could pet the dog, I could see the dad wasn't to excited about that but let him proceed. He then walked away with an even bigger smile, as if he knew what he had just done was nicer then wat I'de say 75% of adults would ever do.
Really brightened up my day.

 Hi,
So I recently upgraded to iTunes 11. Everything went great for a day or 2 but ever since then, iTunes just doensn't open anymore. I tried everything, re-installing, opening as admin, giving priority, deleted iTunes and all sub-components, cleaned registries and reinstalled. Same problem tough, just doesn't want to open..

When I try to launch it and have task manager open, it actually shows up in the list of processes, only to dissapear after a second or 5, never showing the iTunes screen or pictogram in the system bar. 
Could anyone help me please? Thanks alot!!

 This is actually very true, well said 




 No need to upvote, just wanted to tell this..

Important: I'm not a native english speaker and I will try to make this nuanced as possible.

IHonestly, 've wasn't a huge fan of Idra, he was once one of the best zergs out there but then eventually just got passed by others. Nothing bad there, but he kept his 'BM' behaviour and 'I'm the best out there attitude', something wich I tought was a pretty dumb thing to do with no results to back that up. I tough that he would just keep on sinking, trying to survive on the name he once made for himself. 

Now, I must say tough, I was really impressed the last few times I've seen him play on stage, he seems to have really dedicated himself on reaching the top level again. Wich was partially what made me open his stream this evening when I was bored. There, I was pleasently surprised, I found a well-playing Idra, explaing his tactics to his viewers, interacting and not calling people bad every 5 seconds. I really enjoyed it and even felt bad for him and the other viewers when he had to stop streaming because someone tought it would be funny to do the Clan Invite glitch thing.

Just an honest story I wanted to get out there.

TLDR: Idra improved and cleaned up his act imo, best of luck for him in the future.

 1. Often our team will be destroyed when an opposing Katarina is fed, I main adc and feel like there's little to nothing I can do to stop that single-handed. Is there anything I can do?

2. In most of my games I win my lane pretty convincingly but after that it feels like it's up to the team wether we win or not because often teammates lose their lane and I'm not good enough to carry by myself. As long as they don't lose, we tend to win but if they lose their I often get dived 1st thing in the teamfight by a 10-kill fed bruiser/assasin and get wrecked before I can deal dps. TLDR: How can I improve in 'carrying' my team more if I won my lane and they lost theirs?

 That, that and that girl are into you, you're into them. Make a bloody move 




 Would love to hear some opinions about this because I have pulled this trick aswell when I was younger, claiming I was sick to skip school or for whatever reason. The doctor usually came by and always declared me sick for a few days after heaving heard me symptoms and doing a brief check. Now I wonder if they knew I was faking but just played along (they got payed anyhow..) or because it's out of safety 'what if he really is sick, I don't notice it and something bad happens.

Hope this explanation makes sense, english is not my native language. Thanks for the replies!

EDIT: Holy.. Front page, thank you all! 




 Riot pls 




 So you don't want us to look yet you post it on reddit? I'm confused.. 









 Happen to know wich one that is? Thanks 




 As always, expect OP to deliver 




 So euh.. How was she before the accident? 









 Fuck those cross-eyed rice-shitters and everything around them, backwards country, polluting the earth, not giving a shit about the enviroment, other countries, human or animal rights. Disgusting 




 I once was home alone and gaming with my headset on, about 1 am,  volume pretty loud. Suddently tought I heard a noise coming from downstairs but I tought it was nothing (we have 2 cats aswell, they tend to make some noises now and then) but the, after about a minute, heard it again.
So I put off my headset, listened carefully and aboutt 5 seconds later heard glass breaking. My first tought was still, bloody cats, bumping glass off tables. Went downstairs without turning on lights in the hallway and when I get downstairs I can see trought the living room window 2 guys, each with rocks, throwing in the glass kitchen door.
Sneak upstairs while calling the police, telling them very briefly what's going on, taking my dad's katana he keeps next to his bed and go downstairs again. Now they do see me as I enter the living room and flee. Cops then arrived, made a report but were not too happy about me getting the sword and going downstairs again. 
What I can understand, at that moment tough, I was so angry because I envisioned not me (21y old male) but one of my little sisters being home alone and them breaking in that I was enfuriated. Sorry for the wall of text

**TL; DR: Was gaming,heard noises, tought it was cats, turned out to be burglars trying to smash in the kitchen window.** 




 When should this be implemented? Anyone have an idea? Thanks

 I believe the message in this video is something along the lines of him 'fucking his swag' or something.. 
























 Damnit, I was so afraid this was going to come after I saw the vid. First off, you didn't ruin shit, by the amount of flaming done by the opposite team, they deserve no less. Plus, it's bronze and you're climbing really fast, these people have basically a 0% chance to ever play with you again so for them, it's one game where they're either on the right or the wrong side.

And to be fair, I'm in gold and would love a game where I get stomped by someone of your level just to see where all my mistakes lie.. Seriously, keep it up, do whatever you feel like doing and fuck us, Reddit will always find a way to disagree! 




 Is it because he streams on azubu.tv now that his channel isn't being shown anymore on lolstreams? 




 I'll give that a try, thanks! However, I'm afraid that even when it dries out, it will still leave behind that sticky mess wich will destroy everything anyway, any tips for that? Btw, seems like it's only on the side with my battery, ventilator and USB ports, HDD, Ram and video card seem safe 




 Hi,

I manged to spill half a glass of red vodka on my laptop the other night and it's basically dead now. It was an Alienware M14x with pretty decent allround stats, bought for 1600-ish. Now, I'm going to send it back to Dell and ask if they can fix it and if now, if they can just replace the broken parts or give me a discount if I buy the same one since there's probably parts in that that work just fine.

In case this doesn't work for whatever reason, I would like some suggestions for a new one, with about the same specs or better but perhaps for a cheaper price because I know Alienwares are expensive.

Stats I had now:
Windows 7 Home Edition
500GB 7,200 RPM SATA + 32GB mSATA Caching SSD 
8GB (2 X 4GB) Dual Channel DDR3 at 1600MHz
and a 6GB Nvidia card (forgot exactly wich one it was)

All suggestions are welcome! Thank you 




 I main adc and can trade while farming pretty well now, however, due to always having a support by my side, my map awareness is not what it should be. I notice this especially when I play the occasional top or mid lane. More practice I guess! 




 How is he a dick? He just put out a fire using a cat!! 




 Seems so surreal when you try to imagine it happening to yourself 




 Agreed 100%, someone should answer to this because it is in no way fair. 




 Don't forget our beer! And some chocolate for dessert :) 




 Why are these top comments getting deleted when they're telling the truth? Already seen multiple of these.. 




 Thank you so much for giving such a detailed answer. I'm going to buy and download it now, will let you know in some time what I think of the game and wether it was worth it! I'm very interested 




 Hi, I'm looking for a (if possible) Steam  racing game. It has to have an open world and preferably a large collection of excisting supercars in wich you can cruise around. I don't really like racing other people or AI itself, just would love to just drive the cars. Bonus points is if's not needed to grind points/cash for hours before you get your first decent car.

I looked for a game like this and found TDU2. Is this the right game for me? Or other suggestions? Thanks alot!

Ps: I know it's weird to want a racing game without having to do alot of racing itself but I remember I just loved to drive in GTA with the faster cars. This is what I'm looking for now, only more realistic and perhaps less killing stuff :) 




 *sigh* gifbin.. You have no idea how long it took to load on mobile 




 Right in the feels indeed 




 For a second there I read r/spacedicks:beautiful pictures from space and tought you were trying to trick OP 




 You can delete your own post.. 




 This is the internet and he is a stranger, why would he lie? 




 [Well played](http://i.imgur.com/IK4LCfg.gif) 




 Saving this for when I'm not on mobile, thanks! 




 Yes. I don't know who made the call to go back in or why bad that was a really big mistake that lost them the game in my eyes 




 I believe we killed it 




 Impressive 'OP fag' gif collection 




 Very nice, good job 




 Damn mobile 




 I actually laughed with this one, gj OP

 Exactly my tought aswell, especially ar parties, MDMA has given me way better nights then coke probably ever will 




 I'm not from the US and I don't understand 80% of the references to the commercials, anyone else? 
























 Probably way too late for the party again but here it goes anyway:

When I was little, about 8 or so, I lived by the coast of Belgium (still do) A coasttram would drive along the coast in loops, stopping in all cities. Now, this thing drives in a bedding between the 2 roads the follow the same route, so naturally, alot of people cross it daily. There have been accidents before but they're pretty noisy so you can hear them coming wich gives you quite some time (they don't tend to go fast).

That day, I was on my way to the store when an eldery couple ok bikes wanted to cross the tracks. A tram was coming but they still had more then enough time. The man went first and got over just fine. His woman was next and the tram was getting pretty close now. 
She fell because her front wheel got stuck in the tracks. Being old and less mobile, she couldn't get up in time. 
The tram was too close to come to a standstill and ran her over at maybe 15 kmph but still, it was enough to run her over and drag her for a meter or 10. I watched it all in what seems like a slow-motion and stood there untill an ambulance showed up and put a tent over her remains. Needless to say, it wasn't a pretty sight.

Ps: sorry for bad formatting, on my phone 









 In that case, they're not doing a really good job in my experience 




 'Graves no flash' 




 Yes, buried.. 




 Why do things like this always get made by asians people? More particular the Japanese? So twisted.. 




 What?? 




 I have an entire skeleton made of real bones and 2 skulls, 1 fake and 1 real one. And yes, it would fit in my closet! But why have him there when I can have him next to my bed with a tie around his neck? 




 Probably way too late here but whever.. I have a skeleton in my room. Not a metaphorical one but an actual skeleton. My mother gave it to me a couple of years ago.
She bought it when she was in uni, because she had to study all the bones and such.. Apperantly they're pretty rare now, since you can no longer buy them that easy.

 I totally agree, this was the first time I felt sincerely bad for a player recieving this kind of hate on reddit as he seems to be the one that deserves it the least, such a nice guy

 It's not as simple, they're both doing it for obviously very different reasons, one to exploit the system and gain undeserved elo, the other one to have fun playing with some fellow LCS players. And honestly, I doubt anyone on the opposite team would of cared, thing are more relaxed 




 Nope! Like Griffie said, it's called Mayday and actually a pretty good read, would definatly advise! 




 Tyler? 




 My most used way was to write formulas/key notes on a metal ruler with a pencil. Not only do you hardly notice it from a distance, if you're afraid you might get caught, 1 swipe is enough to remove everything. Bonus: very easy prep 




 Drive over the speed limit on highways. Quite a bit, here the limit is 120km/h, left lane usually goes around 130-140 but whenever it's 'safe' to do so, meaning I have the space, I set my cruise control anywhere between 160 and 180, depending on traffic, 200+ at night when the road's totally empty. 
I guess I do it because I like to go places fast and believe 120 is way too slow, look at Germany, simular sized roads have no speed regulation at all (or 250..)

TL,DR: driving fast on highways, 120 km/h is bs 




 Is it the book in wich the army accidently shoots a commercial jet, leaving some survivors in it and then debates wether if they should shoot it down to get rid of the evidence? Because I liked that one!

 I have found that if you can get to late and have a team that actually peels for you, Kog wrecks anything 




 I'm at  148 and feel left out :( 




 If he can continue doing stuff like this I feel like Riot doesn't stand up for the values they stand for (or claim they do) 




 Is it just me or is this final alot more predictable then the EU one? 




 Perhaps because the only time he gets to 1v1 is when the opposite team's top is on equal or higher level as him. Thus resulting in more losses. If he would get 1v1's in all matches, I bet he would stomp most opponents

 You shouldn't have I'm afraid. 
























 I know that that is why people play ARAM, all I'm saying is that I bet there's a large amount of people that would move to practice teamfights within the current 'stupid meta' 




 Not going to lie, I just had a rather frustrating game in ARAM, one of those were you see the loading screen and wish you could go afk if it wasn't for the '9X poppy afk's that would certainly follow.

Then I started thinking, why do I even play this gamemode? You sometimes lose 20 minutes+ of you're time in a game you have no chance of winning.

 'I do it for fun, I don't care if we win or lose' Good for you, but my game time/day is limited and I actually do feel a bit frustrated after those game. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not the type of guy that 'likes ARAM as long as we have a good team and win'. I like it because of the teamfights and the practice you get.

Problem with ARAM tough, you're teamcomp is sometimes so random and/or shit that you learn nothing by playing it. So why not make a gamemode where everyone get's assigned 1 role from the current meta and plays a champ that is considered to be that role. Not only would this make it more fair, it would make it a whole lot more realistic because you play with actual comps that you can see in normals/rankeds.

inb4 'Riot doesn't want to enfore the meta' I know they don't, but it's not like it's a serious gamemode right? Plus, the meta is what the players make of it, the current meta is pretty stable, so I don't see how this would be a problem.

TL;DR: Make a gamemode where each member of the team gets assigned a random role and champ BUT within the current meta, making teamfight practice alot more realistic.

Would love to hear all arguments in favor or against my idea, all I know is that I would play this a whole lot more then the current 'get lucky in picks and win' ARAM

Ps: Yes, I know games outside of the meta are being played in rankeds aswell as in the pro circuit but you unfortunately cannot count in every random team comp out there.

EDIT: perhaps there could even be a gamemode besides this one in wich you pre-choose you role and the game then matches you with 4 others, who each have picked another role. In that way, you could practice by example, positioning/orbwalking as an ADC. Or initiating as the tanky top.. 




 Of course she is, she's surrounded by cocks 




 We're actually on pretty good terms now, we had this period in wich we talked again and got along fine. I also apologised so that helped..
Anyway, she's happy with her bf now so all is good! 




 I actually did this to a girl, when I was 16 or so.. We didn't see/hear eachother for the entire summer so I tought she'd forgotten about me and it would be super akward when the first day. So I did what a stupid young vou does, dumped her the day before school started.

She didn't talk to me for over a year and I found out aftefwards that she was heartbroken when I ended it. Still feel guilty about that actually.. 




 'Dust2, best map ever'

 I'll definatly give them a look! Thanks a bunch 




 Thanks for the tip! Have you perhaps got a short explenation or guide on how to apply this? Cheers! 




 Checked the new post in search for a submission about this game. I'm loving it, alot of teamfights, action packed and Forellenlord absolutly shitting on everyone!! Godlike Ahri plays 




 Preferably an AZERTY since I've been using it for whole my life and it's the standard in Belgium. I think I could get used to a qwerty however, if the laptop is significally better then the ones with AZERTY 




 Thanks for sharing you experience! 




 I'm from Belgium. Wich one do you recommend then? 




 Hi,

My alienware M14x broke down earlier (spilled drink over it) and I'm looking for a laptop to replace it. I don't want to spend 1500 euro on a laptop again, but I still want one that does very good performance wise, at the same level or better then my previous one.

Here are the specs on my late m14x:
-8.192 MB 1.600 MHz Dual Channel DDR3 SDRAM [2 x 4.096]

-3 GB NVIDIA GeForce GT555M


-750 GB (7.200 rpm) serial ATA-hard drive


-Intel Core i7 Processor 2670QM (2,20 GHz, 6 MB cache, Quad Core)


This is the one I was looking at: http://www.toshibadirect.com/td/b2c/pdet.to?poid=2000098506$

Would this one suffice? Is Toshiba any good/know for gaming laptops? And please, any further suggestions are welcome! My pricerange is anywhere between 1000 and 1200 euro.

Thank you!

 A Snoopeh vid on reddit?? Who knew.. Anyway, beautiful steal 




 That was the moment I closed the stream, too hard to watch :( 




 You're welcome! I couldn't watch the Twitch stream, it drove me mad so I searched untill this came up 









 YT stream without lag!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgp0A5xLPBM 




 How on earth is it possible I watched NA lCS this night on my mobile phone, in bed, with no lag whatsoever. Then watched OGN this morning, a stream from Korea,  lag. 
Now I want to watch EU LCS, wich is basically played in my backyard and I just can't because of the horrible lag?? Get yo shit together EU LCS 




 I honestly wonder who would be the better, more consistent player. Fabby is pretty agressive and can dominate bot as soon as he takes the lead. Aphro however, might be more mechanical (when het gets back to his old level, he's a bit sloppy now) and has more experience playing with a pro team on stages. 




 3-0'ing a team like Blaze kind of does justice imo.. But I understand what you mean, have an upvote 




 Just wondering, what's so bad about imageshack? I still use ot from time to time and see no huge flaws

 I never said bomb them. I'm talking about an intervention coordinated by the international community (NATO by example), not just the US. 
We've seen that their method does not work, however, it's getting pretty obvious that something has to be done because the situation over there is getting out of hand, human rights being violated left and right.. 




 No matter how gruesome, this should be everywhere. People have to know what's going on and realise that just watching it happen is not the way to act.

Fuck Russia and China btw, preventing the entire international community to intervene with political and economical pressure. 




 I still don't see the problem.. 




 I think this is one of those people that actually clicks their skills instead of using hotkeys. Anyway, cringed 




 This is no fun on acid :( 




 Where's the EG option?

 It's almost impossible but try to imagine that that's you, trying to deal with the sudden passing of your mother, dealing with all the questions. Newt thing you know, there's this kid making fun of you and of her..
Knowing me, I'de be in prison, I wish I could say I have the self-control but I don't.. 




 The baby was born with abnormaly large feet, making the pre-purchased shoes unusable. I want to believe.. 




 Say whatever you like, the kid can rap and has probably made more money now, age 24, then you (or me for that matter) ever will. So he must be doing something right.. 




 True, but that one has lots of alternatives on somewhat the same level, sites like google and reddit are quite unique in my opinion. 




 That, or for papers due tomorrow 




 Good answer! A site I use so much and consider so normal that I haven't even considered, but losing it would indeed suck 




 Stupid as it may sound, my answer would be Facebook. I hardly ever check it for more then a minute but just knowing I can contact all my friends pretty easely (even when I haven't heared them in ages) if I need to is so convenient. Also, birthdays! Knowing me, I wouldn't remember more then 5 a year.. 




 Perhaps better to exclude reddit since I assume alot of people would answer this. 




 I actually have red particles for him, there was a guide on how to do it posted back when he was released, I'll update when I can find it! 




 Cats are assholes. Love em 




 How on earth can you call players like Wickd, krepo, snoopeh and yellowpete 'trash'? Yes, they have their bad games, everyone does.

 This is the reason it got me angry, if he stopped and considered the pro/contra's or the risks, there's no way he would of done this. Instead he went for the 'nope, this will be both awesome for us and look good on video.'

 I already try to talk to her, in my experience, time can heal you but can also drag you down very fast. This is something I want to prevent at all cost. I really do hope it's just a phase and she'll snap out of it.

And glad to hear that you seems to do allright, I doubt I can make you a whole lot better but if it's any help, I have tough about you, that stranger from Reddit, quite a few times today and I really do hope you're good! *internet hug* 




 Thank you, I might bring this up when Infeel the time is right.

And that may be so but that's no reason for me not to care about others right? So, stanger to stranger, how are you doing and dealing with it now? 




 That must be so tough on you :( 

If I may ask, what could potentionally make you open up towards them? Is there anything they could do or say to make you feel comfortable with this? 




 Hi,

Thank you for your response.

I have indeed tought about the fact that it might be possible that she's hiding something. However, I do not think this is the case. She was never the type of person to hide stuff from her family, no matter how embarrassing/painfull.  

Plus, she also says that this is the main reason why she's so confused, she doesn't know why she is feeling so depressed. I believe that it is something she might be unaware of, or something she refuses to face..

I like the quote by your father since it adresses what I think is the root of her problem. Will definitely use this the next time I have a chance to sit down and talk with her about this. Thanks alot!  




 Hi Reddit,

My little sister (she's 20, but I have 2 and she's the youngest, therefor my little sister) has been diagnosed with depression a couple of weeks ago.

I never saw it coming, she always was the most cheerful one out of our family of 5, has an amazing boyfriend who loves her, has tonnes of friends, popular, beautiful.. You get the picture.
Because of my work, I can't be home often and she's at uni most of the time anyway.

The last time I saw her it really shocked me how sad she looked, the light always visible in her eyes seemed to have faded away, she looked tires, didn't say much..
I went out to dinner with my dad and he told me it has been declining for a while now and I can see that it hurts my parents tremendously to see her suffer like this.

Now, I went trough something simular when I was in uni but got very good at hiding it and eventually got better because I got help and decided what was worth obsessing over and what not.

I'm afraid that she will not have this strenght, she never had any major troubles in her life and I can see she's not dealing with this well at all.
She is getting professional help but this can only go so far.

As her older brother, I alwasy felt like she looked up to me so my question now is, what is my best course of action? What do I do or say to help her in any way possible?
Mind you, I'm able to see her or meet up with her from time to time but this is once every 2 weeks max.

I already told her I was in a simular situation, what I did to help myself and how I eventually got out. The big difference between the 2 of us is that I kinda knew what was keeping me down, **she does not know**

Only thing that we can think of is that she sets really high (unrealistic) standards for herself, is perfectionistic and does not handle the stress coming from this very well.

So Reddit, what do and what say?

Thank you so much for helping me, I'm kind of lost and it kills me to see my baby sister like this. 




 Source anyone? 




 Exactly! Plus, it would remove all the useless searching, just put in an order, decide howmuch you want to pay for it and wait. 

Prices are decided by the players and supply amp;demand.. I would be so happy if they implemented this 




 It's so simple, use Runescape's Grand Exchange system, problem solved.. 




 Be sure to check out stephan biniak's bootleg version aswell!! Super chill 




 Nice guide. One question tough, why don't you include Spirit Visage in the defensive item list? I tend to go for it quite a lot as it does wonders combined with a BT, especially when a tank of theirs has a tornmail 




 I like you, you're funny :D 




 Exactly what I tought.. I sent them an email, hopefully they'll care and fix it because there's nothing I can do with that piece of land now.. 




 Apologies if this post looks weird, I posted it from my phone.

Now, I started a disaster and got this asba requirement to rebuilt. Do they really expect me to not rebuild untill my storage is big enough? This will take ages..:o 









 I'll certainly remember that, much appreciated! 




 I gifted you gold 3 times now, so I believe we're even :) Thanks again! 




 Thank you very much!! I'm on mobile now, I'll get you the gold when I get home, within 2 hrs max 




 Hi,

I found the following gif on the frontpage:
http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/2wf30j/classic_willie/
I would like somthing simular but with the name of the bear changed to 'Poeh' and the girl's name changed to 'Louise'.

The original gif is really easy to find.
Willing to gif 3 months of gold to whoever can make the best/high quality gif out of this.

Thank you! 




 Is it possible that you asked about it in game and I answered it might be his statik? If so, we were on the same game :) 




 I stopped playing a while back, can someone explain me what the difference between normal and 'hard' kills are? Thanks! 




 I meant that I like the idea. Everyone seems to hate it before having seen it.. I think they could do some really cool things with it 




 All this whining.. Seems like a cool skin to me, I like it 




 What does he say tough? 




 Love you all  




 Quality post 10/10

 She looks like she's having a stroke. A beautiful one, but a stroke none the less

 Dude your music's amazing!! Sitting here on the train, hearing it for the first time with this stupid grin on my face..

Thank you!! I'm on my way to iTunes now  




 Love you too 




 Looking forward to see wich team we'll send home next round ;) 




 Anyone got a mirror? Got taken down :/ 




 Hey, how did you get 2 flair?o.O 




 Amsterdam? 




 It's gone :( Can someone tell me what it said? 




 Yes 




 I suggest you download Tor and go browse Silkroad, alot of fake documents are being sold there.

/r/silkroad to get started! Just be sure not to get lost ;)

Edit: why downvote his question? I was never under the assumption everyone held such high moral standards here.. 




 Glad you liked it! 




 Is this just fantasy? 




 Is this real life? 




 Yeah but you can get e free rock using the same method, reversed. So, free bj! 




 Exactly, I was in doubt wich one to answer but I got into Kendrick with GK,MC and discovered Section 80 afterwards, so yeah.. 




 Section 80 is amazing aswell! Learn about Kendrick because of GK, MC and started searching more of him afterwards. S80 is an excellent album aswell, with a whole different story and characters but atleast as 'real' 




 How many sins? I'm running out. How many sins? I lose count.. 
Goddamn love that song, all the stories coming together in 1 track 




 Kendrick Lamar - Good Kid, M.A.A.D. city. It's more than an album, it's a lifestory told in the most fitting way possible

Edit: For anyone familiar with the album, so worth the read: http://www.kanyetothe.com/forum/index.php?topic=313845.0 
It's, in my opinion, a very good interpretation of the album and every song by itself. 




 I'm afraid it might be hard to find ex-procrastinators on Reddit, they probably all got the hell out of here.. 




 Weed wizard zilean tough..
