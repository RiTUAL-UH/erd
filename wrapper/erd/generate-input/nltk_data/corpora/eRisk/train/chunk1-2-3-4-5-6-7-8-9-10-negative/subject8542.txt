 Phew. I thought I was the only one who still had no idea what to do.

I love all the albums, but I can listen to this one over and over no problems 




 Same! Death related stuff intrigues me. I'll be alright reading up on murders and stuff.. but actally being in graveyards and near corpses.. Nope.

I am getting better with graveyards though. But I did have to sort of.. blank out for a funeral when the coffin ws being lowered. I think I  drifted off until I was tapped on the shoulder. 




 Serious?!

Oh yes! I'm headed up to Newcastle for the work's Christmas Do. I shall be there and I shall scarf the pasties in my hotel room while reasonably sozzled. 




 Sausage, Bean and Cheese.

they're always sold out when I go. :( Not had one for aaaaaaaaaages. 




 Graveyards and corpses. I actually turned and power walked out of a chapel of rest before my Nan's funeral. In my head I was all **"NOPENOPENOPENOPE"**

 I get anxious to fuck when going visiting my Grandad/Nan's grave (Buried together) For a while, I used to just sit in the car while my Mum/dad/siter went to visit.

I don't really even know what it is. The fact that there's hundreds of dead bodies 6 feet below me is enough to freak me out.

 Apprentice here:

I was taken on at 17 and I'm fortunate that they started me off at Minimum wage (at the time - 4.50 an hour) but the staff turnover for the department I was in was insane. Apparently, I lasted the longest (2 1/2 years) before moving department because the whole thing was just soul sucking, boring and depressing

(I was in the IT preparing area. Computers on the DSA)

Shifted into the warehouse, but still working (I think. My NVQ provider still hasn't got back to me.) on NVQ Level 3 IT Practitioner.

It's good for experience and for fresh out of school kids, but for the most part, you're an intern. Everything gets dropped onto you, because you're fresh meat. 
 




 I thought it was quite a good book, may just be the rose tinted glasses talking though. I'll have to pick it up again. 




 Was forced to read (and watch!) Holes back in year 8 (Age 12, around 2002) Actually kinda liked it. 




 My brain can't handle this

Oh god.

I need to get high one day. I'd come up with some crazy shit.
 




 So I went outside earlier, and looked up. I could have sworn I was too close to the city to see stars, but there they were. 

I can't remember the last time I just stood there in the cold, looking up at them. Must have been during school. And that was at least 6 years ago now. Probably more.

It's a beautiful thing - looking up at night. 

All those stars. Each one has other planets, some possibly even holding life. Hey, for all I know, there's intergalactic transport passing by right now. Not making contact for some crazy law where they're not allowed to make contact or something.

I just stood there for 20 minutes. Mind temporarily blown.. And I'm not even high!

I sent one of my snackexchange buddies some cadbury's chocolate bars (all the types - Standard/Fruit+nut/turkish delight/Caramel) and they seemed to go down well.

also, Wispas! Wispa gold, too, if you can spot them - I saw one the other day at the garage near my place. 




 Yah, EVE online. 

And thanks for the nostalgiaspaz. Not played Kingdom Hearts in forever. 




 B-but, I'm not evil!

I'm kinda the opposite. I've had a decently structured fantasy scenario and story in my head for years, and now I've had this insane idea with a Sci-fi story, it's gonna be so fun to write. :D 




 Oh damn! What area of Manchester were you in? I'm going to Hazard a guess at Salford. That place is scary when it's dark. :( 




 I had it when I was in the states 7 years ago. I had some kind of chicken soft taco thingy. It was alright, actually. I didn't try an actual hard shell taco though, I'll have to give it a try. 




 Yep! I posted an update, and I got a creepy as fuck story from there about 2 weeks ago.

 It's not a massive troll. Well, if it is - I've been had! Still love the show, though. 




 Where'd you get it?! Wouldn't mind one for mine. 




 You get anything back? Curious to hear his stories either way. xP 




 I get the feeling I'll be listening to a lot of Electronic music while writing. Mainly Pendulum. 

Might put EVE on and let the music go by. 




 Ahh, the good ol' sneaky creeper.

 Posted on r/dogs a while back, but thought It'd be cool to see here too. 

I was lucky with this picture! I can never get him to sit still long enough for a good one. 









 At first, I was going to do a generic fantasy - save the world kind of story, but then I had this insane idea.

It'd be a crime story, which'll throw itself into a fantasy-esque ending, but set in space.  It only hit me a few hours ago, so I'm still working out the details and stuff, but I'm super excited! 




 Hell, I'm stuck between making it a Sci-fi, or a fantasy novel.

Might go out on a limb and freakishly combine them. 




 I can only imagine the damage if you're stood next to him and he decided to shout something.

 Good idea! I shall tag all, too. 




 Let me know if this is the place he comes to. If it's him I hear creeping around in the dark when I'm walking the dog, he's made me concerned for my safety while I'm there! xD 




 Adlington ain't too far out from Bolton.

To be precise, it's Moses Gate Country Park, and it's at the bottom end, near the cricket club. If he's been before, he'll know what I'm on about. :P

 Yup! This hut is between Bolton, Farnworth and Little Lever

 Still at work at the moment, but heading home in about an hour and half.

Just for clarification: There's no pics of the man himself - just of the hut. 

They're old reddit posts, from about 5 months ago, but I got one the other day showing its current state.

Here's the old reddit post until I get home and get the new pic uploaded. :) [Clicky!](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepy/comments/h63l7/update_to_bricked_up_doorway_album_inside/) 




 Will do when I get back from work. Just woke up and I overslept. :( 




 Yeah, I live nearby. About a 10 minute drive.

I'm not sure on the history, all I know is that the area used to be a landfill, and the hut he was near was a sewage control 




 'taters.

Poh-tay-toh. 




 I get weird shit like this happening to me all the time. Usually, I'm at home when stuff decides to come out and play, but last night, it picked the perfect moment to scare the living bejeezus out of me.

The darker nights are rolling in sooner each night, and last night - it caught me totally off guard.

I'd been walking the dog down a reclaimed landfill site, and up until recently, it had been perfectly light enough to take a nice brisk walk up and down the entire length of the area (a good 3 miles or so.) But last night, the darkness got there before I did. 

I'm too stubborn to call it off and go walk on a nice lit pathway with the dog. So I pulled out my torch and set off walking.

This pathway is completely covered by trees. Only letting cracks of light in between the leaves. It gives off a very creepy atmosphere.  It was a very cloudy night, anyway. Not much bright moonlight to go by.

Anyway, I'm going off the point here. I'm walking along this big long dirt path, and I can hear rustling in the trees on either side of me. My dog isn't stopping to check - so I assume it's probably some little squirrels or something. In retrospect, what the hell made me think squirrels would roam at night? 

So I'm a little edgy, but the dog doesn't seem to care, so I carry on.

I'm about a mile into the walk, and I approach what I've dubbed "The Creepy Hut."

This creepy looking building is an old sewage control building. The old iron door is still attached, but the doorway behind it is bricked up. the old brickwork a much darker, redder colour than the freshly placed doorblock bricks.
During the summer, the plant life around it goes wild and obscures it from view, ivy growing on its old roof- hanging off the edges, and grass almost as tall as me surrounding it.

But it's just starting to get into autumn, and the grass is wilting, and the ivy is getting brown.  The place reeks of rotting stuff all year round, but today the stench seemed awfully stronger than usual. 

I covered my face with my coat, shone my torch over the old hut and froze.

There was a person in front of the old iron door. He was slouched, slightly. Looking like he was breathing heavily. Or laughing. I wasn't sure - I was too far away.

My dog had seen this, and he'd also stopped dead in his tracks, staring at the strange man in front of the door. His ears were high, tail curled upwards.

The man slowly started turning around. I aimed the torch at his torso, so that the light would slightly illuminate his face. Don't want to blind him!

Bad idea. His face was lit up sort of like when you used to shine the torch under your chin at camp, telling spooky stories. Except this time the man's face was half rotted. He had the shit-eating grin spread right across his face. He slammed this big iron door shut with his left arm, and I swear it took a brick or two from the bricked up doorway with it. 

(Note: This door is heavy as hell. I tried moving it a few months back after taking some pictures of the place, and it was very hard to move, even with all 220lbs of me behind it.)

I just turned back towards the car and ran. Dog had the same idea - He barrelled past me, barking his head off. I didn't want to turn around and see what the man was doing, but curiosity got the better of me. I quickly turned and began backpedalling, and he was just stood where I was - on the pathway. I could see his shape in the limited moonlight, Hunched over.

That was it. I ran the mile back to the car, unlocked it on the run, opened the door, threw myself in and locked it behind me. Turned the engine and lights on, and turned the car to face where I had come from. The high beams on my car headlights weren't enough to pierce all the way through the trees, but I would at least be able to see him coming. Nothing. 

The Dog had barrelled into the car right beside me, so I just took off home.

I swear he was stood at the gate to the car park on my way out. Waving. Like he'd hoped I'd come back soon.

No chance, mate.

I have pictures of both outside and inside this place if anyone wants them

 I can't even comprehend.

WHAT ARE YOU GUYS THINKING 




 You ain't no Boltoner! :I Everyone I've ever known says Breakfast, Dinner, Tea. 




 Oi! 




 That just sounds weird. 




 It's a barm, you fools! 




 Indeed. You always hear of "This is the new MMO - it will surely kill WoW this time!" 

Rather than attempting to just usurp WoW off the MMO Throne, it'd be cool if the devs could try and concentrate on an original concept for an MMO, rather than the run of the mill 3rd person action-y RPG.

It works, but sometimes you just need something new. And with everyone developing these kind of games, there's not that much difference between the lot of them. 

Makes the whole market stale. 




 Yeah, I dunno either. [](/ppshrug) 









 Hey.

 Hi Swimmit!

I crashed my car about a week and a half ago, and I'm currently suffering from whiplash, a sprained wrist, and a bad back.

It's easing off a little bit, and the pain only hits me bad when I lean over, or move my wrist a little too suddenly (That's with my painkillers, though)

Is there any kind of swimming technique I could use to sort of get back in the water, or would you guys advise staying out for a few more weeks? I miss having my after work swim. :(  









 Little late on the posting, but hey.

There were about 15 of us in Birmingham city centre on saturday. We invaded a pub, talked (quite loudly) and received ponies. 

Then we went on a march to somewhere, which involved walking past a big church while playing Pony music through an iPod dock speaker. That was kinda weird.

Then we went through the city shopping centre, waving a flag and singing Winter Wrap Up. That was kinda surreal.

Then we found a shop which sold pony merch, and we acquired more pony.

In short..

[](/soawesome) BEST. DAY. EVER 




 I don't get it. You're toeing the line as it is by driving with no insurance, yet you drive like a lunatic.

You drove down the wrong side of a road, leading into a junction, then you pull out of said junction (It had Give Way signs!) without looking while I'm coming down the main road. Smashy.

I've got a burn up my left arm, a big-ass cut up my left arm and now I think the whiplash is deciding to make itself known. Shoulders and back are achey, and my neck hurts to turn. I thought I was having a heart attack on scene, the airbag went off right into my chest and the pain wouldn't go for about 5 minutes.

Luckily (unfortunately for the company I work for, though) I was working at the time and I was using a van. My little car wouldn't have stood a chance and I might have been seriously injured now. 




 This happened last night, so I can remember pretty much everything in vivid detail. I've probably had about 3 hours sleep.

It was a relatively normal day. I'd gotten back from walking the dog a few hours ago. I walk him on the site of an old landfill, now cleaned up and is a popular horse riding trail. I usually head off the path after heading past an old and abandoned sewage control building, as to not disturb any riders with my very excitable Border Collie.

I was walking among the trees, alone, when I heard the fallen branches behind me snapping, like someone was walking on them. I turned around expecting to see someone walking behind me - there was no-one there. 

Putting it down to my imagination, I carried on walking along the woods. The sounds continued all the way along the woods, only stopping when the ground cleared up.  I thought nothing of it, until last night.

It didn't start off so bad, just the odd footstep here or there. I live in a old house, creaks are expected. But then 1am happened. My door (which is kinda sturdy) was closed. The handle turned and it flung open, slamming into the desk I was sat at. 

Expecting to see my mischievous little sister there, I stood up and poked my head out of the door. 

*"What'd you do--"* 

There was no-one there.  The floor outside my room is creaky, I'd have heard her running off. I shook my head, closed my door - locked it - and carried on with what I was doing.

about 10 minutes later, I was about to grab my glass and take a drink. It slid along the desk, away from me. I stared at it for a second or two, wondering if my mind is just seriously messing with me.  Then it just fell over. 

I'd had it with my room, I was going to go downstairs to watch a bit of TV, and hang out with my dog.  I got downstairs and he was sat right at the door to the stairs, whining quietly. He saw me open the door and wagged his tail furiously. He's normally sleeping on the rug at this time. He must have heard the glass fall over and got spooked.

I eventually ended up asleep on the couch around 3am, BBC news playing quietly in the background, but my dog was still staring at the stairs door.

It was about 5:30am when I woke up. I cursed myself for falling asleep on the couch when there was a perfectly good bed upstairs. I turned around and someone was stood there. At first, I thought it was my mum, coming to check on me, after a few seconds on refocusing it was my Nan. 

My still half-asleep brain relaxed a little - then it hit me - my Nan had been dead for 3 months - She died in July. I faced both my phobias in one day to attend the funeral of the woman who had cared for me all my life.

I freaked out. I sat up, and threw myself over the arm of the couch. Running into the kitchen, I heard scrambling right behind me. I opened the knife drawer and pulled one out and switched to a defensive position.  

It was just my dog following me frantically into the kitchen whimpering and whining.  I threw some water over my face from the sink and slowly popped my head around the corner, back into the living room. No-one there. I got a torch from the back room and used it to navigate my back up to my bedroom.

(Woah, that was long. That's what happened to me last night.)

 I'm going to a funeral in a week, and I have this horrible, overpowering fear of graveyards. This is the first funeral I've ever been to, and I don't want to have a mental breakdown on the graveside.

Would be much appreciated if you could get me one! 



















 Hey all! This is my second story on here. I have a few more, completely nonrelated to each other. I might post them if I can remember the details. Anyway, here goes;

I was 18, I'd passed my driving test about 6 months ago, and we were in the city, playing video games at the Gamerbase, in Manchester, under the HMV.  It was about 10:30 when we left the place, and started the walk back to the car. 

It was an unremarkable walk, nothing to report, just me and my friends talking about whatever came to mind. Mostly video games.

We got to the car, and the place was empty. Of course, it was 11pm on a sunday night, there won't be too many people about. We got in the car and set out.

We must have hit the East Lancs road about 11:15. We're driving down the road, still talking. I was concentrating on the road. I was still a newbie after all.

The exit for Bolton was coming up, I took it and started speeding up on the motorway. I hit 60MPH on the long straight road. I saw a small movement in the distance. A low hanging tree brance, maybe. I carried on.

Suddenly, a young girl dashed out and lept over the safety barrier. I slammed the brakes, but I couldn't stop in time, there wasn't a chance. 

Her legs buckled from the bumper hitting her. 

Her side hit the bonnet, I saw her body twist, and her face slammed into my windshield. I don't think I've been any closer to losing my mind than I did at that moment. Her face was crushed against the hard glass. 

But she had this... Grin which shook my spine like an earthquake. I was so very tempted to just leap out of my car right at that moment. I kept my cool, and got the car to a stop. (albeit, in the middle of the road, but still)

I opened my door and lunged out of the car and took off up the road to help the person I'd just mowed down. My friends scrambled into action, They thought I'd lost it and chased me up to road to stop me. 2 stayed behind to push the car into the hard shoulder.

I was stunned. I only ran a few meters before stopping. There was nothing there. No body, no blood. Only my skid marks in the road. 

I was so certain of what I saw. My friends took me back to the car and we sat outside it for a while. My car was clean. No blood, no dents, no cracked windows. 

Nothing.  

I was certain for days I had gone mad.

It had absolutely lashed it down with rain last night, so I was lucky I didn't drop my phone (Yeah, my phone has a 12Megapixel camera in it) with the amount of slipping I was doing.
On the approach, it absolutely reeked of rotting stuff. I can't pin it, it was just unholy and had to cover my face, otherwise I'd have emptied my lunch all over the wall.

I took two pictures of the interior and started getting the serious heebie-jeebies, and the smell was starting to penetrate of waterproof coat, so I hightailed it outta there.

Enjoy!

(Sorry for the slight confusion. I messed up with my postings.) 














 I played pretty seriously back in WotLK, and participated in a realm second Lich King Heroic 10 Man.

Since Cataclysm's release, I've stepped back a little bit and not played as seriously. I've had a lot of jip from guild members and been branded as if I'm in for the loot.

This is by no means a description of me. I'm far from it.

I play the game as what it's meant to be. A Game. I don't care for loot, or who goes into raids instead of me - I know what it's like to be a raid leader, it's a pain in the arse to find a right setup.

I like to Roleplay, but by no means is it a requirement for me. I'm willing to transfer to any realm on the EU rack. 

[Here's](http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/nagrand/zeifer/simple) my main character - a hunter - on the armoury. 

I will be transferring my level 43 hunter over, though. I still have a few friends on my current server and I wouldn't like to lose most contact with them. (I'm currently on Nagrand EU)

I will be able to level this up in a week or 2, though.

I would prefer Horde too, so I wouldn't have to cough up for a Faction Transfer also.

I know it's a long shot, but I hope to hear back from interested people. :) 









 Just shortlisting places I can go for a holiday that's a bit Far-Flung from the UK.

What kind of things is there I can do that a little off the beaten track?

I've had a look around the Canada tourism sites, just wondering if there's much else that could be of interest!

Edit: Derp. Typos. 














 First nosleep post. I've had a couple of freaky experiences where I live right now, I'm on a lunch break at work atm, so I've only got the time for one, so here goes. :)

It was a warm summer night. Unusually warm for northern england, even in the middle of summer.

I was sleeping with no covers over me, just wearing my boxer shorts.

I must have woke up around 3am, lying on my side, greeted by the sight of my black wallpaper. I sighed heavily, knowing I'm not going to be able to fall back asleep now. Hah! If only I knew!

I slowly turned onto my back, to face the roof. I expected to see my Alchemy Gothic "Devil take the Wyrm" poster right above me. What I saw instead curdled my blood, yet I couldn't bring myself to do anything.

A disembodied head, gnarled features. Missing an eye. His other eye, bright red staring right back at me.

He grinned. His teeth (those which were left, anyway) were a horrible shade of yellow. 

The light coming from the side of me illuminated his face with a pale blue glow. I slept that night with the curtains open, I regretted it right at that moment, it made everything so much spookier.

Time seemed to freeze for what felt like an eternity. I couldn't move, it was like he had me pinned down.

And then he vanished.

I heard a car squeal its brakes in the distance, then an engine roar.

I didn't sleep for days afterward, fearing he would visit again when I wasn't expecting him. 














 Hey Doggit!

Just thought I'd ask, as my dog's been doing this for years and I'm curious as to why he'd be doing it;

Everywhere I walk my dog, he'll stop, sniff and start licking something he finds interesting. Be it a plant, the concrete floor, a wall, tree stump. Anything. He doesn't do it at home though, which is strange.

I find this slightly weird, and all google searches only really come up with dogs licking carpets at home.

If it helps any, he's a Border Collie, about 8 years old now. 



















 Was supposed to arrive at work at 8:30am this morning, but never turned up after setting off at 7:50am.

I recieved a text off him at 8:10 saying one word: Adios.
Police have been contacted, and his phone is turned off.

May have gone to the Lincoln area.

If you see him, please contact Greater Manchester Police on 0161 872 5050 quoting the Log number 551, on the 8th March 2011.

About 5'11, medium length hair - brown, has a spidery-like fringe, has a few weeks of beard on him. 
May be wearing Barry Bennett Ltd work shirt, but may have changed clothes.

**Edit: Call off the search! We found him. He was wandering the streets looking completely lost.** 









 When I first talked to one of my friends over there via skype, I heard a little squeal when I said "Hi."
It's almost unnerving, would I be violated if I came over and started talking? 









 I'm 18 stone (252 pounds) and I'm 6 foot 1, I'm 21 and I'm pretty sure I seriously need to start losing weight, fast.

I've taken up Rock Climbing and am doing that once a week, and I'm starting to eat less junk and more healthy stuff.

I'm trying to figure out the best way to exercise that will drop the fat from me in the best way, I'm coming up with Running or Swimming, but I'd thought I'd ask you guys for some help. :)

Edit: Thanks for the tips folks, I gotta dash, break at work is over. I'll read up when I get home!

Edit2: Wow! Thanks for all the replies, I looked through all of them and I appreciate all your advice. :) Thanks a lot! It'll help! 




 I live up north in England. Ask Me Anything! :D 
























 I'm probably a tad late for this one, but I'll post anyway.
Not even my story, either, but my Parents'.

I was 12, and I was staying out at a friends place a few miles away, my sister was also out at her friends just down the street.

Must have been about 11pm, my parents were sat on the sofa downstairs, watching TV and getting ready to go to sleep, when they heard a small thumping upstairs from my room, then nothing.

A minute or two later, down the stairs came 5 or 6 little bouncy balls (You know, the kind which are tiny, choking hazards to children and bounce like motherfuckers)

Now, in order for the bouncies that were in my room to come down the stairs, they'd have to roll out of my room, down a corridor, turn left twice and then bounce down.

Here's the funny bit.

*Mine were still in my room*

 My sister didn't own any. She wasn't awesome enough. 




 I'd imagine just holding it out if your arms are long enough (Or if the chainsaw is shorter), then stabbing yourself with it.

 I'm in Warehousing and Transport. I like the transport side of things, but the warehousing is monotonous and boring as all hell. But it gets stuff shipped countrywide, so I guess I'm doing a good job.

House for my sister and her boyfriend, just to shut 'em up

Buy a bunch of tailored clothes, because I'm sick of wearing Jeans and graphic tees. :( 




 It's been 5 years, but every time your name comes up on the Instant Messenger and we talk, the memories come flooding back.

I don't think I'll ever be fully over you.. It's probably why I'm not even slightly interested in dating still.
 




 Well, as I open the most played playlist on my phone..

[Alex S - Party with Pinkie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sryqaS07WaU)

followed closely by

[In Flames - Deliver Us](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTiQ75HY0DA ob=av3e) 




 Been using 'em a while now. Very good. Using speedtest.net I get 9MBS. I'm pretty sure we're signed up for the 10MB service, too. 

Though I recall they used to provide a 16MB service, we might have signed up for that. 




 I've never actually been, but I've driven past it a few times when heading to the Academy for a gig.

I'll have to drop in sometime. 




 Coolio55

*cringe*

train_subject8542 is set in stone now, been using this since I was 15. 




 White Russians, or Vodka + Coke. They're only if I've got some money to throw, though.

Otherwise it's just a bottle of cider for me! 




 Pet Puppies seems to work, but I quite like Watch Ponies myself.

[](/hahaha"Because Ponies are awesome.") 




 Aye, could be. I've raid healed on a druid (85) in ToC before, but druids and paladins are totally different. xD 




 I can heal... when I eventually get back to playing properly. 
Might need a little bit of practice in Raid healing, though.

If not, I can powerlevel my hunter.. I have a _lot_ of experience with them 




 Not sure. I saw the stream pause for a few seconds during the Audience Questions, but otherwise it seemed pretty seamless. 




 This took too long to write up.  
[](/twicrazy"Clock...is.. TICKING!") 









 I can't even get back to the proper sign in page now, I've just logged out and I get the e-mail sign up form.

Try signing out of facebook, maybe? I don't have one. 




 I signed up with just my e-mail. There's a small link under the "Sign up with Facebook" button saying "Sign up with e-mail" 




 Totally up for it, but my sister's 18th is the same night. Next time! 




 Underwear by Royal Republic 




 Lots of shit flinging going on in here.

What the fuck, did I go to a school where the kids were _mostly_ normal?

Weirdest kid in our school was a Jehovah's Witness. Liked to poke everyone he met. He came knocking on my door the other day. Poked me in the nose for old times' sake and wandered off. 




 22 in a few weeks here. Full time Warehouser/Van Driver/Techie for 5 years, Engineer's Assistant for a year before that.

I keep the Ponies and IRL seperate. Moreso after my sister spilled the beans on my Pony music listening habits to facebook. Coworkers saw and ribbed me for a few days.  




 When it comes to society breakdown, or invasion - us brits are screwed. xP I wouldn't even know where to begin looking to find a firearm.

I got lots of sharp pointy things. Do they count? (I'm an avid weapon collector. Got various axes, swords and daggers mounted in my room) 




 Sorry. I mean I'd just forget the doors were smaller, and bash my head on the top of the doorframe.

I type like I talk. :D 




 Hide in the woods. As long as I was quiet about it, I doubt they'd come looking for me. Take a lot of tinned food and see how long I'd last. Sneak out and scavenge shops for more tinned, precooked food.

I'd be a terrible fugitive. 




 I'd say the same, but only if I was a pony myself. Those doors are tiny, I would slip up and twat my head on a door many times.

[](/hahaha"Because Ponies are awesome.") 




 What?! Sweet is outdated?

Fuck. 




 Hell, I still kind of like them. Their new album I can quite happily listen to. I listen to music to fill the day, I don't listen for imperfections, or genius.

It's a band (or a person) who's picked up an instrument, or sang, put it on a CD so I can listen to it.

I'm not gonna give anyone shit for listening to anything.

Haters gonna hate. 




 Could be, though I'm not sure how they'd get in the space between my floor and the kitchen roof.

Hell, how they'd even get in the house is a question in itself, I have a dumb, lovable dog and 2 bastard cats which attack anything that moves. 




 Every single night, about 1am-ish, there's a scratching in my floor. It doesn't wake me up, I just hear it if I'm awake.
 
At first, I thought it was my dog, scratching at something downstairs, but one night, I was downstairs and I heard the scratching above me.

I've been hearing it since I moved in, about 13 years ago. I want to know what it is! 




 [](/derpwizard)I derp'd 
 




 I saw some "Malteaster" chocolates in Mid November. Kinda did a double take at the petrol station I was at. 




 Not sure. Being a site writer on a fansite, I should really know these things.

"Pinkie Pie tries babysitting Cake's twin toddlers but finds it harder than she thought."

back to the subreddit! [](/hahaha) 




 Just wait 'til Saturday. It's gonna be brilliant! [](/ppboring) 




 When I was 14 or something and still used myspace, I believed that the 9/11 terrorist attacks were an inside job.

Yeah - I grew out of that pretty quick. 




 [](/flutteryay) Not all warehousers are assholes. 

I'm a warehouser.  It's all about personal taste. 




 I'll be outside with a giant swizzle straw! [](/party) 




 It's like a great big black hole.
Once you're in, you never leave.

This is not a bad thing [](/hahaha"I wouldn't want to, anyway!") 




 My brain says I should be ashamed, but my heart is currently fist pumping. 




 Well, you've all knocked us Mancs off the top spot.

I'm not sure whether to be ashamed or proud of this. 




 [](/hahaha) Happy New Year from the UK, Everypony! I may had had one too many doughnuts...

[](/punchdrunk) 




 My brain broke even trying to read this.
[](/derp)

I tried 5 times. 




 [](/hahaha"I want to go to the Future!")Maybe in 10 years, when we have some amazing paper.

 




 Currently [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JETHNPLV7Tk).
It'll probably stick for a while too. 




 I have two peices of advice for you. 

Try to avoid Salford at night, and for the love of god, don't mention Scousers unless you're taking the piss out of them. Or Southerners for that matter. 




 Good. Channel that rage.

Right into that there Dragon's neck. 




 Ow! Arrow!
It came from the sky! **IT WAS THE DRAGONBORN!** 




 After wasting weeks and weeks on heroic mode, I started to really dislike "AS YOUR PATHETIC MAGIC BETRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYS YOOOOU"

I was a hunter too, so it didn't even affect me! 




 Yep. Dropped the parents off at my Aunts and I stayed back. With the girls it's shopping and gossip, with the guys, it's football and beer, and there'll be about 10 kids running and screaming.

I just want to chill out and chill with friends, talk shiny things and play video games. 




 The Fire isn't even available here in the UK, I've got the Kindle 4 (non-touch) 




 Slow as in slow to change page? I got the download off EQD and it seems to be running fine!  




 Got my kindle for Christmas too.

[This is going to take a looooong time to read.](http://i.imgur.com/y6KyT.jpg) 




 KFC do breakfasts?
Shit, I've never seen them. What are they offering? 




 I'm not sure. My daft mate left the reciept in from Argos, was 20 or something. Still bloody awesome. I love it, been after one for a while. 




 If you're only 10 minutes away, it's not too bad. Though the campsite has some great craic going on. 




 Download Festival Tickets (:D!) and a laser projector to make pretty patterns on the roof.

 




 Last week, I'd gone to bed quite late, despite having to get up early the next day. The parents and the sister knew I was going to be doing a looooong drive down to London to deliver stuff - rest was vital.

It's 2am. "Can you come pick me up? I'm in Manchester, I don't want to wait for a bus.."

I promptly told her to shove it and went back to sleep. 




 "Dude. Do you wanna go play ball or go for a run or something?"

**"SHIT YEAH"** 




 I love him. Every time I fight him, I always /y "TIMMAY!" back at him. 




 Ooooooh. Yeah, I've been posting a fair bit in the past few days. 




 You do? What did I say or do for you to remember me? D: 




 Recommended, essential reading - I don't care! Gimmie!  




 I masturbated during my grandmother's funeral.

*Well.* 




 I'm not sure if I like bananas.. 




 As a Mancunian - I have no idea.

At least we're winning in something other than football! All we need now is Masturbation as an olympic sport, and we'll be champs. 




  I masturbated during my grandmother's funeral.

How the hell did you manage that..? 




 Fall in your dream. Wake up. Dangling from a rope god know how high up.

Pants wil be shat in. 




 Yes. I was in a LD for just under 2 years, and the times when we met were the best I ever had. I'm in England, she was in Belgium. Nothing like getting tacklehuggedkissed at the train platform. 




 There might be nanobots inside, be careful! We don't want another "Mummy" situation. 




 I have the client downloaded at home, and I made my account last night. I'm just wondering, is there a free trial period?

Also, I'm looking forward to playing. I haven't read much into it, as I signed up and downloaded last night on a whim after seeing a billboard ad on the way home from work 




 I should really get on more.. Steam Sales has me hooked again. Still only at ilvl 365, so I can't queue for LFR yet. 

Soon. 




 serious procrastination. if there's something I need to do, I'll put it off. Everything. Ever.

I should be working now 




 I'm coo' with it. I get back from work and it's a new bunch of games. :D 




 Graham Linehan was tweeting a few links. Caught me hook, line and sinker.

Coooool. 




 It's like a horrible car crash. It's horrible, but you gotta look at it. 




 There's a good amount of pony subreddits. A pretty daft amount, now I think about it. 

There's a subreddit for each character, the main sub, the NSFW sub, the sad sub, the stoner pony (stony) sub.. I could go on.

Maybe they're all posting at the same time. 




 There are some of the fans (myself included) who aren't pony nutcases, and I generally keep my pony antics in /r/mylittlepony, but there are always fans who let it leak a bit too much, though. 




 You're makin' that sound like a bad thing, Sugahcube.[](/squintyjack) 




 Aaaw! Why do BC's look so awesome when you put them in a neckerchief? 

I'm going to get one and see if mine will chill with it. 




 Okie-dokie-lokie, I'll drop you a PM with my address. 




 Cool! Do you wish to initiate the mailings, or shall I? 




 I have Skyrim already. :P 




 If it helps any, I'm English and I love visiting historical sites.

Should've said, really: I'd love to travel to far flung places, as well! I might jump in my car and visit a few of the English sites, and I'm definitely going to head to Ireland at some point. I've always wanted to visit Giant's Causeway 




 ISHYGDDT

(I seriously hope you guys don't do this.)
 




 Sure am! I'll drop you a PM with my e-mail 




 Whenever I go to the city centre, I usually park in a little car park just past Salford Central. Just off New Bailey Street, before it becomes Bridge Street

If you've got a satnav, put in Browncross Street. If not, when you go under the bridge with Salford Central, turn left down the side street just after Stephensons. 

Parked there a while back for a few quid, though it's a bit of a walk for the Arena.  




 I didn't get one..

:( 




 Indeed! I'll PM you my e-mail 




 I had a terrible time with Sky. The first month we had, we had fantastic speed, then for about 5 or 6 months after that, the speed we had was abysmal. I was lucky if I could download a 3 or 4 MB file within a few hours

I lost my temper with it so many times I ended up buying a 3G dongle 'til my dad saw sense with it. 




 Nokia.

I fell off the wagon and got an iPhone, then realised my mistake. I'm on my N8 now. Admittedly, Symbian is a pile of balls, but it makes phone calls, sends messages and lets me dick about on Reddit and Google+ just fine. 




 I lived on that for months. Had a horrible comedown. :( I'm a sucker for citrus energy drinks. 




 I think Youtube has issues with popular videos. It might stick at a number for a long time. 

Usually when I check it again a week later or something, It'll be (somewhat) accurate 




 Up for writing to anywhere, really! Get a grasp on how other people live their lives compared to mine.

I'm a bit of a technophile, and I love games and gaming in general. If I'm not working or gaming, I'll probably be lurking on the internet, or in the pub.  




 Unfortunately, I'm on the piss in Newcastle for the work's annual christmas do.

Maybe next time! 




 I have been swayed! I'm going to finish Skyrim tonight (I'm on the last quest for the main story now) and I shall resub tomorrow, maybe. 




 Aye, true. But still. xD I'll finish Skyrim and see if I can get back in the swing of things with my holycow 




 Picking up, huh? :) Might be tempted to resub, though I'm trying to kick my habit of playing games all day every day, and I've still got Skyrim to finish! 




 I was visiting Florida back in '04 and was in Orlando. After hearing many hurricane warnings, we headed back to the hotel (we were on a ground floor outside facing room), closed the windows and put a towel or 5 against the front door.

Slept straight though it. Totally missed it. As ol' blighty never gets any extreme weather, I was kinda gutted 




 At my desk at work. Bolton - England. 

Dullest town in England, I assure you. :P 




 Indeed you may!

Also, obligatory /r/tattoos subreddit plug. :D 




 Hah. Maybe. :P No rush, though! Don't go crazy on behalf of me. :P 

I'm a little broke at the moment, so I'm cutting back on stuff. WoW being one of them. 




 Fair enough! If you hit 85 before december, drop me a message - I'll come heal a dungeon or two for yous :D 




 I played for a little while - though I've gone off WoW recently. I've got a few days left of gametime, but then my sub runs out. If you're in the 85's, I'll come heal some dungeons for you, see if I still got it. :D 




 My lights are working a-ok, but you just reminded me that one of my Reverse lights are out.

I shall fiddle with it later, thanks for the reminder! :D 




 Not completely finished yet - Still need to get it coloured in.

Paul is an awesome artist, but his waiting list is huuuge! I'll try and get a clearer picture for when it's finished.

the dragon is a personal character of mine. [Jen Philpot](http://jocarra.deviantart.com) was the artist who drew the original picture. Paul modified it a little so it'd fit my arm 





























 I find myself going a few weeks without masturbating at times. It's not even like I abstain, I just don't feel like it most of the time.

So yeah, it depends on the person and how they say it, and situation dependant. 




 I'm writing one at the moment. I have a backstory and an ending in mind. The rest is as it goes.

Though i'm doing a _lot_ of procrastination on that. 

I'd say so! 




 My border turns 11 this year too! He's still as manic as ever. I think they Immortal, sometimes. 




 Apps on smartphones. I see other people's handsets and they're absolutely overloaded on silly games, gadgets and other faffery. 

I have a couple of News apps and a music mood thinger, and that's it. I can't sit and stare at my phone for extended periods of time. 




 "Dude, it's been like 10 years. Wait 'til you see the fucking sweeet flying car I learned to fly. I can do loops and shit with it, though I have bumped a few kids on their hoverboards.

Also, dude. Space Marines are _real_" 




 Thanks! I love making up characters - though I never thought I'd make one for the ME universe. Yet another character to wander around in my head. :D 




 Well, that's what I get on average a month. I get about 60MPG when I drive well enough 




 As someone who fills up once per month on a payday - the whole Panic Buying thing _really_ ticked me off today. I was forced to buy the Premium stuff because I like to run my tank to fumes before filling up.

Yeah, Kinda my own fault, but the whole thing kicked off on Monday - guess who had no money until today. :(

300 miles to a tank though. Bitchin'. 




 I'd probably be a Quarian Engineer.

Rei'einya vas Sayania - Left the Migrant fleet to embark upon his pilgrimage, and is still on it! He has spent years wandering the Galaxy, salvaging, fixing and interacting with the other races as he goes.

In his travels, he's managed to save up enough credits to buy himself a small frigate, which he uses to travel to and fro. He is a free spirit and is even considering returning to the Migrant Fleet, to announce his plans to remain outside the fleet. He'll visit, obviously, but he enjoys exploring and meeting new people far too much.

(Oh god, did I just make a Mass Effect OC? Keelah..) 




 It was a sort of nick I came up with a few years back. Stuck with it longer than all my previous alias' - and it's better than;

Coolio55, Cid55 and NatH 




 Doctor Who. There are so many mind fucks on your first run, watching it all again isn't the same, you know what goes down.

Also - Mass Effect, because aside from the ending, holy shit all 3 games were amazing.

 My friend went in there and did the test, He knew it was all grip strength that sent the reading wacky. It was funny as hell. If the poor guy interviewing him believed it worked, he must have thought my friend was a proper nutjob 




 [](/hahaha) Not OP - but I airsoft a fair bit.

Most airsoft guns are battery powered, some pistols are gas powered though. If you're hiring on site, most places will offer replica coloured guns, though you can buy your own two-toned with no UKARA Licence

Airsoft shots sting like a bitch, but not as bad as paintball - I think a single hit anywhere on the body will count as a kill.

Obviously, rules can vary site to site.

As for your knockout - Go for it, it'll be funny. Take vids.

 Fuck, it hurts just even thinking about it... 




 If you were the Goofy in Florida in 2004, and the stupid teenager ran away from you - My bad, you chased me a little bit. It was warm and I can only imagine how you felt in the suit. 




 Aw, and I got all excited then too.
Welp, now I know how to fuck with people. :D 




 Because cake is ace. 




 Must have been about 6 years ago now, we were just getting into DnD and we were in the process of creating our characters. 

Most of us had already read through the rulebook and were in the process of refining them, our other friend was still reading through, picking his class and traits and all that. 

It was pretty late on, and the host's little sister was asleep.

Suddenly, with absolutely no warning, the guy reading the rulebook just shouted out "I CAN'T READ"

We blinked - assumed he meant he couldn't read, and was looking at the pictures in the rulebook. We were rolling around the place laughing.

He looked totally dumbfounded and then was all "Ah! No! My character! Not me!"

It was too late, the little sister had woken up, and we were in for shit when the host's parents woke up. 




 Hmm.. I've always thought of this. I'd go for a Augmented Reality interface, coupled up with a personal HUD embedded in my vision. With a sweet aesthetic look - much like SFX contact lenses. 

I could turn the Augmented view off with a series of blinks though, I could see it getting in the way if I ever just wanted to see something pretty.

And maybe some kind of heat resistant material on my hands. I burn my hands all the damn time picking up pans and oven trays and shit.  




 Yeah.. I was gonna say. I took Tali and Garrus and saw them on the cinematic.

Eh. I'm still confused. 




 Wait, the guys you take died on the beam?

I was so immersed, I didn't even notice, I was just all "GOTTA GET TO THE BEAM"...

I feel bad now. 




 I think they're still on the Tom + Jerry chef stuff in the UK

(Van driver - I pass them all the time) 




 Custard Creams. Man, I'll kill for those things. 




 I didn't _hate_ the ending.. I just hated the lack of sense it made, and the complete lack of a follow up to either choice you made.

[No matter what, Shep dies (Unless you get that secret ending), but no matter the choice you have (Synth, destruction or control), the Relays get destroyed, and all we're left with is a Normandy Crash Landing on an unknown planet with your crew who were with you not 15 minutes ago, running behind you before you got fried](/spoiler)

_There's no follow up, that's what makes me mad._ What Shep did at the end was totally in character, he'd do that if it meant it would end the threat. 




 Hah, hey there fellow Brony! :D [](/hahaha)

I'll just echo [Honilee's](http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/qsdun/i_was_routed_here_by_some_bronies/c403dzi) comment, discovering the sub and the community just gave me that sense of "Dude.. This is me." and there's others like me. 




 Ho, dawgies, I've been digging in ASDA's blind bags.

 Aah, I was in Blue last year. We were camped next to some guys playing some crazy Toilet Roll + Water bottle drinking game.

I am making a pathetic attempt to gain facial hair.

It is miserably failing. 




 Dude, where were you camped? You look awfully familiar.  




 I dropped history in my 4th year, took on Geography instead

In the 3 years I did take history though, I learned absolutely naff all, really. 

We were more focused on the World Wars, Ancient Egypt, and I remember this point where we focused on this fella dubbed "Peat Man" 




 Despite how much I hate Hollyoaks (British TV soap opera - total bollocks), [I quite like the intro](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iL6gZJC48c feature=related)

 I would! If in a year I still want a pony-related tat, I'll get one. Subtle-like.

Shaile is pretty much ready for raiding. 366 ilevel currently, Valour capped this week, which is a pain, but I'll replace my current 333 trinket and 346 ring when the reset hits wednesday, should be good to LFR then!

 I can't find the image again, and I never saved it. Kicking myself for that. I remember it being a cleaning cart with a paragraph on it 




 Seriously. I've been stuck in a dead end job for 5 years running now, and after seeing one image a few weeks back, I realised what the hell I was doing - absolutely nothing.

I am now in the planning stages of starting my own business - an LAN centre (I've a passion for gaming and socialising)
I'm now in the mindset that _I can totally fucking do this!_

I'm inquiring into properties and this weekend, I think I'm going checking out one of the places I've eyed up.

So again, from the very bottom of my heart, Thank you, /getmotivated.

Stay Hungry. 




 Levelled a hunter to 85, raided with him in heroic WoTLK content and most of Cata normals. Currently levelling another on a different realm + faction.

1. Nope - Int was _okay_ back before Cata, but with the change to Focus, Int is useless now. Get the mail gear (or the leather set at a push)

2. It's not too bad - but I'm not too much of a PvPer, I arena'd with a Holydin for a bit in WoTLK and I had a fair bit of fun kiting warriors and paladins

3. Depends. Questing is BM hands down. Get a bear or another [Tenacity pet](http://www.wow-petopia.com/). Personal tank!  If you're Dungeon levelling, (It's been a while for me) it doesn't really matter, whichever suits your playstyle.

I wear a beanie at work. 




 Coolio55

Yeah. Habbo Hotel, baby. 




 Music tastes are subjective. Everyone has their own.. style that they like best. SOAPF and Reroute to Remain really do it for me with In Flames 




 I think I'll be lynched by r/metal (again) for this, but In Flames. A Sense of Purpose was a bit meh, but Sounds of a Playground Fading is my new favourite album. :D

Anders has changed his vocal style from a deep growl to a more.. screamy style. But it's a nice one. They've gotten a lot more melodic too. They've been going 22-ish years now, to be fair. 




 Not necessairly weird or crazy, but I can only remember bits and peices, but it's been the only dream I've remebered for months.

It's a normal day. Walking in the town centre on a cold winter's day.. and it suddenly gets warm. Warm enough to take the jacket I was wearing off and wrap it around my waist.

It's getting warmer and warmer, I look up, wondering if we just happened to catch a good day... The sun was much bigger than before. It was getting bigger.

All of a sudden, I'm in some kind of Canyon, steam rising from the river at the bottom.  I must be flying, because I look down and I'm right over the chasm, I've no body. The sun was supposed to be setting, though if it was midday, it probably would have taken up half the sky at least.

Then suddenly, an explosion over the horizon. I look back up, A wall of white rips the canyon below me apart. There is nothing left.

I wake up. Somehow the curtains were open and the sun was right in my face.  

I think I witnessed the end of the world. 




 Lets see...

 Way too many. My head is a whirly-swirly bastard machine full of ideas. I might try pitching an idea at some point, they're super fun to watch in my head. 




 It's my cake day too!

It's not going too bad, actually. Quite boring. 




 It was 2002 (or somewhere around that time)

Furbies were just starting to gain popularity and we were on holiday in Turkey. We saw them. My 12 year old self and my 8 year old sister _had_ to have one.

I settled for a green one, and my sister went for a black and white one.

We played quite happily with them for a day or two. Poking its belly, sticking our fingers in their mouth, all that jazz.

There was that one night, it was stormy as all hell outside, our parents were at the hotel bar downstairs, me and my sister were in the room, trying to sleep on the sofas, Furbies on the tables opposite us.

The lightning cracked outside, giving the room that lighting you see in horror movies (you know, with the cracked shutters?)

They were there. Staring at us, eyes wider than fucking dinner plates.

These things close their eyes when they "sleep". But there they were, staring at us. My sister was on the other sofa, and hers was doing the same. I heard her start to wail.

"Feed me!"

I don't think I ever punched a toy so hard in my life. 

Since then, not heard a peep off the thing, it's hiding in the attic. Somewhere. Not sure where. I'm always careful when I go up there, though. Demonic little bastards. 




 I'm currently on the "How can I do it?" step.

Mainly because I've no fucking clue what's going on and and stepping way out of my comfort zone on this. 




 Thanks, you too, my good man! 




 Crash Bash was legendary. Wasted many a weekend with my sister playing it. 




 So, today (Yesterday? Meh. it's 1am) was my birthday, and I got to thinking.
What the fuck am I doing? I mean, yes, I'm planning this whole internet/gaming caf thing out, but there's this part of me that knows I'm pretty much secure in this job that I have right now. It's boring as fuck though, and I've been doing it for two years now.

(and that's only because I got shifted department. I did 3 1/2 years in the most soul sucking department ever known to have existed, and I'd still be there now if it wasn't for the fact that I slacked off a bit.)

I digress

I'm a big fat pansy when it comes to security. I've been working almost every day since I was 13. It started with my little paper round I picked up, and since then, my jobs have overlapped each other, only leaving the prior once the workload eventually sent me mad. So that puts me at nearly 10 years working. I went to college for a year (Americans, College here is 16-18. University is 18+) I dropped out after a year, because I couldn't fucking stand it.

Unless I grow a fucking backbone and learn that being a fucking warehouse lackey is an "Inbetween jobs" job and that I should kick my own ass into finding funding and property for my ideas, I'm going to be stuck there for years and years and years. Even the prospect of that pisses me off.

On another point - I live in England. Our nightlife, like many others revolves around getting drunk, flirting, pulling and eventually having sex. Mostly.
Girls won't even look at me twice if they're not drunk.

Here's my problem. I'm not much of a drinker. I'll go out, maybe have a few bevvies, hang out with the lads, then the girls are completely wasted and start flirting with everyone. Every fucker in that bar is out for a one night stand - I'm Asexual - no fucking interest in sex whatso-fucking-ever. Going out on a weekend is a waste of my money, and a waste of my time.

Every few weeks, I lie in bed, thinking. "What the fuck, man. Everyone you know is getting girls, getting engaged and being happy. What have you got? Fucking no-one."
I get sad as hell, and start thinking I'm destined to live alone, that creepy dude living in that flat upstairs all on his own, never leaving except to work. But what the fuck am I to do? I sure as hell don't give a fuck about sex (Aha, pun!), so any relationship I wish to pursue will end up falling apart after a few weeks, because "He's that guy who never puts out, even for his girlfriend"

There. Vent over. If you read it... thanks, I guess? 




 I'm a big scaredy cat when it comes to healing. When I'm on a roll, I'm quite happy. One little fail will send me on a downward spiral of "Oh god I'm terrible why did I even try" as some might have seen a few weeks ago.

I'm a little busy this weekend, but after work (dependant on how I'm feeling, too!) I might give healing another try and see how it goes 




 The fact that _everyone_ is different. No two people are alike - personality wise. There are so many different people to mee, though it makes me a little sad that I'll never get to meet them all. :(

That, and the small acts of kindness I occasionally see. I always feel better after seeing one, then I usually go and do 3 or 4 myself. 




 Visited back in '07. Didn't want to leave. Everyone I met was super-chill and happy to chat for a little bit. My choices would either be Belgium, Sweden or Canada. :D 




 I've lost me authenticator!

I've ordered a new one, but I'm not going to detach my old one until my new one comes in. I'm a little wary of hackers, and I've spent waaaay too much time earning all the gold I have across the realms I play(ed) on. Not risking losing it, even if I can get it back off a GM. xP

~~Hopefully, It'll be here soon.~~ Sorry for not posting earlier. :(

(Disregard that, It got here this morning! See you in game tonight. :D)

~Zeifey 




 Love the Flair! Surprised you put Bolton in there. :P
Layout's pretty cool too. Thanks for the work! :D 




 With the rise of Smartphones and laptops, would an internet Caf be widely used? 




 I'm the same. My nails become nothing if I'm in shotgun, the backseat - I'm not as bad. 

I usually drive when with friends, just for the sake of my sanity! 




 After my abysmal attempt at healing in yesterday's HC dungeon, I think I'll roll with what I know best until I get back into the game (I've been off for a few months)

Gonna roll on with my Hunter (Zeifey) for a while. Might hit 85 end of this week, or mid next week if all goes to plan!  




 Fucking hate this thing. Guaranteed I'll see it every week before I go to bed. (Someone will post it at 1am. They just know, the bastards) 




 Smoked up for the first time last night and got a serious case of the coughs.

I have learned now, and will buy this next time. 




 I wub you too, Karma! [](/raritydaww) 




 I use an Emulator with my copy of the game. I've got a new-ish GPU and it still struggles on very busy environments. Make sure your PC is powerful enough! 




 Shameless copy paste from a reply before:

I toked up tonight with the lads. I didn't reach a [10]. I probably reached somewhere along the lines of a [2] or a [3] I just found things funny for no reason and felt really sleepy.

Then we ordered takeaway and played some halo. 




 Thanks for the advice. I actually toked up tonight with the lads. I didn't reach a [10]. I probably reached somewhere along the lines of a [2] or a [3] I just found things funny for no reason and felt really sleepy.

Then we ordered takeaway and played some halo. 




 Pefect, thank you! Just what I was looking for. We'll be smoking up at their place, and they're my best mates - so I've no worries there. :) 




 Nice one! Wish I was there to cheer you guys on. Next time, you'll have the one lone hunter on, cheering you on from /g :P 




 I've only ever seen Star Wars: Episode 1, the Phantom Menace.

I plan to remedy this, soon. 




 I've not really smoked many cigs, either. I have done a few though, so a joint would probably be best for me. (I have also used a hookah, but with Shish flavouring) 




 I've never smoked before, and for the past few months, I've been considering giving it a try. I know a few smokers IRL, so I'll probably be lighting up with those guys, but they can't really remember their first blaze - it was a while ago

So I've come to you guys for a bit of help.

What should I expect from my first time, so I don't freak out? I think the guys usually just do joints, but they do own bongs. Which is more intense, which would you recommend?

If there's a comprehensive thread on this, feel free to whack me on the head and tell me to go over there. 




 Me too, brony. I actually welled up a little bit. And that's only reserved for when I get hurt lots or other various bad things. 




 I just got back from The Darkest Hour, but I still welled up like it was my kid who just said "Daddy" for the first time. 

I'm not even a dad!

[](/raritydaww"I might just have to take up Babysitting..") 




 [](/allmybits"SHUT UP AND TAKE MY BITS") 




 Dude. I just got finishing watching The Office (US) for the first time.

He's not that crazy, I assure you.
Maybe a little bit crazy. 




 Yeah, but they're cool guys. Pretty relaxed place. I mean, who lets us flings a screaming stuffed monkey around the offices and joins in after 3 or 4 throws? :D 




 I remember when I was offered a job, my name must have been passed around the office as "New guy [train_subject8542] is starting Monday." I had so many friend requests even before I started. xD 

Turns out that total random guy "poking" me 2 weeks before I started was my boss. 




 3.50 for my usual poison in the local. Pint of cider.

Pissed myself when they asked for 7 for a Double Vodka+Coke when I was in Newcastle 




 I'm a member, but I've not been for some time.
It's quite a ways out for me to come down often (I'm in Bolton)

I miss it, but, hey. I usually hung out on the upstairs bouldering walls, and the downstairs ones. I wasn't much of a climber. I belayed a lot, though! 




 True. It's still bloody cold though. : 




 My windscreen was iced this morning, are you in an alternate dimension?! 
























 God.
Damnit.

I will find you, and I will play Barbie Girl RIGHT AT YOU
 




 /r/whatsthisbug might enjoy this one.  




 I just said "If you want me for anything, I'm super active on Google+"

Got the one circle notification a week later. If they don't want to join, let 'em be.

I still have my FB open, but I connect it to nothing, just in case some distant friend wants me for something. 




 Motivated me to lose weight.

/r/keto 

and /r/getmotivated got me going. Now it's just a case of keeping at it. 




 (Sorry for the thumbnail there, it's all I've got on the guy, a photo of the sign taken while out running) 









 I drink a lot of Jack Daniels + Apple Juice when I go out sometimes. Stuff's killer.

If I'm feeling particularly flash, I go for White Russians. (Kahlua, Vodka, cream and milk)

Abide. 




 Applejack. Followed by my own art.
Followed by more ponies.

Yeah, that's me alright.

 A bit of both, really. My home city was ravaged by a plague, forcing survivors to flee. 

During my escape attempt, I was confronted by a wolf. I didn't really learn I was cursed until my 3rd transformation, at that point, I had gained some control over the beast inside.

I have since made it to another city, but the situation here is so tough, I'm merely making ends meet by doing odd jobs here and there, before leaving the city at night, just in case.

And, for my dietary needs, I have been eating a lot more meat. Rarer, too. Comes with the species, I suppose. 




 I'm 25, and I'm a female, if that counts for anything. Only one other person knows of my curse, and she's sworn to keep it secret. 




 Feels good having a local lad win the gold! Went to school and hung in the pub 2 minute down th' road from my current residence. 

We're ripping it up in the Velodrome, eh? They were right with "Home turf advantage" Never seen the brits go mad for it like they have been doing for the past week and a half 




 Obligatory /r/asexuality plug

 That's pretty easy, It was one of my first.

I was hired by a Canir - A canine-looking race of people - to find her husband - who had gone missing a year or two ago, who was a Human. Now, I'm not one for interracial relationships - but hey, who am I to argue?

Anyway, after a month or two I found the poor guy begging in one of the slums on a Purseus station. He'd come here to get some "Augs"

Unfortunately, the guy didn't read the T Cs correctly and got filled with untested Augs. Became a Guinea Pig. It was like looking at a Picasso Painting. Didn't want to go home to his partner, so he spent years on Purseus. Took him back after a lot of persuading. 

He wasn't the only guy affected by these cowboy implanters. Station #7 is filled with them.

But what got me the most, was despite his grotesque appearance, his partner still took him back without so much as a second look at him.

Love is a helluva drug. But you won't ever catch me with Augs, even though every other D in the Universe is rocking them. 




 I change it up. 

Sometimes, I'll wear a button-up shirt open, over a plain t-shirt or just a plain graphic tee, either wearing jeans or cargo pants.
Skate shoes or steel-toed work boots.

I have long hair, pretty much always tied up in a Ponytail
(I'm Male)
 




 They're pretty common out in the far reaches of the Andromeda, but the areas close to the transporter gates are squeaky clean, although the songs you speak of aren't really well known any more. It's all about the thumping basslines and the wacky synthesiser in most places.

Don't get me started on the "Dames". You wouldn't believe how many times I've been tailing a guy and he's sent a fine lookin' lass over to "see" me. More often than not, it's a distraction. They're easy to spot when they're only a distraction. Comes with the job. 




 Toan is pretty robotic, really. He's a little boring, but he's really helpful! I should really get a fun AI one day, just to see his reaction.

Travelling times between galaxies are pretty instantaneous, the gates enable this - it's just the travelling _to_ the gates that take time! Most gates are a few days travel from the more popular areas, thanks mostly to FTL travel. 

So in short - Average is a few days.

None of us really know how the gates work, though.

Might be a good motivation to actually fully jump on board! 




 Can't talk too much about my latest quarry, hell, don't know much about him myself yet. 

It's the year 2150 in standard Earth (Not like that means much anymore..), though the rest of the Universe has their calendars set at 6630.

I have a small frigate I pilot alongside my ship's AI, Toan

Ask me Anything!  




 I may have misheard that, but did he say something about "The President of the United Kingdom"?

Edit: After a re-listen on my home speakers rather than my crappy work speakers, he says "Leaders, past and present of the United Kingdom" 




 Oh, cool. It was such a strange find for me, I've never seen anything other than a normal Moth.. It looked like a fuzzy ball with wings. 




 Not entirely sure where it might have come from, though - it flew out from behind a box in the back of a courier's van. 









 [](/pinkiefear)And now, reading your post, I have realised the exact same thing.

  [](/00) Yes! Season 2 didn't get nearly enough AJ-centric episodes. 




 I'm heading in this weekend. I'll be in a cowboy hat. Lurking with two cosplayers. If you spot us, wave! 




 Oh man. I played with First and Only in the Rochdale area - they had a mill before the place was closed down for demolition, I think.

Anyway. It was the last game, so it was fancy dress day. I turned out in full pirate gear. Sash, frilly shirt, headband. The works.

We had a guy who looked similar to the Sniper from TF2, and the only other guy I can remember was a guy in full 80's disco getup.

Lets just say, to anyone observing on the outside, A pirate with a latex knife chasing a guy in a disco getup looked pretty hilarious.

Or serious, if they didn't know gaming was going on.

 Any chance of sharing the skins? I'm interested in that music one.. Vinyl is best. 




 Pretty much lurking all day. 




 My dog, once being presented his dish of food, will wait until I have left the room before he proceeds to eat.

I tested this. I put his dish down, and stood on the other side of the same room. He just looked at me until I walked through the door. 




 I feel like I've accomplished something now. 




 Not directly, but Commander Shep in ME3. The ending I got... I cried 




 It all depends on the driver of the car - in the UK, we insure the car for certain people to drive it. 

For example, if it was just my dad on the policy, it might cost about 700 for him, because he's been driving way longer than I have, and he's in the lesser risk age group. 




 It really is a rip off - but build up a decent no claims and it'll go right down.

Up until this month's renewal, I was paying 2,200 for my insurance - I drive a Toyota Aygo. A reliant robin could probably go faster than me on long straights.

Seems like I'm plugging, but Insure the Box have brought my premium right down - my renewal this month is 1,011. Sure you're getting tracked, but I look at it this way - if it gets nicked, the insurers probably know where it is. 




 Yeah, I saw that.. "Wait, he's done it _again?_" 




 Radio 2 is awesome, though I just tune in for Ken Bruce and Jeremy Vine. Evans and Wright annoy me a little bit.

Moyles just sends me in a frothing rage if I'm stuck in the office and someone has Radio 1 on. 




 Our company has an incentive: Go an entire working year (For us - Oct 1st to Sept) and you'll qualify for...
An extra day on your paid days off.

I'd much rather take a sickie or two.. 




 Interlink/DPD aren't too bad - don't know the costs, mind.

We use them where I work and everything arrives in one piece.  




 She's usually posting naked pictures of character's she's voiced.

Tara is the troll queen of Twitter. 




 Right on. Hopefully it was theirs! No idea why it'd be in Bolton, though! 




 You're form Farnworth? Awesome, as am I. 




 As I said in the title, long shot. This is the closest I can get to Bolton on reddit!

Was heading down Hacken Bridge Lane in Farnworth. (Connects Little Lever to Bolton, pretty much) and there was a lady looking a little confused pulled over by the side of the road. There's an albino Ferret bouncing about the place.

After a little while, the little guy jumped in the lady's hand. A quick box was made and she took it home - She said she'd call the RSPCA once she got home.

The little guy was definitely a pet. He was scared, but very friendly and ran all over my back and shoulders.

If you know anyone who's lost a Ferret, the RSPCA probably has him/her! 




 There's some at various car dealerships, but north of the city, and within the city itself, I haven't really seen them. Though I've not really actively looked for them. 




 First use the Every X minutes too, but before I thought "Fuck it, I'll get a car", the service I used to catch to get to work was on a "One every 10 minutes" service.

I was waiting for nearly an hour once. (Got to the stop about 8:15 - bus got there about 9am) 




 I think they retconned the Thermal clips into the ME lore, rather than have it introduced as a new tech.

Of course, I'm probably talking out of my arse. 




 Gravy on _everything_

Yes! Even _Ice Cream_! 




 We let 'em have it this year. We all got distracted by the shiny thing on fire outside this time 




 Please! At least Pies can hold gravy without walling apart!

Speaking of gravy - have you all learned that Gravy is amazing on chips yet? 




 Yeah - Well.
We have all the pies! We don't need none of your nancy southern shitey food. 




 Not sure, really - I'm not too in depth with the technical stuff - might wanna check for a virus or something.. Might have fuddled with your settings or something. But yeah, /flushdns pretty much makes your DNS server get its shit together.

Glad it worked for you! Didn't work for mine, though! Your DNS server is what "decodes" www.google.co.uk into 74.125.131.94 

Bash that IP into your browser, and it loads google. If your DNS is malfunctioning, if you put in a website's IP, it'll still load fine.

If your computer's DNS is screwy, there's a few public ones you can use, too. Normally a flush usually fixes problems. 




 My aunt's latop has this issue as well. If you can, try flushing your DNS - might be that. Might as well renew your IP while you're at it.

go to cmd:

    ipconfig /release
    ipconfig /renew
    ipconfig /flushdns

 




 I walk down here occasionally. You get to it by walking through Moses Gate park. It's probably a good mile and a half to reach the canals, but it's a really nice walk. 




 [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORQFk5GcgFI), last night

Didn't stop for 20 minutes. 




 I played the Beta Weekend #3 and I'll probably be playing when I get home for the final weekend beta

From what I played last week, it didn't seem too bad - the combat was a bit standard really, but I liked the "Class" mixing you could do. I was running around with a hammer and a shotgun and was doing pretty well.

I did a solo dungeon and it was more based on infiltration and disabling security rather than tanking and spanking your way through the place. If the group dungeons kept this up, I could see it being really interesting!

My main issues were with the combat and the quests.

 When an NPC offers two kinds of the same quest, it gets annoying having to run back to the same guy, then probably run back off to where you came from 




 I had a waterproof MP3 player a while back. (I've lost the charger cable since, and it wasn't your basic MicroUSB port)

I'd recommend this, though! http://www.amazon.co.uk/Speedo-Aquabeat-1GB-Waterproof-Player/dp/B0017KRAFK/ref=tag_stp_s2_edpp_url 




 He deleted the entire story. :( 




 Surely you checked inside?
What was in? I am curious. 




 You owe me a new monitor. I just punched mine out of instinct. 




 I was driving back to work after a quick trip across Manchester. I was using the Motorways, as it was about a 20 mile journey.

I was about 500 meters to the exit slip road I needed to take, and the road I was on was a sweeping right turn and my tyre burst. 

I tried as hard as I could to keep the car straight by gripping the wheel as tight as possible and trying to hold it right, but the damn thing was rocking harder than a metalhead at a Slayer gig.

Eventually, one of the other tyres blew, and I was sent careering into the barrier seperating the two directions at 60MPH. Head on.

Hit the barrier, but it didn't totally stop me. My car did a full 180 and hit the barrier with the back end. This stopped me. 

I was now facing oncoming traffic, whizzing past me at 65-70MPH.
Luckily, the lunch rush hour was done, and a fellow road user had pulled up on the hard shoulder when he saw me fling off the road. He waved me over, I was good to quickly drive over and hang on the hard shoulder.

Come to think of it - I was lucky to even start the car and move across lanes without getting taken out again, never mind surviving and having not even a single scratch or injury. 




 but I h(av)e no urge to have sex with them, at least at this point.

That's generally the basic definition of Asexuality - A lack of Sexual attraction/desire

Asexuals still have a _romantic_ attraction, and are labelled much like their "Sexual" labels. (Hetero, Homo, Demi, Pan), (Just replace [X]Sexual with [X]Romantic)

Aromantic Asexuals on the other hand have no desire for sex, nor relationships. They'd much prefer to have no relationships whatsoever and just do their thing through life.

That's the best way I can put it - if anyone else can explain it better, read theirs! I'm fairly new to the concept of Asexuality myself - only known about it for a few months (I also identify as a Hetero/Demiromantic Asexual) 




 Looks familiar. May have done a little parkour training there in the past. May go lurking later. 




 In my school, we had the normal kids, the chavs, and us. We hung around the same building every break we had. At first, There was just the 5 of us. We were pretty nerdy. 

We just hung around talking about games, and D D stuff. We were also into metal and rock, so we were outcast from the rest of the kids, who were mostly into Dance and R B and all that kinda stuff.

Anyway - 5 grew to 10, which grew to 20, which grew to the point where a few years after the inital 5 had left, the entire building would be pretty much swarmed by kids who were like us. They had to be dispersed at one point, I think.

They called us "The O-block crew"

Good question, Rarity. 




 I'm overweight. Been so for about 6 years.
I'm 19stone (266lbs - 120kg), and I'm 6'2". 22 years old

 I was an avid swimmer in my younger years and took part in meets and races. Due to this, I had a ravenous appetite which I appear to have kept for the last 8 years since I quit swimming to pursue studies. One minute I was a healthy weight, next I was just getting bigger and bigger. Luckily, the fat has spread around my body, rather than being focused on one part - though I'm very concious about my thighs when I'm sat down.

I've started to cut down on my intake, as well as go for long walks with the dog. I can walk for miles and miles just fine, but I can barely manage 1 minute of running.

I'm trying the C25K program, but my lungs despise me for it, though I'm going to keep pushing! 

My ideal weight is about 80lbs away. 




 I had this, but not as severe! I was lined up for this surgery too, but managed to outgrow it before my 16th.  




 Gender: Male

Colour: Red

Music: Anything goes, but mostly Metal

Film: Comedy/Action

Literary: Sci-fi

Hobbies: Airsoft, Gaming, Writing

Personality: Quiet, but a bit kooky once I get to know you. 




 He was delicious, apparantly.

That's what Grunt told me. 




 Mess Sargent Gardner! Your Cookie from ME2. 




 Thanks!
He's called Benny, though he generally goes by any exclamation that gets his attention.

Pal, Daft, Oi, Buddy, Fluffybutt. Just shout those and he'll come running and wagging his tail. 









 When I get a minor brainfart, I always remember Vertical coasters rock because they go straight down. 




 Worked all day. Stuck in a van in Manchester.
The Van had no air conditioning.  




 Tell me about it. Feels worse when you're in a metal box stuck in traffic with no aircon! 




 Oh wow. I remember seeing these in summer and they looked just like that. Kinda glad I didn't touch it now.

These are way off a beaten path, though, Guess that's why no-ones bothered with them.

 Oh no. Here goes all my free time.
Well, what was left of it anyway. 




 This one might need a bit of backstory to understand

Okay, so, back in September 2010, I had a tyre blow out on me on the motorway. I spun out and collided with the barrier twice, car was totalled.

Shortly after, I shaved all my hair off (It was a big deal, it was halfway down my back, had been growing it for about 6 years) I think I might have had a slight mental breakdown.

Anyway, I work with some very lax guys, not at all afraid of offending.

When I turned up to work with no hair, they fell off chairs laughing. Serial Killer [Raoul Moat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Northumbria_Police_manhunt) was all over the news, and I apparently looked like him.

I am now nicknamed Raoul. 




 I'm not sure what it's called, I played it last year at Download Festival

It's fairly simple.
Stick a 1/4 filled bottle between 2 teams. The teams can be any size. Try and get the space between the teams about 20ft.

Each team takes turns throwing the "ball" to try and hit the bottle. If you hit the bottle, your team grabs your cans, opens 'em and starts chugging. The other team has to run, stand the bottle up and retrieve the ball and get back to their line, and shout STOP!

It's made slightly difficult, as the "ball" is off shaped (We used Toilet Roll wrapped up in Duct tape) and is prone to bouncing all over the place.
Also, if that wasn't bad enough, if you somehow knock over one of the other team's cans, you gotta run and pick that up.

First team to get ALL their cans chugged is the winner! 




 Should anyone invade the pub, put on some Queen, and attack the intruders with cricket bats. Run around them to disorient 




 ... That sounds like something my boss would do.
Was there any chance that this man was shiny-head bald? 




 He sounds like an awesome shopkeeper. Where is this fine fellow located? 




 I think she was too busy "Blasting off aga^a^a^a^a^in" to be remorseful [](/fluttershy) 




 They played part of a new track when I saw them in October, it sounded totally awesome. RR have reached.. 12th in my all time most played, and I've been keeping that record going for about 5 years now or something. Kinda scary. 




 Manchester Ritz. I'm so excited. :D  It'll be my 5th time seeing them within a year. 




 Ah, Per Andreasson. Total dude. Spoke with him a few times after shows. Goin' watching them again on Tuesday! :D 




 Aha! Dude, that's awesome. 




 Hmmm, 
Feck it! Surprise me with the flair! :D

(Holy shit I actually saw this before the allotted time passed.) 




 Me and my sis were helping my dad pave the new bit of garden he was working on, so there was a huge pallet of bricks, and a huge bag of sand. I was throwing bricks onto the bag of sand, and my sister was running back and forth from my dad to where I was throwing the bricks.


I was throwing faster than she was carrying, but I stopped for a minute to take a breath.

I start throwing again, and I hear this pained scream, and "MUM! MUM!" 

It's my sister, running at my Mum with her middle finger raised. I'd thrown a brick right onto her awaiting hand, and it had made a pretty nasty gash right on her finger where the edge of the brick had landed. Needed stitches.

(I was about 13, sister about 9) 




 It's pushing the mile limit, but [Naughty Needles](http://www.naughtyneedles.co.uk/) in Bolton on Halliwell road is a good place, though unless you're after a small-ish tat, he's always pretty booked up.

Gone there for 2 tats, Paul is awesome. 




 Bolton, UK Checking in. Lived here all my life 




 I think the first album I personally bought was Feeder - The Singles (~2002)

I remember doing my paper round with my CD Walkman and cursing everytime the track jumped because I got off my bike too violently. 




 It's getting crazy in there.. Can't take the ponies [](/twicrazy) 

I'm all for a good pony spam, but Croikey, it's insane in there tonight. 




 Hobbies: Airsoft, Gaming, attempting to play guitar
Currently working in warehousing, looking for another job, possibly self employed maybe possibly. :D 




 I'd actually like a lot of the guns from the ME Universe, but I'm an Assault Rifle kinda guy, and the Avenger is one of my favourites. :D

I'll have to check out that pulse rifle, it's been a while since I've seen Alien. 




 I'd love a replica of the [M8 Avenger](http://gamerfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mass-effect-m8-replica-1.jpg) - from the Mass Effect series 




 [Created my own Shep. Like to think I didn't do too bad.](http://imgur.com/l1S3O) - even imported nicely too. Used Default femshep though

 




 I occasionally do a run to London, from Manchester

One day, heading back up the M40, just listening to the radio:

"Hey, I'm on the M6.. wait, when did that happen?"
 




 Yeah, I guess so. :P But I can only really see myself falling for a girl, so I generally put myself under the Heteroromantic tag. 




 Personally speaking - I have no physical attraction to anyone. It's a really hard thing to explain. In order to "Fall" for someone, I have to talk to them, get to know them, before I know. 




 Sounds a bit odd to me. Though you can't really judge until you get his story direct from him.

But yeah, feel free to message me later, I'll try and answer any questions you have to the best of my ability. :) 




 Alright, at my computer now, I can type without driving myself insane.

I can't really explain asexuality, since it's all I've really known sexuality-wise. All I know is, I have no attraction to anyone really. I can walk down a street of the hottest people in the world, and I probably wouldn't bat an eyelid or turn around, stare at chests, etc. (Well, maybe a little)

There's the various types of asexuals - Aromantic Asexuals (No interest in sex or a romantic relationship) and then there's the various Romantic Asexuals: Heteroromantic, Homoromantic, panromantic, etc.

I specifically identify as a Heteroromantic Asexual - I desire a relationship, but all that relationship would ideally consist of is hugs, cuddles, maybe some kisses, and generally sharing life together.

I know for a fact that won't happen unless I'm extremely lucky.

Some Asexuals in relationships might maintain an active sex life just because of their partner's needs, but won't pursue them to return the favour, so to speak.

That's probably the best way I can explain it. there's a subreddit ([/r/asexuality](/r/asexuality)) and [AVEN](http://www.asexuality.org/home/) (Asexual Visibility and Education Network) which can give _waaaaay_ more info than I can.  




 Asexuality isn't quite as clear cut as it seems. Everyone varies. But to answer your question, I personally lack sexual attraction and a lack of sexual drive. It's quite hard to explain. I can elaborate when I get home if you want? Typing on a phone is kind of awful 




 Yeah, sounds like it. I'm asexual and I'm only ever really roped into checking ladies out when my friends notice "Dat ass."

Damnit guys, I'm trying to eat cake here.

Also is your friend me? Sounds like it. 




 Hey! I drive one of these. I think it's a cool little thing, but that might be the MPG talking. 
























 I'm not much of a coffee man, myself. Prefer me a good ol' cuppa tea. PG Tips, preferably. (Comes with being English!)

But when I did have coffee, I had a Mocha. It's like a Hot Chocolate with a bit of a coffee-y taste to it.

Then I had an espresso a few weeks later without anything to eat. I was wired for an hour or two afterwards. 




 You've got a point on the LGBT(Q) getting a bit too long-winded

From what I've gathered being in the LGBT community for about a year, it's a support/awareness group

GSRM does encompass most orientations, even if a "new" one creeped up out of nowhere

Queer does sound a little out of place, to me, anyway. When I think og "Queer" I think of the old term - odd, different.  




 Eh, the menu I saw had those as the ingredients and that was the name. 

I've never even heard of Apple Pucker.. Is that a US thing? 




 White Russian:

Some Vodka,
Some Kahlua,
Some Milk,
Some Cream.

Mix to taste, pour over ice, Abide.


Also, an Applejack, tasty as hell:
Jack Daniels, a shot of Jager and some Apple Juice (Cider in the US) 




 The way I'd put it is "Hey man, you know that money I lent you a while back? Yeah, it's cool. Happy Christmas!" 




 I'm studying with Train2Game - I work full time so learning from home is my only real option, and fuck going to uni with those fees!

I'm an ideas man, mostly story ideas, but give me a few hours and I can come up with a game and gameplay style to suit it. xP 




 Nifty! Love it, especially easy on the setup, too. 




 I'd love to come! Although I'm not very far in my Game Design course, so I feel I'd be mad out of place. Any chance I can just stand and watch? :P 




 Added myself!  




 I used Travel Master for a party of 12 down to Donington.. Return was included in my quote too! 




 We had a sneak preview at B.U.C.K.

From what we saw, it's pretty cool and shows a lot of stuff! Stories from Bronies, and most importantly, how awesomely we party! 

[](/twiright) 




 Its like you just channelled me for a second there. So freaking excited!

I had no idea Meghan studied Mythology in College, that's going to be so interesting..

I can understand their love for world building, it's so much work, but it's fun and you can get your imagination out of your head and onto paper! A good world generally makes for a good story.  




 "Sup man?"
 




 The way I've done it with my Social Networks is nifty (IMO)

I've used Facebook for IRL friends and acquaintences.

Twitter is for Companies and things I want to follow, NASA, etc

G+ was new ground for me. I found new people to follow. Made new friends and new interests spawned out of it. 




 Google+

It's a really smooth experience compared to facebook and twitter.

Facebook is a giant clusterfuck of Apps, games, tickers, chats.. 
Twitter is all #, @ and whatever else. Looks a bit like a Cid (FFVII) rant

G+ has a simple interface and really easy to use, and sharing to certain people is easy too, with circles. 




 Thank you!
As a writer on EverfreeForest.com, I need something like this!

I don't have the time to read through all of EQD's posts for news, and when I come here, I just get distracted by all the awesome images and forget what I was doing!

Subscribed and Shortcutted, thank you! [](/joy) 




 In England, it's the same as usual. Grey, cold and rainy.
There's the added bonus of leaves, which after a week on the ground become very slippery, and the wet weather does not help.

God help the guy who thinks it's awesome to ride his bike through a park. 




 I'd be 260k richer. Shave off 4 inches to become 5'10" 




 I'm going for my 3rd tat in a few weeks, this one is going to be a 4 hour session.

All I can say is, only have the tattoo to mark a period in your life you never want to forget. All 3 of mine (Well, one is going to be incorporated into my new one) have a meaning to it, so I can never regret it. 




 I think it's a universal thing. I like to see where the needles are going, I can't see inside my own mouth unfortunately. A mirrror into my mouth would only make it worse, weirdly enough.

I've had about 4 hours of tattooing already, going for another 4 in a few weeks, but I cant get a jab in the gum from a dentist, I need to go under completely for someone to go in my mouth.

coming from a Brit, what's a Beta Blocker? 




 Me and Dentists.. Nah man.
I'm suffering from some really bad toothache, but I refuse to go back to my dentist.

Last time I went, he took a tooth but missed a bit. Instead of drilling or whatever some more, he just grabbed his tweezer-things, clamped onto it, wriggled it to loosen it, then yank it out.

I was _not_ looking forward to the anaesthetic wear-off, not one bit. 




 Currently, Warehouser. I'm going into Remote Software Training come the 22nd though. :D

 




 Sounds like my Border Collie, absolutely loses his shit when new people appear. 




 Looks like a Border Collie mixed with a.. Ah, I can't remember the name. That facial structure - I can just tell!

He's adorbs, how much of a shithead is he? 




 Your engine needs to be converted for that.

If you put cooking oil, or water into your tank, it'll fuck your engine bigtime. 




 Mine's white. Gets dirty well quick, but I only pay 98 a month on it, so I can't complain! 




 [Toyota Aygo](http://tajdrivingschool.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Toyota-Aygo-Platinum-111.jpg). :D
Gets roughly 60MPG 




 I can't be anywhere unsecure in the dark. Public parks at night on my own? Nope. This place is miles out of town, I go all the time and I still make a beeline for the exit when the sun starts setting. 




 My car normally get a good 70km out of a "block", so I'll mill about for 40km before filling up, just to be safe. 




 I'm feeling the pressure more these days, I'm on social networks a lot more, and I see brand new games getting a lot of hype and being talked about. 

Sometimes I felt like I could only join in if I got the game and played it!

Unfortunately, my wage doesn't allow me to buy games right off the bat, so by the time I get round to buying and playing, the focus has shifted off that game and onto another. 




 Don't forget Geordie Shore..  




 We both know all of reddit is just two guys.
Me and you. Stop talking to yourself, man! 




 At home? I have an ornamental axe. It's actually quite sharp and I cut my hand on it while mounting it on the wall.

Also, an Airsoft M4. I'd probably just bug them. Go for the eyes! 




 I'm 22, still at home.
I balanced my budget and with what I was earning, I couldn't get out. My parents are happy to keep me anyway. : 




 I was doing my paper round on my bike. Had to make a quick turnaround - missed one of the houses. Slammed on the front brake by mistake.

Front flipped over the handlebars and landed on my back. Paper bag full of Sunday Papers promptly landed on me, followed by my bike. Shit hurt for weeks. 




 Yeah. Ah well, it's only Karma. Felt like sharing my desk anyway.  




 I'm a bit of a mix of both here. I'm a brony, but I despise those who post damn near everything about ponies. 

I keep my ponies to the relevent subs, but my avatars (almost everywhere) are ponies. I try to be very pony quiet - posting ponies only in /r/mylittlepony and the fansite I'm on (for ponies) and I keep discussion relevent everywhere else

The avatars throw people right off though, but I just like the pastel coloured bastards so much. 




 I have a bunch, mostly on the fly, so daft easy to type with Swype, like
"Whee"
"Thing"
"Damn"
"Fuck" 









 He's driving in the overtaking lane.
As a rule, you're meant to stay in the left lane at all times, unless you're overtaking. 

By hogging the right lane, anyone going faster than him can't overtake, and if they undertake, well, shit could go down. 




 Not as busy as you are, though I'm working full time as a Warehouse guy, transitioning into a new role as a Software trainer, I'm doing a CompTIA A+ and Network+ course, as well as a Game Design course.

I'm also attempting to write a novel, but that's on the backburner.

I'm also an Administrator and a Site Writer for a fansite and its forums. 




 Oh.. Damn. Thanks for the update. 




 Adam Grahn, Jon Davis, Brian Johnson, Anders Friden, and despite the flak he gets - Chester Bennington 




 Take a look in /r/paranormal. Bit more of a relevant sub. 




 My rule of thumb is to look at a design, maybe sketch one up yourself, and look at it a lot.
Imagine it on your arm. Do this every few days, after a few months, book an appointment with an artist (The guy I usually go to has a 5-6 month waiting list, depending on session length)

If you're still up for it do it.

It's your body, don't let anyone dictate what to do with it - unless it's a visible part, like your face or something. 




 Met at school. I was awkwardly hanging around, my other buddies being on holiday. He and a group of his friends saw me and thought it'd be nice to keep me company while my old buddies were away. 

Been best mates since, they as a group changed me completely. But my best mate works with me. :D 




 Royal Republic - We are the Royal

In Flames - Clayman, all the way up to Sounds of a Playground Fading

Pendulum - Immersion

Linkin Park - Hybrid Theory, Minutes to Midnight and A Thousand Suns 




 I second this, singing along with music really helps keep me awake. Make sure it's songs you know, though. Concentrating more on the music rather than the road could make it worse.

I drive ~400 mile round trips sometimes for work and singing keeps me up in the last 100 miles ro so 




 I'm getting my 3rd tattoo next month, after I said to myself 4 years ago "Nah, tattoos aren't my thing" and then "I'll just have the one" 









 Instrumental: [Enya - Lothlorien](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=408lJ0svE0Q). Got major chills first time I heard this

I'll have to get back to you for a non-english, my library isn't that extensive yet, and I'm at work. :D

 Sweet Jesus!

Or my personal favourite: "Bollocks!" 




 if my brain is working correctly - which, to be honest, it rarely does..

If they caught up to him in the current time, they might see him get taken away by themselves. Much like when The Doctor and Rose went back to see Rose's dad, then went back again and saw themselves watching Rose's dad. 




 Mass Effect 3 was outstanding, the original ending was a bit deflating, but with the extended cut, I actually cried with the ending I picked.

A game has never done that to me, a fitting end for the 5 years I'd been playing the previous 2. 




 Mine's probably just past my shoulders now, due to mad working hours, I've just been tying it up in a ponytail.

When I get the chance, or when I'm going out places, I give it a quick wet, comb it back and apply some gel/hairspray to make it stay. Doesn't take too long.

Myself, I just tie it up in a plain ponytail, or just let it loose and let it do it's own thing. 




 Fuck.

Get out of my head, good sir. 




 This is where cars live!
Git you one! 




 I still haven't watched the entire Star Wars collection, Alien, Terminator, and most other "must watch" classics.

I always get "What, you've _never_ watched that?!" when asked about any of them. 




 Yeah, it's an odd one. 




 Ponies, Vore and.. uh... more ponies, really. 




 First and Only...  Man, used to play with those guys back in Rochdale.. I wish I could afford to play again, my M4's Hop-up is busted though. 




 Jus' stick me down as Demiromantic. I guess. :D 




 No. We're a species with incredible potential.

Yeah, we're dickheads most of the time, but all you need to do is look for the good, and it totally outweighs the bad stuff.

Plus, what's the fun in ending yourself? 




 Not to picky - but even in a relationship, I'm not really... sexual, if you get me. Sorry if I gave off the wrong impression! I meant Hetero-demiromantic  as in I feel I can only feel right in a romantic-only relationship with the opposite gender.  




 I am stapler man!

... I believe you have my stapler? Give it to me.

**fires staples at passing mugger* 




 "Yeah, yeah. That's cool." 




 I'm a 22/Male/Demi-HeteroRomantic

the best way I can see about doing this is getting AMA volunteers marked via Flair in /r/IAmA for the day or something - though that's down to the mods there..

I'm free most nights (6pm onwards). Weekends almost all day. (I'm in GMT)
I can pull an allnighter if you need a few more answerers :D 




 Alright, now, it's been a while since my last encounter with him, but it happened again last night and it totally freaked me the hell out. I'm not looking forward to locking up tonight, anyway..

It's getting darker these days, though that's pretty much irrelevant here in the Warehouse. There's no windows. When 5:30pm comes rolling around, I'm the last guy in the place. 

Like clockwork, I set my handheld scanner down, grab the keys and begin locking the metal gates around the warehouse and turning the lights off. After a round trip through the office to get to the "front" of the warehouse, so I can grab my coat and keys and go home, I can hear one of the gates rattling.

I work with a prankster - so even though I've encountered this.. thing before, I always assume it's my coworker in another department. I grab the keys and start to unlock. 

"C'mon man, quit fucking about, I was just about to go home!"

No reply. Not like him at all. Normally he'd fall out of his hiding place and roll about laughing. I quickly remove the keys from the lock and start to back up. There it was. Stood by the gate opposite the one I was at. Just standing there, hunched over. Despite my fears and I just *knew* it was that thing again, I said "Sorry mate, can I help you?" regardless. Clients and Visitors do sometimes pass through the warehouse.

His head turned. Slowly at first. Then - **SNAP** - his head had rotated 180 degrees. The last 90 degrees almost instantly. I stumbled backwards, almost forgetting there was a metal gate between me and it. He didn't even move, but he was right at the gate now. It was almost like he teleported right close to the gate.

Its face... I can't even describe it without getting weirded out majorly. It looked almost like a wax figure that was left out in the hot sun a bit too long. But he had these holes for eyes.

It reached its hand through the gate and pointed at me.
"You.." It sounded like a breath .
"You.." It repeated

I bolted. I slammed the final door behind me and locked it, and ran past the rest of the office, much to the bemusement of the guys in that department who were just finishing up.

They never knew what I saw. I hope they don't either. That thing was petrifying.  




 Excellently written.
I'd love a guardian spirit, though my dog will have to do, I guess. :P 




 I'd be up for it :)

It'd be neat-o if we got a wide range of [x]romantics and aromantics, genders and ages too. 




 Got it!
Seems like the domain's gone down. They're back on Blogspot

 Not all web-savvy when it comes to hosting - I used [Heart Internet](http://www.heartinternet.co.uk/) for a while. 




 Maan, never go to PC world. They will try and sell the most expensive thing they can. It's probably in their training. 




 Thanks! Very informative. We give him antihistamines in his food, which usually does the trick. I'll keep on top of it next year. 




 We've had our Border now for about 10 years, and every year in the Sept/Oct period, he gets very itchy and starts nibbling in the area just above his back leg. He eventually gets bald in the area, so we're always telling him to stop nibbling/scratching. I took a close look today and it looked very odd.

We can be also petting him on the back, and he start twitching one (or both) of his back legs. Seems a very ticklish or sensitive reaction, but he doesn't back off once he's done reacting - if anything, he comes and puts his head in our laps like he liked it

We've been to the vets, and they seem to give him a dose of anti-allergy stuff, because we put that in his food and he stops right away. 
I'm wondering if it is just seasonal allergies in a dog, or something completely different.

[Images of the baldspot, for the curious](http://imgur.com/a/AnEeW) 




 This is true. Ah well, we can only hope, eh? 




 For a minute there, I thought in my absence from the Internet, I missed the news of Maggie's death.
 




 Might be down along with GoDaddy, even the [front page of FRW](http://www.freedomrequireswings.com/) is down.. 




 Yep. Was at Download Fest this year, was on the Fun House and there was a bit of a queue for the slide down, so me and my group were waiting. I was at the back

These drunk girls were behind us, yelling about the wait, and for 10 minutes, my arse was being fondled like a stress ball. Was not happy.

Should add, really: I told 'em 3 or 4 times to cut it out. Eventually I just gave up and resigned to my fate as living stress ball. 




 I decide that driving that forklift truck over there would be pretty funny, and I've no idea how that thing works. I turn it on and go for a spin. I impale a man on the forks, then ram him into a wall. 




 I know it's had huge popularity recently, but Gangnam Style has got to be seen, funny as hell, and the song is annoyingly catchy!

But another one has to be [No One Knows - Queens of the Stone Age](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88r_q7oufE) 




 I always waste their time when they ring me or text me. "Yeah, I've got a credit card.
Yeah, it's only for 750. What's that, your fees are almost that? Why did you even bother telling me I could claim 2k then? 

Fuck off." 




 Same with Co-op. Hopefully it is just restricted to Mobile/Online.

Not like Co-op's online is any good anyway. It's total arse - maybe they're updating! 




 I've been a part of our Diplomatic Circuit since we emerged onto the Universal Stage - it's been about 10 years now. We're new, but I can already tell there is corruption, especially in the Milky Way, luckily, we have a few politicians who do have morals and are trying their best to counter any bad moves, but some bad ideas do slip the net.

If you ask me, we need more people on the Universal council - Currently, there is only 1 representative from each galaxy on the council, as well as 4 members elected directly onto it, completely neutral - which makes about 20 people on the council altogether. Considering that they're in charge of almost everyone in the universe, I think more people should be allowed to have their say.

Also, there is only 1 Feln in the Universal council - obviously, we would like more.. We are new, though, so people are quite surprised Kur'jin is up there with them.
 




 When we initially set off from our homeworld, we weren't too technically advanced, compared to the rest of the species' advancement - We set off without FTL drives, so before the Canir found us, we we just drifting, in comparison to their speeds. We had pretty fast engines, though. We could cross our System within a few weeks. 

Though our World-ship was a different story, it took us the best part of a year to get out of our system with it!

The universe is.. how would Humans say it.. Ah, Free-market. We have FTL drives, Galaxy Gates, Intergalaxy expressways. Basically, you can almost get from one side of the explored universe to the other within a decade or two! 

As for personal tech, we're very much an Augmented universal society. You can get Augs for almost anything these days, mostly due to Innovation in the Milky Way Galaxy.. They have questionable methods, though. Loopholes and all that. They're very crafty over there.

As for humans and their previously war-like ways, they appear to have settled some since making first contact. Mostly due to their home planet being made almost uninhabitable a few years after starting to colonise nearby systems. As the saying goes. "You learn from your mistakes - only a fool makes it twice". They imposed sanctions on themselves - which stunned the rest of us, really. Well, I say us, we weren't exactly off our planet yet. 

War isn't an issue, yet. For the Feln, at least - I try my best to keep our tails out of the fire, but that hasn't been too much of a problem, really. It's been pretty peaceful up here, aside from the slavers out on the "eastern" side of the Andromeda, and the cowboy implanters out in the Milky Way. Oh yeah, and the Mercs which you can't seem to dodge are always kicking up some kind of fuss. We stay out of their way, though - They just fight each other.

By no means is it an utopia, though. Only places such as here, in the High-Sec stations and the Canir capital city. 




 Yes, one thing the Humans, Canir and the Feln had in common were the fact that in our early documented history, we were all highly religious and wars were foughts not only over land and resources, but wars were also fought in.. well, the Humans called them the Crusades, the Feln and Canir have similar words - We called them the Deims, although the Humans went much further in their Crusades.

There are many other similar things, we had multiple dialects - but while the Humans have maintained their multiple languages, the Feln almost unified their languages before we achieved space flight - the Canir keep two separate languages too. 




 Well said! I run around the park with my Border Collie, and he's usually happy to trot up to any other dog and sniff butts, but any little dog will see him coming and I have to stop and leash mine, because one of the little terrors is barking like a maniac.

It breaks mine and his running flow. :( 




 We originate from the "Northern" section of the Milky Way Galaxy, a small system named after our star - Junl - There were just 4 planets in our system.

Each galaxy has their own set of laws, so to speak, though many overlap - it was much like the Human's.. continents, I think they were called.. Each Galaxy has their own ruling council, which all answer to the Universal council.  Only upon breaking a Galaxy's law, will you be pursued. The Milky Way council has a pretty harsh time with Aug Docs, and they're forever finding and closing loopholes.

Our relationship with the Humans is pretty stable, I try to keep the peace between us, but we were - and still are - quite a.. religious bunch, with the Human's religions, many wars were fought in the name of religion - but ours is very much a peaceful one. We merely worship our ancestral animals, which we believe we descended from - Evolution, if you will.

The humans - or most, at least - are quite wary of religion. A brief study on their history would explain why. We ask our people not to worship in public, as this may lead to raised tensions. Though 2 times a week, I'll get an angry comm from the Human ambassador - not like I can do anything about it anyway. 




 We, the Feln, first encountered the Humans - officially, at least - on the main council fleet. There was no tension between us, at least. Humans were pretty new to the Universal Society too, they must have been there about 60 or 70 years before us.

As for diplomatic situations, the Canir allowed us to us their Research posts on one of their colonies, and access to the shipyard so we could make our own scouting fleet. We needed a homeworld before we could establish ourselves in the universe - we would not be allowed a place among the Universal Council otherwise.

As for the Canir, we view them as saviours, though we were very much self sufficient on our World-ship. The Canir found our World-ship adrift between systems. they discovered our communication methods, gave signs of peace, and boarded the ship. Everyone on ship was on edge, including myself, who were these... Aliens who had found us, what were they doing?  

They took us to the Council Fleets, where our high-ranked officials met council leaders and diplomats. I was picked for Diplomatic duty, and I mostly talk with the Canir and the Humans, hence my history studies.  




 Feel Free to add me! I feel I need some encouragement on using the site,

I'm train_subject8542 on there too. 




 Aye, the camera is pretty awesome. Once I ditch this thing, I'll be keeping it as a camera.

I'm not sure what Helicoptering is in this context, but I'm going to assume it's bad.  




 I'm also a history buff, and have quite the stack of Feln, Canir and Human history books littered all over my desk. 

I haven't quite gotten to the rest of the universe, but I'm getting there!

[D'oh! Forgot the Fiction tag, apologies!] 




 /r/getmotivated gets me off my chair if I'm feeling lazy before my runs. 




 The Google Nexus 7 is pretty good value for money.  159.99 and 199.99 versions are out here in the UK, and they run pretty well, supposedly. I've not got one, but I'd love one! 




 I've got an N8. The software feels like it's being dragged through cement, but the amout of times I've dropped it on concrete is silly, and all I've got is a few scratches.

I also launched it across the room after it refused to answer a call 3 times in a row. (I was having a shitty day) 




 I live somewhat near them, so I use [Micro Direct](http://www.microdirect.co.uk) for stuff. 

The few times I've had faulty stuff, I've just driven in and said "It no work!" And they give me a new one on the spot 




 That's all I got for ages in my inbox. I like them. So what? 




 Yeah, but they're not metal. More Hard Rock if anything. 




 I was in /r/metal, and the question "as it's July 4th, what are your favourite american metal bands?" 

Now, I'm not American, but I jumped in, and answered "Killswitch Engage and Disturbed"
I understand I was wrong about Disturbed, but Jesus Christ I got absolutely hammered in the comments/downvotes 




 Graveyards. If I'm totally unaware we're going into one, I'll freeze on the spot.

Made my Nan's funeral pretty tense, as well as sad for me. 




 I've seen them about for a while, heck they were about when I was at school (I left Secondary in '06), but I never actually saw anyone with it assembled.

Anyone who wears this in a town or city centre needs a kicking, It'd be good for when it's pissing down when you're out hiking..

Who am I kidding, if I was out hiking and saw someone wearing one of them, I'd flip and run the opposite direction. 




 Stealing cake.
Just wait until they're at some kind of party, and they have a slice of cake.

BAM

Stolen. 




 We think they are, as almost immediately after building the final expressways, they backed off immediately. There is an unfinished Galaxy Gate over on the Andromeda. They left an "always on" signal warning people not to use it. It's completely dead, though, so why they warned us not to use it seemed a bit redundant.

Yeah, the ships are built with the gateways in mind, though these gates are huge, they're at least a few kilometers tall - The Feln made quite a surprise entrance after the Canir found them. Their ship was huge!

Scientists and Engineers have mapped out the expressways, and the Galaxy Gates, and are in attempts to reverse engineer their schematics, but its proving quite difficult. 

As for holding them ransom, that would be quite silly, really. The express gates are one of a kind in each solar system. Without them, there's no way in, or out, apart from conventional FTL drives, the pirates know without it, they're going to waste a lot of money should no-one pay the ransom and they destroy the gate.

As for camping - well, the Admirals of each galaxy have huge warships capable of mass destruction, Pirates don't really stand much of a chance against them. It's been done a few times before, and never again since.

((sorry that took so long, working on two projects at once, I know. Derp. Got so absorbed in one, I forgot to reply here)) 




 I'm a manual labourer, might soon be entering a software training role, but I aspire to be a Game Designer, and possibly write a novel.

My current worldbuilding project is probably going to be the subject of my first novel, if I ever get around to it. 









 A currently existing race built the gates, but they went reclusive after building them, no schematics exist, and they refuse to speak to diplomats sent out to speak to them.

They're very large structures in space, very rectangular in shape, you can see a lot of the machinery and workings underneath most of them. I think they left the "covers" off to dissipate the heat that is generated when gate travel is made. Due to that, they look very strange, Wireframe-y, with a giant hole in the centre, which any ship can fit through.

FTL is possible without the gates, though it uses quite a bit of fuel when you go over anything than 3x. Most use the inter-galaxy "Expressways" when making a trip way across the same Galaxy. These use similar technology, but, unlike the Galaxy Gates, they're not instantaneous, They can accelerate your ship to 500x the speed of light, which makes a trip from one end of the Galaxy to the other about 180 years (Still a bit long, but for the rest of the Galaxy's species, that's about two thirds of a lifetime.) (That would be impractical anyway, the "top" and "bottom", as well as either "Side" of all currently accessible Galaxies have the main gates)

As for conventional ungated FTL, a ship fitted with FTL engines reaches such speeds through particle manipulation, mostly. Thrusters kick in, helping the FTL Core charge the ship with the energy provided to  manipulate the ship and the area around it. With the charge building up, approaching planets or other large structures, it becomes a bit dangerous. Most ships will drop charge on outer planets, or, there being none available, a "Charge Drop" is constructed, where ships can pass and lose their built up charge. This is required after every FTL trip, or else the Particle Manipulation charge can hit a populated area. It is a combination of electricity and radioactive charge. Very deadly. 




 It's tough. I'm English and she was Belgian. I was only 17 at the time, so It was hard to scrape the money to go see her.. Only went the once before the distance and the lack of IRL contact drifted us, really.

It's all about seeing each other somewhat regularly, otherwise it's all for naught. 




 Spreading the musical misery, wherever I go! 
























 Come back in 10 days or somethin'

I'm a last-minute kind of guy. [](/derpsrs) 




 I'm boring with my ships.

Fluttermac, Soarin'Dash, and TwiDash. 

[](/pinkiefear) 




 Yeah, I normally do that, but I've got a pretty terrible shotgun right now, so I'm alternating between assault rifle and revolver and firing from the hip with the sniper (I've put some points into the accuracy trait.)

I'm struggling in the caustic caverns, I've got a little too far in the story for my level and everything is kicking my ass down there atm.  




 Yeah, I always end up just picking their HP down with a Slag sniper, but I always end up running out of enemies, and I'm not near a reinforcements button. I'll get to it eventually, I just like trying as I see them. 




 Theshers. Full stop. All of them.

Goliaths - not because they're hard, but because I'm trying to get the Goliath - Meet David achievement. I can never have them get that last level.

Anything that moves fast. Stalkers, Rats.. I'm a sniper, can't do shit to 'em. 




 I did practically nothing!

Mostly trying to adjust my sleep schedule for my new hours at work.

[](/ppfreakout)But I played a lot of Vidya games. this is bad, I should be studying or writing my novel.  




 He's just turned 11 this year. Gettin' a bit old now, We've had him since I was around 12 years old, I'm 23 in about a month. 

Still, he outruns me when I go jogging and still likes to play [](/mlyra) 




 Aaaah! Goldie! I love Golden retrievers. Big, strong, loyal and fluffy.

A bit like Big Mac, then.

 'Tis rather nippy out there. Walked the dog down the park and slipped on a patch of ice.

[](/cheereww) Dog thought that was code for "Give kisses now" so he decided to walk on over and lick my face off.  




 During the main cutscenes, subtitles show what the character's actually saying, but elsewhere, it's just "Mumbles" "Groans" "Roars"

Remade my character. I tried to Humanise and R63 Zecora.

[I'm super lazy when it comes to customisation.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-hZn81eDSDhs/ULtqJn5rOAI/AAAAAAAAdf4/l3sOv0Cv4NY/s1531/2012-12-02_00001.jpg)

 I made a new character to play with a friend on Co-op

He has fabulous bright pink hair, looks old, and has a voice like a zombie.
Can't understand a word he says, but it's hilarious. 

[](/hahaha) 




 Meanwhile, I do things like [this](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-NI8UWVtUgLI/ULfprXxZpLI/AAAAAAAAdY0/zuYVkWKGVvY/s1493/ss+%282012-11-29+at+11.01.50%29.jpg)

 How about a delicious can of Tab? [](/flutterlean) 




 I got one a few years ago on my day off.

Played like you did - they asked to use the remote desktop connection. Uh, no.

Laid into 'em. Asked them how the fuck could they know I have a virus?

I know I don't have a virus because I check my system damn near every night, and I'm not a stupid fuck, I know what to download and from where.

They hung up midway through my rant. :(

[](/btwicrazy) 




 I know that feel, I just added 5 more games to my "To Finish" list.

[I posted this 3 days ago.](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lr5WGl-6D9g/ULPH9sObipI/AAAAAAAAdLQ/h15K5Zpwf-k/s567/SEETHIS.png) 

There's probably more to actually finish, but I'll probably never play them. I picked them up because they were HOLY SHIT CHEAP! - played them once, couldn't get into it, abandoned

I now have 125 games in my steam list.

[](/twiannoyed "I'm procrastinating on playing games, what is wrong with me?") 




 Well it's pretty dark out, just past midnight here.

And I just remembered, I haven't put my frost guard on my car windscreen. [](/twidurr)

Tomorrow morning is going to be fun. 




 Would you ever get a pony-related tattoo? Subtle or Loud, doesn't matter! 




 I wouldn't wish a Mancunian accent on anyone, nor scourse. A good Yorkshire accent might be good on AJ 




 was thinking something show-related, not fanon, but tempting!

Was thinking maybe Twi's cutie mark on my shoulder or something, small and inconspicuous - All my tats mean something to me! Ponies have been a huge part of my life for the past year and a half.. 




 It's a little awkward when silence hits and small talk has to be initiated. 

I'm _terrible_ at that.[](/tsawkward) 




 Yeah! Red is awesome. [You need context, but this is one of the saddest scenes in the game](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxn1kxzwL4s).

He's a bit like me. Don't talk unless you got somethin' to say, and make sure it's worth talking about. 

[](/twibiggrin "Makes me sound antisocial, huh?") 




 I go to the best artist in Bolton - he charges 70 an hour, this was 3 hours so far, and I'm due for another hour, maybe hour and a half, so this as is cost me 210, with another possible 105 on top.

[](/twidance) Worth it! 




 This is my 3rd Tat, I'm considering maybe getting a subtle pony tat next. 

But gotta get this finished first! It wraps all the way across my arm pretty much..

Red XIII has been my favourite character in any media EVER for the past **15** years, only felt right to get a full tattoo of him to honour the decade-and-a-half 









 Labour voter all the way through here. After the last election and the debates, was close to marking down Lib Dem for their policies, but my MP is rockin'.

Bolton North is a safe labour seat anyway.. 




 I fight the system. I look at NSFW at work! Ha ha!
But seriously, I'm sat in an office and my screens face away from everyone else. :D 




 I think I'm going to go curl up in a corner of the office for now.

Damn man, what was going through your head? ;_;

I do miss physical books though. They smell nice.

You better smell them when they arrive.

 Black Friday. MEH. BritPony here.

Although those Amazon deals they had looked pretty sweet, I'm broke as noodles until Payday - which is this thursday!

Probably. 




 Eh, why not. I've always wanted to do an AMA! [](/05)

 They would kill us all - including themselves. They want to be Martyrs. Their Leader - Aragath Brighteye - had a bad dream one night and based his whole terror act on that.

Of course, if they succeed, we'll be extinct. If they don't.. Well, We gotta be careful in that spaceship of ours.

I don't think they'd do anything to the rest of the Galaxy, but I wouldn't put it past that twisted freak to change his "vision" 




 I guess so. I mean, I've not even heard of that conflict.

All I know is, the Iskaldi think we're going to fuck the Galaxy up something fierce - so they're trying to stop us, either by isolating us to the planet, or by killing us all.

Evacuation plans are almost finished and we're in the last weeks of preparation, they're desperate and some fucknut in the Council left their access codes to the radioactive waste dumping ground. There's enough material in there to wipe us out ten times over. It's a race to get us off the planet before they find it.

I'm serious. 




 [](/ajsoawesome)Oh man, Karl is the best.

I live in Manchester - where Karl is from. It's amazing when people say "What did he say?" and I understood him perfectly. 




 We, the Feln are a Race of peoples living on our planet - Luetem. We're in the Itern system.  Our Galaxy - Lomia - is the nearest neighbour of the Andromeda.

We're a - well, the humans said this, anyway - Feline-like race. Our legs are Digitigrade. Naturally curious, our technology evolved quickly. The Humans were surprised when our Recorded history was "only" 5,000 SUY old. It apparently took them around 10,000 SUY to even begin deep space exploration.

I mean, That's the Gist of it. I could probably go find a Scholar or something and they'll lecture you on what it _means_ to be a Feln or what have you. Boring stuff. 




 As one of their fellow countrymen, make sure they end up with a cone, or something similar on his head. Otherwise that night just didn't happen.

Seriously though. Drunk brits are either massive cunts, or giggly dunken messes. Make sure they go to bed!

[](/berryparty "A happy hungover person was one who woke up in bed!") 




 1. If it comes up in conversation, I'll say "Yeah, I'm Asexual". Though I have an Asexy bumper sticker. :D

2. Not that I can recall, I've never "wanted" to have sex and all that, just after getting to know some people "Hey, she'd be pretty cool to sit on the sofa and cuddle with"

3. Yes and no.. Sometimes I'll get the urge, It's a very tiny urge, easily ignorable. A few minutes and it goes away, nothing I'd act upon, even in a relationship.

4. If you call "Cuddling on the sofa and maybe eating ice cream" a sexual fantasy, go for it!

5. Intimacy is kind of important, but not a deal breaker, One of my favourite things to do when I used to hang out with my ex (We split for distance..) was just cuddle on the sofa.

[](/twismile "I Mean, who'd pass on snuggling on the sofa?!")

Been ace all my life pretty much. There's just no desire or attraction there.

As for "Coming out", unless they're really getting on your case about grandkids (Like mine were), I can't really see them caring. I mean - so what if you don't like doing the deed? It's not like you describe what goes on to them.

[](/ajhappy)Are you a Romantic Ace or Aromantic? That can make all the difference sometimes.

 I'm pretty high ranking as far as the foot soldiers are concerned, and I am "unofficially" brought in to advise the strategic council from time to time. 

Our current enemy is almost 1/4 of the population of the Feln, under control of a cult - the Iskaldi.

 Anywhere but his bed!

We leave him downstairs, he has a good wandering area. I'll come downstairs some nights and he'll be on the rug, in front of a chair, in a doorway, under a desk.. 

He's good and doesn't jump on chairs or beds unless you pat and say "Come on then!" 




 Border Collies are one of the best dogs around. You'll have a friend for life in Penny. Her colours are amazing too! 




 Yeah, that probably would have worked. I'm just as derp as she is, it seems. 




 Ah, RP instances like yours notwithstanding of course. Maybe he could make his own last name? :D 




 Okay, so I work in IT training, but I work with a particular girl who knows what she's doing most of the time, but sometimes has moments of extreme derp.

Anyway, we use a databasing software, which is limited to a set number of open process.
We wandered off for a quick meeting about the upcoming influx of Windows 8 machines we will be using to train our customers.

Anyhow, we come back, and our hero's computer [We'll call her Jane] was having a minor freakout. (I just bailed right to my desk on the other side of the room)

"[train_subject8542]! My computer's spazzing out, I've got like a bazillion copies of Customer Enquiry open! I've got an e-mail from [Network Dude] asking me to stop opening them, no-one can uses Axis!"

So I walk over to see what the fuss was about.
Her bag was on her keyboard.
for nearly 30 minutes, holding down enter.

"Your bag is on your keyboard, damnit!"

I forgot how long I was sat there clicking "Cancel" and "End process"
But we were all laughing about it the entire time. 

We had an in-joke, and it just got reinforced. 




 Nope, all of mine do. Always try and give last names to characters in MMOs if I can, makes my character feel more unique! 




 jtechs beat me to it. But what he says is pretty much it. I'll have to change my plan because I put my sim in an old sony xperia for a week or two while I sent my phone in for a repair and I leaped over my data limit like an Olympian leaping over hurdles. 500MB ftl.

 I played with Symbian in 2010 and deemed it "Perfect for what I use it for".

 AS WELL AS ALL THAT COURSE SHIT I POSTED ABOUT THE OTHER DAY, I'VE GONE OFF THE FUCKING DEEP END NOW, COATED IN CONCRETE

I'M DOING THAT AMAZING FUN THING CALLED NANOWRIMO

TELL ME TO STOP LOOKING AT GOOGLE+ AND REDDIT AND GET MY ARSE WRITING. I NEED MOTIVATION 




 Walking, Gaming, Writing and usually once every two months, I'll jump the Pennines and get wankered 




 FUCK YOU.
I'M GOING TO GO LISTEN TO "PHOTOGRAPH" JUST TO SPITE YOU.

WHAT _IS_ THAT ON JOEY'S HEAD? 




 I WILL QUOTE SUM 41 ALL I LIKE FRIEND.

BUT THANK YOU

YOU MADE ME REALISE HOW FUCKING AWESOME I COULD BE. I'M GOING TO GET HOME FROM WORK LATER AND I'M GOING TO OPEN THOSE BOOKS AND EAT THE WORDS WITH MY EYES.

THEY WILL BE DELICIOUS. 




 I MEAN IT'S NOT LIKE I HAVE ANY REGRETS OR ANYTHING

BUT I SIGNED UP TO A GAME DESIGN COURSE _AND_ A COMPTIA A+ **AND** NETWORK+ COURSE

NOW 
I NEED MOTIVATION TO PICK UP ON MY COMPTIA

I'M PROPER SLACKING, LIKE.

TL;DR: *YOU LAZY FUCKS*

CAUSE I'M IN TOO DEEP, AND I'M TRYING TO KEEP, 
UP ABOVE IN MY HEAD, INSTEAD OF GOING UNDER.  




 Not entirely sure, but my reasoning is the "flat" is all on one floor. Some flats are in converted houses, some are in high-rises. I think Apartments might be reserved for the high-price range stuff. 

I drive to Manchester sometimes and I see "apartments for sale" signs, but driving through my hometown, there's "Flats to Let" above shops and in house windows. 




 I posted this vid on my G+ profile and eventually went off on one:

I don't mind it, but it appears to have infected most FPS' games that hit the "mainstream"  I might enjoy the occasional interactive-movie-like game, but sometimes I just wanna get chest deep in a game and spend weeks playing it.

Borderlands 2 is my crack atm, got like, 6 hours and I'm only scratching the top.

FPS' are the most immersible game but breaking flow so often really pulls you out of it. I like to call Single Player "Multiplayer Tutorial" 

MoH: Airbourne was pretty fun. You were given objectives and given an choice of 3 landing zones, though you could just fuck 'em off entirely and land where you like.

Obviously that was dangerous and you'd be on your own. No linear paths to follow, just a huge map. Do the objectives, lead into a single "end-level" objective, mission done 




 Almost time for hometime here.

I'm in my new job and I actually have my own desk.
Not a shared desk.

It's _my_ desk.

It feels awesome.

 FRIEND

DID YOU JUST MOTIVATE YOURSELF?

MY WORK HERE WAS DONE BEFORE IT EVEN BEGAN 




 THINK OF IT THIS WAY PAL

THAT THING YOU WANT TO DO TOMORROW INSTEAD OF TODAY?
WHAT IF SOMETHING PRETTY IMPORTANT COMES UP? NOW YOU HAVE TO DO TWO THINGS IN ONE DAY

NOW I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO PULL OFF MIRACLES, TWO THINGS IN ONE DAY MIGHT BE TOO MUCH FOR YOU TO HANDLE

BABY STEPS, FRIEND. DO THAT THING, DO IT NOW.

THAT REALLY IMPORTANT THING? PROBABLY GETTING RUN OVER BY A TRUCK, OR MAYBE GETTING MAULED BY A VICIOUS TIGER THAT ESCAPED FROM THE ZOO

DO IT. YOU MIGHT DIE OTHERWISE. 




 Hm, might take you up on that! Although I don't get paid until thursday..

I'll give it some thought and get back to you! :D [](/ajhappy) 




 The guys are saying December 15th, but that's subject to possible change. 




 I have no idea.  I can get the info for you if you want? [](/bonbon) 




 We're a rare breed indeed.

There's another meet scheduled for December, if you want, you can get a ride with me if you're near manchester or live near the M60 (north) or along the 62! 




 I'm sure there's a bunch of Bronies down there too! I have some friends in Bristol and they go to meets occasionally.. 




 That was the intent. Someone put a fez on him, then the fuzzy hat came, then all of a sudden:

"TF2!" 

hats come out of everywhere.

[](/ppboring) 




 Do it filly! We have a laugh, and I break everything the group stands for by being the resident Lancastrian who just turns up, hangs about, drinks, dances, then bucks off back to Manchester 




 well. Beer, alcohol, whatevs.

I was on shots and cocktails all night, but I'm a cider guy. Kopparberg is delicious. 




 It was awesome. It was my 6th meet, 5th with these guys, they're awesome! 




 Spilled beer. I spilled my Derpy shot. [](/derpwizard) 




 Beer, hats, internet. 

I was lucky enough to get a hold of the portal gun.

Lets just say that night, only one or two people were sober, out of the 30-ish people who carried on to the bar.

 Yes I know, I took this on a potato.

My hair isn't normally this straight, I just got out of the shower, it's normally just a little curlier though.

I usually just tie it up in a ponytail, because I love whipping it out at gigs and having a good ol' headbang

 Oh my god

That reminds me when I used to do distance driving from Manchester to London for work.

winter was the best, used to pull up at Norton Canes services and grab a peppermint mocha. Tastes like christmas! Sat in a freezing cold car park, slightly warm van, tasty-as-shit minty coffee in my hands. 
























 Everything.

Everything you can!  




 [](/vshey) Dude! Sonne was the first song I heard! It always makes me think of Christmas, for some reason.

Ich Will is a good one too. Has that "live" feel to it.

 Chillin' here in my jeans and a tshirt.

Feet are bloody frozen, like. Still. Nothin' a cuppa won't sort out. 




 Tis pretty cold up here, but you might be better getting the scots in! 




 Red XIII, aka Nanaki. 

I feel he's such an overlooked character in ff7 sometimes. His general temperament and his development in Cosmo canyon is amazing. 

Also, he's got a radical design and I have him tattooed on me. 




 That is a Nanaki tattoo! Still not finished, but still worth the 210 I've paid for it already! 




 Face thread? Stick my two "tat pics" together and you have my face! :D

 Pretty new myself. If he has his ask box open, you might be able to get him there. You might be able to follow him, then send a fan mail, but again, I think there's a time limit, though not 100% sure on that either. 




 I know of a stained glass art maker. [Here's his Tumblr](http://cryoganix.tumblr.com/) 




 I think I'll reformat the book type from a two person perspective to a one character perspective. I guess it's a little ambitious for a first time writer.

Thanks for the advice, it's helped. :)  




 Awesome. I'm on my phone and can't see shit. [](/hahaha) 




 She's mine now! [](/wahaha "oh god I hope I got this emote right")

 Yeah, I guess I'm writing from the wrong perspective. I need to focus on the character's point of view, rather than a bystander's (so to speak). So it's kind of like a form of Role Playing, or acting. Just temporarily jump into their shoes and write what they'd actually think. 

Right, I think I get you properly this time. Cheers. :D 




 Awesome! Thanks. Just gotta add depth to my descriptions and dialogue then, I guess. Gotcha. 




 Yeah, I probably picked the part I had most fun writing. I should probably post in a little characterization instead. I had a few pages of Shia'le and Taern having a bit of development. which I might post up, my draft at the moment is about 6.5k words long. 

I'll work on describing surroundings more though. 

I can post up the less action oriented, and more character focused section if you'd like?

Thanks for the feedback!  




 Yeah - with the whole non-human thing, it's explained right at the start of the story. I just dragged an except out toward the end of the section.

But I'm marking down a few areas now where I need to go over "talking too much about tech" 

Cheers for the feedback! 




 Hi /r/writing!

I'm currently working on a little project for an "origin story" for a race in the universe I'm building.

While I am only a hobbyist (I work full time, and study when not working or writing), I'd love some brutally honest feedback, to know where I can/should improve. I have recieved good feedback on the entire story so far, but I feel like my friends were being nice in order to not hurt my feelings. I never went to University, and only did one year of college (I'm from the UK)

**Be brutally honest as you can!** I promise I can take it! :P Not looking for anything on plot, as what I've included doesn't really include much plot. I'm looking for more feedback on the writing style and a general impression of the piece.

I'm not really _aiming_ for publication. It's more of a little personal project I have going on. But I may look at publishing onto a digital format, depending on costs.

[Link to a Google Docs page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QRjlbTjQAzJvJcp8lVqV7n0NlCJk1BUGQe55SKwWxaU/edit) 




 It'd be pretty neat, hanging out with an alien race and all that, but considering the shortest person alive on Luetem is 6'5" and the average is around 7"8, I'd probably feel a _little_ intimidated.

Shia'le is like, 8 feet tall, it's freaky. 




 I know, right? Tea is clearly the superior drink! [](/rarityannoyed) 




 Was gonna say, the style looks similar to the old Mac Hall comic.

IIRC, he ditched Mac Hall and went on to do [Three Panel Soul](http://threepanelsoul.com/)

 It was a pretty grim night, by all standards. Rain and hail was bouncing off the window making a rather dull drumming reverberate through the bar.

I mean, the weather in winter on Ratine was pretty bad, but this was just taking the cake. Feln, Canir and Humans were all darting between shelter, making their way to the huge bar planted dead center of the market.

Rein brought the alcoholic beverage to his mouth and took a rather large swig. He'd been hiding here for a few weeks. It was nice and busy, he'd go mostly unnoticed here. That was, of course, until Warren Shaile turned up. That nosy bastard was out looking for him. He'd heard the stories, but he could totally avoid him. He had to. There was no way he was going back to Limitless. 

He'd endured centuries of pain, testing, surgery. All illegally. by all accounts, he didn't exist. He was nothing. Fuck that, he'd shake off Shaile and expose those bastards. He doesn't know how yet, but there had to be a way to get the word out without exposing himself in the public eye.

Public terminal? Maybe, but so far, he's stuck on Ratine. Last thing he needed was Warren and his cronies surrounding him. In the only place he can hide for the next few months. 

It was an amazing fear he even got to Ratine, really. Getting out of that station was a miracle in itself, never mind getting across the galaxy.

It still baffled Rein, He was brought up in the 21st century, where it took hours to cross the planet, and here he was, about 80,000 light years away from that station mere days later. He liked Ratine, originally. But he arrived in summer. A lovely, vibrant jungle, covered in merchant stalls on the surface, while the rich and powerful lived miles high on their floating city, protected by all sorts of fancy gadgetry that would probably make Rein even more confused that he already was.

The poor were "trapped" on the surface.  A couple of years ago, a company tried to terraform the planet, to make it just a little _less_ hostile for mining operation, but it cocked up something fierce. Operations went ahead, but the winters are so harsh, it rivaled even the old arctic back on earth. Work was always halted on the surface in winter, but people continued to live down here anyway. Have-a-go engineers were trying to make the outdoor conditions somewhat hospitable during the harsh winter, but fires occasionally broke out with loose wires accidentally crossed. 

Snow dunes crept across the landscape in the distance, moving ever closer to the small market town. Soon, men in ships would arrive and move the dune over the town, making sure the town isn't buried. It was a sight to see, according to the locals. Rein couldn't wait! 

enough of that, he needed to find a way of getting Limitless to fall, guinea pigs of Limitless and their competitors littered the stations of Purseus, abandoned by the corporation after their testing is complete. It was a sickening sight.

A sight Warren knew all too well. His first case was to track down one of these victims, who had gone missing after heading to Purseus for a "routine implant check". Warren found him begging for change. He wasn't as described but it was him alright. He looked like a Picasso painting, a proper mess. It took days for Warren to talk him around and to go home to his wife. Who, despite his new grotesque appearance appeared over the moon to see her husband again. It was a sick business, but the Universal Council weren't even looking into it. 

It was a problem everyone knew existed but no-one did anything about.  Warren was committed to ending this godawful practice, even if it meant working for one of them.

(Oh damn, that's a lot. But that's 30 minutes of brain leakage right there)

 I know that feel. It'd be nice to get a "Mature" brony meet geared up somewhere, but meets in the UK are a rare thing, and when they happen - they're quite big - I think we had 60 people last time.

[This is my Age 20 crash]

(http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l6wbgoG4mm1qcfe4ro1_500.jpg) There was way more damage, but I only had time to capture the front as the recovery truck came to take it away.

My Age 21 Crash: http://taernfastgrade.tumblr.com/post/10244162781/fucking-hell-that-hurt-burns-and-cuts-on-my-arm 




 I love telling stories! :D I'll tell all three because I've nothing better to do.

Age 10: 
--
It's my sister's 6th Birthday, and my 10th Birthday was mere weeks after, so we (My mum) decided to combine our birthday parties into one. We went to the nearby pool (Indoor, because outdoor pools in England in January?  HAH!)
Anyway, I'm pretty much a fish in water, up until a few years ago, I was in a swim team, but I'm diversing.

Lets just say, I dived underwater, because going underwater is awesome, and when I tried to surface, there was a rather... Large kid on one of those spongy floaty things. After bashing the bottom a little bit, the kid finally realised there was something up and jumped off. I nearly passed out and drowned.

Age 20:
--
This one was kind of my fault. I had an hour to zip to an exporters, exchange some stuff and get back to work on time.. I had 10 minutes left on the last 3 miles - I got this! 
At this pojng, I'm still on the motorway, coming around a rather large sweeping bend at around 60 mph.

My tyre blew out.. I wobbled all over the road, trying to control the car, before another tyre gave way, and I careered off into a motorway lane barriers at 50mph, hit it, span around and completely took out my back end on the barrier again.

At this point, I'm in the fast lane, facing the wrong way. Anyone could come around that corner and completely fuck me and my car over. Luckily, it was pretty quiet and I somehow managed to restart the car and limp it over to the hard shoulder for recovery. No injuries whatsoever, I was a lucky bastard. Just had to pay for the barrier repair, and my insurers covered the car repair.

This one prompted me to have a bit of a meltdown and I shaved off all my hair and closed myself off for weeks, being completely sure I should have been dead.

Age 21 (last year!):
--
Another Automobile accident, this time, completely not my fault.

I used to work as a van driver. I used to drive this wee [Purgeot Partner](http://www.nortonwaypeugeot.com/images/new-vans/large/peugeot-partner-van.png) about for stationary deliveries and such.

I was coming around another long sweeping road, with a 30mph limit. I'm tracked in that van, so I was sticking to the speed limit pretty strictly..
As I approached a junction, As I had right of way, I kept going. A guy just exited it without looking. My van came off better, but it was still a mess. The clash of metal, the screeching of my brakes, and the eventual thud of hitting a barrier brought back some pretty harsh memories of the year before. Everything went white - but that's because the Airbag went off, and the white bonnet had popped up. But my chest was on FIRE. I opened the door of the van and staggered out, clutching my chest, the airbag felt getting a solid punch in the chest.

I staggered over to the other driver, despite bystanders shouting "Sit down, your chest! Someone call an ambulance!" to make sure he was fine. He was fine, his car had just span on the spot a little. But I noticed his engine was smoking.. and so was mine. "Dude, your engine. I'm going turning mine off too." 

I rang my boss to tell him what had happened, then the police, fire engine and ambulance came.. It wasn't until a bystander said to me "You are lucky, any faster, you would have gone right through that barrier and into the river."

I just sat there, completely out of it until the Paramedic came to check on me. I got Whiplash pretty bad and couldn't walk properly for weeks. Got a decent payout too..

Other driver didn't have insurance (which is illegal here in the UK), so he got a ban, I think.

 




 Scares? Hm.. Had quite a few in the past. Nothing recent though, thankfully!

I have nearly died three times though, scary stuff. 




 As the Flair suggests, I'm in Bolton, just north of the city. Born, raised and work here. I think at this point, I'm never leaving.

I'm an IT Trainer. :D 




 Thanks for the help. :) I'll let you know what they say when they get back to me. 




 I have an e-mail set and ready to go - could you possibly give it a look over for me before I hit the send button?

Hi there,

Over the past few months, I've been borrowing from Wonga - and while happy with the service, I fear I may have dug myself in a little too deep.

I am contacting you to attempt to set up a repayment plan, I can pay around 200 pcm, which means the outstanding debt can be paid off within 4 months.

If you could contact me back ASAP, that'd be fantastic.

Thank you,

Nathan.
 




 You could do that?

I owe it to Wonga. I didn't think they'd even give me the time of day for something like that. 




 Jammy bastard. Never won anything on a scratchcard, and you go and win on all your lines! :( 




 Cheers man, anything helps at the moment.

I'm gonna give my bank another try, see if I can pursuade them to let me borrow.. Anything's better than paying back to borrow right away again. 




 Long story short, I fucked up and now I owe a Payday Loan company 800..

It's been months and they refuse to help me pay them off slowly over time, and I'm in that vicious cycle where I pay it off, then have to borrow more to pay off the last round.

If anyone could lend me the cash, I would be so damn grateful.
I can pay back 200 per month, plus interest. I fell off the boat months ago, now trying to make myself stable again.

I would be so grateful if anyone could help, I'm desperate. My credit rating as been dropped so bad over the last few months and bank loans are turning me down.

British based, obviously, Manchester. But I can pay anyone who is willing to help, including fees if it came to transferring.

 But yeah, I'm with ITB. I've had a relatively good experience with them, though I'm a daywalker for the most part, They used to get me for the 9am commute and shave off 20 miles or something, but 6k miles a year is alright for me.

I've not needed to top up, but if you are driving heavily, ITB generally isn't a good one to go for. Good for city dwellers such as myself. 




 Yes! Finally!

 [](/aj25)I was kinda gutted by the last one, Derpy took the show, then best pony was missing for like half the episode!

But I've yet to watch today's episode. Gonna catch it in a few hours. 




 It is tempting, but the cops with those NPR cameras will catch you if you drive in front of a copper for more than a few minutes.

And I've seen first hand what happens to guys with no insurance. Was coming round a corner and the guy pulled out without looking. Driving without insurance. His was a writeoff, so it just got crushed and 6 points on his license, and find a few grand.

The premiums are so damn stupid nowadays though... What's helped me is going for a tracker in my car for insurance purposes.


First started out with with my current insurers at 2k p/a.

I'm in that age range where it's "He's a boy racer, charge him shit tons"

In a year, I've knocked my yearly price down from 2k to 1k, and that was with an-almost-writeoff a while back because of a blowout on the motorway.

I know being tracked is all Privacy concerns, yadayadayada, but I see it as a price reducer, and an extra security device. If on the chance my car gets robbed, insurers can track it. 




 Let them keep him, I say. I think he'd be too scared to come back anyway, after Leveson and all that. 




 Hm, as my fellow briton mentioned, it's rather hard for me to "Big meself up" without feeling a bit bigheaded, BUT TO HELL WITH IT

Primarily, I'm an IT Trainer, but I like to think my overactive imagination will pay off one day. I reckon I'll end up finishing this Game Design course (Home Learning is a double edged sword, folks!) and I'll write and design a game that's totally bitchin' and will get top marks everywhere.

That's wishful thinking, like.. But I like to think I write some damn good fiction. I've 2 novel projects I'm going on-off with because work and studies are clashing.

Also, I reckon I'm easily forgiving and try to be as generous as possible - once or twice I have run myself to the ground because god damnit, it's a friend's birthday, and I'm not getting them _nothing!_

Although I am a lazy fucker at best and it takes a lot to get me out of bed. 
I guess that's the con to being me.

 Might be worth zipping into a hairdresser's aand asking "Hey, I'm trying to get long hair, could you maybe tidy it up a little?"

Maintenance is key, though I am failing to heed my own advice. :D 




 I'm CisMale, and I've got long hair. I keep it down all the time, unless I'm working - where I tie it up into a ponytail. No-one really gives me a second glance.

I mean, I might be going in the wrong direction here, but as you transition longer hair might be a blessing to help you feel more feminine.  




 To Redeem the FF Series (for me, anyway) would be going back to the old game-types, like FF9 or FF7.

My favourite final fantasy has to be FF9. The story is quite engaging - and with the previous two protagonists being someone Strong, Silent and "emotionally sensitive", Zidane was a breath of fresh air, as was FF10's Tidus.

With the Old PS1/SNES/NES Final Fantasies, the presence of a World Map gave the player a bigger feeling of an open world - you could just jump on the airship, chocobo or boat and pilot it around yourself - none of this "Fast Travel"

I might just be a nostalgic git, but I've recently replayed FF7 and I'm playing FF9 again, and they just seem like better *games* than the recent offerings. I couldn't find myself getting into FF13 at all. I tried, I tried so damn hard, but the linear corridor runs made me feel a little (metaphorically) claustrophobic. With the old titles, you could have different entry points on each "map" to find hidden items each map had 1 (or 2) "Camera" points, which made it a little easier to orient yourself in the surrounding areas.

As far as I went in FF13 - to find chests, all I had to do was run off the "corridor" a little. Also, the combat system bugged me a little - but if there's one thing Square did, it was change the combat system with each iteration of FF. FF7 had Materia, FF8 had Drawing and Junctioning (Which I dislike and couldn't really play it properly), FF9 had AP - etc.

FF13 has a sphere-grid -esque system, but it's locked to one "class". Switching "jobs" mid battle got confusing at best, especially when it affected all characters rather than just the one. the old FF's pulled the job system quite well - and so did FF10-2 (Which I enjoyed, despite the shit that got too)

In short, I feel with FF13, the game has gotten _too_ linear. A little open-ness wouldn't hurt! 




 Despite the shit it got, I found BRINK quite fun in short bursts. The single player and Multiplayer are practically identical, single player is bots on your team/enemy team, and multiplayer is actual people.

So good, never finished it though, toast is a killer
 




 I used them just now - still good! 




 When I go jogging, I definitely bring him with me, though he is pull-y if I have him on the lead, so I let him loose - He's good and always stays in line of sight. 

Sometimes, on narrow paths, he works as my pace setter, running a set distance in front of me so I don't run too fast. 




 Not only will it have a military use - think of all those sci-fi gadgets you read about.  Computers built into your clothes, all your tracking apps on your phone you use to monitor where you run, how fast, etc.. Instead of relying on your phone keeping a GPS, your clothes could have that functionality built in. 

On a somewhat related topic, all those AR games like Ingress could use sensors in your clothes, powered by this tech let you know when there's a place of interest nearby, maybe like a little vibrating motor on the back of your neck or on your shoulder

 Aaaand I had to go check it out anyway.

[](/twiuhoh "What has been seen cannot be unseen") 




 Let's see what I got..

Huh. Still got that, I took that screenshot hours ago! [](/gamerluna) 




 Metal~!

Used to be a massive fan of metal - wouldn't listen to anything else.
Now my tastes are a bit wider and I listen to damn near everything apart from "Hardstyle"

 Oh hi mark.

Seriously, this film is so bad it's good. Enjoy.[](/celestlol) 




 I still need to get my copy!
Gah! I'm broke!

But yes, I agree with your best pony sentiment. Applejack is best pony after all. 

[](/ajsmug) 




 I didn't even know!

I just checked while I was at work, out of habit

Was about to close the tab out of habit, until i saw "Add to Cart"

I got it anyway. So damn excited, made a bad choice with my current phone.. 




 iwoot.com helps me out, if not, there's always the brawls in the town centre. They're always fun. I have an advantage.

 But

Is she going to do the Dinosaur? [](/ppseesyou) 




 I've proper buggered it up though. :( it fires, then shoots upwards.

I think one of my younger cousins messed around with my adjuster while I left it unattended while the battery was charging.  




 Oh neat, I thought the Manor was a zombies only event. Warrington ain't too far out for me.

Definately remember Bibby, and Graham and big Pete sound familiar.

Need to get my hop-up fixed before I venture out again, though. 




 I wish I could join in - alas, I'm in Bolton. Bit of a distance with my current budget issues. :( 




 Last I checked, aside from the Bolton Woodland, closest I could find was over on t'other side of the Pennines in Huddersfield  




 I used to play with First   Only, up on their Bolton Woodlands, and the Rochdale Mill before it got demolished - If anyone went to that last game, brilliant game. I was the pirate running around.

Not been out in a while, Aside from the Bolton woodlands, there's not much about that I can find.. :(

My favourite part of the game - Cosmo Canyon's BGM comes in a close second.

This song though, just fantastic. 




 Thanks again! Always nice to "see" your character for the first time. :D 




 Yep. That too.

;-; 




 Those two are the only thing I've seen so far in my travels on the internet which genuinely renders me sleepless.

Jeff the Killer is probably the worst. The story isn't too bad, but the picture gives me the willies somethin' awful. 




 It's that one time of the year I put a tenner on the horsies.

3 on the bottom

1 on one in the middle. 




 I've barely finished the intro. :(

Working and studying chews into writing times. (Also, the world is still in development in my head and all that.)
Gimmie a few years. :P 




 And that's only the beginning! (Really!) 




 Unfortunately, not so good. :(

 RSPCA might know what to do - maybe see if you can get a hold of 'em in your area.

If not, give the council a buzz and ask for animal control, surely they'll know what to do.

 ORANGERED MASTER TEAM!

HERE, SIR. HAVE A SWEET HAT. 




 I have not the fucking foggiest what is going on, but I have a Distinguised Medal of Something Significant, and I had a scepter of the Queens English earlier but that's gone.

WHAT IS GOING ON 




 Huh. 1990 here. Was in school, teacher had the Telly on with it happening.
We sat there and watched it for a bit, then went back to the lesson
(Brit also)  




 We're the closest accent to the Wiganers. We're vital for that translation service! 




 I got the dreaded speed wobble while driving my car on the motorway.

Turns out my tyre had burst. 




 So while I'm not exactly _new_ to the Fandom, an new to actively participating. I'm wondering about Conventions.  I'm aware of the annual Confuzzled that takes place in the UK, but are there any more?

I'm a bit of a convention nut and I've been to a few other fandom cons/general geeky cons.. but every other con I hear of is in the USA and I don't think I could head over there for a weekend, as much as I'd love to.

I think I'll skip on Confuzzled this year due to trying to work out my financial situation, but I'm pretty much open next year!

(Of course, I'm going to Download Festival this year, as well as _maybe_ attending BUCK in Manchester too, and then there's the obvious MCM Expo that turns up once or twice yearly.) 




 Where abouts are you at? I am located somewhat near the Kearsley roundabout. :D 




 I train software over the internet - one on one.

Sometimes I like to slip in funny words and see if they pick up on it.
Chances are, if they pick up on it, we'll have a laugh about it, if not - no harm done. 




 Kai is awesome! I got my commission off her too 




 Holy Shit, and here I thought I was the only one!  




 Not fun when I got to Cambridge at 9am, thought "M25 was wank, Might zip through London to get to Hammersmith. By the time I get there, the rush should be over"

Newbie mistake.

I drove 15 hours that day. It was _not_ fun. 




 Only been in to work. Which involved driving into Hammersmith, dropping some stuff off, and promptly getting the fuck out of there before the 9am rush hit.

I accidentally went into central London once. Nice Sights, but I was 7 hours late home. 




 Bolton - We're like Manchester, honestly. Please ignore the empty and charity shops 




 Mine's been on the fritz recently too.. seems to have picked up today, but I nearly slung my modem the other night. 




 That's Bolton, isn't it? - Opposite the Halifax

That motherfucker got me for parking in the long bus stop, right at the back for a grand total of 20 seconds 




 Cosmo Canyon, definitely. 

Do you think they have the background music going on? I'd settle for just the drums! 




 IT Trainer - Weapons mentor 









 Best bet is to go into google and just type their name

If you knew they went by some nicknames online, you could try that. 




 If you can't find them on the social networks, try asking your old school friends - they might know too. 




 I'm sat here at my desk at work, and I can so, _so_ relate to this

your writing style is fantastic, and I can feel myself really hating Angie, despite never meeting her.

For a little while, I thought you might have been one of my colleagues, but then you mentioned ITS and Finance sitting near each other.. We're in our own building, thankfully. 




 Manchester, on the lurk! 




 I've e-mailed him on info@richardlittlejohn.net

Probably a frontend where some poor intern deals with it all, but it's worth a shot. 




 THANK YOU, SIR. MAY YOUR DREAMS BE POLLUTED BY NAKED LADIES AND BEER. 




 SHIT YEAH I DID. JUST THE ONCE THOUGH

MY BUDDY WAS GETTING ALL DOWN ABOUT HIS CURRENT PREDICAMENT IN THIS AIRSOFT MATCH WE WERE IN.

I DIDN'T WANT NONE OF THIS SHIT, I'M HERE TO SHOOT FUCKNUTS.

I RELOADED, AND SHOUTED SHIT EVEN A DRILL SARGE WOULD BE PROUD OF

"LISTEN TO MOTHERFUCKER, IF YOU WANT TO SORT OUT YOUR PROBLEMS, DO IT IN YOUR OWN TIME, PANSY. WE'RE FIGHTING A WAR HERE - IF I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT FEELINGS, I'D GO TO A COFFEE MORNING AT THE CHURCH. I WANT YOU TO RUN IN THERE RIGHT NOW AND SHOOT AT LEAST 3 MOTHERFUCKERS. IF YOU GET SHOT, I AM NOT - I REPEAT **NOT** - GOING TO SAVE YOUR ASS.

IF YOU CAN DO THIS SHIT, YOU CAN DO YOUR FEELINGS SHIT."

(If it's any consolation, I did help him talk about them later, I was just in character and in the moment) 




 Red XIII (Nanaki) from Final Fantasy 7.

He's that silent badass who always has a minute to listen to his friends.

I have him, and his tattoo tattoo'd onto me. 16 years since I decided he was my favourite character, and he's still there. 




 Single right now. Not actively looking due to my Demi-romanticsm. Asexuality and a low sex drive isn't exactly inspiring to get myself a SO. 

So right now, I'm just playing writing stories, studying and working - and things can't really get much better for me!

I still miss my last relationship though. We were both fur - she was a wolf, I was a fox. LDRs are killer though. 




 When it comes to getting my head down and writing stuff for my novel, usually Ambient stuff does it for me, with a Space-y/Sci-Fi feel to it, like the Deus Ex soundtrack.

"A Thousand Suns" by Linkin Park is an usual one that gets me going, though. Especially "The Catalyst" and "Waiting for the End" 




 Asexual Male here! :D 




 Huh, it's on Ovi store too. I'm temporarily on my Nokia while I wait for my Nex4 to get back.

I'll install it and drop you whatever in a message once I get it set up. xP

Edit: Or not - Vodafone/Nokia think it's fun to not let me use the Ovi store because I've not paid my bill, even though I'm on WiFi.
 




 Yeah, looking back, the noises only ever happened when Voirrey was in the room - but still, there's some weird stuff that went on - like the builder's bread just apparently moving of its own accord. 




 Yep, it is!

[Here's a link for anyone stumbling across these comments later](http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/4915/gef_the_talking_mongoose.html) 




 I'd heard of Gef back when I was doing a lot of research into the Paranormal some years back - same with the ghost of Freddie Jackson.
Still, quite an interesting read, piqued my curiosity and now lots more research to do. :D 




 I'd much prefer to date a fellow ace, purely personal preference, but if I did fall for someone, I wouldn't turn them down or cut off my own love just because they were sexual.

My libido is very low, to the point where I could honestly go the rest of my life without sex and probably not really care. 




 (Sorry I took so long replying! - Had to go pick my sister up from the pub)

Congrats! I know a few Trans people, and they're looking forward to the OK on the HRT.

I've had a few "Eh?" and "Seriously? Isn't that the self reproduction thing?" and my sister said "Oh, so you're just not into relationships at all then?"

But nothing hostile, and when I went to a Brony meet a few months ago and the topic of sexualities came up in the post-meet-pissup, the fellow I was talking to was quite.. excited to meet an Asexual person, as he'd never met any before! Which was quite refreshing 




 Sexuality is a fluid thing - for all any of us know, in a few years, we could be sexual

But, to answer your question - maybe. HRT is a hormonal crazy time, are you currently going through the treatment? 




 I'd heard the term "Asexual" before, but I didn't think much of it - mostly in biology classes - Asexual reproduction. Of course when I saw people referring themselves as Asexual, I just waved it of as internet craziness.

Then I saw Jenni's BBC article - which is the Asexuality we refer to ourselves as, and I was pretty much ".. Damn, that sounds like me" 




 Yes, most definitely. Nothing better than being curled up on the sofa with the one you love, just chilling the night away, talking about whatever and just taking pleasure in each other's company.

An ideal relationship for me..  Hard to imagine.. For me, someone to come home to, tell them about my day, share a meal, talk a bit more, snuggle in bed.. I can't ask for any more than that! 




 For me, I was at work - I used to work checkouts at a clothes store - I had some other colleagues working with me, and every time an attractive woman walked past, they always checked out "dat ass"

Maybe I just wasn't into women, I thought. Was I gay without realising? A few more weeks passed. Nothing. I felt nothing for anyone.. 

But then I met my girlfriend, fell for her after a few months of knowing her as a good friend. We lasted a year before the distance killed it, but all the time - even when we met - I never once thought "I want to do the horizontal dance right now".. I was quite content to just sit on the sofa with her, cuddle, kiss and watch TV.

Cut to last year, I'm lurking on the BBC news site, and I see Jenni and Tim's article. "Hey, that sounds a bit like me.." 




 Evening!

I'm train_subject8542, Demiromantic and based in the UK (It's midnight here!)
I'll be here all night, I hope, and while "new" to the Asexual scene, I've been Asexual most of my life. 




 I got my typin' mode on! 




 Damn! And I just sent my phone back for repair.. :(

But yeah, I used to work shipping/receiving and it was always nice opening a box with a little baggie of skittles or something attached.

Even if you don't get anything extra back, it's always nice to brighten up someone's day. 




 Oh, neat. I just started a trial account the other day. I'ma come lurk on chat before I head to bed.. 




 Bolton's a bit shit, not much goes on here. Half the town is shut, and it's a bit scary walking down Manchester road at night.

I think the only thing interesting about the place is this little tidbit:

In 1651 the Earl of Derby was executed for his part in the Bolton Massacre outside the Man and Scythe

Also, another fun fact: I live 2 minutes down th' road from The "Phoenix Club", which I promptly clip people around th' lug'oles, and say "It's the St Gregory's club, you prick."

But I do quite like our accent. 




 You didn't even capitalize the I either.

You're a monster!  




 What's done is done, the past can't be changed. Let it flow under the bridge and let's hope both parties learn from the experience.

That's how I do with life. 









 23 year old Male, Demiromantic.

Up for it! Depends on time though, I'm free 9pm GMT up until about 3am GMT. 




 Yeah, I remember it now. Proper pain in the arse. Wakka, Lulu and Yuna's summons were my best friends in that fight.

Also, Haste. 




 Was that the giant undead version of the boss, or just the normal?

IIRC, you could just use Yuna and cast Life, or chuck a Phoenix Down at him 




 Too Human.

I spent 5 hours playing that game.. Every time I died, the resurrection animation took at least 2 minutes. When you're getting pissed off with a boss and that god damned fucking angel comes from the sky to grab you, then drop you off a 5 minute run away, you get frustrated every time that bitch comes down from the sky

Otherwise, I thought it was quite fun, I just couldn't stand the delay of getting knocked out of the fight, before being able to take control of your character again. 




 I was the same. 

Went from Fox, to Dragon, to a different dragon, to another different dragon, back to the first dragon, and now I'm a Lynx. Give it a few years and I'll probably be a Dragon again or something.

Go with the flow, do whatever! :D 




 While not the same, I went to a similar convention with no plans whatsoever. It was a first-time con, but it had still sold out. 

I did a lot of milling about, hugging suiters and just chilling with beers and watching panels.

Don't worry about it. Go in, do whatever. That's what they're for! 




 The only two I've done are the /r/snackexchange and the /r/mylittlepony ones (2011 and 2012 respectively)

Neither giftee seemed to give me a hard time over where I posted.. All depends on the person you get!
Heck, you could even get a fellow fur! 




 Aiight.

[Lynx attack go!](http://puu.sh/239p9) 




 The worst I personally encountered was on a friend's stag-do

We booked the field with an events company who run open days there. We had about 30 people with us, so we had the place to ourselves - it's a woodland.

Anyway, we're playing, and everyone's having a laugh, but repeatedly, we'd been telling one of the guys to "Take your damn hits" - At one point, I was stood next to the guy and I could hear the bbs bouncing off his gear.

I'd had it - but the Stag's brother got to him before I did. He snuck up closer and closer, peppering him on full auto with a G36.

He only shouted "Hit!" after a solid minute of being peppered. He was wearing goggles - his face had a few cuts.

He was being a dick through the entire day. Not taking hits, aiming for the head and generally not giving a shit for his or anyone else's safety. 




 Also, there's ConFuzzled this year which is in Leicestershire, which isn't too bad for me, but Northern Scotland might be a bit of a trek.. There's never much in the way of UK fur stuff, maybe apart from local meets. 




 Alas, just a few hundred miles to the south of you. :( 

Nice to find a fellow UK fur though! :D 




 Yeah, was jus' gonna say myself. Go look at "___ Goes to the Dentist" vids on youtube. Some of the inane babble some of them talk is _really_ funny. 




 Bit late, but this is my favourite when I hit the motorway:

[Blue Stahli - Let's Go](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lREZy9LBsKI) 




 Poop jokes are hilarious
(Englishman on late shift. :D) 




 You get laughed at? Damn.. Whenever I tell people, I just get "Huh, interesting. Well, whatever."

I have had the odd giggle, but what can they do about it? 

To be fair though, I stopped caring years ago. I have ponies sat on top of my monitor, I have the asexual flag on the back of my car. I am what I am and I ain't changing for no-one, nor am I hiding it.

It's hard to "Let go", but it's probably the best thing I did. Heck, if you don't make a big deal of it, no-one cares. If the topic comes up, mention it. People are more likely to take it in stride and roll with it. 




 Yeah.. I always say Asexual first to let them know I'm not just a weirdo - it's a legit orientation!

Then I say I'd rather be hugging on the sofa or playing laser quest or walking in the park with people.

[](/octshrug) 




 Oh, neat!

It still wigs me out a little when people post about Asexuality when they're not Ace themselves. Everyone else I've ever tried to explain it to were like "what-sexual?" 

[](/spitfuck) 




 You just beat me to it, fellow ace! :D 




 It's the granite top, there's glittery parts in there.  









 There's one game I've conjured up so far for my fictional race, the Feln: Coinsies

Based on an old schoolyard game I used to play back when I went to school.

**Coinsies**

A target is drawn on the floor, close to a wall. This game can be played with as many people as you like, as long as you can find your coin amongst the mess!

Competitors take turns flicking a coin at the wall, trying to get it to land in the centre of the target by bouncing it off the wall. Best of 3 wins the round, and a game normally lasts for 5 rounds

Its origins were back in the Lon empire, in the early 2100 years.. It's very much hard to play is the present day, mostly due to coins being taken out of circulation and digital currency being used globally. People still hold onto old coins, or make their own - just to play the game.

--

(Still early days yet, so this is the only one I have so far) 




 I've known for a while - since I was 18? maybe 17 - I've only recently heard of Asexuality.. I'm 23 in a few days

Until then, I thought there was something up with me, or my friends were greatly exaggerating their desires. 




 Add me if you want - though I'm not very talkative. Talk to me otherwise I'll be sat there on your contact list doing nothing :

 Google+ and Furaffinity, if we're not counting reddit.

Spend the most of my time on Google+ though. I've got an interesting bunch circled on there.  









 Can echo you on the Trainers being derp with the internals.

Luckily, the department I'm in now has 2 of us who are pretty handy with technicals. 

But how do you break a memory slot? Yeesh - I thought the RAM stick itself would break before the slot would. 




 Selling seems a bit extreme to me. If people asked nicely, I used to mock up quick character designs for them based on a personality or a race they wanted. 

Sometimes, no matter how hard people try, trying to create a character just completely eludes them

 




 Same. I was trying to work towards opening one last year, but I just couldn't drum up interest, investors nor funds. 




 No idea, unfortunately. 

Mine's pretty much the lowest it can be, I'm guessing. I was getting refused for even Tesco credit cards. It probably can't get much lower than that. 




 I'm in my "repayment year" - I've dubbed it. Chances are, I won't be applying for credit, rent or anything for a year or two yet. (Still at home)

I'm going to pay off this Payday loan, then clear off my credit card. then slowly start building up some savings. I was stupid in my teens and kept digging too deep buying gadgets and useless stuff. 




 They've frozen interest, but if I can't keep up with repayments (which I can) and I tick over 2 days of agreed dates, I have to pay the rest with interest. 




 Nah, I got on that slippery slope and last month, I finally tipped over the edge of not earning enough to pay what I owe them.

Rang up and said "Guys, can't afford this shit. Repayment plan?" "Sure thing"

Got it set up, and I'll be clear by May. 




 I'm stuck in it now.. Few months and I'll be out.

Luckily Wonga are nice enough to set me on a repayment plan without any arguments! 




 I had fun once.

It was awful

[](/rsangry) 




 I live in Takeaway, just north of Manchester. There's a couple of different awesome stuff up for grabs here.

The Godfather burger is amazing. Burger with pepperoni and BBQ sauce.

(The town's called Farnworth, but holy shit. The two main streets of the town are pretty much takeaway central. [Just 3 of them. I'd guesstimate around maybe 40 takeaways in Farnworth alone.](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en ll=53.546861,-2.392015 spn=0.006923,0.021007 t=h z=16 layer=c cbll=53.546657,-2.391867 panoid=mrJCE4eyN3-dyq7OBNqD1w cbp=12,221.52,,0,5.21)

 These guys were going off the deep end. " show quality is shit compared to season 1." " this episode is the shark jump"

I'm sat here like. "dude. It's got John de Lancie in it and it was fun to watch. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?!" 




 [](/vswhathefuck)I know for a fact there's people raging. I had to have a rant at them about it because hot _damn_ people take this pony thing _waaaaaaaaaaaaay_ too seriously.

 I like you, you think on your feet. 

I wish I could have gone, I had a ticket and everything, but I was with two attendees who didn't have tix.. and my heels were shot 




 The FAB afterparty was ticketed and it was sold out!. Still, there's a lot of fun to be had in manchester, and we were super fabulous this weekend with Manchester Pride being this weekend too!

[](/fabulous) 




 Yeah, Nat Geo turned up with some guys. They were pretty cool about everything and ha a laugh with some of the attendees. :D[](/ajhappy) 




 No FUN allowed!

I heard the stories of you guys in the Auditorium.

Still, glad you had fun! (Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun!) 




 So guys, if you're not passed out already, and somehow reading this, I want to say from me personally, you guys were amazing.

I was working security this year (I was the guy with the fauxhawk you may have seen looking dangerously determined at times) 

Thank you guys for keeping the spaghetti contained. Especially with the documentary crew there too. You were awesome fun to watch do your crazy thing, and I wouldn't miss attending it or working it for the world.

Now, I'm sleeping. Good night!

(P.S. If you're at the FAB Party, have a cider for me, will you?) 




 Probably. It's there all the time!

I even say it far too much when I'm talking to people too.  




 Age doesn't really matter. :3 

Do you have skype or any other kind of IM? Even if I am a bit older, can't hurt to chat every now and again, right? P: 




 Still stole my mug though. It will never be right ever again 




 I even brought that mug in from home. I will skin them alive. 




 I won't post this in the sub itself because it's more of a personal discovery than an Asexual thing, but if you're interested, I did a bit of a longer post just now where I think I found out why I'm a bit.. confused

http://gettingmadatnothing.blogspot.co.uk/2013/08/im-not-okay.html 




 Definitely, I usually have my freakouts in summer, the heat really gets to me and small annoyances build up quickly and I get broody and mean.

Luckily, I go to a lot of metal gigs so I just run in moshpits and get a lot of my stress out that way, but summer's always quiet.

But yeah, I have a hell of a temper, but it takes a lot to get me in full hate steamroller mode. 




 I was always certain I was just terrible at being Heterosexual, but for the last year I've identified as a kind of romantic Asexual, now I'm just not sure of anything, but I might be Biromantic or Demisexual or something

It's driving me fucking mental 




 I think I'll manage. I've got some understanding friends around me. It was just late last night and I had to get it out of me - rant blog was perfect for it.

Thanks though. :) I appreciate the offer. 




 I probably don't come across it in the post, but I had a little bit of a freakout last night. 

Up until last year, I was pretty set on everything I was.. Then It's just been turned around a little bit, then the last few days have happened and I'm not entirely sure of myself anymore - at all. 

It's been a bit of a crazy month, compared to my usual day-in-day-out monotony of the last 6 years, everything crazy just happened in the space of a week.

Quick edit: I guess I should add that I'm Biromantic Asexual. 




 To be fair, I barely skimmed it and I nearly left it out altogether. :P 




 I know there's a few of us. 3 Keep looking! :D 




 That'd get you a few reward points. Might even be able to get a new game!  




 I just found out where all the files I had stored (In my case, it's in a dropbox) and I just copied and pasted around to where I need it.

I've personally got it set up so if I modify and save at home, I can access it at work without changing anything.  




 The best me is a me sat in a dark-ish room, maybe with a lamp and a coffee and some paper and some pens.. Maybe a computer to write.

I'm a writer and I'm nocturnal, work best in the dark. I think about the future - I'm a Sci-fi writer and I'm a very speculative person. I get excited about technology and space and the future of society as a whole. 




 I keep trying but I keep getting tattooed so they won't let me. :(

I'm on the organ donor register though so I'm good on that front. 




 As I said in the rant, I don't want to impose anything on anyone. It just so happens the majority of the Fur Fandom sure does like their fetishes, and I'm not going to rise with the super-minority of the fandom to get them to stop posting their art. 

But that was an interesting read, didn't know they existed as I only joined the furry fandom in ~2008/9 and "Full time" as of a few months ago. 




 No worries, could always use the criticism.  I do get a bit soapboxy at times, probably unconsciously. I did try to rein it in a few times but it appeared to get anyway anyhow. 




 As I said in the title it was a bit of a rant, and yeah, I'm a bit of an idealist - always have been. It just felt good to vent, pretty much why I set up that blog. 

That being said, I didn't say that this sort of stuff should stop completely, I said at one point that if that's what you like in your media or like to talk about, feel free to like it, just don't talk to me about it when I've already said to leave me alone about it (and I don't watch much TV or listen/watch much media aimed at me for that sole reason) 




 I saw a tweet a little while back, and it made me think. I wrote this in about an hour, maybe an hour and a half about my experience being Asexual as a young white male.

Also, just generally jabbing at pop culture in general. 









 I use [Zim wiki](http://zim-wiki.org/), which I have access to via Dropbox.

I've got it installed at home and at work, with the files stored in dropbox.

You can also set up a local host webserver with it and access it remotely (view only) if you know how to port forward and know your IP address and all that. 




 Deadly 60 was on before the Dr who announcement. I thought it was quite interesting myself. Might catch it next time it's on.

Host was like an extremely excitable Steve Irwin lookalike 




 I'm not too sure what's worse. The Chav or the LAD.

I think I'm leaning toward the LAD. Can't tell if they are or not until they open their mouths. And by then, it's too late. 




 I love wasting their time. I like to think I'm biding time for the next person on their list if they're going out.

I just go with it then just as they ask for the login details I say

"Hey, you're asking the system administrator here that you think I've a virus on this system? The only way you could know that is if you either implemented that virus, have a listener in my system or you're just guessing. I'm guessing the latter. Piss off." 




 Ah. Fair enough.

Not a big 4chan lurker, I just go and lurk /x/ and /adv/ every now and again. 




 It's got a pinkish background, so it's on one of the nsfw boards. /x/ is blue 




 I got caught out in it.

and I didn't even run for shelter, I just stood there, arms wide open, embracing the rain. 

I missed you, friend. 









     wow    such fish
         amazing 
                        colours wow
    wet
          cold 




 Totally freaking forgot about it, and I've no money left.

Last year was mental. There was a Dalek just roaming around the place. 




 He is a Kangaroo. 




 Aaand, 9 hours later, I emerge from yet another Archive Binge. 




 Total bullshit. Foxes are so scared of people they won't even go into houses unless tempted by food.

I mean, yesterday I was out walking the dog and there was a fox running for a rabbit which had just crossed my path. A fox came running up not far behind it, saw me, and turned tail and legged it.

I wanted to see the fox. :( 




 Pretty much everywhere these days.

 I had some severe dental pain on Saturday, and I'd already had 1 too many painkillers.

the official medial advice from 111 was to wait until the morning for the emergency dentist. I didn't sleep that night.

Always wondered if I turned up at A E if I'd be turned away or just left to squirm in the corner if I was willing to tear my jaws off to stop the pain 




 I've got too many 'sonas, but I don't think Taern looks like me, I mean hell, I'm 6'2", his race is on average around 9 feet.

I think I designed all my characters and races to look every way different than I do. 

 




 We're a "special" lot.  




 Lynx' are so awesome. I am in no way biased whatsoever. Nope.

Here we go, back at my computer now.  That's got most of it covered. 




 I can't really explain sexual attraction as I've never experienced it.  But I imagine it as "oh, I'd like sex with that person" whereas I'm quite happy to just cuddle on the sofa at most. There's a cool article on HuffPost but I can't link as I'm on my phone ATM 




 Hah, I suppose we aren't. :P

Ace is just the nickname for Asexual. We're not sexually attracted to anyone, but we can be romantically attracted. In my case (Grey-ace) I can be romantically attracted to anyone but only after I get to know them really well. Otherwise it's the same as the sexual spectrum. Hetero, Homo, Pan, Bi, etc. 




 As RandomPotato said, Sexuality can be fluid. Some people find they'll go from Straight to Gay over time, and sometimes even back.

I've been Grey-Ace for all my life, but for all I know in a few years I could be Gay, or Straight, or still be Ace. 

Sexuality isn't a defining feature for humans. Those who care what you do behind closed doors need a new hobby.  




 Immediately - Sort myself out. House, family members houses, etc.

Short term - go a bit mental. Go to all the festivals, travel the world, see things, do things.

Long term - Be very Philanthropic. Startups looking for funding? Here you go - no biggie if it doesn't go anywhere. Invest in stuff. Start up my own silly little gaming cafe thing, just because I can. Giveaways every day. 

Dunno, in short. Just attach a a little tap to my bank account which will inevitably spring a leak and I won't give a crap to fix it. 




 I was there. Fucking amazing show. Rammstein blew them out of the water through sheer absurdity though. 




 Hello there fellow UK Fur! I'm in Manchester and I'm a Lynx.

I'm thinking of heading to Confuzzled next year, I'm too broke to head there this year. 




 Not in the slightest. 




 Nope. I'm me. I hide nothing when it comes to the internet. If I didn't want anyone to know about it, I wouldn't post or talk about it to anyone at all. that includes anonymity.  




 Have you seen Bolton/Manchester?

The Enlightened can't get a swing in without getting beaten back into the ground a day later. :( 




 Sounds fun, I'm guessing it's in the US, Can you pay for my flights?! :D 




 Nope! I'm sorry. :( 




 Drunk! 




 Kid! 




 [Kid, I had this awesome set of like 5 guns and we played in this field behind my house. I fell down a ditch and lended shin first on a fallen concrete post.](/spoiler) 




 Depends where you are, I'd imagine.

Look for decent coverage in the area you play a lot in.

I run with a Nexus 4 myself, on the Giffgaff network in the UK and it does pretty well. 




 Matt Berry plays the perfect sex pest.

"Oh baby, I like it when you touch me there!"

"That's your shoulder, and are you not at all worried about the giant demon coming towards us?"

"Hey, I like it when you touch me anywa-- WOAH what's that thing?!" 




 Yeah, twitching out on my end too. My scanner was showing a portal I'd captured a day or two earlier only having 1 level 1 resonator on it. Even though I'd upgraded to 4 4's and 4 3's.

Friend's scanner was showing that. Force stopped the app, restarted and everything - still nothing. Hope all is fixed by tomorrow. 




 There's more of us than I thought!

I wub you too. 3 




 Could always have a wander at Castlefield. Heck, just stop with a butty and sit on the grass near the walls. 




 Pre-toast a little bit, not too much. Maybe a minute on low heat

Put the cheddar on thick as you can get without getting too silly

Put under the grill until cooked to personal taste. Pull out, drip on some Worcestershire sauce. 

that's what I have, anyway. 




 As some of the posters have already said - there's no need to label yourself or just jump right into the deep end. 

I made my first 'sona almost a decade ago now, but it's only within the last few months I've decided "I'm a furry"

I don't let the label dictate me, nor the fandom. I'm also a brony, writer, doodler, and Asexual.

All of those have all sorts of different stereotypes, yes, they make me what I am today, but don't let one label get you down if you feel you _have_ to use that label. 




 I'm Asexual. I'm narrowing down my romantic scope still, though! 




 TiA is just /cringe but poking fun at people on tumblr for anything and everything anyone posts. 




 I like to think that it could be more than 1%, just people who might be ace just don't know what it is. I was convinced I was heterosexual with a low libido and a lack of shits to give until I heard about Asexuality. 




 Nope! Both Connie and Sasha missed on the plan, but Annie and Mikasa (I think) saved their asses at the last minute.  




 You're going to ruin everyone's festivals! 




 Huh! that's an interesting option - I'll give that one a go. 




 I've got an idea for a huge arcing story, but some small stories based in the universe might be good to get some ideas flowing and set in stone. 




 I'm studying a Dual Course - both A+ and Network+

It's not going too bad, I'm taking the first exam for the A+ next month, then I'll do the second after that.. Should be done then for A+. 




 I'm currently focusing on one project at the moment, but I fear if I start focusing on this one, I might lose some details of the rest of it. Guess that's what I have evernote for too. 




 I've got a full universe (lots of galaxies and FTL travel and everything) with races and planets and space stations and multiple stories all planned out... in my head.

It's hard to get it all out onto a mind map or onto paper. ._. 




 23, a few years out of an apprenticeship that went nowhere. Worked my way up from Line IT lackey to IT Trainer - now on 15k p/a.

Never went to Uni and dropped out of college when I was 1 year in. Studying CompTIA and Game Design on my own time and money. 




 I guess because there was no active damage going on, the Titan's body had a chance to regenerate. Whereas ErenTitan had other Titans hanging off him and chewing, so he didn't exactly break combat. 




 Wow. Holy Crap. [I mean I knew Eren was the Titan](#spoiler)  But the way the episode was laid out, the pacing, the action and the tension, oh god the tension.

[I nearly cried for Sasha, I've grown rather fond of her and I hate to lose the "comic" characters](#spoiler) 




 Yup, cycled to work. Nearly fell off the bike going uphill.

Wasn't too bad on the way back though. 




 Depends, mine are currently only shared with who I have on Latitude, so only 4-5 people actually see them 




 My avatars everywhere are my Fursona. Even on facebook where I connect with family and IRL friends. Had 1 like off my ex-gf, who was a fur herself.

No-one's given me hassle since, I guess I'm just mad enough so no-one really cares. My previous photos were me drumming, and me crosseyed at a party. 




 Those ears. My heart can't even 




 I'm known for my "I'll enjoy anything" attitude to films and games.

I nearly walked out of the cinema. 




 Cereal in fridge, milk in cupboard. Mornings elude me and I always forget what I did. Consider me surprised when I get home for tea, open the fridge.. 

"Oh. Muesli. 

What are you-- I did it again didn't I?" 




 Crikey. I'm at work right now, though I'm getting out soon. Right now it's very much a WIP and I'm still developing the world/universe/politics yet. But I'll keep yous in mind! 




 I did a little while back - I can go dig up the links if you like

I've nothing too serious going on, just a few stories I have in my head and want to get out. 




 Yup. "The Waldo Moment"  




 If you swim in the Sea at Blackpool or Southport, expect whatever body parts went into the water to not come out again.  




 When I get out of my car, I take the phone out of the cradle, climb out the car, then put it in my pocket. Seems about right to me.. 




 My Border Collie is called Benny.

He will come when called by anything. Heck, even if you make a noise. He's right there.

Choice names:

- Grump
- Butt
- Oi
- Ben-ben
- Dog
- Stink-butt 




 Some of that looks pretty Steampunk to me! 




 I'm Hetero/Demi-romantic and I masturbate. Purely for Stress relief, mostly. Might get the occasional urge like.. once a month. 




 I also accidentally a word. I feex. 




 I'm train_subject8542, and I cut my 3 feet of hair off to completely bald in a mental breakdown

 Huh. Farnworth was there back then too.

Damn, it really can't have been much. We're a land of takeaways and.. well, more takeaways. 
























 Ever had that feeling that somethings watching you? Even though you know nothings there?
I found something - or should I say, something found _me_, and.. I can see _it_

I dont know how I got away from it. Its been with me for months now, it knows where I live, where I work.. everything. It follows me, wanting to touch me. I dont know what it wants with me, but I know its bad. because _it_ doesnt want to be seen.

I suppose I should start with who I am and what I do, it might make sense then.

Im a van driver. I know, not exactly the most exotic or exciting of professions, but hey, it gives me time by myself to sing at the top of my lungs, or just to think. With home life going crazy at the moment, its nice to be alone. I can drive hundreds of miles a day sometimes; heck, sometimes Im away from home for weeks on end.. Like now.

Ill start at the beginning - but I can only hope that I can finish it before it finds me again.

It all started a few months back - as usual, I was driving around, listening to music, or the radio, I cant remember.. I usually listen to Jeremy Vine during the day if I can, otherwise I just put on some of my usual music. 
One of my last jobs that day was at an old house - I think it was the house of some accomplished author, I didnt really pay too much attention - it looked like it had been refurbished to accommodate tours, but the entrance for loading was down in the basement, using a ramp down to an open door.

Despite its new refurbishment, when I entered the basement, it still looked.. old. It creeped me out a little bit, it was still dark, and there was a biting chill in the long corridor. I buzzed the button and waited for my contact to come find me. 

In the corner of my eye, I saw a shadow.. peeking around a corner - I thought there might have been stairs there, and my contact was making sure I was there. When I twisted my head to look and wave her down, it was gone. 

Hello?

Nothing.

I shook my head and noted that I should stop letting my imagination get away with itself. It was only a few seconds before I heard a loud groan and a screech in front of me. My ears tingled and I stepped back, goosebumps appearing on my skin, before I realised the lift was coming down. Knowing it was the person I was waiting for, I stepped back outside and opened the back door of the van, ready to offload a few bits and pieces of equipment.

After boxing up a lot of things, I offered to take the lot upstairs and take it to the room the person needed. I left the van open, as I was only going to be a few minutes at most, and this place was in the middle of nowhere. Itd be fine, and the van was empty anyway. Any would-be-thieves would be disappointed.

I spent 4 or 5 minutes unpacking all the items, before heading back down to the van and waving goodbye.

It was a few weeks after that before I started noticing the shadow a bit more.
Sometimes, Id feel something behind me while I was driving. I knew the back of the van only had empty boxes or my laptop sat inside a bag under my seat, I never let anyone in the back - it was too dangerous, and I am a stereotypical van driver - quite nutty on those left turns.

I saw it most at my home though, but Ive always had weird experiences at my place, but Ive always put it down to sleep paralysis or just my imagination running wild, as usual. Shadow men approaching me as I lay in bed, but the shadow.. figure was being spotted not just by me, but by the family. Itd hide in cupboards, outside in the shed, stood in the garden staring at one of the cameras. But wed only see it for a few seconds before it disappeared.

It was focused on me though. Id spot it the most, and Id see it outside of the house. It was definitely the same thing though. It had a very distinctive shape. It was tall - about 7 feet tall, Id say. Im 62, so it was almost a good foot taller than me. And it was very wiry, almost only a few inches thick on its arms and legs.

It never approached; just watched. Just stood there staring. Id feel the hairs on the back of my neck creep up, and Id spin around to catch its long spindly arm disappearing behind a tree, or a traffic post, or around the corner of a building. Id spot it on the motorway, just standing on the verge, staring, as I sped past. It didnt have any eyes, but I just knew it was staring.

It started to escalate about a month ago now. If I wasnt constantly vigilant, itd start creeping towards me. Not a single crunch of leaves or gravel, even in quiet, echoey rooms, not a single footstep would be heard. It started getting exhausting. 

It was the worst when Id feel it while I was driving. I tried to ignore it - I checked the van already.. There was nothing there. Until I went to look into my left mirror. It was sat there for a split second, staring.. But this time, it had these.. empty, white eyes. I panicked, My van slid around the road and I pulled up on the side of the road and scrambled out. It was lucky I was on a mostly empty road. I stood across the road from the van and stared, my heart pounding and my breath fast and sharp. 

This was getting ridiculous now - but I had no idea on what I could do. Maybe it was the medication? A few of us in the family were on similar medications. I decided to stop taking them and talk to the doctor about the hallucinations.

Its been about a week now since I said Id go to the doctor, and Ive not had the chance to go. Ive not taken the pills, but Im still seeing it. Im getting exhausted from the constant vigilance, but I dont want to find out what will happen if I let it catch me. Im holed up in a hotel at the moment, working long distance. Im not expected back until Friday, and this hotel is a signal deadspot, no mobile signal, so if something happens - no-one can contact me.. or try to contact me anyway.

Maybe its trying to keep me awake, its hard to drive when youre tired. Theres only so much that coffee can do. Ive not seen it today, though. Maybe I lost it driving down here? 
 




 Money for kickstarter projects doesn't get taken until the funding date has ended. So in this case, no money was taken at all because the creator cancelled before the due date. It's a much needed safety precaution. 

If the funding wasn't hit by the due date, money wouldn't get taken (Unless it was flexi funding, which this wasn't - Always keep your eye out for that.) 




 Update: the funding has been cancelled. Looks like the creator had a flick through the comments here and realised they hadn't thought it through.. :( 




 The software they're using is a package software which looks like it allows them to use assets on a premade "app" so to speak. I've raised a few of the issues with them still 




 Hey guys, not sure if you've heard about this yet. 

There's a kickstarter underway to make an Asexual dating app, much like Tinder or Grinder. I'm not affilated with it at all, but I'm hoping it can get funded! 

I'm very much sick of flicking through both Tinder and Grindr to try and find something, and all I can find is people after casual hookups or are very much searching by appearance.

The creator's answered a few questions about the effort, and it seems like it's pretty legit, chucking a dollar or two at it shouldn't be too bad. :3

Link is here!

 Took 3 hours, done in one sitting.

Had quite a crap few months. Elastic Heart by Sia helped me realised I had depression and pushed me to get the Diagnosis. Felt it only right to get a homage. It also looks badass. 









 ..And I don't get paid until Thursday. There's only so far Noodles are going to get me.

I would be super appreciative if one of you kind folk would sub me a pizza - I will get you a pizza right back on Thursday! 

If it helps any, I'm in the UK 




 Niiice. I love me a bit of 'tallica. Static-X and Rammstein was pretty much my entire teenage years. Gutted about Wayne!

Watched Rammstein..  last year? at Download Festival. Damn crazy show. 




 Oh man, Black Dahlia Murder - Only head of them when I was at Download Festival in 2008. Jumped into a pit and promptly got knocked over, fell on my face and broke my nose. Fun times. 




 Woo!

At the moment, I'm in an "Upon a Burning Body" mood, which is where I got the inspiration to get the commission for! But my all-time favourite band is In Flames 









 I went there yesterday. Jesus Christ, couldn't move for people standing in the way, or taking selfies.  




 http://taernfastgrade.tumblr.com

Absolute nonsense but mostly funny reblogs with a little bit of furry in there. 




 I'm on the staff for one of the bigger UK pony cons, and some of the stereotypes of bronies can be completely true. It's the most vocal, noticeable members of fandoms that almost set the tone for the entire fandom. Not to say that they're completely annoying - some of my closest friends I met through the brony fandom, and while I'm now anything _but_ a brony, I still keep in frequent contact with them, and I'm trying to put time aside for watching the show.

In terms of them being almost the same, I can see your point, but while the pony fandom has a canon thing to base their fandom and discuss and whatever else, the furry fandom doesn't really have so much of a base other than themselves. Yeah, there are films and shows like.. half the disney catalogue, but furs are a completely separate entity. In terms of how the fandom feels, yeah, they're lmost the same, I guess. I find the furry fandom tends to have an older average. I attended BUCK 2012, and I worked it in 2013 and will be working it this year, and I'd pin the average age for bronies (in the UK at least) about 17-18, making me (24) feel a tad old.

On the other hand, Furries in the UK tend to be older. I was at Confuzzled this year, and there was times I felt like one of the younger attendees. With an older average, the behaviour tends to shift more towards mature... Alcohol related stuff.

It's just unfortunate that the pony fandom has this huge stigma around it now because of the surge of what I like to call "Former Sonic Fandom Members" - the open RP on public pages, terrible english/grammar, and over the top fandom-evangelicalism. ("This video is 20% cooler!")

.. Wow, I kind of went on a bit there.

Quick edit: [I had a kind of similar ish blog post last year-ish.](http://www.accordingtotaern.com/2013/10/a-breakdown-of-fandoms.html)  




 Aah nards. In that case then, if you're searching display name, it's just Taern and you should see my fursona in there somewhere. He's a grey lynx with back hair \ blue ear tufts 




 Add me on steam! I've got about 200-odd games so chances are we'll have one or two in common. I'm EU based so timezones might be wacky. 

I'm "zeifer" on steam.  




 Cosmic's suit is so soft and huggy! Was at CFz, it was amazing! 




 Go ahead and add me if you like. I'm Taern Fastgrade on G+ :3 




 Me too. I was gearing up for an eye-rolling night, but the only time I wanted to punch him was when he started going off on one about airports. 




 Mine also ends in BJ. 9BJ.

All 9 of them. 




 Brugge is fantastic. I went in January in 2007 and there was barely anyone around, I walked around all the buildings, the parks, the towers and bought some excellent chocolate from a tiny gift shop down some really tiny side street 




 Not been in for a year or two myself, but yeah. It's pirate themed and got a little monorail inside. Not sure if it's laser gun themed because every time I've gone, it's always been off!

I think I'm too big ^tee^hee for the ride anyway, I'm like 6"2 and pushing 300lbs and I imagine it's a bit tiny and aimed at kids anyway. 




 Aaah, Blackpool. Many a childhood memory there. Coral Island took all my money as a teenager. I love arcades! 




 I'm not sure that would be wise. I know for a fact I'd be attached to a wall mumbling something about keyboards.. 




 Once I left the Retail job, My tax righted itself and I was only paying around 50 tax/NI. 




 It was coming out of my new Full Time job, which I got a few months after starting the weekend part time at retail.

Was getting around 800 a month from my Full time place, which the 200 tax came out of, and 220 from retail which wasn't taxt. In the end I was essentially working weekends to pay off the 200/mo tax

I worded it badly, I'll admit that one. o.o' 




 The Retail job was my "first", technically.

 I moved to what is now my current job which became my second. the 20% applied to this, which was where the 200 was coming from. Rather than fuck around with the tax office to get codes swapped, I just left my retail job and got the issue corrected. 

Got my weekends back and had a good wage until I got myself in debt like a tit. 




 I was doing 8 hours a weekend in my old Retail gig, coming out with about 220 a month from there.

200 was taken out in tax. I was losing money just working there with transport costs 




 Not exactly the most imaginative, but it goes so well when I'm tanking and I'm playing FFXIII music!

Working out outfits for my MNK/SMN

 




 Hi Guys, apologies if it's already been answered elsewhere, but I did search and found nothing.

I've come upon hard times lately and trying to work off a ton of high interest debt. I'm just about getting by with my current wage but it's by the skin of my teeth.

Pay rise at my current job is out of the question, so I've been thinking about a weekend part-time job just to pad out the earnings a little bit and get a change of scenery from the office

I've scoured the HMRC site but it's all vague and personal allowance stuff, which I'm already over with my current job salary.

Last time I had a second job, I was 17 doing part time, and with the tax code I had I was paying upwards of 200 on my second job, making it completely pointless with the hours I was capable of

Just wondering, what is the usual situation for a second job's Tax Code? I think last time I may have been on an Emergency Tax Code 




 I use CJS keys, but I think they're a UK company. It's all online, so it shouldn't matter, but all prices are in !

**Quick note, what I've linked is an _EU_ time card. Careful!** 




 Similar mechanic on WoW - Disengage for hunters.

Mid Lich King Heroic attempt, decided to disengage out of a puddle of bad.

Went flying off the edge like a lunatic. Cackled all the way to my death. 




 Reading the shenanigans at the reception, I had the Benny Hill theme playing in my head. It just fit so well. 




 We're still recruiting to get enough people to get a group of 8 actives in the FC, so we're just getting stuff like Ultima and Titan HM on "farm" to get our FC working well together! We want to get to coil soon and I think we're getting there. 




 "Cheers pal"

If everyone in front of you has already used all the variations of thanks, it feels weird, and I always feel shite if I forget to thank him. 




 Hah, will do. Pretty set in Cerberus though. Playing with a pretty tight-knit FC and some rad contacts in my linkshells! 




 Nope. I went the whole hog after trying everything I could find on the internet for the last 3 hours.

Internet Options, clearing files, attempted reinstalls, .rar files of game folders before losing my temper with W8 in general and reinstalling 7. Then I found this thread. 




 God damn, there I was cursing out W8 for ruining everything. Lost my temper and put W7 back on hoping it'd feex.

My connection in general with them has been pretty shite of late too.  




 Taern is the secondary character in my story idea. He's a soldier in a rogue squadron after being denied permission to investigate a potential threat to the species. They rob a shit-ton of weapons, armour and shields (Sci-fi!) and go investigate. 

I eventually adopted him as my fursona, but making a few changes to identify between Canon-Taern and Me-Taern 




 Probably. I even type it too much as well. Even when something will definitely happen. "Yeah, probably will."

What can I say, I like an open ended story 




 I think I've seen this before! When you approach it with the prerequisites filled, an event kicks in! 




 On my mind right now?

Debt. Debt. Debt. Currently buzzing around in my mind like particularly vicious wasps stuck in a jar. I'm running around a labyrinth in my mind, trying to find solutions but I keep running into dead ends and pitfalls. Pitfalls filled with even more vicious, angry wasps.

Above the maze, a lone laughing figure, occasionally slamming a huge fist in my path before demanding more money. 

I have a small companion running the maze with me, but clearly not as invested as I am, mostly because I'm keeping him out of it on purpose. He's my only light at the end of the tunnel, and thinking of him keeps me sane in the labyrinth of debt and anxiety.

Sometimes, I'll reach sections of the maze with giant books in the way. I open these and huge ideas fill my head. I want to write them, draw them, live them.. but I'm trapped in the eternal loop of work, sleep, and running the labyrinth 




 I keep meaning to come to the manc meets, but I'm always working. .

Cool suit! 




 I use CJS keys. If they're in stock, you can usually get to your key within 5 mins. Pretty nifty. I'd link but am on my phone. 




 I always saw it as inflating one cheek only. It always looks like a neutral-ish expression, kinda like thinking about something. 




 :T 




 I use CJS Keys. I pay via bitcoin too!

 I was torn from my Button yesterday. The MT from the previous fights was sleepy, so I made the ultimate sacrifice of leaving my button.

I miss my button. Tomorrow, we shall be reunited. 




 Gravy on everything. Including ice cream.

Gravy is good.
 




 I'm in a relationship now with my boyfriend now for 4 months. We've engaged sexually twice.. mostly because of awkwardness with families. 

I'm personally up for it, if just to keep him happy. I'm a complete virgin so I'm extremely inexperienced, but he's been amazing and very understanding about it. 

I can't say I enjoy giving oral.. I've gagged quite a few times but I guess it's all about learning. Heck, even receiving.. It feels odd.

I'd rather just snuggle and watch films..  




 Is it bad that I kind of want to roll a planet? Your description was amazingly disgusting still, but.. did she actually roll or was it kind-of-like a deflated [football](http://leicesterexchanges.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Football.jpg)? 




 It's difficult to be in a relationship with a "sexual" (As much as I hate the term), because your partner wants sex, and in my case, I'm just obliging him to keep him happy.

I don't mind doing this, because in the end, a relationship is about compromise. But that's just me.

You just have to be clear and draw a line with him where you feel comfortable and where you don't. If he doesn't like it, there's no point "hooking up" because it'll only result in more and more friction and it might get ugly. 




 I generally just mark in order of what should really be killed (Barbers in Pharos, Dullahans in AK) then tab then 2, etc.

Makes it a little smother, so I can get a combo off on 1, flash, 2, flash 1, flash, etc. 




 I'm on Tumblr, but I'm not exactly a source of info. Laughs, maybe. Little bit of cynicism and sarcasm dotted around with maybe the occasional Asexual post. 




 Probably get latched onto by the boyfriend for one, then get extremely confused because if I'm in here, then who's being "Me?" 




 Shit yeah we do. Otherwise it's my fault if you pull an enemy off me, and my pocket healer laughs at me. 




 Beat you to it by a few years! But it's a nice reminder. : 




 Was just messing around in Revenants while waiting for LS buddies for Crystal Tower and got my camera like this.  









 Hallo!

Mostly lynx with a bit of an otter side.

 I stream here or there. Usually when I'm fucking around on FFXIV with Free Company buddies. 

[My Stream!](http://twitch.tv/zeiferrei)

With 2.1 hitting, we're playing a lot more, but we usually do end up playing at 8pm on Sundays more often than not. 




 "Shit me, I'm on Mars." 




 This just in, Bear found shitting in woods 




 How to run further and faster

1. Warm up: Watch your ankles, the Benny will stay 1 step behind you at all times.

2. Another dog? New friend!

3. How to hill climb: Just follow the dog. 




 Hybrids are fun to work with! It's all about trying to merge to animals together in all sorts of different ways to see what looks good. 

Folfs are quite common as well as Dragon/Anything

But you could always combine the different kinds of cats. Lynx/Jaguar? Tiger/Lion?

I've gone Lynx/Otter for mine because why not? 




 You get the occasional crazy, aye. But most know their boundaries and will back off when asked.

If not.. well, that's what people like me are about for. Find a staff member and they'll find security, and we'll give 'em a proper telling off or kick 'em out if they're repeat offenders.

But don't let the stories scare you (if they are!) Cons are a blast and I've met many great people from them. 




 Me and a few buddies play Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn. 
We're hyped as shit for 2.1 when we get home.

We mostly UK with a few drop ins from Scandanavia. We're more of a gaming community in ourselves. Most play LoL, while the rest of us play FFXIV. We'll drop in and out and play other games too.
 




 Aye. Twas BUCK.

Pants man was this incredibly crazy fellow running around with a pair of boxer shorts on his head, thrusting at anyone and anything. He even got a group and stood outside the convention venue and thrusted at passing trams.

I had to make sure anyone he was thusting at wasn't feeling uncomfortable, and watching that lunatic as well as vendor tables was a headache. :P 




 Might possibly be working this year. \^^

It'll be my first, but from my past Con attendance, UK cons seem to be pretty chill in terms of attendees. I worked at the UK's biggest Brony con doing security and aside from a few creeps, everyone was rather well behaved!

I'd say depending on where you live it might be worth staying at the Venue. If you live only 20-30 miles out, it might be worth just buying petrol money/public transport. But if you're like me and 90-100 miles out, on site accom or nearby accom is best bet.

But in all, Conventions are made by person interaction. Half of the conventions I've been to wouldn't have been as funny if it wasn't for the attendee interaction. 

Oh Pants Man, you were amazing, but such a security annoyance. 




 About a year and a half now.. I'm 23. 




 I asked a few weeks back as well. Got a canned "Not accepting at this time but isn't ruled out" response.

(Ooh, actually. Quick edit: Takeaway.com have some places in the UK and they accept bitcoin!) 




     such coine
                          wow
       bite cgminer
                        DCTm3ZdtKnBbbhGrEQ4DAoZFCjpo31XfHE
                  such addreess 




 Left the house for a coffee and to walk the dog. Nearly got bowled over and damn near dropped my coffee. Dog shit himself when I nearly fell on him

Also, lost my favourite hat. Whizzed off my head, rolled down a hill and landed in t' river. 




 Love this song. As someone in a relationship with another male, this one really hits home.  




 On the submission, they say that the final thing is full colour. The sketches are just an example of the poses. 




 If it's heavy, I usually love it.

Prog, Melodic, Heavy.

In Flames, All The Remains, Devildriver, Rhapsody of Fire are my favourites, but I love all kinds of metal 




 I got the same. I found it actually quite accurate. I might actually have to pick up To Kill a Mockingbird. 




 Used to play quite hardcore, but dropped it after burning out something awful.

I might pop back for Warlords of Draenor and see where I go after that 




 Very much so. I find when I'm doing some tome grinding I can only do 3 or 4 in a row before needing an extended break. Luckily I usually run with FC/LS buddies so they can usually be quite happy to wait for a few while I take a few to catch up on reddit or something

I'm getting used to tanking, so I'm getting better at not fucking up too often. Have my occasional brainfarts, but who doesn't?

I saw that someone said they run with the focus of not messing up - I'm exactly the same. It really drains you, even when you mark and cane the emnity. You want to position everything right so that the MNK/DGN doesn't have to move much.

I'm an overperformer when I really don't need to be. I hate to inconvenience the rest of the party and it kills me. 




 Well, you know. We like to hold hands and be interested in people of.. _The same sex_

We're totally deplorable and I'm surprised we've gotten away with it so far 




 I run in screaming.

Run in spamming my key for Shield Lob until it goes off. As I'm positioning the boss, I'll throw in Circle of Scorn, turn around, start off with Fast Blade, then throw in a Spirits Within, then Savage Blade  Rage of Halone

then just FB  SB  RoH, throwing in Spirits Within and Circle of Scorn when available or save them for upcoming mobs or save the high damage things for Bloodbath combined with Fight or Flight 




 Not much development has gone into weapons yet, but I've got a "gun" that targets an electrical appliance and turns it off. Usually used by "dark" squads to kill lights as they move around starships

I'm more or less focusing on society, mannerisms, and clothing styles right now. 




 Still on my PS3 at the moment, but feel free to add me if you like.. Is it cross-platform for PSN friends? I forgot.

Add me! 

**train_subject8542** 




 Same here. Oddly enough, Google Services on highest battery usage, followed by AlarmDroid, weirdly enough.

Only at 73% battery though, though I leave mine on charge overnight. Been at work now for 7 hours.

My usage today stands at 27% Services, 26% AlarmDroid

Unless Play music streaming counts as Services now, it's a little odd. 




 Meteor is always hilarious. We didn't have any melee DD for a pre-made titan group, but we were getting the heart down every time, so there was no worries

We were saving the LB3 for healers should shit have gone down, but we were gong flawless, so a BLM used LB3.

all I could hear on mumble was "I CAN'T SEE!" and the guy's HP bar suddenly drop to Zero. Turns out he got hit by Landslide.

It was some miracle I could actually stay upright to finish tanking him. That was our kill too! 




 That was an interesting afternoon. I was like "That's that Charlie fella from busted, oh this is going to be pure cringe."

And then they actually were quite good. 




 We're stuck in the early 90s.

Please help us. 




 Your profile is confusing me. You're in Paladin gear but the picture shows not-paladin gear. 




 I've found when I'm tanking anything or running around in FATEs or whatever.. I'll run out of the AoE and jump. 

I've not been hit by an AoE in a while unless I've been _really_ derp and either not noticed the cast bar (AK End boss, I'm looking at you) or I've just horribly mistimed running away. 




 I'm in IT Training, hoping to get into IT support soon.

the whole talking with other people aspect of it is kind of draining on me, being an introvert and all that, so at the end of the day, I'm really drained and absolutely _need_ to be left alone.

But aside from documenting what goes on in the calls, it's great for me because there's no other organisation to do really. I can just have piles of paperwork of things to teach or show around me, with no need for anyone else to look at my stuff.

I'm quite outgoing when I am on the calls (or at least I try to be) but I definitely need my downtime between calls or at home otherwise I burn out and get cranky and nasty with colleagues or family. 




 I'm a little bit of a cynic, I've been burned a few times in the past when I was a little more trusting, so I've slowly evolved into a bit of a cynical bastard. 




 I totally forgot about it. I used it back in 1.0 with the limited amount of time I played.

[Shameless link because I can](http://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/2284483/blog/436904/) 




 I don't hide it, but I don't flaunt it.

Well. Maybe a little. Profile pictures are of him, but I'm not labelling myself furry on profile bios or anything. Heck, on Facebook (Old school friends, family, etc) I even got a few likes when the "Changed his profile picture" went up. 




 Aggressive stuff. Heavy/Hard Rock, Metal, "Bro"step (Knife Party, Some Skrillex)

Favourite bands at the minute are [In Flames](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewFgQqklqHM), [Royal Republic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xN2hL8NvrMw), [Knife Party](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipX6wgwuHho), [Pendulum](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogMNV33AhCY), [Korn](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hetDSqvMT4 feature=youtube_gdata_player)

But I pretty much like anything - [Ah Nee Mah](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uqFJ0daX6s), some BGM Music for towns in FF games like [Cosmo Canyon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvpL1bfc6YI) or [The Great Warrior](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4bEPxULwME) are my favourites for chilling out to.
 




 Excellent. Just in time for payday too! 




 Huh, when did that change? I drove past a Sainsbury's on my way home and it was 1.29.  




 Extremely unpopular - everyone would kick off if it shoots up again.

I know I've got it good on my tax (20/yr) but 1.30/L up norf still makes my wallet shiver. 




 Bit rainy, like. Nothin' we can't handle. they've been yammerin' on like it's the end of the world or summat.

Weather was worse on Friday, like. See that funderstorm? Bloody hell, not seen one like that fer a bit. 




 I'm totally the opposite. There's barely anything there.

I'm in a relationship now and still - nothing.
Although I am Asexual, so that probably explains it. 




 Eesh. Typo'd in the title. Meant to say Grumpy butt. It's what I call him when he starts groaning at me for patting his paws while he tries to sleep.

He's 13 now. Old git! 









 That road looks so familiar. It's actually going to keep me awake while I think of where it is. 




 I'm on Cerberus as well. I'm Paladin, I have a WHM/SCH friend and a Bard friend. If we're doing nothing we're always up for anything short of Coil! Our FC isn't exactly active though - we're like freelancers. 




 Aye, that you can. M/23/British here as well and somewhat sexually active. My body doesn't seem to do much more other than snuggling and stuff after a weekend with someone close last week.

There's groups of Asexuals (I've seen them) who are a sex hating bunch, and it's hard to talk them around or even have them see your point of view without getting hostile

Sexual attraction and the act of sex are two totally different things. I've always been Ace, so I can't even describe how Sexual attraction works, but yes, you are still Asexual if you don't feel sexually attracted to someone.

(I've always imagined Sexual attraction being - upon seeing someone, you have a pull to have sex with them, or at least get really close with them physically) 




 "Yes, this is dog. What's that? Your owner obviously didn't throw the toy and he's acting like he did? We can get him for distress for that. Here's my direct number and address." 




 I came out to my parents a few days ago, though mum's totally confused. Admittedly, I came out as Biromantic at the same time, but she's confused at that too. 




 Exactly. 

I had a bit of an experience this weekend where I found out I'm definitely Ace, I can understand why sex is "valued" by people, but I frankly found it boring and was quite happy to just have the snuggles and the cuddles, etc. 




 Done by klippy, she did such a fantastic job on it I just can't even anymore.

Character on the left is Shia'le, on the right is my main 'sona Taern. 









 [](/cadanceheart)I pick up on smells and scents a lot. I've got a pretty close person in my life right now and lots of smells trigger memories of them. It's amazing and it helps me feel a lot better

Old smells, like Nan's cooking will sometimes come to be out of nowhere. Kind of like a scent memory bank. I get looked at funny when I say "What the hell, I can smell [thing]!" when we're in a concert or in the car or somewhere where I won't typically smell the thing 




 Tell me about it, Luckily I was tanking and my FC buddy who came with me was healing, so they had to be a little patient, the other tank was having fun with trash with the other healer

Still felt mad pressured to skip cutscenes though, buddy kept shouting at me to watch the cutscenes over mumble 




 The beautiful thing about a newly released MMO is that boss tactics aren't widely known in game, and no-one "expects" you to know the dungeons

I tanked Cutter's Cry a while ago, and Chimera was definitely interesting, After a 2nd wipe I was wondering why the healer and the caster dps were getting hit - was I missing adds or was there some damage I couldn't keep hold of?

turn out I didn't notice Dragon's Voice hitting distant players. After we got the dance down, we caned him.

I love running blind in dungeons - I tried to do it in WoW but I was a late starter and everyone expected you to know what to.

Heck, I ran Ampador Keep blind last night with two FC buddies and while I was freaking out at trash mobs (I'm a paladin and there was a Bard and a BLM in the party, AoE Party!) It was super fun, Demon Wall took some doing and working out when and what happened. 




 the worst part about trying to come across as sex positive as an Asexual is that people, upon finding out you're sex positive then say

 "Well then, you're not Asexual" 

as if to say the "Involuntary Celibacy" is the whole point of being Asexual. 




 Sitting here at 11pm, wearing my hoodie and nursing a hot choc..

Beats the crap of swearing at the fan for not being cold enough and tossing and turning all night, getting some heat-induced insomnia. 




     wow 
                       such effects

        such reaping

                          wow


      must save galaxy 









 I've got the craziest head. I've got plenty of stories in my head I'm trying to write, if I can somehow get the time.

I love writing as well, I write on a rant blog for myself to let off some steam. I can sit and write for hours with minimal fuss.
