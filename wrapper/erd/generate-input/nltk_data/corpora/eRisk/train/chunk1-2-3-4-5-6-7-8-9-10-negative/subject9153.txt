 The owner just asked me about him just adding Peroni to his mix, which I sort of tut-tutted.  He seems to be genuinely interested in stocking better options than the usual national suspects.  It looks like got cooler space for maybe 24 options.  What do you think? 




























































































































 If this is an RES thing, please advise and I'll submit there.

I'm stuck with a perpetual -1 next to me.  When I try to upvote or downvote myself, it increases the -1 to -2 and -3, but I can get it back to -1. 

I don't know how I did this, but I spent a lot of east coast USA late hours in /r/olympics last week while tipsy.  I think I may have inadvertently tried to upvote a comment I forgot that I had made -- things were moving very fast in say the womens slalom thread.  Maybe I tried upvoting an event thread which were self posts?  

Any idea how to set myself back to neutral?
 












































 You have to hand it to NBC.  They suck but sometimes they don't.

 Yahoo seems to be set up for game by game predictions like an NFL pool.  I think in past WC's I've done pools more like an NCAA basketball bracket where you have to predict the F4 and so on before the tournament begins.

 I completely and absolutely disagree!

The Chinese are a communist state and could harness whatever they needed for their opening.  It was spectacular, but as I was watching it, I thought "at what cost?"

The Brits had a terrific opening themselves, and free world.  

However, it was their closing ceremony that I will always remember.

 Only during sports and reality shows.

Fun anecdote: when Survivor was a cultural thing, in the season 2 finale, I was watching with my windows open.  Runner-up Colby made a decision that guaranteed him not to win (he took Tina to the final two).  

As soon as he did it, I yelled "YOU FUCKING MORON!" out of frustration and anger at the top of my lungs... and could hear people up and down my block laughing.   




 I re-checked -- yup somebody posted it in there, but only part 2.  Only 18 upvotes.   

I dunno.

I absolutely love /r/truereddit -- you have great taste in r/'s.   




 I'm kind of happy about this.  Uber's great but I never liked how it puts the costs   benefits of driving for them onto the newbie drivers.  It's not a career driving for Uber.   









 I thought this was a fake due to the euro style of printing of the phone number with a period instead of a dash...

but apparently it's true:

 All I can say is that we were both in ski boots, which is a great equalizer.  

I imagine he wears higher heels or lifts when in day to day public. 

Nothing wrong with this at all -- he needs to project his larger than life persona and I wouldn't fault him.  

I'm just saying I think he's naturally shorter than me -- I, too, was surprised to find this.  

He's still a big MF. 




  Aleksa Palladino

I have been in love with her since her arc in Boardwalk Empire.  I don't speak metric, but an online converter says she's 5.74147 feet and that Lee Pace of 195cm is 6.39764 feet tall.  That's about right actually.

I'm 5'11" and a 5'7" girl would be roughly at the level of my nose.  Had I grown another four inches, shoulder is about right. 




 He speaks in a Texas "good ole boy" vernacular.  It's not important.  He rarely says what he really means.  Those guys speak in visual cues.  I love them. 




 I'm old enough to remember Jolt cola, the Red Bull/Monster too early energy drink -- this is the soda can Gordon speared at the beginning.

I had one once.  Once. 




 Rumor on Dexter: the reason he became a lumberjack is because as a child in that container, he watched his mother get dismembered by a chainsaw.

I just heard this today and was all Sudden Clarity Clarence.

 




 I bet the Turner family isn't going to let GRRM anywhere near that cute doggie. 




 Really?  If I don't hear the confirmation beep, I try to rescan it once or twice, and then the driver usually nods me back into seating. 

I've never been yelled at by a Metrobus driver.

 That's exactly it for me.  The Orioles seem nice enough but OMG how I hate their owner. 




 If you haven't read this two-part long-form article on the investigation into Silk Road, this is a must-read:

http://www.wired.com/2015/04/silk-road-1/

I read them in the print edition. Force is a major character, but I don't remember anything about Bridges.
 




 OK Mythbusters, solve this one. 




 I don't know where they'd fit.  Too long for new, I'm sure tech's already seen them, and I think I saw them on truereddit -- I was suprised because I had to wait a month between part 1 and 2 for the next issue to arrive -- I subscribe -- and there it was online.

The formatting of the print articles was really interesting so I waited it out.   




 YAY they remembered us in DC! 




  If a 1960s show is rerun today, the content may be edited by nine minutes to make room for the extra advertisements.

This really infuriates me.

Anyhow, I DVR basically everything and ffwd through the commericals.   




 I've met Schwarzenegger while skiing.  I'm 5'11" and he's shorter than me.  Maybe 5'9".

I have never seen shoulders that wide though, even under a ski jacket.   




 Staged.  Why would the frisbee thrower throw it to the dog? 




 The celtic chief probably trusted a lieutenant to bury them, then the Romans killed anybody who knew where they were buried. 




 I really hope somebody remembers this article when it comes time to hand out the Pulitzers.  Not only did the journalist write a compelling true crime piece, but also explained the technology seamlessly, not to mention the applicable laws.   




 I have it -- is that what caused it? 




 Holy crap you're right.  All three were about the same age -- Gable was six years older.

 I'd go see it, too, if I was in the area one day.

I'd wear a Ford Pinto Owners' Association T-shirt though. 




 Still there?  I'm typing to you from a rainy Georgetown.  Do you ever miss DC? 




 Maybe they should've planted a callback?  I dunno.  It's still a pretty bad finale. 




 They could even take away his red stapler. 




 I gave up on the first season for that reason.  The red herring of the Muslim school teacher?  I was out. 




 Whoa.  Thank you for that!

 




 Ah he wasn't a draft dodger by any stretch.  He was 34 when Pearl Harbor was bombed.  That being said, he didn't exert himself to serve.  I have read that the WWII vets resented him for all of his war movies.

From wiki:

America's entry into World War II resulted in a deluge of support for the war effort from all sectors of society, and Hollywood was no exception. Wayne was exempted from service due to his age (34 at the time of Pearl Harbor) and family status, classified as 3-A (family deferment). He repeatedly wrote John Ford saying he wanted to enlist, on one occasion inquiring whether he could get into Ford's military unit, but consistently kept postponing it until after "he finished just one or two pictures".[4]:212 Wayne did not attempt to prevent his reclassification as 1-A (draft eligible), but Republic Studios was emphatically resistant to losing him; Herbert J. Yates, President of Republic, threatened Wayne with a lawsuit if he walked away from his contract,[4]:220 and Republic Pictures intervened in the Selective Service process, requesting Wayne's further deferment.[4]:213

Wayne toured U.S. bases and hospitals in the South Pacific for three months in 1943 and 1944.[4]:253 with the USO[27][28][29] By many accounts, Wayne's failure to serve in the military was the most painful experience of his life.[4]:212 His widow later suggested that his patriotism in later decades sprang from guilt, writing: "He would become a 'superpatriot' for the rest of his life trying to atone for staying home."[30]

U.S. National Archives records indicate that Wayne had, in fact, made an application [31] to serve in the OSS, today's equivalent of the CIA, and had been accepted within the U.S. Army's allotted billet to the OSS. William Donovan, OSS Commander, wrote Wayne a letter informing him of his acceptance in to the Field Photographic Unit, but the letter went to his estranged wife Josephine's home. She never told him about it.[32] Donovan also issued an OSS Certificate of Service to Wayne.[33] 




 Yeah I saw the one with 37 miles (kilometers?) on the odometer and thought the same thing.

It's a Toyota.  Of course it'll eventually start. 




 I lived in London in '89 and can't donate either.   




 Fun fact: in the movie Invictus, Mandela gives a copy of the poem Invictus to the rugby captain.

In real life, Mandela gave him this speech. 




 Erin Cummings -- Sparty's wife in Spartacus -- is in the mix, too.   




 Yeah I know.  Armed guards in a very tight space.  I'd had too much vodka the night before.  It would've been a real problem. 

































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































 *What's the problem?*   
I reformatted my computer three weeks ago.  Never ending RES used to get me to 1000 or more and is now conking out at 200. 

Just now I got "There doesn't seem to be anything here! (Why not?)" at 25.



*What other browser extensions are installed?*  
On Firefox: AdBlock, BetterPRivacy, FEBE, Ghostery, HTTPS-Everywhere, NoScript, NoSquint, RES, SecureSanitzer, TinEye, and the only new addition to my line-up YouTube High Definition 36.0.

Except for YouTube HD, this was my exact line-up pre-reformatting.  

Is there anything I can do to get back to seeing never ending reddit displaying deep into the 800's?

 Can anybody provide examples of such videos?  I'd like to see what the fuss is all about. 




 Good.  Good.  Let the purr flow through you.

All kidding aside, get thee to a shelter.  I was a rookie cat owner when I got adopted, but my gf at the time had cats and coached me.

PM me if you need advice/how-to's.

Also consider getting two.   




 I've got a 12-year old orange tabby who was a feral kitten that adopted me at the beach just like the little kitten in the vid.

He and I are besties.   




 You and I are of the same iTunes tinkering fellowship.

I don't understand why Steve of this story didn't do the same.  He had the song requests in advance.  It'd be maybe 10 minutes to set up a playlist. 




 IIRC, Probst had just announced that a guy allied with the two girls had been voted off, while Matty in the middle hated the guy. 




 That's correct.  It looked like a preppy college jacket   tie combo.

Dunno why I'm getting these downvotes. 




 Sorry -- what does this bot do?
 




 I bet legal fees ate up a huge chunk of the winnings. 




 You'll be fine around there.  I'd run southwest on NY Ave until you hit 15th and then across the pedestrian block of Penn to see the White House, take a left on 17th and down to the Mall.  Be careful crossing Constitution.  

Alternatively 10th St. takes you past the montrosity of the FBI building and Ford's Theater one block up. 




 I love this site:

http://800notes.com/Phone.aspx/1-202-559-6606/11

This number's got 11 pages of comments, so yes it's a national thing.   




 Oh wow talk about a cat who hit the lottery.  

My cat will eat almost anything but I guarantee you that if he lived in a sushi joint, he'd be just like this cat.   




 The number of details really helped sell it.  He was wearing a jacket and tie that is exactly what a white guy in college would wear.   




 I live in Washington DC.  Only recently -- maybe the past two years -- were the liquor stores allowed to be open on Sundays.  We could get wine and beer from the small grocery stores throughout the city.

 




 Oops I did.  Thanks. 














 Many thanks!

I was standing in the main viewing stand with the official countdown timer just in front of me.  I remember that just after they announced the abort, the heatwave from the main engines hit me and lifted the cuffs of my pants.  

I can only imagine what the full launch would've done. 

Earlier that year, maybe even late '84, I happened to be in a parking lot in Santa Barbara waiting for a bus shuttle to LA when two sonic booms startled me.  

Yup, a shuttle landing at Vandenburg.  I had no idea what the sound was until I got home.  It sounded like a pair of surround sound shotgun blasts, but catching you more in the chest. 




 What bugs me about the story is that the owner didn't trust your dad to camp there anymore.  Like he'd done something wrong.

The owner knew something that your dad didn't know. 




 Gotta love a cat that runs towards danger rather than away.

I have an 18 pound orange tabby tomcat.  Nothing happens in my neighborhood unless he wants it to happen. 




 I've read the letter where Franklin expressed this view -- it was in the context of a letter to his nephew.

I thought it was tongue in cheek.

He might've been somewhat serious, but the letter was definitely uncle-trolling. 




 I think ospreys are eagles, just more sea-going.   




 You and me, brother.  I don't think we're alone. 




 *insight

I didn't know it existed.  I grew up in the 70's so if there's any detail you need, I was there.  

Did they report on the Schwinn banana seat bicycle?  That was the defining thing to own for my generation as boys.

Typically though I find these retrospectives are done knowing now what happened and filtered accordingly.  

Jerry Ford's handling of the Pueblo Crisis is a footnote now, but I remember it got my attention.  We'd just gotten out of Vietnam and suddenly North Korea wanted to mess with us.  We really didn't need that. 




 I doubt the FBI got its panties twisted by somebody's bumper sticker, but I also wouldn't doubt that somebody somewhere asked for context and easily got it.

The hashtag if it actually got used on twitter would've been NSA/DHS territory.  Again, the context was I bet easily found. 




 That might -- MIGHT -- have been true for the 50's.  But don't forget about Sputnik demonstrating superior space technology and the leaks of the hydrogen bomb to the Soviets.

Then they put missiles in Cuba.  That to my mind is when the Cold War turbocharged itself.   




 It's true.  They support adoption for the cat or doggie and hope you'll come back to them for food   accessories if not grooming. 




 Sylar is the nutshell for everything wrong with Heroes.

I'm not impressed by this trailer.  Looks like the same old bait   switch of the original.

I actually got a little angry watching it. 




 I was high school class of '80.  Youngest bro did well for himself. 




 The Citizen Kane spoiler was also I think a Billy Crystal joke on SNL so it's forgivable.   




 The problem with international law is that it's an awfully amorphous field.

I know a lawyer who is always flying around the world doing negotiations and making deals, but not as an international lawyer but an expert in US medical devices.  

When I think of international lawyers, I think of State Department or USAID people.  Those are great jobs to have btw. 




 Get onto the running paths of the C O Canal and you look up at the streets crossing it.  Dunno if that's what you're looking for.   




 Tyrion Lannister: "One game at a time." 




 Duke fans individually are perfectly fine.

It's when they get together as a group that's the problem. 




 Dunno if there will be any Colombians or Argentinians there, but Lucky Bar should do nicely.  Call ahead to make sure they're showing it but they almost certainly will be. 




 Zookeepers around the world have been imitating Chris Pratt in Jurassic World:

http://www.dorkly.com/post/74902/zookeepers-around-the-world-are-chris-pratt-ing-with-their-animals

It's sort of like Tebowing except not annoying.

With actual dinosaurs, that Smithsonian curator just won the competition.   




 I remember at just about this point last season thinking "OK the Nats are good but can they solve the Braves problem?"

They did and I've moved on to worrying about other franchises. 




 Wow.  Giving away a broken-in glove? 




 Doesn't look too bad.  That stuff a few nights ago was apocalyptic in comparison. 




 It has to be something regional.  I'd get a referral to somebody who specializes in food allergies or reactions.  This is the kind of problem they love to solve. 




 I now agree with you all -- FP at very least had too much coffee this morning. 




 That's annoying.   




 FP still appears to be traumatized by Yoga in the Park. 




 AZ can just ask for your papers on demand?  If that's part of a traffic stop, I don't see a problem -- license and registration are required everywhere -- but papers on demand?

Yeah that's not going to last long. 




 That was some terrific situational hitting.  Escobar's hit in particular. 




 Here in DC the police cannot ask jaywalkers for ID.  They're affirmatively prohibited from it.  I guess they'd had problems with pretext arrests back in the day.   




 Here's the Post with detail:

 Is that house a carbon copy of the Amityville Horror house? 




 This is true:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Monroe#Military_service_in_the_Revolutionary_War_and_serious_wounding 




 I saw Challenger abort in '85.  So disappointing.  They'd lit the main engines, something went wrong, and they pulled the plug before lighting the SRB's.   




 At first I thought who would rob a movie set and why is a costumer so brave?

Then... typo. 




 I jog past the Watergate and sometimes ponder all the other gates it has spawned.   




 If you like gin, that Green Hat Gin named in honor of him is really good.  It's actually distilled in DC, too.   




 I'd add womens tennis to that list.  I love watching the Williams sisters.  Olympic swimming doesn't suck, either. 

Regarding softball, I once batted against a female colleague who had pitched for I think Stanford.  I like to think of myself as a decent batter but I have never felt that kind of frustration and humiliation.  I didn't know a softball could physically travel that fast. 




 Verifying it is one thing; establishing its provenance is quite a different matter.  

I'm smelling war loot.  They're going to need to establish that it wasn't stolen.   









 USA 0-1 China or maybe a PK situation but I have a feeling the USA is done

Germany 3-1 France

Australia 1-2 Japan

Canada 0-1 England which I know is a huge upset but I've got another feeling
 




 Dunno about that hygiene grade... 









 Wow.  Virginia won something.  What is this feeling I'm experiencing? 




 At least in Virginia, not so much.  It's not the economic powerhouse of northern Virginia, but the true poverty line doesn't start until you get closer to the West Virginia line.   




 Niners and Nationals fan + Wahoos.  

Gin is the only thing that eases the pain. 




 Didn't it fall through though?

What's going on with that parcel now?  Is it the big Trump development? 




 The line running from northern Virginia into Georgia roughly tracks the Appalachian mountains.  Lots of Scots-Irish settled those highlands.  Lucky people, too -- it's gorgeous.   




 Special hell for this bastard. 




 Ah Desi you wonderful wonderful man. 




 BFA! 




 Same thing going on here in DC.  The whole city feels like a construction site. 




 I think that it's also that many of us (I'm from SW Virginia) have families that have been here so long that it's impossible to pin down which European country is our origin.

Taking the four names of my grandparents, I've got French, German, English, and Welsh.  It gets exponentially muddled going back through generations, with one line going back to Pocahontas.  

So for me it's impossible to say.   




 It's something in your diet.  Start switching things around.  A food allergy is most likely. 




 I grew up in the 70's and burned my tongue so many damn times on their coffee before I just started going elsewhere.

It was really crappy watery coffee, too.   




 Call the admissions director and voice your concerns.  Maybe they'd give you a fresh start.  And how come this suspension is so long -- I thought the typical suspension for a flunk-out was a semester or two.   




 Of course.  I bet that if you wrote the prestigious university and explained that you're better now, they'd let you back in, too.  Nobody's going to be around anymore from your original class.   




 Did they every ID the body they found that had the connection to the shoeshine guy in I think Crystal City?

I bet this poor guy's death is somehow related to the storms. 




 And from the country that produced Kafka. 




 One of my friends had a pair -- his wife was allergic.  They were kind of cute once you got used to them having no hair.

They always cuddled with a human for warmth.  Adorable. 




 I think people congregate on the Lincoln end of the Mall.  But the Capitol end is where they have the concert, so that's going to be affected. 




 I gasped out loud.  It's rare for something on the internet to make me do that. 




 I live in DC.  Woe unto those on the Red Line. 




 There's a mistake in this -- the Chicago bid was for 2016, which Rio won.

The US 2012 bid was NYC, which was dead on arrival.  No place to put the Olympic stadium.   




 We're in agreement then.  

ESPN needs to learn that nobody outside on NY and New England cares. 




 That rivalry annoys the bejesus out of me for all the press it gets, but I think it's the very model of a rivalry that is NOT forced.   




 I live in DC and it's a real beating to get to FedEx.  Once there, it's a joyless experience.   




 This is misleading.  There are plenty of coaches who are in fantastic shape (Pete Carroll, the Harbaughs). 




 I hope but I think the ship has sailed again.  Who knows -- maybe the USOC has some DC partisans in it.  I think we sadly have to assume that if if yanks Boston, the bid goes to LA. 




 I really wanted to transcribe his rant on Hall of Fame voters living in their basements with their moms and voting all day.  "Not that there's anything wrong with it." 









 Here's a great article about what it would have looked like:

http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/digger/wp/2015/06/12/why-the-olympics-washington-didnt-win-could-still-transform-the-city/

I saw the 2012 bid plans which DC lost to NYC and this is MUCH better.  It's a damn shame it lost. 




 I went for the second week as an adult.  It was great.  I saw Michael Johnson run both the 200m and the 400m.  

Exhausting, but what a great week.   




 Yeah I'm seeing lots of red links today.  Anybody know what's going on? 




 FWIW anytime I hear of somebody named Gay, I think of the sole survivor of VT-8 at Midway:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._Gay,_Jr. 




 Great news.  Boston's bid is effectively a replay of the disastrous NYC bid for 2012.

I wish DC had gotten the bid, but if the USOC goes with LA, the Olympics are almost certain to be there.   




 SPANNING! 




 That's from Chelsea James.  She's one of the Post's baseball writers. 




 Alright.  I'll go on a beer run.   




 Great.  My satellite just came back on only to hear Dave toss the broadcast to EPSN until 8:30.  

Too bad this isn't a Friday.  We could have another Padres drinkfest.
 




 Oh.  Well I'll have a G T anyway.  The tink is the ice going into the glass. 




 The winter games are an entirely different beast from the summer games though.   




 If you look at the Post's radar loop, it looks like it's just a glancing blow.

http://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/

Still I looked out my back window a few minutes ago and it looked as dark as it get closer to 8pm. 




 Wahoowa!  Is that tink for a gin   tonic? 




 I liked Bryce winning the walkoff.  The guy's seen Zoolander; she hasn't. 









 "Everyone's a critic."

POW! 














 I just became a commie about downvoting to 1783.

 September 3, 1783
 The United States and Great Britain sign the Treaty of Paris and Great Britain signs a separate treaty with France and Spain.

I am no damn commie! 




 That's always bothered me too.

It's kind of like when the NFL Cardinals went to Arizona, suddenly Phoenix didn't want to acknowledge the St. Louis years.  

Mind you, they had good reason, and so does Minnesota for the Senators, but the '24 era players ought to be commemorated somehow. 




 Trust me: the TV show was better than the movie!

I think it set the stage for Buffy.

You're dealing with Duncan MacLeod of the clan MacLeod though -- a different character than Christopher Lambert's.

Here's a highlight reel with Queen:

 First the [flying cat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_8mdH20qTQ) and now this.

 I don't think it was a cartoon by any stretch.  

It was more lyrical, rather than a show of force.

There's no way to beat thousands of communists oops FoxCon employees drumming away.

Anyhow.  London's closing ceremony was where the English put their true genius.  Does anybody remember Beijing's closing? 




 Yeah maybe but the timing of her visit to England and her death I think means a certain connection to a typical London disease -- she died on the voyage back home without clearing the Channel.  

Here's wiki on it:

https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Pocahontas#Death

They cite smallpox, pneumonia or TB.  The timing adds up for those to my mind. 




 You found Trevor Hudson! 




 I've pretty much given up on reading Joel Stein's columns in Time for the same reason.  

That being said, it is fun to remember that those guys plotting the Thatcherite rebellion thought so highly of themselves.   




 You da real MVP 




 Why is nobody considering that he simply had a heart attack? 




 I live in DC and when I saw the headline in the Washington Post maybe two days saying that he was missing there, I read it as White House Chief Missing as in Chief of Staff. 




 Well the Vince Foster thing really was odd. 




 Better this than a ringbear(er). 




 I saw Les Miserables in London.  The actress singing Eponine absolutely wrecked me with On My Own.

I think she noticed and kinda gave me a half smile/wink as she exited.

I've always wondered who she was. 




 Without clicking on it, I knew it'd be True Romance.

What a great film.

Excellent choice. 




 Heh.  There's something to this.  I worked on Connecticut and L in the early 90's and as I was walking home around 6pm, the strippers for those clubs near Sign of the Whale were just coming in.  Lots of interesting early 90's fashion choices...

No clue what's going on at 6am there though. 




 What on earth makes you think /r/law gives a rat's ass about anything in Bergen County?  What state is it in, for starters.   




 I always heard typhoid, smallpox, or some other disease common to Londoners who had built up resistance, but she from the New World had not.  She died shortly after visiting London and being received by Queen Elizabeth and treated with diplomatic respect.  

Plus she and Rolfe had already had a child.  Syphilis would've prevented that, I think. 




 Cool enough.  Agreement: nbd. 




 Me, too.  My google-fu is weak, but I found this:

 I bet she knew this.

You'd think she'd wear flats to meet the president.   




 Five months ago on pics, but the rest are cross-posts.

My panties are not twisted. 




 I wonder why they arrested him in the first place?   




 The TV show was awesome from start to finish, though. 




 I agree.  I don't think BN ever fell off a cliff like the others.

There were too many iterations of evil secret organizations responsible for burning Michael, but that's forgivable for what the show was. 




 I've never seen it.  I've seen a telephone/internets cable, but not this one. 




 Shouldn't this car get ticketed on sight?

That poster's obscuring the rear view mirror's view. 




 What is the gun safety one like?  For $2 I'd buy it to mess with visitors to the house. 




 And now we know that Mrs. A. O. Teller of Honolulu came up with one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. 




 I regard the distinction as being the same as watching womens tennis.  The Williams sisters would get crushed by a male ranked in the top 200 (and did once -- he was slightly drunk, too) but they're still a lot of fun to watch.  

I saw womens Olympic matches in '96 at RFK, and this after also having seen mens WC matches there two years earlier in '94.  What struck me was that the goalie couldn't kick the ball for a clear nearly as far as a mens goalie, but I was really impressed by their athleticism.   




 Way too many spoilers in this for those of us that haven't seen it yet. 




 The woman in front has full Theda Bara make-up on.  Even back then, I can't imagine somebody would wear that to the beach. 




 I wonder about that, too.  A cat who didn't like it would run away or decapitate him.

I dunno.  Maybe this guy secretly wants to get decapitated. 




 I live in DC and listen to WTOP all the time.  In his defense, he's a radio reporter -- and a very good one at that.

My bet is what you are reading is a transcription of an item he read on air.  

Writing radio reports means brevity above all else. 




 Here's another article from the Washington Post.

http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/06/22/supreme-court-lets-its-nerd-flag-fly-with-comic-book-references-in-spider-man-toy-decision/

I loved the final paragraph.  She wasn't just geeking out for the sake of geeking out. 




 Please tell me this girl is now in a K-pop band. 




  kappa

What's this kappa stuff?

 




 I've never thought of the USWNT as being particularly chirpy unless somebody lets Hope Solo get near a microphone without adult supervision.

Anyhow, I have a bad feeling about this match.   




 I didn't know the Brits relegated the games to third-tier broadcasters.  Promote the matches, get them on the air where everybody can see them, and I bet the audience would grow.  I'd imagine little English girls would be just as interested as little American girls, which is the core audience that seeded interest in the '99 WC.

It seems like this is just benighted broadcasters not realizing what they have on their hands.

Speaking of which:
 in a pre-cable age the 1999 Womens World Cup

What?!  Cable was in most households by the early 80's.   




 Yeah this article is wikihole trap.  

You could read about the entire Battle of the North Atlantic given enough time.  




 The ep where the woman who'd lost her family went to NYC was one of the single best eps of anything ever filmed. 




 That was nothing compared to Toy Story 2 when Jessie gets left behind in the box at the recycling kiosk and peeks out to see her grown-up little girl driving away.

They had Sarah McLachlan singing "When She Loved Me."

Again: **Sarah McLachlan singing "When She Loved Me."** 




 Whoa!  It's Swiss?

I would've thought it was an indigenous drum from say Indonesia that I'd never heard about.

While listening to it, I did think she was using Western musical patterns though.  So at least I had that going for me. 




 Ed Grimley might be able to offer something:

 Whoa.  I always thought Kansas was almost dry and Missouri gloriously wet.  

Funny that the former dry holdout approves things faster. 




 For all the Anglo-hatred Joe Kennedy had, he sure seemed to like having the women in his family be Anglophiles. 




 "That's not how this works.  That's not how any of this works!" 




 Many thanks!

So you find yourself being able to ship to only certain states?  

Did you ever meet Battle?   




 Did you do this before the Matildas won?  If not, get thee to Vegas. 




 There's a Joe Jackson (who is English) song from I think the Mad World album, released in the late 80's where here's talking about a WWII vet who lost his leg and says "no more soccer for you!"

Whether he changed the line for the US market, I don't know.   




 States can operate in parallel to the federal government.

I read that a state contested Flying Dog's Raging Bitch.  

It's ultimately apparent that they're talking about canines so the word bitch in the context isn't pejorative.  Whatever state it was withdrew the challenge, but the feds had already let it go through.

My bet is that you need to get pre-approved for federal purposes but the states can challenge it as they see fit. 




 I love the kitten at the bottom keeping time. 




 Driving might -- might -- make sense if you drive around the Beltway and come into town from the east, but the I-66 direct route will be miserable and you might miss the show.  

Metro will be crowded but at least you'd be likely to get a seat on the way in.   




 A similar thing happened to my hometown paper during the Virginia Tech shootings -- The Roanoke Times.  None of the cable outfits could get into Blacksburg due to high winds keeping them from landing and the Times did an outstanding job breaking the story and the aftermath.   




 We got hail in Georgetown.  I picked a couple up and they're in my freezer.  One's quarter sized the other nickel

My cat was traumatized. 




 BFA! 




 Adorable little kid with the snow cone. 




 WIPE THAT SMUG SMILE OFF YOUR FACE HITLER.

 I just tuned in, looked at the score, and was all "what, did the game start at 11am?!" 




 That was terrific!  The Anderson Sisters harmony, blue T-shirt girl knowing how to dance that way... WHAT FUN! 




 Oh they do but I don't think they've ever heard of "leg day." 




 Compare and contrast to Nathan Fillion:

 Four stomachs?  I always wondered why their chests are so massive. 




 As soon as I see somebody wearing a V for Vendetta mask, I disregard them.   




 I have never understood how the Larry Niven Ringworld series hasn't been filmed. 




 You are completely mis-remembering it.

Spiro Agnew resigned as VP long before Watergate broke.

Nixon's choice to replace him was Gerald Ford, who became president upon his resignation. 




 That's not true -- Deep Throat was Woodward's source and his alone. I don't think Bernstein knew his identity until Felt announced himself.

Plus, Vanity Fair got the scoop because a Felt family lawyer handled the announcement, which resulted in the Post being scooped by someone else because Woodward and Bradlee couldn't comment until they had confirmed that Felt had come forth.  Very odd situation.   




 If you are referencing Silver Streak, I might have to say mean things on the internet.

 Whoa that's a great idea.  I wish were like the Duke basketball fans and could get everybody on the same page pre-game. 




 It was Michelle Pfeiffer's first big role, though.  I'll always thank Hollywood for that.

Never seen the movie though. 














 I didn't want to karma whore, but go the Post.  The line on top of us right now is nothing compared to the next one, which ought to be here in maybe a half hour.  It's not a derecho but it could get bumpy.

 Stachowski's occasionally has a turkey mac   cheese as a dinner special.  It's delicious.   




 He changed his jersey every inning?  How many do they have? 




 I know!  It was great to see him. 




 The next time I see Tabata coming my way, I will cross the street.  That is how angry I am. 




 I gotta say: way to go MASN for not going to commercials!

 OH NO! 




 Aspirin asperin dammit where is the aspirin?! 




 I actually got chills go down my spine  when Max took the field.  This is really something.

RENDON!!! 




 Thank you!  I saw this on /r/dc and thought "hmm, I wonder where else people might like to see this..."

Anyhow, adding some context to the story, this is in Adams-Morgan (thus the play on the bar's name), which at the time had been having a spree of pop-up electronic music dance parties occurring in unlicensed venues.   

This is what chimed in /r/dc :

 I think ABRA was concerned about the onslaught of those dance clubs that would pop up in unlicensed venues. So in order to stomp them out, they had to ding up Madam's Organ to show that they were enforcing noise violations across the board.


 









 Maybe.  I think ABRA was concerned about the onslaught of those dance clubs that would pop up in unlicensed venues.  So in order to stomp them out, they had to ding up Madam's Organ to show that they were enforcing noise violations across the board.  

Those pop up dance clubs were apparently really annoying.  

 




 I hope you've been catching him on Halt and Catch Fire.  It's a completely different vibe from Pushing Daisies -- more menacing. 









 Go down to Half Street and get your car inspected.  It's a much easier process than it used to be -- I've sailed through the past couple of years. 

Contest the ticket online.  I'd say you have a 90% chance of them waiving the ticket.   




  in the 80s

Oddly enough, 1985.  Aspen.  New Year's Eve.  My girlfriend at the time was a ski instructor.

I also met Barbara Eden on the same trip.   




 OH WOW!

Could you post the Bridges complaint?

Force gets all the press. 




 What can you possibly do when you have "DEA Agent Mark Force IV (best name ever)" in the mix. 

Poor guy.  He ran hard at these guys, then got too close to the flames. 




 Da! 
























 Yup.  I first saw her on Supernatural, where she was a demon master thief.

She rocked a posh English accent.

She looked great all washed up, too.

Her Georgian accent is OK but wanting.

 




 It's an Italian thing done to make themselves sound like singing in an American production with nobody speaking any English.

I love.  My brain keeps searching for something but can't find a phrase.

The cheat is that they use "ooh-rah" exactly where "alright" would appear.

It's a catchy tune.  Very well done.

Anyhow.  I'm still scouring this thread for non-English speakers weighing in on American accents.  Few and far between.

 I lived in London briefly and with a natural SW Virginia accent -- I had a girlfriend at the time, but oh I could sense pheremones in the air. 




 "Ma!  Where's my Red Sox hat at" was actually pretty good. 




 SW Virginia checking in.  I always associated him with Alabama, but say a public official who is over the top officious. 




 Seriously -- they're obsessive about it. 

Australia's the same way too.

The UK used to make any animal imported go into quarantine.  Fluffy the cat from NYC who'd never been outside in her life?  3 month quarantine or she's not coming in.

This is why Jonny Depp got into trouble with the Aussie with his lap dogs. 




 Family law.  Divorce gone seriously bad, I'd bet.  

What a nightmare.

The good news is that whoever did it will likely be found very very quickly.

 I'm in zone 2 and regularly leave my car in one spot for mulitiple weeks.  I don't drive very often.

OP it depends on your immediate neighborhood.

Street cleaning rarely happens unlike say NYC.  I don't think I've ever been affected by it.  DC lets Mother Nature clean the streets.  

How long it takes to find a spot is up to your immediate traffic patterns.  For me, Friday nights is the worst, but I know not to drive on Sunday mornings due to all of the churches in the vicinity.

The absolute worst is when a neighbor throws a party and hires parking attendants to valet park their guests' cars.  Every block within reasonable walking distance gets shut down.

I like having my own car.  You can easily live without one if need be though -- zipcar is quite the rage these days.  Do a cost/benefit calculation. 




 I... I... 

I don't know what to say.

Somehow I think the 420 break is on the other side of the communication. 




 I heard it was closed to tours, but could be wrong.  

There's a US Navy museum nearby that apparently is awesome.

This new bridge annoys me.  But London long ago closed off the Thames to large ships. 




 I just went digging for it and couldn't find it on WaPo -- share?

This btw sounds like something I would do.  That race was fixed. 




 There's a sad end to this story though.

Remember [Aldrich Ames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldrich_Ames#Some_CIA_sources_betrayed)?

The S.O.B. gave him up to the Soviets and he was executed. 




 England's rabies-free.  But I don't doubt they wanted to double check. 




 I get it that a debit card would get declined, but not a credit card.  Visa gives you a pre-set spending limit and you can charge up to that no matter what.

Do credit cards work differently in the EU? 




 I've always regarded Patton as being the finest biographical movie ever made.  

Ken Burns' Civil War would be the first documentary that I'd recommend. 




 I live in DC.  These polls are always crap -- we're a city of 600K crammed into a teensy space.  

It'd be like comparing Manhattan or maybe even just the Upper East Side to a state.  

Still, the city definitely runs on booze.  But also, I'd say only a third of the people in the federal government live here as opposed to the burbs of Northern Virginia and Maryland.   




 It's in the game thread under "Umpires confirm foul-ball call" -- that's exactly what I saw.   




 I didn't see it.  Perhaps an x-post? 




 There is nothing like a Harper at bat this deep in the game. 




 I'm so glad he got a curtain call.

He must be thrilled! 




 Yeah he needs to knock off the interpretive swan dance.   




 Fun fact on the thumbnail pic: a few hours later, DC got smacked by a rogue midnight T-storm, the worst since 2012, and the scouts had to flee for cover.

 What is that animal running around the car?  His doggie?  Wildlife? 




 That was some Harding administration level fixing. 




 I think they did it voluntarily. 




 I went to a wedding near Morristown in the Fall once.

I was staggered by how pretty it is.  And I grew up in the Blue Ridge -- I know something about pretty. 




 Oh is it chrome?  It looked iPod white to me on first glance.   




 Good looking torch.  It looks like they might've been influenced by Apple stylings.   




 I dunno about that.

I remember during the Vancouver Winter Olympics, Digg sent a reporter to interview alpine skier Julie Mancuso.  The format was no holds barred as there was no FCC involved, but the interview was announced 48 hours before it began so diggers could submit questions and she had to answer the top ten "digg'd" questions.  It was a wonderful interview -- she had dug in in a chalet, was wearing a cuter Russian fur hat for fun, and happily bit on the more salacious digg'd questions.  She was in her element.

I thought it was one of the single best athlete interviews I've ever seen.  

At the time, I thought that I was seeing for the first time what new media was truly capable of.  

Then Digg imploded.  

No NBC, no BBC, no whatever press operations wanting to get to her, and all they had to do was listen in for content.

IT WAS GREAT.  The single best Mancuso interview I've ever seen.

It wouldn't have been not that hard for reddit to adapt that format to LIVE AMA

Digg was ahead of its times.

Here's pic of Julie in that era:

 I never knew dogs could raise their eyebrows in all "what is this fresh hell?" 




 I ruthlessly cleared out my DVR last night.  The Buffy marathon is looking tempting. 









 I think they had a far worse fate planned than an ordinary redrum. 




 I love this skit!

The body of Pontiac with a door from an Olds 88.  

What great attention to detail! 




 I've got them on my DVR but not watched yet.  Glad to hear you like -- I've heard iffy things and frankly I thought season 1 was over-praised, Harrelson and McConnaughey's performances excepted.

I'm going to watch them and then make the decision.   




 That's the reference.

Except these cats look like they don't want to play so much a cut somebody. 




 I've seen the first two eps and while not sold on it, it's OK.

I'm toying with turning off HBO until Game of Thrones comes back though.  I wouldn't miss it.   




 Is it just me or do they look woefully underdressed for that kind of cold?  This winter was apparently one of the most brutal Europe had ever seen. 




 You can tell who's more adventurous (girl on the balcony) and who's the attention whore (girl out of pose with her knee over the windowsill), etc. 




 I think only if the /r/sports mods have had trouble with the reddit front office.  If so, absolutely.  




 Do you want to get shot by Florida Man?  This is how you get shot by Florida Man. 




 ELI5 decided not to join the protest in I think a very well-reasoned post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3by1v9/why_isnt_eli5_participating_in_the_default/

I'd think /r/dc would be wise to follow this line of thinking.

Unless of course there have been problems with the admins, but I can't see how they'd want to mess with a city subreddit.   




 It's metastasizing too -- /r/facepalm is about to go private, too.  

I hope /r/nationals doesn't.   




 I read an article about it -- nope, but they were able to splice and dice enough footage to make a usuable ad.

I always felt bad for the "sophisticated couple" extras across from him.  They had to be thrilled to be acting opposite Orson Welles... and this happens. 




 I don't know.  I bet they will.  I had a pair of 1K+ link karma links that are now in private r/'s and my total karma didn't take a hit.  This leads me to believe that they're still there, just hidden.   




 Yes.  I think once a sub goes private, comments disappear.  I'd been talking about the protest on r/videos, it went private while I was out, and they're gone now.   




 I had no idea the big /r/ mods were this alienated from the admins.  I hope this isn't our Digg 4.0 moment.  

Ohanion's not helping things, which makes me really nervous. 




 chooter got fired today and the mods of many of the default r/'s have set themselves to private in protest.  Lots of bad juju floating around right now.

Here's a pretty good summary:

 Great.  Reddit's imploding and now this.   




 I dunno.  He got the double and later scored.  That doens't totally suck. 




 I just took a 50 question test and missed only this:

3) Name one American Indian tribe in the United States.
A. Metis
B. Macedonian
C. Arawak
D. Maya

Metis never heard of, Macedonian obviously wrong, Arawak are Caribbean, so it must be Maya.

Wrong.  Arawak.  

That's not right.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arawak 




 Either that or this is the end of the road for Ellen Pao.  I hope Alex Ohanian awakes from his slumber.  

Until we know more, this could turn out to be a good thing. 




 Holy crap, this is the first I've heard of this.  What a mess:

 My thoughts exactly on the details.  I grew up in Roanoke and OP included the Star -- the huge neon Mill Mountain Star that overlooks the valley.  

http://cdn.meme.am/instances/48505750.jpg 




 This link was embedded in the description:

http://www.palestineherald.com/news/bushey-shooting-videos-released/article_34b8e3ec-1f82-11e5-9e3c-0bcf0658377a.html

The guy was an alcoholic and presumably drunk.   




 Whoa, my hometown of Roanoke in the news!  The man with a camper, wife and three teenage girls has courage.   




 That looks very Georgetown.  I feel like I've walked past it -- very familiar.  Dumbarton Street maybe?

Google dent place washington dc for Dent Place.  It's only two blocks.  I just streetviewed it but whiffed; you may have a better eye.

I'm surprised this address isn't on the web.  I hit IMDb and it turns out this building was also Diana Prince's house in Wonder Woman.   




 I swear to God that Chris Pratt is the most charming man on the planet right now. 




 They're re-doing Scream apparently.  

I don' want to watch because I know they'll never come close at all to Drew Barrymore's death sequence.

What a forgettable network.

In the 80's and 90's they were all that mattered on cable. 




 Here is the N W 611 upon being restored recently -- not too far off from this concept.

 I live in Georgetown.  This sounds right.  Google streetview Wisconsin and Dent Place and walk yourself west.

I remember they had an ep about forming up a neighborhood watch just about the same time my neighborhood was thinking about setting up a watch.  I was annoyed.  

I remember the setting was in the West Village somehow.  The West Village is different from me.  Dent Place is way up there, too.  

Anyhow OP post a screenshot and I might recognize it.
 




 DC's a tough nut to crack.  Once it does, it's wonderful.  

The single thing worst thing you can do is hole up.  

I first moved here in '85 and apparently it's still the same.  I watched a lot of TV in my first few months, then things blossomed.   




 Blech.  Rain delays + Nationals = nothing good. 




 That is the scariest fucking thing I have ever seen in my life.

Who on earth would even take possession of such a thing?!

I truly hope I'm being trolled. 




 Buffarene giveaway?  What's that? 




 I know.  Giancarlo's injury perhaps giving him pause?

 I would've been torn myself.  Wahoo by birth and degree but I really like Tech.  I would've worn Nats red instead of U.Va. orange.

 Actually, I'm American but a total Olympics geek.

I'm always mystified as to how the four sub-nations comprising the UK can't get its act together for the Olympics.  They have no problem with Scotsman Andy Murray winning the tennis gold for the UK. 




 Ooh.  You might be right.  I forgot that it's not England in the Olympics but the full United Kingdom.  

Wiki's unclear:

Edited to add:

Nope the four home associations couldn't agree.  No U.K. in the Olympics

 That was my thinking too.  It would've been nice to see say Kawasumi interviewed via translator. 




 She's got Rio to look forward to next summer, too. 




 Yeah that's the problem with getting down there for me.  Too close to fly, too far to drive. 




 My family's got a place in Litchfield.  I love it down there.  Myrtle not so much though.  

How's the weather?  Did you all get clobbered by that storm system last night? 




 I see what you did there.

 




 England just Mets out of the tourney. 




 Jesus -- 120F on the field?!  That's life threatening. 




 Quick question: in the mens WC the trainers had that magic spray can that somehow helped the players when they went down.  

How come the women don't get it and WTF is it? 




 I'm sorry I can't hear you over the sound of my air-conditioners.

 Or that freaky bald Emperor Palpatine lookalike.  That guy was great.  The Ed Hochuli of soccer. 




 I get the distinct impression FIFA's having problems finding WC-class refs who aren't American.   




 Crap call for Japan, then a make-up for England.

I have no problem with this. 




 I've both Metro'd and driven out of crowded Nats games.  Via car, once you're out of the vicinity of the stadium, it's fine.  

I'd imagine getting across the South Capitol Street bridge would be a snap.   




 Whoa.  Italy without pasta and tomato sauce.  Must've been a bummer to live there back then.

I wonder why the Italian cuisine went in that direction and the rest of Europe didn't.  Maybe it's easier to grow tomatoes in Italy? 




 Consider that the tomato is indigenous to South America.  

The great Italian recipes with tomato sauce?  They didn't exist until well after Columbus.   




 Excellent!  The airlines with all their consolidation over the past decade have become an old boys club.  I bet this is just the beginning of something bigger. 




 They replaced the entire grid in Georgetown in 2001-2002.  It was a massive pain -- the power was intentionally shut off for a night every month or so.

But, the power hasn't gone off since.  Derecho, hurricanes, snowpocalypse -- nothing.   









 It is SO cool seeing those highlights without the announcers play by play. 




 Junior High School, perhaps '74.  There was something amajigger that could compute.  It mystified me but I could see was cool.

I didn't have access to a mainframe until college, perhaps '81.

I thought they were cute diversions until I saw a spell check program work on a laptop in '85.  That's when I knew the world had changed. 




 Relax.  The same thing's been going on since the founding of the Republic.

The news cycle makes it worse and more pronounced, but don't forget that people can only vote every 2 years.  

Sometimes, the country gets together but that's not normal. 




 I was hoping to annoy inter-disciplinary redditors, but

 Holy crap, is that really happening?!

They're in the East Room for the night, I'd bet. 




 Ah, then I might've slept through the 2012 midnight T-storm.  I just don't remember thunder   lightning like this post-midnight.

No question that this was nowhere close to the dercho.   




 Whoa.  autowkibot patrols /r/Nationals?  

This is something.  What this something is, I dunno. 




 I was.  Are you referring to the derecho?  That happened much earlier in the night.   




 Holy crap.  She was at 21 the youngest FLOTUS.

Somehow, I don't think we'll ever see that record beaten. 




 I've got an 18 pound short-haired orange tabby who is the largest cat I've ever encountered. 

Is this a domestic cat or a lynx or something?  Perhaps you are petite? 




 Well, in the Coolidge administration, yes.

Very odd choices by the Nats with their POTUS's.  

They seem to be stocking up on post-Teddy pre-FDR characters, and now we get the great Prohibitionist? Not good for beer sales on South Capitol. 




 Where the heck did this storm come from?  Normally we get clobbered like this in the hours immediately following sunset.

I don't remember a non-hurricane storm in the middle of the night like this. 









  thanks to Title IX 

That's all anybody needed to read. 




 A Brit nailing Valley Girl vocal fry?!  

Like, very impressive. 




 I don't think it's fair to tie the Packers to this guy.  It doesn't look like they had any warnings of his behavior.

 




 John Locke is overrated. 




 Oddly enough, just last week I saw the first sensible defense of that ending.

The reason he became a lumberjack was because as a child in that container, he saw his mother murdered via chainsaw.

So he picked up up a vocation that uses chainsaws to expunge the horror.

It still sucked, but maybe less so now. 




 Oh yeah, of course the tree canopy changes every decade or so.  But I know there are still trees in that spot on the Capitol grounds -- you'll notice they're slightly north of the Senate wing.  It's pretty green along the sides of the Mall.  


Dunno how well this link will work, but it appears the construction site is probably where that pic was taken from, but you'll notice trees just west of it:

https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=zl1XyXXdJ-Yw.kvVMosuox5jw hl=en_US
 




 Not a definitive answer, but I remember reading something maybe two years ago that kale supposedly has more nutrients than other leafy greens such as spinach.

I have hated kale since boyhood and still do.  I can't wait for this fad to die. 




 Hodor! 




 I might accept that challenge.  But it'd be a little underwhelming -- I too live in DC and all of the ones I recognized are the same.

That pic of the White House threw me a little bit though.  I think the portion that's got the trees on the roof is actually the East Wing, which is now the First Lady's base of operations and the main actual entrance to get into the White House.  They must've have a promenade on the roof back then.

The West Wing wasn't built until the 30's or so.

The Castle, the Capitol, Treasury, what was then the State   War Department and is now the Eisenhower Building -- they all look exactly the same.

I don't recognize the Printing   Engraving Building or the Pension Office.  They may have been razed since these were taken.   




 Before tuning out -- OP that was a TERRIFIC play by play up there! 




 Here is NBC's Leigh Diffey broadcasting F1 from Monaco:

https://i.imgur.com/o1gEC62.jpg 




 What is that buzzing noise that sounds like an aircraft engine? 




 That's been in the back of my mind since the soccer halftime. 




 Dagger for the USA!!! 




 I am.  This is almost certainly going to decide the championship -- Germany/USA are both considered stronger than England or Japan.  

It's not a bad game so far.  They're duelling each other.   




 Not entirely true.  Royal Navy operations had to be suspended in the North Atlantic, which is what the US was mostly angry about.

Yes the White House got burned, but that was it.  The Brits had to pull out of DC a day later.  Hardly the capital being razed.  

It was an unpopular war that resulted in a stalemate.  I've always viewed it as settling remaining contentions from the Revolution. 




 Give it a better wingspan and it looks very much like Lilienthaler's pioneering gliders.

 John C. Flood got me out of a serious heating problem a few years ago.  I really like that company.

This is the OP here, folks.

I saw it a few nights ago in r/pics

https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/3beutv/this_is_what_a_320_bacon_and_egg_roll_from/ 




 Me too.  Nats fan here who has the game on in the kitchen whenever I'm home, half-paying attention to it.   




 I saw this photo pop up elsewhere.  Is this confirmed to be Gates?

He was born in '55, appears to be ten or so here, which makes this photo in '65.  This photo looks like it's from the 70's -- color, that style of bike, the way he's dressed.   




 Bingo.  As soon as I saw a trailer for The King's Speech, I thought blatant Oscar bait.

It was a perfectly charming movie though. 




 How could they possibly be smiling after a day like they'd had? 




 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyssa_sylvatica 




 DAE think this is kind of douchey? 




 I grew up in the 70's and those Schwinn banana seat bikes were a must for any boy of the era.  I get incredibly nostalgic anytime I see one.   




 You're the redditor running it?  It looks promising.  

I love tracking the bids. 




 I didn't know https://www.reddit.com/r/olympicgamesbids existed.  

Subscribed!

Interesting to see Switzerland interested in hosting even a youth games.  

 




 Here it is over Washington, DC:

 Lucky Bar.  It's the go-to soccer bar. 




 Love it! 




 I was in my garden and watching the radar loops on the Post so I knew full well it was coming.

When it hit, I dived back into the kitchen and kind of had caveman-level terror.  I have never heard the tree canopy make that kind of sound, not even in a hurricane.  

Anyhow, I never get tired of that Jefferson Memorial video linked in the article.   




 I dunno about that.  I walk past that house once or twice a month and only now noticed that it has a basement level.  Three story house on Olive Street and abutting Rose Park?  $1.1M actually sounds like a steal.

Good luck finding a parking spot nearby though. 




 50% idiot + 50% too much gin last night. 









 I've lived in Georgetown for 25 years and don't recognize them.  My bet is that it -- not surprisingly -- came from upstream on the Potomac. 














 It's more that that issue just now popped up as a leading article on washingtonpost.com.  

I wonder if somebody's trying to send a signal or just foster chaos.

It's weird.  I knew PR was having financial difficulties but they have been for years.

*edit: OK now I see that their bonds mature on July 1st every year.  My panties are no longer twisted.* 




 To my mind, the leading clubs are the Metropolitan and the University clubs.  Cosmos Club is more merit-based.  

I've never been attracted to the club culture though.  

The City Tavern Club is the only one I truly considered joining.

Don't join National Press unless you're a journalist.  I love that space though.  Many happy evenings spent there.  If you are a journalist, snap it up. 




 The timing of this makes me wonder if it's a real crisis or somebody trying to scramble the markets before Wall Street opens tomorrow morning. 




 I love it when the Millenials embrace historic local music.

This vid reminds me of this:

 Stalin + engineering + possibility of certain death?  Yikes.

Edit b/c I was warned by the bot: at what point do these people go "oh hell no!" and let these systems become obsolete.  

And at what point did the Soviets think this was a good idea?  Terrifying their comrades who are simply trying to commute? 




 "You're coming with me and if you forget the frisbee this time, I will cut you." 




 Have you ever ticketed somebody for chewing gum?

I spent a night at the Raffles once, pre-modernization.  Ever taken a call there?  

 














 You didn't watch it all the way through, did you?

Some of the creepiest stuff on YouTube starts with something innocuous to keep the censors away.  This is a classic example. 




 "rebuked in Dubuque" -- better than "Banned in Boston"!

Anyhow, this is like Florence Jenkins, a notoriously unaware horrible opera singer:

 Why do weekdays?  Fun fact that nobody seems to know: parking is free on Sundays in Georgetown.  Come in, walk/bus to Foggy Bottom, and the Metro is yours.

I drive from SW Virginia to DC all the time, which means the full length of I-66.  It's not difficult. 




 That was the moment I realized Community had gone from smart to sublime. 




 My favorites were his musical cold openings.   




 I came to the show late an that took me forever to grasp.  The occasional references to the Soviets still existing threw me for a loop.   




 Some can, and well.  Max Scherzer of the Nats is doing very well.   




 FYI this was a joking reference to Nixon's possible return post-Watergate: "He's tanned, rested, and ready." 




 I live in DC and pretty much grew up without baseball.  When the Nats came to town, I started to really get into it.  I remember that just about the time I understood what an opposite field homerun was that I really began to enjoy it.

Now the Nats are awesome and watch or listen to pretty much every game.   




 I just finished the Mr. Robot pilot.  Financial market meltdown imminent.  So, basically I'd be living in Athens in real life. 




 Excellent choice!  Classic moment in TV history.  With all the hype around Survivor that summer, it was basically the show sticking the landing.

 I read that it had to do with wanting to avoid Apple's liabilities.  He didn't want to be held responsible for any debt or something. 




 Aqua 301 is really nice.  I bet they do brunch but look them up. 




 The poor boat was sunk in Singapore and raised.  Complete agreement with everybody that if she were still sea-worthy, we should be all in on preserving her.

But she already sank.  It's hard for a vessel to come back from that. 




 Patton.  

George C. Scott gets all the press for his rightly-earned accolades, but when you take a step back, it's the absolute best biographical film ever made.  There was some love and effort in getting the script right.

DDL's Lincoln and MLK in Selma should've done the same but screwed things up.

I also think Patton's one of the best war films ever made. 




 Yup.  They wouldn't let her do the full bikini thing -- her butt would've been much sleeker, like modern beauties.  

The corset thing sort of hid it, but when you see her move, it does look like she was wearing a diaper.

The ep I saw had something to do with the rescue of a scientist with a secret potion.  Diana loved kicking a Nazi's ass once as Wonder Woman.  She was actually in danger in this ep.

Roddy McDowall did Wonder Woman?!
 




 George King of Falafel.  28th   M.  They might let you eat al fresco if you ask nicely. 




 Yup.  She was mad about the padding throughout the filming.

I recently saw an ep on a OTA alternate channel for nostalgia sake where she rescued a crazy scientist or something.  She looked weird with the bikini bottom stuffed like that.  This was the same era of Charlie's Angels so I don't know why she was made to do this. 




 I do!  DirecTV with an over-the-air add-on and a woefully maxed-out DVR.  

Bonus: it's hooked up to a CRT television.

I can't stand watching TV over the internets.  Lower quality, horrible sound, etc.  

Mind you the only thing I watch live are sports or the occasional season finale.  Sometimes reality TV eps in order to bitch   moan live online.  

Edit: Plus live newscasts -- you can't beat live TV when a hurricane or blizzard is in the mix. 









 Breaking Bad, easily.  I watched the pilot as it first aired.  It had been getting favorable pre-reviews across the board.  I have DirecTV so it wasn't even in HD at the time, which might have made WW's tightie whities a little easier to take.  Had I seen them in HD I might've bailed.

2nd choice would be Buffy.  I fudge on the rules a little though: the first ep I saw is what turned out to be the S1 finale, however, S1 was a half-season.  They re-ran that half season in order over the summer, I watched or VCR'd each ep and then launched into S2 without missing a beat.

I plead forgiveness for fudging as this was the late 90's. 




 What is it with cute Korean girls and impossibly complicated first pitches?

 Pre-nups are fine for second marriages when there are children in the mix.  They're effectively a component of estate planning.

For first marriages they're a crock.   




 The LSE in London has one of these.  I never had the courage to go over the top. 




 I know.  

The last five minutes was the most fun I've had watching soccer since the mens WC.  

Gotta hand it to England.  They were getting shelled and defended beautifully.   




 Many thanks! 

I can't believe I was right in remember it was Jacoby.  

Great sleuthing.  




 As if anybody needs a new reason to hate the Phillies. 




 My first thought, too.  I loved how he wound up interviewing the construction crew and dedicating the broadcast to them.  He had absolutely nothing to do with his air time. 




 I know you can't have them in Nats Park, at least the last time I asked. 




 I give it 10 more minutes. 




 There was an ad for I think TV's with one of the Redskins original Hogs -- (Joe Jacoby?) -- who upon being introduced responds with an incredibly flat "and yes."  

My google-fu is weak.   




 Call ahead and let them know what you're doing.  I've never witnessed one myself, but the myth is that they flip over this happening.   




 I wuz just trying to say he wearing exactly what a white guy collegiate player would wear unless he didn't bite on the elaborate fashion-forward/fashion-disaster route.  If he'd come from a preppy school and been selected by the Jazz especially.  

He needed his persona to be credible, nailed it, and funzies began. 




 There was some sort of a governor on the turret that wouldn't let them fire when the gun was pointed at the tail.  

They had an onboard communication link with the pilot though, so they'd tell him to cut one way or another and square off of on the attacking aircraft.

These beasts could outdive anything though. 




 I know how to adjust volume levels.  I could've nailed it and handed the iPod off to the real musicians. 




 The Titanic pic made me laugh.

I normally hate this kind of thing, too. 




 These are all journalistic interns.  They're running to get the copy of the decision to their network's/magazine's/newspaper's legal analysts.  

It's a grand tradition.   




 Dayum whoever took that pic has got an AWESOME security clearance!

I like how the rainbow is over the Supreme Court building. 




 Cocktail, a Tom Cruise chickflick.

My gf made me go, I went, but spent the middle part of the movie patrolling the condiments stand. 
























 Males can squee, can't we?  Just put on a fresh pair of shorts and it's all good.

I just did. 




 Perfect name!  Did you know that when he was a puppy he'd live up to it? 




 Same here.  Watch only on the left.  Anytime I see somebody with it on the right, he's either a leftie or wrong. 




 Wow.  Flavored chips didn't exist in the USA until 1954?  How is that possible?  Nobody thought to add jalapenos or Old Bay to them prior to that? 




 Holy crap.  Walking around up there with just business shoes?  That's just plain stupid.   




 Pretty aircraft.

There's one hanging in the Smithsonian's National Air   Space Museum on the Mall.  I always it was an odd choice for an American museum.   




 I've spent limited time in Chicago but watched pretty much every ep of ER, The Good Wife, and Shameless.

Be prepared for a Chicago-condition winter but one that will last only a week.  Our summers will be tougher to acclimate to -- 95F plus humidity is life-draining.  Our springs and autumns however are world-class.  I swear during cherry blossom week, DC is this prettiest city on the planet.  

Washington itself is much smaller obviously so I bet faster to get around.  The L from O'Hare to downtown amazed me how long it took.  

DC's got a weird duality in that it's insular amongst social circles yet everybody welcomes a newcomer.  The city is also much more international than Chicago -- a good chunk of your class will be foreign.  

You'll be fine.  Lots of midwesterners here.   




 Interesting idea, but the choices are too limited.   




 Ah.  That's a gavel on the bottom.   




 What's the reason for the bald eagle in the northwest?  American soldier cemetery?   




 I've flown from National to Bermuda.  I think they did all the customs stuff upon arrival at the airport in Bermuda -- the opposite of doing it when say flying from Dulles to Heathrow. 




 Roanoke, which is in the center of all this, was originally called "Big Lick." 




 British English spelling for an American English movie.

Unless this pic was taken in Europe. 




 My sense was that with the women they were young and impressionable.  They would've been maybe five to ten years older than me.  

The late 70's were weird.  Even the early 80's.  All kinds of cult-y movements springing up.  I fended off all of them -- for some reason, I seemed like an easy target, but have a hidden cynicism in me.

I'm happy to hear that a woman who was that close to him landed on her feet and raised a child who writes as well as you do.

Perhaps I shouldn't be surprised!

But you have to know: Erhard was a con man.   




 Spare fuses.

When a storm hits, that is not the time to figure out what fuse belongs where. 




 I don't sadly.  Did she ever meet Erhard?  From my POV as a teenager in the 70's, I thought the adults were going insane.  

But anytime I'd see an EST type on TV, the females sounded like that, while the males weren't too different from modern self-help types.


For my mini-generation, I think that's remarkable as normally it's the adults thinking the teenagers were going insane.

There was a terrific movie where a real-life EST girl coralled a director.  It's on the tip of my tongue.  

Anyhow, that movement was weird.  I hear Erhard has vanished.

What did your mom do with them?   




 Ouch.  Classic "good enough" traffic engineering.  

I imagine re-routing roads in the UK is a whole new level of problems, but still. 




 I've been there -- he had converted a urinal from Sloppy Joe's to become a water bowl for his cats, right?  Still there? 




 I drive a '68 Mustang as a daily driver.  My goodness -- Ford managed to produce a car that would be only more tail-happy!  

I did not think that was possible. 




 "Theatres"? 




 No they can't.  I have never seen a pic of a llama who did not look smug. 




 True.  I'm really digging Rachel McAdams, so that'll see me through to the end.

But I swear to God anytime Velcoro appears, I want to take a week wacker to his 'stache.   




 Yup.  I thought it was cheap cop-out.  I'm not enamored of this world the way I was of season 1.   




 I agree and I live in the epicenter of political discussion: Washington, DC.

The problem is that those of living here effectively do not have a vote.  

I think yapping about politics is a waste of time.  

But I do have a buddy who truly knows what's going on at any given time, and I love hearing his reports from the trenches.   




 My bet it is that it was a leak.  ESPN is not TMZ.   




 The CFPB is toothless. 

This is a nuisance settlement.  

How fucking dare they consider this to be a victory?   




 I did once.  Had a very nice chat with a little old lady who noticed that I was reading Moby Dick while waiting for my number to be called.   




 Al Shepard walked on the moon.  You honestly think he didn't rip one off just to show everybody who's the boss?! 




 Whoa!  That was Fred Ward?!  Nice catch!  I thought I recognized him.

Anyhow I truly hate Velcoro.  When what happened to him at the end of ep 2 happened, I was all "good!" 




 Is this a prank reel?  How could the bird immediately vocalize what Attenborough just said?  And how does a wild bird in Australia get access to Seinfeld re-runs?   




 You never know with celebs who are in movement from point A to point B.  They could be out of gas and irritable.

John Goodman is supposedly a great guy but beware if you mess with him inbetween shoots.   




 I have to admit -- the shark fin was a clever idea.  Too bad nobody tried "swimming" with it.   




 That might have been an influence on the internet, but I'm 53 and knew of so-called cat ladies well before the internets.  

Watch American Hustle.  They prey on a woman who had too many cats.   




 This is exactly correct.  If you have an over the air antenna you can the FCC-controlled broadcasters listed above, but redditor above forgot The WB, which is the home of Supernatural which I will keep watching until the bitter end.

The broadcasters also have a number of sub-channels.  For example, my ABC affiliate has a channel 7.2 that shows reruns of the best 70's and 80's shows.  My CBS affiliate has a 9.3 that shows the weather radar loops.

Meanwhile on cable/sat there's basic cable -- AMC with Breaking Bad -- and premium cable -- HBO with Game of Thrones.

I love having over the air reception.  The picture quality is better than compressed satellite quality.   




 Here's the video.  Doesn't seem all that bad, but who would buy donuts on the counter?

 Agreement that dogs are much more expressive than other animals, but cats -- or at least my cat -- has expressions.  Eyes slitted and head high and looking smug?  He's feeling smug.  Eyes wide and staring at me like he wants something?  He wants something.   




 I'm not sure what exactly you're referring to as Ackroyd and Martin were aping a Czech accent and the woman a manufactured accent, but for the people speaking normally and having been grown up in the 70's, I can add

- on the SNL skit, that's Larraine Newman in the middle.  She was hilarious.  The accent you hear her speaking in was the famous Mid-Atlantic American accent from the 40's Hollywood.  See My Girl Friday.  She didn't normally talk this way, but I bet thought it the best choice for an arts patron of the period.

- JZ Knight is more interesting.  The accent before she went into character is only of the 70's.  It's the way people involved in the self-enlightenment programs such as EST spoke.  You could spot them immediately.  I never encountered one in real as I was too young, and I think it was mostly a West Coast thing.   




 What happened to the stink bugs anyway?  The winter wasn't that brutal.  Maybe all the rain?   




 The guy didn't sue the blogger as a John Doe at the very least? 




 I just googled the bejesus out of this picture.  Despite being a wikicommons pic, it's not used in any wiki article.  The official USN description says the gunner was "thrown clear" though.   




 Yeah I usually take Acela when going to NYC from DC.  It's such a hellhole.

There is a Irish Pub tucked away that I really like and I normally hate Irish Pubs (unless actually in Ireland).   




 Mosquito repellent.  I hate the rules of this game as I also bought beer in the same purchase. 




 I think TMZ or somebody polls celebrities as to what the final score of the Superbowl will be.

It's inevitably won by a former Baywatch star or the like.   




 Nicely researched article!

This is where he got on the highway:

https://a248.e.akamai.net/f/1202/1579/4m/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/07/08/10/2A54921200000578-0-image-a-67_1436346996129.jpg

It strikes me as a horrible layout asking for trouble. 




 And you admit this? 




 I don't know enough about the market at the tiem.  Were Commodore 64's TI products co-branding with Timex or something? 




 Ah, LinkedIn.  What a resource!  You must be more professional than most mags.

I've always wondered what would happen if a magazine just created a /r/nameofmymagazine and simply posted its articles there to use reddit as a free comments section.   Unless of course you pay for subscriptions, which if you're a LinkedIn vet, you do.  Maybe a best of series of postings?  

followers from Facebook are all in places that are behind the european circuit on technology.

What does that mean? 




 I gotta say if I was the Greek PM and had in money, this is precisely what I'd send to Brussels just to freak them out. 




 Have you every been able to use reddit to promote the magazine?

Otherwise what does this entail?  Lots of twitter and Facebook? 




 Nope, I've never had the chance to try one.

But couldn't a toddler nibble at it to get to the toy?

Anyhow, I remember growing up in the 70's there was soap with a toy inside it if you used the full bar.  My brother and I would regularly knife them in half.  Not smart to have I'd guess a 7 year old and a 5 year old around knives and wet soap bars.  We were fine but the potential for danger was there.

Now add in candy.  

I'm just saying I think the US FDA has a rational argument on their side. 




 Why are the birds challenging the lizard?  They can fly; he can't.

 What a great smile! 




 Oops.  I subscribe and didn't notice which sub I was in -- I thought it was historyporn.

Nevermind.

Happy cakeday! 




 I've never been attracted to hunting but have always loved shooting -- my best childhood friend's father was a renowned sportsman/hunter.

If I had these bastards digging up my ranch, I'd be emailing Pig Man for tips on how to get a clean shot at them.   




 This was post-Reagan I thought.  They'd already migrated to the GOP at that point.

Things like this happen.  In Virginia, we had George Allen running for the Senate against Jim Webb, who was regarded as having zero chance of winning and was there simply so the race wouldn't be uncontested.

Allen made a huge goof -- the macaca comment -- and suddenly everybody remembered that he was a moron.  Webb won.  Webb's also now running against Hilary Clinton.   




 Is that because of snow days?  I grew up in Virginia and the schools generally let out around Memorial Day.  

Anyhow, OP if your parents could afford summer camp, you went.  Getting the children out of the house for a month is a grand tradition in American marriages.  I've always thought it had less to do with the children than the parents wanting some alone time. 




 An oldie internet thing:

I really like the "welcome aboard -- please call me Admiral" idea. 




 Like Mark Twain, the reports of her death have been highly exaggerated. 




 My bet is a dolphin.  They're curious critters.  

Odd that you saw no fin of any sort though.   




 I gotta say that if my child was going to get bused due to the first letter of my last name, I'd be kind of pissed, too.  Arbitrary reason to tack on an hour or two of the student's commute. 




 I'm actually with the US on this.  Children too young to understand that there's a toy inside could get access to one of these.  The wiki says three children in the UK did in fact die due to choking.  

A 3-year is very different from say a 6-year old, obviously.  

 




 Oh the TI calculators are classics!

No this was definitely a foray into PC's.  I think even Johnny Carson was making jokes about them.   




 Well, this incident happened at the height of the Balkans ethnic cleansing so it was a highly loaded phrase at the time.

The point was more to embarrass the newbie Congresscritters than anything else.  It was a "gotcha" stunt. 




 I thought that was Bridgestone. 




 That sounds like something Spy Magazine used to do.

They once polled every incoming member of a House class if they opposed "ethnic cleansing in Freedonia."  Everybody of course said yes and felt good about themselves.  

Freedonia exists only in a Marx Brothers movie. 




 The thing I remember about it is that they did this in a number of cities but knew not to mess with DC as that could be real trouble, then pretended they didn't know they were doing anything that might get people worried. 




 Yup.  I started watching again with the debut of the 2nd half of last season -- ep. 4.9.  It was an excellent stretch of eps.  Don't hesitate to catch up via recaps and start from there.  I feel like new life has been breathed back into the franchise.   




 I know a guy from the Clinton Administration who somehow got possession of that helmet and still has it.   




 Texas Instruments did the same thing once, I believe.  They wound up basically giving away the older models, or maybe selling them for $10 in order to get shelf space free for the new models.

I don't think they stayed in the PC business much longer. 




 Whoa.  I thought you meant the airborne deadly disease -- I live in DC and had to deal with the anthrax attacks after 9/11.  Scarey times.  People were microwaving their mail. 

Then I saw MTV. 




 Gold Star I think it is?  Their cashews are even better.  Buy only at half price though. 




 I saw the tail end of it.  He filled the dead air by paying tributes to his construction workers, who looked like they wanted to kill him.   




 I saw clips of his concert.

He was having a blast.  

Good for him! 




 That was the Ann Richards race, right?  There was another incident where he refused to shake her hand.

Yes, children, there once was a time where Texas elected a progressive Democrat.   




 I was living in DC at the time.  I remember they had stills of some of these kids on the sides of buses.

Apparenlty, a pair of DoJ prosecutors were standing on a corner as a bus went by, and they looked at each other and immediately said "is that child porn?"  Thus the investigation was born.  

Anyhow they were really creepy.  CK I guess wanted to be oh so edgy and blew it.  Same with A F these days. 




 Aw, I love the CVS house brand of almonds.  Try them! 




 You could also try r/archiveporn.  I don't know they accept albums though. 

Those letters belong in a Civil War museum.  I like how somebody along the line put them in a protective liner.   




 I've never been certain about whether the markings were black   white like zebra stripes or multi-colored.  Anybody know? 




 I gave up on after the Governor horsepoop, but came back to it this past season with Alexandria and whatnot.  I'm glad I did.  

Wikipedia has surprisingly good recaps, so I was able to fill in the blanks.  I don't think I missed much.   




 FP is off the leash and free associating without fear tonight.

Nancy Drew? 




 r/thingsjonsnowknows
 




 I know Gene refers to Gene Okerlund, but that's about it. 




 Why not both?

Bryce could be a girl name too.  Bryce Maxine perhaps? 




 No sadly.  I don't envy anybody having to search manually. 









 /r/HeyCarl for anybody needing more. 




 This is second only to seeing a teddy bear thrown away. 




 Couldnt get it show even on 820p 




 The just found by overwhelming evidence that Cosby had launched himself into the public sphere.

Ordinary firing litigations don't have that kind of behavior so they're left sealed. 




 Snooty Gwyneth Paltrow and the first lady of reddit Jennifer Lawrence.

Actually now that I think about it, despite what a trainwreck it'd be, it could be fun. 




 I somehow got roped into seeing a concert I didn't want to go to, and there was this cute blonde who also yodelled opening.

Jewel.

Two months later, I Was Meant For You broke nationally and I couldn't have been happier for her.  I love her to this day. 




 That is a seriously well-tailored suit.  High waistband by today's standards, but it that's the only thing 70's-ish about it, the man's got classic style! 




 Don't panic but it's your cakeday. 




 **Submission Statement:**

An examination into Frontline's examination of international gambling.  It's fascinating in that I can't tell if they as Frontline says couldn't get their sources squared away or if as Bergman says they were afraid of litigation costs.   









 I was preparing to buy my first CD player in maybe '86 or so.

I asked my salesman what would be the best demonstration CD to test the various players.

So my very first CD purchase was Frankie Goes to Hollywood.   




 We've got B-52's are now being piloted by grandchildren of their first pilots.  Or so I read.  Still, they've been in service for decades, too. 




 You never know.  Maybe she had a bad first marriage and wants security with her second?  He's by all accounts a charming guy, so all the best to the happy couple from me. 




 Pretty much my favorite Bond girl.

That cute little wave she gave 007 from the helicopter?  Swooon. 




 I live in DC's Georgetown.  Every single intersection not controlled by a traffic light is a four-way stop.  

It works pretty well as most drivers know what they're doing and newer drivers catch on by doing the same, but I have noticed that when I'm close to Georgetown University, things break down.  I think it's all the adult drivers from out of town taking their children to visit the campus.   




 I've gone on Saturdays the past few times I've had to get inspected and sailed through each time.  Maybe one or two cars ahead of me.  

My inspection date is always late October though.  Maybe that has something to do with it? 




 DAE think the narration is modern and tacked on?   




 I bet he's going to trounce Fallon.  Beer pong with Channing Tatum is interesting exactly once.   




 Crappy quiz.  There was no 1978 Winter Olympics.   




  "For Whom the Bell Tolls"

I regard it as one of the greatest novels ever written.  

Read up on the Spanish Civil War before launching into it.  

Hemingway's short stories are perhaps the best introduction to him though.  A Warm Well-Lit Place is a classic. 




 Yeah that's kind of my thinking, too.  Question is: who replaces him? 









 True dat.  I walked out my door at 3pm and walked back in at 1am.  

I guess we were the only trains on the tracks.

Still: 20 minutes including a transfer at L'Enfant.   




 Never apologize for being an insufferable know-it-all -- you are on reddit. 




 What could possibly be going on inside these cats' heads?

edit word. 




 Relax.  This is as bad as it gets.  I've never seen anything worse.  Normally it's drunk people doing drunken things.


For example, here is a man lighting fireworks off of his privates.

http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=ac6_1408136793

He's fine, so safe for looking.  

I think it's the absolute best HMB vid on the internets.
 




 By that rubric, no female sports are worth watching.

I love womens' tennis.  I could watch say a Sharapova vs. either Williams sister final and never get bored.   




 Before I click off this thread, I just wanted to say many thanks OP for the play by play!  Nicely done! 




 What a great video!

I love how they included the girls' high school team goal.  

Edit: which goal won the award? 




 Oh I gotcha.

The RCMP I'm sure have Interpol on speed dial. 




 I was at the 18 inning marathon last October and it took me maybe 20 minutes to get from Navy Yard to Foggy Bottom.  Metro was awesome that night.  I got the sense our trains got special treatment.  

Glad you got to go the game! 




 I know -- he seems to feed off of the energy.   

I loved his star spangled bat yesterday.  Apparently he'd had it in the locker room for a year and was waiting to use it.   




 There's a Harper brand broom?  Are they for sale within the DC area?

edit:

http://www.harperbrush.com/ 




 I know.  It felt like an away game. 




 Whoa.  How did you get home that fast?! 




 OP you should x-post this into r/soccer! 




 He said the thing nobody could know about is how great the weather was that day and the different colors of flames coming from the Japanese carriers.  

It must have been epic! 




 I just did a drive-by on it.

There are people defending Bruce so they're not all bad. 




 I didn't think Uncle Ray was awful.  I like him.

But FP's "special." 




 I can watch a replay of Bryce's splash into McCovey Cove and never get tired. 




 Me, too.  I thought it was a signal to the dugout. 




 I love Bryce losing his helmet like that. 




 I think it was huge.  Horrible stadium.   




 I once met a man who was a Wildcat pilot at Midway.   




 I just tuned in post-WC euphoria and OMG these guys are annoying.

They don't seem to have much audio from the field, either. 




 I still think this is most frightening thing anybody could have in their homes. 




 No chance.  The USA and Canada will be in a diplomatic stand-off by dawn.   




 I wish he was.  I'd love to hear his reception. 




 I know -- I saw her in the semis celebrations and wondered what her story is. 




 Where's Sepp? 




 I totally disagree. 




 Nah.  Her kind of crazy runs too deep. 




 Somewhere Brandi Chastain is ripping off her jersey! 




 Nice way to bookend her career! 




 Wait until you start seeing guys your age retiring.  NFL then NBA then MLB.  

53 here.   




 I wonder if we'll see 250. 




 If anybody deserves a curtain call, it's her! 




 I think that's the very first time I've ever seen Sawa get angry. 




 Including the own goal.   




 There we go.  Thank Alexandra Patricia Morgan!

Meanwhile, the guy in the eagle mask never gets old. 




 Player of the match?

The architect of the stadium.   




 It's almost NSFL:

 Live and Let Die is actually my favorite Bond film.

It's the one where he escapes from the little island surrounded by alligators, right? 




 I'm from SW Virginia.  There's a Pulaski county.  It's really pretty. 




 I lived in London for awhile.  I really miss kebabs. 




 Crappy free kick. 




 HOLY CRAP!!! 




 I just tuned in and was what the game started an hour ago?

Shades of Germany/Brazil! 




 For some reason, the threads in r/soccer are better attended:

https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/3c8nde/match_thread_usa_vs_japan_wwc_final/?sort=new 




 Fun fact: there is always an officer of the Royal Navy stationed on the USS Churchill. 




 You can smell all the horse poop dust.

I wonder why those buildings that were at the location of the Reagan Building got torn down.  The site used to be a huge parking lot.  They look to be perfectly good, large buildings.   




 Ageist. 




 The 395 option is I think the most epic, but there's a sublime alternative especially as you're coming from the north.

Take the Connecticut Avenue exit off of the Beltway and drive south until you hit the White House.  

You'll see the city spool out as you drive down it.  If you have interest, reply and I'll add some pointers that you'll need. 




 As a former little human who invited such tackles with an ornery English Bulldog, that feeling is AMAZING!!!

Bulldog vs. 6 year old me?

He won most gladditor conflicts. 




 Where is this?  New A/C in Europe during the heatwave? 




 The authorities said it was one of those things best left unsolved.
 




 Dammit Reagan had a great tailor but oh his choice in ties was deplorable.  

Still what fun for everybody in this picture.   




 I can't believe she went all in on the grinding. 




 noscript got really worried with his video.  I wonder if the ChiCom internet people messed with it.  




 *:: epic season-long Supernatural montage ::* 




 I heard what sounded to be cannons but it sounded closer than Arlington Cemetery.   




 I think everybody in the US has a high opinion of Canada.   




 I went to college in Vermont and have many happy memories of Montreal.  I never understood the hatred to the French Canadians. 




 It was a very odd incident.  I drive past the spot a couple times a year where he shot himself and get the heebie-jeebies -- it's not a natural place to commit suicide.    




 I'm a Virginian who went to college in Vermont.  I love that state.  

I didn't have a problem with the winters.  Challenging but not overwhelming.  Plus I love to ski.  We'd go to class in the morning, ski in the afternoon, study in the early evening, and party later on.  Rinse   repeat.  It was heaven.   




 Typing to you from Georgetown.  I love living in DC.  

You're wrong about the city going hollow after sunset.  Incredibly wrong.  K Street of course gets emptied out, but there's a LOT going on elsewhere.   




 I live in DC and see tons of French flags on Bastille Day.   




 Aw I hate people crapping on hotmail.  That's my email address since perhaps 2000 and I still love it.  It's much better now, too.   




 Huh.  It looks like they launched from the Ellipse back then.  Now they launch from the sides of the Reflecting Pool.  

Anyhow I saw the Mall fireworks earlier tonight in person.  Awesome as always.   




 That is SO cool!  I regard him as having planted the seed of the US re-embracing soccer.   




 Honeymoon here in freaking AUGUST!!!?  This is when DC turns back into a swamp.  

I guess if you can survive that, your marriage is on solid ground.   




 That was really annoying.  The sound of the chopper detracted from the sound of the explosions.   




 Chuck Berry I hear will only accept payment in cash in a brown paper bag even to this day.  He doesn't get the bag?  No show. 




 It's a horribly written question.  All those modifiers in the middle?  Blech. 




 They're not feral anymore! 




 Well, I don't think he's as fat as Taft.  That guy needed a special bathtub to be installed in the WH.  

Anyhow, I think his weight is the least of his problems.  I don't think he'll make it past New Hampshire, but who knows. 




 A red SOLO cup.  Accept no substitutes. 




 Actually when I saw that pic I thought he'd lost a lot of weight.   




 I have an orange tabby tomcat.  He's a terrific mouser.  The problem is that he'll catch them outside, then bring them inside to keep catching them.  

I've never seen him with a dead one. 




 I appreciate that.

He was absolutely destroyed.  Washington basically made him go to France as ambassador to get him out of Monticello, where he'd effectively become a recluse.

If you get a chance to read Jefferson's Conversation Between the Heart and the Head from that period, take it.  It's wrenching. 




 This is a common misconception.  His wife died in childbirth well before the Sally Hemmings affair allegedly happened. 




 Do you want tinnitus?  Because this is how you get tinnitus. 




 My heart broke watching her interview.  Poor girl. 




 There's a sloping lawn on the east side of the Four Seasons.  That's where I go.   




 Tune into WTOP -- 103.5 FM.  Things are looking good, but it's wet on the Mall.  I just heard their weather report.   




 The important thing to know about fighting a speed camera ticket is that they're not adjudicated by the DMV but by the company that issues them.  

I tried to fight one from the camera on McArthur Blvd and got the sense nobody even read my letter. 




 OMG that's adorable!  I've never lived in a house that has a doorstopper.  Added to to-do list: house with a doorstopper and a puppy. 









 I grew up in SW Virginia.  I recognized the voice as southern, but not like any voice the adults around me used, thus I deduced that it must be further south.

I did hear however the inflections of a commanding voice, 

http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/stentorian

so maybe we Virginians are to blame.   




  Zone 1/2 hybrid pass

Is this like owning a unicorn?! 




 Upper Dupont's not zone 2 is it?  I thought zone 2 stopped at Rock Creek.

Anyhow, I'm in east village Georgetown.  I've never seen a street sweeper.  Then again, when it snows, I don't see snowplows either.

I've always thought the street sweeping regulations are more about keeping spots open than actually cleaning streets. 




  "possessing sandwiches with ill intent".

This is me whenever I walk out of my local butcher shop.

Their sandwiches are insanely good. 




 Yup.  Kittens got nuthin' on Houdini. 




 The owl seems to have an ankle monitor whereas the cat does not.

edit: I call fowl.  As in f plus an owl. 
























 Bingo!  Crabs, too.

Who could have possibly figured out that steaming/boiling such an unholy looking critter would result in such deliciousness?  How did I'd a guess a Stone Age human figure that out? 




 I'm sure it's a fine film but don't you think you are Micheal Bay lite?

 Well at least he was on the proper ballot.

The next time I see a Twins fan, I will cross the street to avoid them.

Thank you for the explanation!  I feel less angry now. 




 I live in DC and have always wondered why somebody didn't put a timelapse camera on our snow farms.  We'd melt off much earlier than this and it'd be fun to see say the last remnants of Snowmageddon die! 




 Oh it was fan voted?  

I think the Senators sucked in DC longer than the Twins have sucked in Minnesota though.  

But 1924 seems like it's been erased from history.  

Was Johnson on the Minnesota ballot or the Washington ballot? 




 This truly pisses me off.  The Nats get only Expos players yet the Twins don't list the Senators' Walter Johnson?!

At what point does the MLB decide what records go where? 




 Nah.  A puppy conks out wherever it is when it runs out of gas.  He wanted to play. 

As young as the doggie is, you could see him beginning to understand the cat batting at him.  

They'll be fine.   




 The next time we fly past it all will be well.  Pluto now knows we truly love it.  It just needed a sign. 




 Well the heart looks to be broken....

Sorry. 




 That's an unusual place to find a lost dog.  I hope it's not a tourist's dog who got loose.

Please update once he/she's been scanned.   




 Toyota cars of that era simply refused to die. 




 Well have you ever tried to hail a cab in Paris?  Even in the worst pre-Uber/Lyft days, DC had a better cab network.  

Bus/taxi-only lanes wouldn't work here.   




 I've never heard of this movie, but am so glad I did now -- thanks!

She went from Nixon in '68 to Nixon in '73. 




 I bet if he left it that way for the winter, come spring, it'd sprout. 




 Ah the simple pleasures of a porch and a nice rocking chair on a hot day. 




 This is the look of a bulldog in final abject defeat.

I did not know this was possible.

He will however have his revenge.  Bank on it.  He's plotting it as the pic was being taken. 




 What this video doesn't convey is how noisy the NYC subway is.  Her voice couldn't carry over the racket.  The man in the blue shirt was likely the only one who could hear her.

Plus, it sounded like all she did was a snippet of gospel.   




 I'm amazed the co-host chimed in with the Bo Derek point that spontaneously.  I saw that movie as a teen and still have fond memories of this look:

https://bloggojane.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/bo-derek-nude-bathing-suit-10-1979.jpg

I thought the modern world had forgotten about 10.  It's a great film! 




 That's precisely what's going on.  He's a vanity candidate.  Pat Buchanan did this in the 90's.   




 That was pretty cool! 




 That's a fair point.  It's not like the racists pop up anywhere else.  In fact, I didn't know they existed until I read about them elsewhere.

Still in the immortal words of Jake Blues: "Nazis.  I hate those guys." 




 The bullying kid was named Aspen or something right?  Is that a boy's name? 




 They really do have a lot of affairs and are more elastic about it. 




 Aw dammit.  Who do we blame for this? 




 Really good summary of the recent important articles too.  I'd never heard the Biker Bar argument before.  I like it. 




 Alright McCutcheon!!! 




 Gotta feed the teenagers summer blockbuster machine somehow. 




 Holy crap somebody really wants us to see Ant Man. So many commercials for it that I feel like I've already seen it.
 




 Oh I missed the ad -- was the reprehensible Briefcase show?

No argument.   




 Truth be told I don't hear him call a lot of baseball, but all kinds of football.  I simply remember that he doesn't annoy me in baseball.   




 They really do scrape the barrel.  I love their old spoof RTV shows though.  Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire and so forth. 




 I don't think he's that bad of a baseball guy.  I mute him on NFL games though.   




 Nuts.  Anticlimatic.  Beer run now. 




 I went to school with a Norfolk native.  He pronounced it Nawfuck.   




 It's happening tomorrow?  Why are we hearing about this just now? 




 Well it does look exactly like that photo above.

But thanks.  I have no intention of selling them.  They're sort of a fond memory of late, beloved cousin.   




 Dickbutting and saying something mean about Ellen Pao. 




 I've heard that on Navy ships, the captain orders all rings off while the ship's at sea.   




 It is a huge law school, true.  I've always thought that getting in is the toughest part.  I've known plenty of HLS lawyers and they are across the board all very good, but have heard lots of anecdotes that after first year, they coast.   




 That's my question, too -- don't negotiate salary until you have the offer.  Who knows, the offer could be perfectly good.   




 Unlike any of my friends' fathers, he always worked out.  If not tennis, running, and doing that well before the running craze broke out in the early 80's.  

A knee replacement has knocked him back a bit now, but he's still got it.   




 /r/BestOfLiveleak  




 I was 18 in '78 and can shed light on '75 and '85.

Both of the guys are dressed for a night in a disco or for '85 at a New Wave concert -- Thompson Twins or something.  Nobody wore that stuff on the streets.

'75 girl -- I think I might've seen that a few times, but it wasn't popular.  '85 girl however is in a high school prom dress.  




 DAE watch The Leftovers on HBO?

http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/v2_article_large/public/2014/06/30/leftovers.jpg

Should I suddenly see 1000 people in white, I'd freak. 




 My computer's messed up so no pix of it, but I found what appears to be it via Google:

http://images.europeanwatch.com/images/21/21542.jpg

The numerals on mine seem to be slightly smaller and crisper but that might be the perspective of the photo.  On the back there are two symbols under the IX and a teensy 18K at the bottom -- almost unreadable.  It's in really good shape -- no major scuffs on the lens.

I have very little reason to believe it's a fake.  My cousin had way too much money and the executor of the estate had everything of value appraised.  

The Rolex meanwhile is a Submariner with black dial, steel casing, and no date bubble.  I'm 100% certain it's real.  It came with the box, certificate, receipt, and the little anchor keychain.  

Thanks!

Edit: I then remembered to check visit this page and there are more photos and a valuation.  Is that accurate?  

http://www.europeanwatch.com/21542.html#

All of the other photos stack up except that Patek Philippe is not embossed on the inside of the watchband.  The clasp is identical though.  
 




 Will do!  Thanks -- I'm always on the lookout for a new show. 




 No you now have the bestest bartender available. 




 Seriously -- is this something that's been made or a funny trailer for soemthing not to be made? 




 It's pre-Iowa.  The GOP is the opposition party so anybody who thinks he/she has a credible shot has to do it now or wait 8 years.  

Any one of them could be the Jimmy Carter coming out of nowhere.

Except for Donald Trump.  He's a vanity candidate.   




 The Omen.

Damien was a lot easier to take when I could get out of the car and go play with the other kids on the playground. 




 Really?  I grew up in SW Virginia and saw a funnel cloud once.  It landed and I think knocked over some lawn chairs, but it was confirmed to be a tornado.  Tornadoes in mountains don't do so well. 




 I don't think it had so much to do with Snowden, but with her cooperation with the Taliban.

I don't like this woman one little bit. 




 I've never tried acid in my life and it's freaked me out while completely sober.   




 Me, too.  I guess Curiosity and the seven minutes of terror has made me an immediate gratification type. 




 Really?  Oddly enough, it's my favorite.

The Rolex feels like I'm wearing a brick on my wrist.  I never understood the appeal of the big diving watches.  It's still fun to wear with a polo shirt though.   




 73?!  I'm 53 and frequently fell like I'm the oldest guy on reddit.

Nicely done, good sir.  My father's 83 btw and has the same build as Harrison Ford to this day.   




 I hope the other side of the bar is at ground level for ease in getting the empties and crates back into the system. 




 I inherited a couple of really nice watches.  A Rolex, a Patek Phillipe, a Movado.  Dunno how much they're worth, but one of them is probably it.   




 It sounds like she'll be using an American accent.

I don't know that my brain could handle seeing Lady Mary speaking 'murican.   




 That harpy on the left is showing way too much wrist.  Slut. 




 Yup, his career didn't last long.  I read he'd get written up for being "lazy" and spending too much time with his guitar.  I think he twisted his ankle on a jump and the Army decided it was best to let him go.  I'm pretty sure it was an honorable discharge.   




 I love how the orange cat is all "oh not this shit again." 




 53 here.  I don't think the millennials could comprehend the crap us teen boys in the 70's had to put up with cults trying to recruit us.  I was fortunate in that I have naturally high cynicism but I figured that they were fishing for the one in 100 that didn't.   




 Thank you SO MUCH!  I was this game and forgot to record it! 









 I remember in April 2007 it rained for a week straight.  I don't think we saw the sun once.   




 I saw that ep.  Kevin Costner was the pilot, right? 




 I've always thought those rooms are for visiting heads of state.

I live near the Four Seasons and it's frequently got so much security outside it looks like an embassy.  I think they actually block off 29th Street from M down to K so they can park their black SUV's.   




 I was adding traffic and clearing customs and a safety buffer.  3.5 is a little too long, though. 




 Did you all think she -- Meryl Streep -- was aware of this and adjusted her accent accordingly?  At that point she was known as the queen of accent roles. 




 Poor thing.  Taking a nap and bam!

Orcas aren't whales though, right?   




 My God what a crappy movie that turned out to be.  That kind of talent on the screen and they screwed the pooch? 




 I just don't see anybody stepping into Yul Brynner's shoes. 




 Over the air and FCC-compliant, I think The Good Wife is awesome.   









 Gotcha.  Thanks! 

I read you all got snow outside of Sydney today.  Oh how I envy you. 




 So it was basically like a thick US Southern accent?  Deliverance-class thick? 




  a Lindy Chamberlain accent

I'm intrigued by this.  What's the difference?  
 




 WHAT a great story!

If there is ever a top 100 selfies list, this deserves to be in the mix. 




 Not following you.  Clarify?  What was on the cassette? 




 Is it just me or does this look like an aluminum GI Joe in a faceplant?  

Crappy way to memorialize the fallen.  I guess this is why Scott did it without NASA knowing about it. 




 I've dined with plenty of Catholics and have never heard a prayer in a public space, especially with a stranger.  It just doesn't happen.

Now if you're having dinner at their home, that's fine.

I'm calling BS. 




 Those of us in the DC area got completely clobbered by one a few years ago.  I'd never heard the word before that, myself.

I've been through a couple of Cat 1's and dying tropical storms, but have never heard the tree canopy around my house make that much angry noise.  Seriously -- it was caveman-level scarey.

Here's a video taken inside the Jefferson Memorial.  It doesn't fully capture how bad it was:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxMIfVS9d4k 




 My pleasure.  I once flew KL to Newark via Stockholm, and then a regional flight to National.  I will never do that again.  

Stay hydrated!   




 And this is why I haven't touched tequila since college. 




 Following that link led me to this:

http://www.plasma2002.com/blenderdefender/

which is possibly the funniest thing in the history of the internets. 




 Oh it had to be for himself to lounge with the kitties.  My cat only pays attention to TV during Formula 1 races.   




 On #4: this is in New England?  It sounds like they really needed some company.  

How urban was it?  I went to college in Vermont and the rural to the streetlights could change within a hundred yards. 




 Well that explains that... 




 Oh Jesus, your jet lag is going to be epic.

Cabs are I think $65 or so to downtown.  For Dulles, the only service is Washington Flyer.  If you can afford that, absolutely take them.  Super Shuttles are less but take longer and are in a van, but also charge per person, so maybe a Flyer is better for two travelling together.

The point is both will carry your luggage with you.  Easy-peasy.  

Just ditch your luggage in your room and go wandering.  Just get a hotel within walking distance of the Mall.  Your time is too short to learn the Metro.  If you have lots of money, the Willard is the absolute best choice.  Hotel Harrington is near it and more price-conscious.   














 Whoa.  I live nearby and haven't heard any sirens all night.   




 I don't understand -- where are you staying overnight?  

Regardless, call the Hotel Harrington.  Stay there if you need a hotel room, but if not, I'm pretty sure they have a baggage room that's amenable to tourists needing to park their bags.  It's right off of the Mall.  Kinda shabby, but perfectly nice.  

You're not going to get into the District until 7pm-ish and will need to leave 4pm-ish.  Dulles is way out there.

Take Super Shuttles each way. 




 Here's the DC Metro.  I couldn't break it out from the site, but press start and you'll see it develop from 1976 until now not unlike Shanghai's.

http://greatergreaterwashington.org/post/14214/evolution-of-metrorail-animation-now-with-rush-plus/

Frame of reference: keep your eye on Metro Center, which remains the heart of the system.  It's three blocks east of the White House.

This animation also stops too early.  There's now a Silver Line going into Northern Virginia. 




 No he's not.  He's just saying he keeps taking roles and working rather than being a prima donna. 




 He made up for it for the year where he won over Haley Joel Osment.  That was the most gracious acceptance speech I've ever heard. 




 That Omega looks embarassing.  He had to know.  Omega doesn't make over the top watches like that. 




 Exactly.  It kind of made a little sad.  Cat's expecting play attacks, the dog's expecting a tug of war over the toy.  

I'm sure they later figured out a mutual language to mess with other. 




 I've met Scots and have had no clue what they were saying. 




 I'm from SW Virginia but spend a lot of time in the Low Country -- my family has a beach house there.

Frank Underwood definitely sounds to me more like an educated Charlestonian.  I was surprised when I heard that his district was elsewhere. 




 Meryl Streep in the dingo ate my baby movie?

RDJr in Tropic Thunder? 




 It's got to be.  There is simply no way to train a cat from entering a room.  They'll engage in a battle of wills and the human will lose every single time. 




 Emily Lakdawalla is to my mind suddenly becoming THE space reporter of her generation.  Or maybe it's because her name is so cool.  Either way, I read her article anytime I see her byline.   




 I've never been drawn to hunting but after reading this article about wild boars in Texas, I'd be doing it all the time if I lived there:

 According to this, it's called The Australian:

I think it's in Chelsea.

Edit: Here's some background:

 His agent told the casting director that he'd done Shakespeare.  What he didn't say is that the play had been translated into German.  

edit: word 




 He later played for Harvard.  His roommate?  Al Gore. 




 The story I heard is that he got this ticket driving around a Porsche 911 that he'd bought with early MS money.  He apparently had a lead foot.   




 Well his mother was a redhead.  The late also hilarious Anne O'Meara. 




 I've given up on George Will.  I used to think people saying that he cherrypicks were political opponents, but then he wrote an article about something I had participated in personally, and holy crap he blew it.  Some of the things he said happened not only didn't happen, but could not by federal statute happen.  Simple PACER printouts could refute him.   




 Plus Lena Headley is heavily tattoo'd. 




 OMG who would post such pictures?  And where?  I mean there are so many sites like that. 




 This article sounds like it's right down your alley -- renovation mortgages:

 Even if they fail you, you 30 days to fix it.   




 I grew up in SW Virginia, Roanoke actually, which is at the other end of the Roanoke River.

I remember somebody excavated some helmets of the era near Danville.  The idea was that it's almost conclusive evidence that they moved way inland and assimilated.   




 Halfway right! 




 Huggla!  

Nice to see Henley still unafraid to send the runner, despite yesterday's first inning. 




 I was in high school in '79 and don't remember hearing much about Voyager 2.  I knew it was happening though and the pictures were cool.

I know more about New Horizons.

It could be just because I've gotten more interested in the space programs since then, and also I was in a boarding school at the time, so little access to TV. 




 Cool.  I once drove between those cities.  I didn't know.  

It's a super modern three lane comparable to US Interstate.   




 Mondern Mengeles operate more sublimely in mondern t9mes. 




 One of the best things about the NYT is how transparent they are at making corrections.  This article however shouldn't have been published in its first form.  It needed the two hours of edit time before release. 




 How could possibly NOT notice the cheekbones of Carice van Houten?  What, was she wearing too much clothing?  Sexist bastard.

 No kidding!  I knew they were having to uglify her for shooting, but dayum! 




 Hurley found a stray Dharma food drop and kept it to himself. 




 Los Angeles + Audi driver going backwards = Hollywood stuntdriver screwing around.

 Sometimes the only time I know for certain that I'm not shadowbanned is waking up to a raft of downvotes. 




 Jesus.  I just went through his comment history and it brings to mind that poor whale in the Pacific whose whale calls can't be heard by other whales. 




 There's nothing wrong with cross-posting.  In fact it's a good thing.

I don't know how he does it.  But he or his collective has an eye for good stuff.   




 No, I bet the whole axle needs to be replaced.  You don't want the weakest link to be the point where the tire attaches to it.  




 I was a little boy in '69 and it must have been awful.  The people looked cool, but you don't know how they smelled.  I remember encountering hippies at the local drugstore and holding my nose -- literally.  They stank.

80's girls had awesome hygiene.  

Plus nobody was getting drafted to Vietnam for my generation.  Things were a pressure cooker for kids in '69.  Those were dangerous times. 




  snapping the axle

I probably should've written "snapping it off of the axle" -- the axle itself is probably OK.

Still, I hope MPD is looking into the circumstances of this incident.  It's got drunk driver written all over it. 




 Born in '62.  Sucks to be you.  You have no clue how much fun you missed! 




 Well, not to worry.  It could've been 1980.  That year was mostly the 70's.  The 80's didn't start until the Fall of 1980.  Source: I was there at age 18. 




 Gotta love the high shorts on the girl to the left.  I think this might be late 70's though.  I grew up in the period. 




 This is precisely why Sam Altman is on the board.  

If he wasn't there, I'd bet reddit would be crashing everytime Anna Kendrick sneezed. 




 Yeah.  It should be like that Dirty Harry movie where Det. Callahan thought he was being followed by the mob but it turned out they were trying to protect him because if he got killed, some stooge he'd hired to kill the mob boss in case he died got the mob very worried. 




 My bet is going too fast and hit the curb exactly wrong, snapping the axle.  Looks like it's already got a parking ticket.  Maybe a drunk from last night?

I hope this isn't the tight single lane service road just above the Circle paralleling the tunnel entrance.  A drunk killed a pedestrian there maybe two years ago.   




 ThingstodoDC.com is absolutely the best if you're into the embassy circuit.  There's much more than that, though.

 OOOOH that felt great!!!

 Dayum.  They're really into that walk-off sandwich.   




 He's got a great voice, though.   




 No it's different.  FP is prone to Yogi Berra malaprops.  This is where we collect them.   









 Oh so they've got the local team on Fox?  Why the DC crew and not the home Baltimore crew?  Or is FP getting his shot at national fame?

Dayum I'd hate to lose him.  

Edit just looked at the time and tuned in.  Yup, there he is!   




 I've always wondered why the Nats haven't adopted some of the show-stoppers.  You Gotta Have Heart for example is terrific.    




 Who is the Fox announcing team?  Please be better than the ESPN crew.

It's great to have a pair of Virginia grads living large on the internets.

I'd imagine that your colleagues come mainly from the great STEM schools.  Did you ever feel like an outsider amongst them?  Or did your years in Charlottesville perhaps give you a fresh perspective?

Regardless, welcome back.  Your appointment as CEO is the perfect resolution of this sad incident. 




 That's a fair point.  The first week of sales would be the early adopters who've been anticipating the release.

 Dunno what to ask you but dayum there are that many Hawaiians in the Northwests?

 I used to doodle mushroom clouds in my elementary school notebooks.  One day, I realized how screwed up this was.

I was so happy when the USSR tanked.

The stress of Mutually Assured Destruction played a key role in messing with us children of the era.   




 It was a civil war to my mind at the time.  I'm Virginian so the US Civil War surrounded me growing up like oxygen.  Why we stuck our snouts into it eluded me.   




 I was just kinda/sorta messing with you.  "Student in university" betrays you as being British or Aussie or not American.  So I threw the extra U into favorite for fun.

I grew up in the 70's.  The proxy wars were confounding to my young mind.  I got the domino theory concerns about communism but what I didn't get is why the heck anybody cared about Vietnam.   




 Favorite war vs. favourite war?

 Why they changed, I can't say 




 I know a Firestone heir who joined the USMC.  He loved it.  

He's now running the Firestone vinyards and brewery.   




 How old are you?  If in college, target your studies to getting a job with USAID.  Those people are amazing.  It's tough work, but rewarding.

 Many thanks!  I should be ashamed of myself as I consider myself a WW2 airplane geek.

Who were the Italian pilots shooting at?  Allies or Axis? 









 Were you here during Snowmageddon?  I went to college in Vermont and it was an honest Vermont-class snowstorm.

I still think the 1996 blizzard was worse.

Anyhow, when we get clobbered, Chicago's used to the recovery, but we dig out after a few days just OK. 




 Oh.  Then that's fine.

I get annoyed by American theaters using theatre to make themselves more important-y. 




 Agreement.  I don't get YouTube fame. 




 Is your friend named Tommy, Lee, or Junior? 




 That bikini would be fashionable even today. 




 Based on this it doesn't seem too funny.  He's basically Rupert Gee without David Letterman in his ear. 




 Go slow and stay in the right hand lane until you have things figured out.  Yield to traffic in the circle -- those already in it have the right of way.

 Here's Sam vs. terrifying cat:

https://youtu.be/ASZkRM1vx54?t=7s 




 The private fake agents would've missed 100%.

TRUST ME: they truly sucked. And were officious jerks.  At least with TSA, you see some glimmers of professionalism.

Don't forget: private security companies like Argenbright and their ilk in NYC and Boston were the ones that let boxcutters and skeevy people onto the 9/11 flights.   




 The show's been on for freaking 11 seasons!

It would be nice if the Darkness just unleashed would get it back to its roots.

I need to re-watch the early seasons again.  I have seen every ep as it aired.   




 https://i.imgur.com/XSTVI.gif 




 We should never have broadcasted Glenn Miller.

The space aliens are going to attack and demand that he throws a concert before they depart. 




 I see your Catherine Deneuve in the 60's pic and raise you one Catherine Deneuve in the 70's pic:

http://clampart.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Jerry-Schatzberg-Catherine-Deneuve-Repose-1.jpg 




 You're missing my point -- the private security agents could do whatever they wanted.  

At least now they're somewhat accountable.

However I don't think a machete would've been allowed pre-9/11.  I flew from San Diego to DC in the 70's and I remember I took a clock radio with me.  They made me plug it in at the gate to make sure it worked.  I was perhaps a 12 year old boy. 

I live in DC now.  I hate the security theater.  Coming back from a Nationals game last month, there were all these DHS paramilitary police in black in the Metro.  WTF?!!!

But better them than the Argenbright Security Barney Fifes. 




 Oh that has to be tough for the Poles.  All of your friends when you were 16 recognize the plate for the rest of your life.

Did stupid things in a Lada?  When it's on a BMW 7-series, you still get laughed at. 









 Whoa.  That makes perfect sense.  Thanks! 




 I hope you heard the later Travelling Wilburies album.  I swear on half the tracks, he was teaching the other superstars how to record a song. 




 My cat used to come home smelling of really nice perfume.  One of my neighbors is a former model -- married -- and I suspect her.   




 Tires. 




 I was thinking about the four women killed on Long Island last week when a pickup truck broadsided their limo doing a U-turn.

How is that their limo was destroyed yet this one gets hit by a freaking train and appears to be somewhat salvageable? 




 Trust me, as bad as they are, they are FAR better than the private security they had pre-9/11.

Argenbright Security which ran the DC area airports were basically power hungry little termites.  I hated them having any kind of authority.  It was like volunteer deputies -- give them an inch of power and they'll try to take a yard. 




 Aw that's sad.

Still, Mr. Coe had a great run.  

I wish the Archer people had let us in on the reason but perhaps he preferred his privacy. 




 You're getting downvoted but you're not wrong.  He does a lot more than action hero/conflicted pretty boy.  And even when he's in those roles, he brings something extra.  Top Gun was terrific acting believe it or not. 

 




 Toy Story 2 is the one that got me.  When Jessie was left at the recycling kiosk and sees her little girl drive away.

Utter abandonment.

And then Sarah McLachlan starts singing...


 




 Me too!  Jeff Lynne is an underrated genius.

I listen to Concerto for a Rainy Day a few times each year to this day.   




 For anyone with interest: see The Deep sometime.  Great film and excellent photography of her. 




 Both of them are defaults now?  

They're great r/'s.  I don't see a downside to either of them being defaults. 




 Imagine an alternative history where an astronaut gets sick and they're all "suit up Margaret!" 




 Wrong.  It was supposedly Westinghouse.

Also, what people forget that the elephant had killed a handler and was doomed to euthanasia, so it wasn't for yucks.  

Edison may not have even known that it was happening:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topsy_%28elephant%29#Death

Snopes needs to tackle this incident. 




 I bet I'm alone in here having watched Medium, but Alison's husband Joe -- portrayed by Jake Weber, who pops up all over the place, recently on Tyrant -- is a saint.  

Literally psycho wife, three daughters showing the same trait, and he kept things real as far as domestic life was concerened.  A real saint. 




 I think this is more a combination of women marrying within the industry like Kate Winslet and Sam Mendes and them making terrible choices -- to this day Sandy B and Jessie James?  How did that happen? 




 RIP.  Was his ill health the reason Woodhouse went missing last season? 




 Meh.  She's in violation of the county code.  The eviction notice doesn't mean that's she's going to be evicted but the county taking the dispute to the courts, apparently unable to reach agreement with her.  This happens all the time.  I'm sure an accommodation is within reach somehow.   




 The trick is to look in the East Village, i.e., east of Wisconsin Ave. and north of M St.  The rentals in the West Village get snapped up by wealthy GU students.  This works in your favor.

I know a neighbor who had to go overseas for a year and rented his house for $1800.  This was maybe four years ago.  

I know a property that's had a rental sign on it for a few months.  28th   P.  Not an apartment house so no gym or pool, but there're plenty of those around.  I'll jot down the number and PM you tomorrow evening.  

When are you coming to town? 




 I saw a Nats game recently where Ian Desmond tried something like out of desperation and was off by just a hair.   




 I would wonder why Linda Carter is asking me out.

But if you're talking about a classmate, I'd be thrilled to catch up and take it from there. 




 It seems like the '70's pictures were a more vibrant blue.  Better processing on this image? 




 For $2800 you could get a small townhouse here in Georgetown.  You should consider that.  Your commutes will much more sane. 




 Orange tabby owner here.  When he was young, I could throw a toy mouse for him and he'd bring it back.

Then there was that one time when I misjudged him as being too tuckered out to bring the mouse back to me, so I went to retrieve it myself... game over.  He was testing me.   




 Holy crap this is the attention whore who played for Russia in the Olympics.   




 In the second pic, he'd be a new "deal with it" meme. 




 *ding ding* 




 *petsi! 




 One thing that may explain it that in the UK and maybe all of Europe, a car keeps its license plate for the life of the car.  So they need a format to basically print a VIN number.   




 It's not THAT clickbaity.

 Some very interesting choices.  They place Spike Lee in too high a regard though.   




 Plus the US version has radically different rules.  The hamsters conspire amongst themselves and vote each other out.  No public vote at all as in the UK version.   




 I live in DC and take Acela sometimes.  It's not that much faster than normal Amtrak, but it is more luxurious.  

The problem is that the tracks are all laid out circa Civil War.  Straightening them to allow trains to go any faster is the headache.   




 I just looked out my front and there's plenty of parking in Georgetown.  You probably wouldn't get a ticket if you parked now and got it first thing in the morning.  

I see this hostel is McPherson Square -- the 30-line buses would get you there, a taxi would be maybe $10, or you could walk to Foggy Bottom and metro. 




 Plan on taking the 3 but if you make the 2, terrific.  I think your plane would have to land early in order to make it.  

Union Station's not a bad to cool your heels for an hour.  In fact, it's terrific.  

I see nobody's tsk-tsk'd you calling it just Reagan.  We've got our panties rustled about the re-naming.  National, Reagan National, or DCA please.   




 Wish I'd read that first.  

Interesting that he namechecked Edison.   




 Yup, it sounds like he had a good run. 




 I remain convinced the suite's designed with visiting heads of state in mind.  I live near the Four Seasons and sometimes see security out front that makes the place look like an embassy.  I wouldn't be surprised if every major hotel in town has a similar suite.  I'm pretty sure Netanyahu stayed at the Willard.   




 Awfully pricey for plastic toys.   




 What currency are these prices in? 




 His instruction manual states three rules: eat, sleep, pass gas. 




 Yup.  They changed the system.

McKayla Maroney almost got a perfect score on her team vault in London though.   




 I think that's the softest of the records so far in this thread.

Joe was facing a string of palookas in that streak, but I still think it'll fall.  

 




 This was actually a brilliant show -- Ton of Cash.

They would have to literally move a ton of I think $100 bills from point A to point B, sacrificing anything they couldn't lug.  

They cast people who weren't so book smart.

 This is how Bryce Harper wound up looking the way he does. 




 Thanks for this -- I'd never heard of a geyser east of the Mississippi.   




 I thought this was going to be another guy landing on his privates.   




 If you're from Georgia and a student here why would you want to register in DC?  I miss being able to vote for a congressman or senators.  Just do absentee from home.  Contact your city/county's election board.   




 It's counterintuitive but do you wear a T-shirt under your business shirt?  It helps for me.  All cotton though.   




 JFK: I think it's one of the small wooden houses diagonal from the 7-11 on 27th   P.  I know for certain the first house he had with Jackie was 2808 P.  He was awarded the Pulitzer while living there.

The tavern is City Tavern on M Street.  That story might not be true, but Jefferson definitely ran into a tipsy Hamilton somewhere in the vicinity one night, retired to a tavern, and hammered out an agreement that resulted in a national bank.  My understanding is that it's most likely the City Tavern. 




 I wanted to see a tuba not saxophone playing the melody. 




 Please don't let us Muricans be searching cost of porn, please...

OK I'll take that.  We are an inventive country. 




 You are describing the behavior of my cat not only when waking up but throughout the day. 




 I had a girl drive 250 miles to my parents' house, break in, and snap a 45 rpm single that she'd given me in half.  

That's all she did.

(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iol0B-clFFM) ["Build Me Up Buttercup"] for anyone interested.  

A few years later I caught her cruising my new home's street.  My very understanding girlfriend and I accosted her, invited her in, and calmly explained that this kind of behavior couldn't go on.

She got it. 




 Typing to you from Georgetown.

We're really only more of a neighborhood now, but had been an independent city pre-USA and even post-DC. 

There are all kinds of fun spots here and there.  JFK's bachelor pad I walk past all the time.  The tavern where Jefferson and Hamilton came to an understanding is still here.   




 Why go Oceans 11?

Leave -- oops -- a door or two accidentally open, place a few strips of properly-placed bacon and BOOM! you and doggie are on the run.

Simplicity trumps even Clooney and Pitt. 




 The problem would be you'd be denying -- for my home team, by example -- the Nationals the services of Bryce Harper and Max Scherzer for a two week period.  We'd right now basically be an AAA team without them.  

I think the NHL recognized how valuable Olympic hockey is to the sport and just shuts down.

There is zero chance Olympic baseball will ever be as important to the sport while the World Series contenders are trying to keep themselves over .500 even in the doldrums of July. 




 Yikes.  Did airbags save the driver? 




 It was not very well thought out.  Remember that she is the sister of a brother who got himself fake kidnapped.   




 We'll see next week but I bet to let the SEAL expend his anger and win his confidence.

Seriously -- we've seen Raymond take punches like that.  Ever seen him stagger so melodramatically? 




 Thank you!  It's an awfully cute doggie!

I was worried that it might be a Presa Canario which has a checkered history. 




 And this is exhibit A as to why baseball shouldn't be played in the Olympics.  

Anybody who is even remotely good is being paid to play this time of year. 




 I think I'm the only person on reddit or perhaps the entire universe who admits to loving Two and a Half Men, but she had an absolutely hilarious arc on it in its final seasons.   




 Nanny state strikes again.  Still, I wonder why if the children were crying she didn't excuse herself for a moment or two -- I can't imagine the interviewer would've minded. 




 I was in college in the 80's.

I think mine was the last generation to write love letters.

I was very good at it, by the way.   




 Stocking up on canned soup is actually the perfect thing to do when a hurricane or blizzard threatens.  Even if the electricity and gas gets knocked out, you have food.

 Also last week's Ray Donovan.

I think one of the real life Getty heirs did this, too.   




 Get her to meet you for a mai tai at the cabana tomorrow in daylight. 




 Don't be.  I've filled a passport.  I've had some dicey things happen -- being surrounded by skinheads in Munich is the worst, but it was only dicey and I walked away -- and 99 times out of 100, people look after travellers. 




 Well this is in a [Serious] post so I didn't think to, but even when in the wild, if it's a good story, I keep reading just in case the monster from the Pleistocene era shows up.  I love it when he does. 




 That was identical to the set-up here in DC until only a year or two ago.  They've since let the liquor stores open on Sundays at 1pm and stay open I think until 6pm.

 




 There's a drive through beer store just over the bridge going into the Outer Banks in NC.  Brew Thru.  Its awesome. 




 No I type it from memory any time I see somebody asking about visiting here -- I figure it's something tourists would like to know.  It's a good introduction to the neighborhood.

edit: and once the leaves turn and the summer furnace turns off, try one.  It's a nice way to spend an afternoon!

 For anyone with interest, Jen Cheney of the Washington Post just published a oral history of Clueless.  By all accounts it's really good.   




 Nope.  I've been logged in for two days without a blip.   




 States qualify as autonomous?   




 What in the US qualifies as an autonomous zone?  The reservations? 




 Bloodbath.  

Imagine being at the Park, suffering and sweltering, then this happens.  Plus they've cut off beer sales by now.   




 Especially with people from Hollywood visiting. 




 Why hasn't the Walking Dead or something similar apocalypse-y snapped this up as a filming location? 




 Oh come on Blue!  Horsepoop! 




 If you decide on Georgetown, there are printable walking tours easily found via Google.  They're heavily JFK/Camelot, but there's nothing wrong with that.   

As for shopping here, the further you get from M   Wisconsin, the quirkier the shops become.   




 Heck I'm happy about this!!! 




 RFK had a bouncing third baseline for baseball. 

I was in it for the second U2 concert on their Achtung Baby tour. 

I got a little seasick but oh what fun! 




 R2D2 




 You're right -- 707 not a 727:

I love the idea that somebody in Florida built a development around propeller-heads.   




 This kind of trickery makes no difference unless she can run and get a first touch on a ball passed to her.

This is Harlem Globetrotters vs. the NBA. 




       ^^Wow.

                                     ^^Such ^^cute.

                      ^^Tired ^^now. 




 He used to be a one season showkiller.   




 My first thought, too! 




 Professor Moriarty.   




 Anybody have google maps google-fu to see what this place looks like now?

Anyhow, what a lethal combination these two tanks made. 




 John Travolta I've heard lives in a Florida aviation community with his own Qantas 727.  Why couldn't the Spanish convert this into such a thing.

It'd be like golfers living along a golf course, except everybody's got an aircraft. 




 Gone from YouTube now.  Mirror? 




 Seriously,

http://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/52283121.jpg 




 That sounds like an AWESOME show for the genre.  Real conflict instead of manufactured. 









 Sir David is so awesome.

He he is narrating Olympic curling:

 Any hope for the future?  

I'd be terrified to pilot one of these things, but I'd thought if the USMC let them go operational, things will be fine.   




 No (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedict_Arnold)[Benedict Arnold] nominations yet? 




 That really is badass.  I thought that with all of the early problems with this aircraft, it'd never see operational status.   Glad it made it. 




 SW Virginia here.  Rednecks in the Appalachians are people who I think are indispensable.  The mechanic who jury-rigs a fix on your car?  The man running a Winn Dixie grocery store?  I really like them.   And I don't use the word redneck ever.   




 Sounds like my last Pan Am flight.  '89 or so.  I really miss that airline.   




 I see this question a couple times of year, true, but come on -- different former prisoners answer each time.  I think it's interesting.   




 Cowboys vs. Aliens.  

Great concept, but crappy movie.  How is it possible to put Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig in the same movie and have it suck that badly? 




 Dina Meyers.  Those are the only two things I remember.

 




 I agree 100%. 




 Why didn't somebody just swat it on the nose?  I thought they hate this. 




 I grew up in the 70's and this was fairly popular.  I liked it.  I don't think I've had it since then though.   




 Just spewed Diet Coke! 




 Call up Schneiders or Calvert Woodley to see if they have that much in stock.   




 I had to get a DC license replaced there last December and sailed through.

Be aware that they're now issuing something called "real ID's" so look at the website carefully to find out what documents you'll need.  

BTW the entrance is on the corner on M just east of Dean   Deluca.  I walked past it a few times myself.  I think it's mainly a gym there.   




 Hell of a catch Bruce! 




 "Dodged" a bullet there. 




 I've always thought they're the side facing seats at the doorways.  

The first row of front facing seats are sort of a gray zone.   




 Sweet stroke on that HR!   




 Then he's probably still hiding inside. 

I've had my cat for 11 years in the same house and he still finds new places to hide.  

Open all of your closet doors and so forth in case he's trapped.   




 This does not factor in humidity. 




 Drama Queens.  The cat started it, but the dog executed it. 




 How well are you adapting?  Do you stay within a fellow Somalian enclave?  Do the Swedes embrace you?  Have you learned to cross-country ski yet?  You'd be good at that.   




 In case anybody didn't click through:

 Seriously there is aww and then there is something beyond aww. 




 Eastern Air Lines.  

Now that's a name I have not heard in a long time. 




 Problem?  Send a terrier in.

Problem solved.   




 That revolver.  It's scary.   




 Agreement. 

I was seriously angry when Peking became Beijing.  

How did anybody let the Chinese Communist Party change the name of the great city we'd known for centuries change its English name?

We let the unctuous assholes re-brand themselves.  And only a decade after Tiananmen Square.   




 Dammit just when I had forgotten how furious I am at the damned Russians.

These dissembling sons of bitches.   




 He's old enough for Iams kitten food.  

Your next few years are going to be all about devising new ways to entertain an adolescent cat. 

Hint: take an old shoelace, tie knots on on end to resemble a mouse, and swing it around.  Do this until the cat is tuckered out -- 15 minutes or so.  The doggie will take care of the rest. 




 So sad.  And with Schumi languishing in a coma.   




 "Because I DID know that I couldn't do that!"

 I'm from the south -- redneck accents are southern but not all southern accents are redneck.  They're a subset.  

This man doesn't sound too rednecky though.  I can't place it but he's soft spoken.  North Carolina maybe?  

I hold people like him in high regard.   




 'Zactly.  I hope that water wasn't contaminated.  It looks iffy. 




 Sorry about this Angelenos.  Nats Park is actually a really nice place.  Never seen this before.

We had two Taylor Swift sell outs there during the ASB.  This must be related.   




 Fun fact: I was at that game and had no idea what was going on until I got home.  They didn't draw any attention to the misspelling to the live audience.   




 Harsh. 




 Holy crap I'm glad they got this game going again!!! 




 Why would he do that?  It's way too early in the game.  If you're having lighting problems I'd think it's best not to turn off the spigots. 




 Huh.  I remember making that post -- this is a mangled version of it.  Somebody had posted an album of old photos of DC buildings on r/dc.   




 +/u/User_Simulator /u/train_subject9153 




 Check out /r/justFPthings -- a collection of FP's musings. 




 Yup.  I bookmarked it for viewing tomorrow.   




 How many parking spots does the District have that are actually under a bridge?  I'd think parking on the emergency shoulder would trump physically being under a bridge in most circumstances, too.  

Something's not right here. 




 TV and radio station web posts are always notoriously mangled.  I've always thought there must be something going on when they take a blurb prepped for on-air brevity and turn it into a written news article.   









 On the kettle thing, I think the electrical grid is easier in Europe to heat water or something.  For us, I'd use my stove. 




 No they're not pests in the sense that rats are pests.  They're just part of the ecology.  I get them in my garden tree every day, they're cute, piss off my cat, and move along.   




 In the mid-Atlantic we absolutely love the French.  We know their role in the Revolution and a lot of us are Huguenots.   




 There are two schools of thinking:  one is that crazies are attracted to Florida and the other is that Florida embraces and nurtures crazy.

It's a symbiotic relationship of crazy. 




 Yes but don't read too much into it.  It's more the ceremonial start to the day than anything else.

I know it sounds creepy to foreigners, but it's a really good civics lesson.   




 The Superbowl is the championship of Madison Avenue advertisers.  Everybody's paying top dollar for a spot.  

I personally love the NFL so watch the game for the game, but even in the VCR era would tape the game so I could back and watch the commercials.  

My all time favorite?  From the mid-90's, Ross Perot's EDS "Herding Cats" ad:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pk7yqlTMvp8

 




 Yes.  It tends to be a black/African-American thing, particularly from those with roots in the South.  




 I live in DC.  No better lunch than a pair of half-smokes (the local specialty), a Diet Coke, and a bag of Doritos, eaten on a park bench.

A regular diet of this would consign you to an early grave, though. 




  The Washington Animal Rescue League

My sister found her now-soulmate toy poodle there on an adoption day.  They're inseparable.  

I'm sure the others don't suck though, but WARL's good.

Go get your doggie/kittie and don't worry too much. 




 Find a 7-11.  They keep fresh coffee brewing for law enforcement. 




 I don't think that's true.  Dialing 1 means securing an international line.

Maybe things are different now, but I grew up in the 70's and you would dial 1 for the international line, then country code, then the local number.  I remember having an Englishman visiting my parents' house as late as '95 or so and having to take a couple of tries before getting his call to London connected.   




 In the US, starting a number dialing sequence with 1 means you're about to dial internationally.  112 could lead to some horrible misdials -- I don't think it'd even go through.  The line would be waiting for the rest of the numbers. 




 I grew up with a bulldog.  He could clear a room in five seconds.

My mother loved throwing bridge parties.  One day, he crept underneath the card table, detonated a particularly lethal emission, and my mother and all her friends en masse ran for the door.  It was a sight to behold.

I have never been as proud of him as I was that afternoon.  

Chaos. 




 I didn't think about that -- it's clear to me they're playing a game.  If the cat didn't like it, he'd move.  He's not cornered, he's not being hit hard -- this boy and this cat have done this many time before.  

It's a "How long can I annoy the cat until he pounces" game.
 




 I don't which of them was having more fun.  That cat is a feline jack in the box.   




 Boston makes no sense.  I heard a story that the roads follow old cow paths. 




 Me too.  I've only needed them twice but POW! they were there immediately.   




 He's right -- a mai tai really would hit the spot at that moment. 




 I know they're here somewhere -- a friend's house caught fire and he and his family stayed in one for a few months until the house was fixed.   




 Right back atcha!  

Holy crap you're right, and they still seemed to have had trouble listing the clones properly:

 Tatiana Maslany
as Alison/ Cosima/ Helena/ Rachel and Krystal/ Sarah

Why the "and" in there?  For when one clone pretended to be another?

They missed the transgendered clone, too, but maybe he didn't appear in season 3?

http://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners 




 Dumb question: for which role was she nominated? 




 Yup and right at the start.

Ishmael was trolling us.   




 This is no Rusty the Red Panda escape, but go agouti, go! 




 Bud Greenspan was a woefully underknown documentarian.  He was an international treasure.  

I think his son is trying to keep his productions alive but haven't heard anything lately. 




 Why would you say that?

It's Emily Yahr -- there's a picture of her at the bottom of the article. 




 Ah missed it.  There it is in the final pic on the shelf! 




 HIMYM fan and I missed the reference.  Clarify? 




 Have you ever read the Cetology chapter of Moby Dick?  It struck me that that Melville via Ishmael was amazingly accurate for 1850.  Your thoughts? 




 I'd be so tempted to mess with him by calling him Elijah.   




 TIL Obama's going to Kenya.  

You'd think they'd be thrilled about this.   









 Loved the Wesley Snipes sighting at the end. 




 HUZZAH!!! 









 It happened to me in Xian.  I'd finished the tour of the terra cotta soldiers, stopped to buy an ice cream, and suddenly a pack of cute Chinese stopped me and each had their picture taken with me individually.  

Blue eyes perhaps?   




 I also live in DC.  My favorite is when somebody asks to see THE Smithsonian.  (For anybody who doesn't know, there are dozen or so of them -- Air   Space, American History, etc.) 




 I don't think this is tin-foily at all.  MPD still hasn't said why the people detained with Wint were released.  It's a fair question and one I'd like to know.   




 Preface it with "PSA date time ____ line(s) is/are fucked" and that might be helpful.  

Imminent weather dangers such as derechos might be a good idea, too.   




 UWOTM8?! 




 I once toured the battlefield of Borodino -- Napoleon vs. the Russians and made famous in War and Peace.

Its monuments were pockmarked with bullet holes from when the Nazis later tried to take Moscow.
