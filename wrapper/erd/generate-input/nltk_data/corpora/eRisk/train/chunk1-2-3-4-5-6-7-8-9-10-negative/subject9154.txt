 I will be answering questions for my cat, Fred who wanted to do an AMA.  









 No categories. Top 5 of everything.  









 A family walks into a talent agency. It's a father, mother, son, daughter and dog. The father says to the talent agent, "We have a really amazing act. You should represent us."

The agent says, "Sorry, I don't represent family acts. They're a little too cute."

The mother says, "Sir, if you just see our act, we know you would want to represent us."

The agent says, "OK. OK. I'll take a look."

The father pulls out a watermelon and shoves it in the daughters vagina. The daughter screams in pain from the giant fruit. Then the son takes off his shirt revealing a pink bra and starts fingering himself in the asshole. The mother takes off all of her clothes and starts to finger herself while the father feeds her x-lax pills. The father grabs the daughter and shoves her face right in the mothers butt hole that at that moment exploded with diarrhea all over her face and it filled up her mouth. The the daughter turned to the son and spat the diarrhea all over him. Then the father reaches in the girls vagina and pulls out the now stinky, cum covered watermelon and starts to hump it while the mother begins to shoot her explosive diarrhea in his direction. Then the son begins to rub his cock and cums all over the daughter. Then the father stops humping the watermelon and cums all over her. They continue to cum on her while the mother fills up a plastic kiddie pool with her crap and piss. They all jump in the human excrement and start to fuck each other. Now the pool is filled with cum and shit and piss. 

They jump out of the pool covered in cum and shit and piss and say "tada!".


For the longest time, the agent just sits in silence. Finally, he manages, "That's a hell of an act. What do you call it?"

And the father says, **"The Aristocrats!"**

 I've been in the profession for 3-4 years now. AMA! 




 I noticed this is a movie a lot of people enjoyed. Is there something I'm missing with this movie? It's seem really highly rated but when I watch it there's no endearing quality about it, it's just a cheesy humor, action flick with not so great montages of a kid training while we watch the villain plot. Is this like a homage or satire? 

What am I missing? I feel like there's a joke and I missed it.  







































 So about 6-7 months ago I told my best friend at the time that his behavior was unacceptable when he got drunk: Example: Overly aggressive, violent, angry, mean, physical, arrogant, and insulting when he gets drunk. One night was the icing on the cake for me, and I told him when he was sober how I felt and that I think he might have a problem. Irregardless if he believes that he does, I didn't want to be around him when he drinks anymore because he treats people badly. 

In perfect him fashion, he said he disagrees with everything I said and never wants to talk to me about it again. 

Systematically the few months after that all of my friends stopped talking to me and asking me to hang out. Now i have no friends where I live and it makes me wonder if I had just gone along with it and put up with it maybe I will still have friends. 

None of them have spoken to me at all in the past 4 months.

 This happened many many years ago when I was in 5th grade but I was reminded of it today when I got a hard on. 

I used to think when I was younger that us men got boners because it meant we had to pee and the stiffy meant the penis was full of urine. 

So one day in class during silent reading time, I had an erection and stood up and walked to my teacher and asked if I may go to the bathroom. I was standing there with my pre-pubescent dick with a pitched tent and my teacher gave me the strangest look. I didn't think anything of it, I thought this was normal and all boys walked around like this when having to drain the snake. 

I went and finished my business and my member was flaccid again so I went back in the room and everyone was still looking at me. Later at recess people kept calling me Masturbating Matt and that set the tone for the rest of elementary school and middle school for me until I went to a high school where no one knew me. 

tl;dr thought my shaft getting rigor mortis meant it was time to go to the bathroom.  









 Missing person somewhere in Texas last seen:

My friend Thomas W. has been missing for over a week. He lives in Columbus Ohio and his last known whereabouts were somewhere in Texas where he was doing a job of some sort. He does not do drugs so this is very out of his character. He is also a father and needs to be found. If you know anything at all please PM me for facebook info.

Or if you know how to check hospitals or some type of database. He's never been in trouble or anything, but has been missing and his family is concerned.

 I wanted to take the time to thank Reddit and people on here for coming together to help the people in Nepal this past few days. We created /r/NepalEarthquake   /r/LangtangRelief both awesome subreddits. Watching it unfold has been extremely motivating, seeing people work together tirelessly. 

We got all this info from people in Nepal, someone who is even talking to people in Langtang via SAT phone to see what they need food wise. News articles, local contact, helping one another find lost ones or missing ones with a missing/found google doc database. 

I find it fascinating   motivating how beautifully the internet can be used to resource and connect people so quickly. 

The /r/NepalEarthquake subreddit is really awesome seeing how fast people have compiled a compendium of everything so quickly- with the sole purpose of helping one another. 


It's fascinating to see the results of what happens when people work as a part of a global team.

Thanks for listening to my ramble. I just wanted to say thank you reddit. You're awesome. 

TL;DR - Motivated by Redditors working together to help Nepal Earthquake victims. 









 It's rare. 

**bagpipper-onnen (OP)**: MacFarlane has to be bangin Amanda Seyfriend, he's casting her in everything he does. 

**AckleyKid1990**: Yeah wow he's cast her in two whole movies. That's insane. If that's how it works, Leo Dicaprio and Scorcese must be married with three kids, a poodle, a couple of Prius' and a beach house in Lake Geneva by now.


**theshape26**:Yep, DiCaprio and Scorsese are together. It's a long story. Now, it's never been publicly revealed but from 1973 to 1995, Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro were an item. Unfortunately, Scorsese caught De Niro in bed with Joe Pesci and they broke up. Scorsese stopped casting De Niro   Joe Pesci's career pretty much died. 

Then in 2001, Scorsese ran into DiCaprio at a party and they started talking. They had met in 1993 when Leo was still a teen, at the premiere of This Boy's Life. They were introduced by... Robert De Niro! 

By the way, for those wondering, De Niro and Pesci broke up in 2006 and in 2011, De Niro started an affair with Bradley Cooper. They also knew each other from before when they briefly talked, at The Actor's Studio when De Niro was a guest in 1998.

 I saw a cool ranch Doritos chip laying on the ground near my dinner table, must have been dropped on the ground when I had a snack several hours earlier in the day. I ate it. It tasted like cat urine, because my cat had urinated on it. 

Surprisingly, cat urine tastes a lot like cool ranch Doritos, the aftertaste on my breath at least. My own fault. I knew my cat was looking to get back at me for giving him a bath a week ago, I just didn't know this would be his plan. The feud lives on Brian.  

TL;DR: Ate chip soaked in cat urine.  









 So I have just about finished season one of Twin Peaks. A couple things I would like to ask: 

Among fans of Twin Peaks, is there a running joke about how many times Agent Cooper drinks coffee, or how excited he is every episode when he gets an amazing cup of coffee, minus fish in the one sip he had. 

I can't tell if some of it is bad acting or if it is done purposely, there are some really hilarious lines. I really feel bad for the girl's dad, but ...damn if it wasn't hilarious watching him try to dance to those swing/big band songs that kept coming on. Should I be laughing at that? lol

I have never seen any David Lynch before, so I am new to his creations and style of directing. 

I was told to watch the movie after I am finished with season 2, is this correct? It looks like a prequel though, is it worth watching?



EDIT: Just finished Episode 8 with the cliffhanger of an ending. Wow. Season 1 was marvelous if for nothing else than that wonderful soundtrack of glory. Running theme of the first season: Almost every female relationship the female is being abused somehow. 

I knew I recognized James from somewhere, he was also in A Few Good Men.  



















 
Just watched the first episode of Twin Peaks for the first time, why is this guy (on the right) randomly doing a strange wormy jig off camera in the background? It's so random...made me laugh out loud. Is this show full of random quirks like this?

 I was originally recommended to watch this show because I love the X-Files, I recognize the music will be a bit weird because this came out 25 years ago, but it seems to be rich full of randomness that just makes me giggle and I love it.

 I work a Lowe's and I was chatting with a customer for about twenty minutes about paint mixtures. We had been joking back and forth, and I called her a jerk out of sarcasm/joke. It was clear it was a joke. She says I need to learn how to talk to people because saying things like that is what gets people killed....... 









 I was in my car driving home from Easter Dinner with my mum and a large white spider started crawling across my windshield. I was almost home so I pulled over and put my emergency lights on. 


After this I tried to kill him with my hands but he foiled my attempts at squashing with my clumsy hands and he landed on the passenger side dashboard. I then got a bunch of paper I had laying around in my passenger sit and rolled it up to swat him. 


For whatever reason he survived it and fell on my passenger seat then he scurried away onto the passenger side ground among all the trash I had laying there. 

The worst possible outcome happened. I lost sight of him. He disappeared. I drove home with my car lights on keeping a watchful eye on that side of the car. Then I got home..not sure if I'll ever drive that car again


EDIT: Spider dead. Went down to my car to try and retrieve my cellphone this morning and I saw him crouched against the weather stripping on the driver's side window on the inside. I rolled my window down and he started crawling out on the outside door frame. I threw water on him. He fell to the ground. I stepped on him. I can drive my car now.  









 It was on An Corp, somehow it stopped, was on UOF, now it's on UO:R almost every night...weirdly in the middle of the night which seems dumb because it's not in prime time but...wtf? I don't understand, why can't they just stop. 




 Anyone else see this movie? It has Casey Affleck and Myatt Damon in it. I made my brother watch it and it was the worst 100 minutes of his life so he tells. What do you all think?  




 I just watched Going Clear, I understand it's subjective, but this is one question I have had. 


EDIT: Would like to tag as Serious. 




 In Columbus, Ohio I have found that public toilets have been raised at least 6-10 inches, in several places. I don't know if this is nationwide but what would the rationale for it be? We're not getting any taller on average as American Men.  









 My best friend has a girlfriend who is from another country (one of the Scandinavian countries i dont want to say which dont want to give away their identity or anything).
She got a school visa to come to school here. She graduated from undergrad, then she got her graduate degree as well. She is currently working at a job, but they will not help her stay by saying they absolutely need her or whatever on her immigration forms for a visa. She has an immigration firm that is helping her with the massive application process but she is going to have to move away in 4-5 months and be deported if she does not figure out another way.


They could get married, theyve been dating for a while, but they don't want to do that because it wouldn't be "sincere." I mean they do love each other, but not ready for marriage and yet neither one wants her to go. She wants to stay, he wants her to stay.


I want to be able to help because I hate seeing him sad. I know her place of employment had to fill out a certain section of her application and they refused to which I guess was the only way she could stay?
Any advice?


EDIT: lives in the United States, South Carolina.

 I cried at the scene in 28 days later where Jim finds his parents dead holding a photograph of his younger self. I dunno why, it's just heartbreaking. It's not typically a movie I would cry in like in The Notebook or something.

 I posted this as a comment on Ask Reddit on a question about what is the strangest house rule you have come across in your life. This is mine. Someone suggested I put it in /r/creepy and while I am not sure if it is up to part with some of the other posts I have seen here and I have no pictures...here is Cuddle time. 

When I was ten years old, my friend's family had something called cuddle time. When cuddle time started, my friend, his parents, his autistic brother, and his other younger brother would get into bed naked and cuddle. I'm not joking. Luckily, I didn't have to and I left the house and haven't spoken with him since. Literally I walked out the door and walked to a payphone and called my mom. Creepiest shit I ever witnessed. It irks me to this day.

I mean...the way it started out was just bizarre. Anyone ever seen Clerks 2? The way Randall looks at Elias when he tells the story of pillow pants? That's how I looked at my friend and his family when he told me it was "cuddle time" 

He started taking his clothes off in front of me, like it wasn't a big deal and it was completely normal and I should join them. In their defense, they said I didn't have to. They said it's just something they do for family unity or bonding or some shit. I dunno. I got the fuck out.  



















 Around 6PM today I ate a piece of chocolate. About five minutes later I realized I had to go poop. I went to go poop and it was one of the worst experiences I have had pooping in a long time. I was in there for two hours. 

It felt like having a double edged sword swimming around im my stomach constantly laughing at my plight. The laughing would signify the bubble/stomach groans I often felt in the middle, like my stomach was a goblet of fire. 

To make matters worse I was reading that reddit post that was on the front page a day or so ago asking the question of whether or not a fart can overtake a poop or vice versa in the intestine. I pondered this questions while pooping on my own as I would poop then bubble out some farts, then poop. 

I stood up and was exhausted to the point to where I couldn't stand. I felt 'drunk.' So I laid down. 

Five minutes later I realized I wasnt through pooping. The shear amount of force I put into each strain made me feel like I was just going to shit my colon out. I got through round two seemingly quicker, only about thirty minutes. 

I sat on my bed again. Then realized I still wasn't finished. This time it was mostly urine being forced out but yet a bubble in my stomach caused an avalanche of poop and now red blood to come out. Round three was surely the end? Nope. 

It went on like this for about eight rounds. I went and sat in my chair and watched the movie 42. After it was finished round nine started. 

I've decided not to ever eat again. Obviously, yes, I have Crohn's Disease but this is probably the worst day I've ever had. The most pain. 

I often wonder what would have happened if I didn't eat that piece of chocolate. Maybe my poops would have been spread out over time and not been as painful. I have no idea. 


TIFU by eating a piece of chocolate and then pooped for an entire day.  




 My name is Sean. Pronounced Shawn. It rhymes with Yawn. Not Seen.

 I drove to pickup my chinese food order which I ordered online from my apartment. It's been really snowy lately so it was a bit of a hassle driving there but I finally arrived. 

Hello, pick up?

yeah

name?

Sean

uhhhh, last name?

*******

internet order?

yeah, am I early or something?

oh, Seen.

what?

your name Seen

no, my name Sean

says Seen on ticket

says Sean on ticket

*takes my credit card*

sure its not Seen?

yeah pretty sure

why it spelled like that

ask my parents

(Asian woman in background saying something, probably talking shit)
*little boy laughs and stares at me*

thanks?

ok bye

bye

-end-

I took my food and went out into my car and drove home, which is only a 5-10 minute drive. I realized they forgot my chicken fried rice, so I drove back. When I got there it was very busy in the back behind the counter like lots of people there. The same kid came up to the counter and said,

 "Oh..Seen again"

"No..Sean...again, you forgot chicken fried rice in bag" 

*I handed him my receipt* 

*He looked at everyone in the back which was about 4-6 people and said "we forgot seen rice" and everyone started laughing.*

They handed me some rice and I left, somehow feeling ashamed because I was born with the spelling of my name Sean. A bunch of Chinese food employees at the China Wok made fun of me for it and had a nice laugh over it. 


TIFU by ordering chinese food...and then became insecure about my name...lol

 I FUCKED UP REDDIT. I FUCKING FUCKED UP. THIS IS WHAT I GET. 

FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK. 

A spider came down on his web from my ceiling and ONTO MY FUCKING LAP PILLOW. He landed on the pillow and began crawling across it, I was frozen in place unable to fucking move by this unsettling and surprising move. 

Out of a rush of panic and delirium i used MY FUCKING HANDS to squish him into the pillow. But the pillow isn't a hard surface, there isn't enough surface friction there, I don't know if I killed him because I CANT FIND HIS GUTS OR CORPSE. 

And to make matters worse I think he is a spiderling babe, so THERES PROBABLY MILLIONS OF THEM PLOTTING REVENGE. 

I'm so fucked reddit. I gotta burn my apartment down. MY CAT IS NO FUCKING HELP. FAT CAT ASSHOLE. 

I'm gonna try and find him, but my carpet is brown and my shorts/ and recliner are both black. FUCK. I'll try and update as the situation progresses into the early morning. Not sleeping tonight. 

**UPDATE: Well reddit, I can't find anything. I can't find the spider's remains or his guts or his live body. Save yourself reddit. I'm a goner. I think maybe I will buy a hotel tonight. I'll bring my cat, as lazy and fat as he is, I don't want him to be killed. This is the end, I'm sure of it.**

Update: Still not found. Hard to sleep. Got a hotel with my cat the next two nights and set a bug bomb off in the apartment...

**TL;DR  can't find the spider i did or did not kill, may have to leave all my possessions and move...tonight**

 This was a great forgotten film I feel like. It wasn't the best of movies, but it had some good acting, a solid story, and enough weirdness to say the time was well spent watching this creation. 

So here's the discussion: What other forgotten films do you think are good? (or films no well known by the general movie buff) 




 It's still the strangest movie I've ever seen.

 They were working not 20 minutes ago. When a video ended I went to start another one and VLC crashed immediately. I went to try the last video file that worked but it crashed too. I tried using my other video players but they all crash immediately.  HDC, VLC, Realplayer, itunes, they all crash when i start to play a video file- audio files they play fine. 

I do not know why it started doing that so suddenly. It happened yesterday too, but I ran a malwarebytes scan and got rid of some malware and then it started working again. However, I ran malware again and it found nothing today. So I am confused. 

I have windows 7, 64bit, 8GB Ram 

All my graphics card drivers are up to date. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the video players. Any suggestions?  














 Does anyone think that this lady probably had a bothan husband? The way she conveys the information is so sad and filled with such sorrow. 

I'm willing to bet one of the dead bothans was her lover. 

[Bothans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQeabed9N9M) 



















 I have Windows 7, 64 bit

8GB RAM

I have had VLC for a long time, it's fully updated and the newest version. I began using it a few hours ago to watch a television show .avi file and another was a .mkv file. It worked fine as it has always worked fine.
Then I decided to listen to some music. So I listened to an audio file on the VLC player. When I was finished I went back to the video file and VLC crashed. It kept crashing upon trying to open a video file. It still plays music files .mp3 but not mp4, .avi. or .mkv files. It just crashes immediately.
I tried uninstalling and reinstalling which did not work, as well as resetting all the preferences. Troubleshooted some stuff on youtube/google but couldn't find anything that was like this issue.

In addition, I tried installing older versions to no avail. I also ran a virus scan, but nothing changed.

EDIT: Fixed it. I ran Malwarebytes and it removed some malware and now VLC runs again. Weird. Keeping this thread up in case someone encounters same issues. I had originally run Avast Virus Scanner and it found nothing so I figured it was okay.

   'I've got your permit right here!' And thus began the best movie ever filmed. Kung Fury, a short film, about a cop who becomes Kung Fury, master Kung-Fu martial artist, via lightning/cobra strike. 
He protects the city of Miami from crime with his super awesome one liners and impenetrable forces. This adventure he must hack time with the help of his friend Hackerman to rid the world of Hitler, who wants the pwoer of Kung Fury for himself. 
         
Written   directed by David Sandberg, it was originally a trailer turned into short film. Made with the help of an amazing kickstarting campaign what David Sandberg has accomplished here is nothing short of brilliance in animation   filmmaking. After my first viewing, I thought it would be better if it could be a feature length film. Then I realized, I could just watch the film three times in a row and it would fulfill that need. 

 This film has everything you could ever want from an over the top, cheesy one liner 80's flick. 

1. Laser-Raptors

2. Hitler, the villain

3. Triceracop- Half mancop/Half Triceratop

4. David Hasselhoff singing 80s style music 

5. Cheesy one-liners 

6. Arcade machines with lasers trying to kill people 

7. Thor 

8. Barbarianna   Katana, Viking Age warrior women with machine guns

9. The Nintendo Power Glove hacking time with 80s computers 'breaking' time. 

10. T-Rex Vs Golden Metal Eagle monster fight with small t-rex arms vs small eagle legs. 

11. Anime sequence with cobras as spirit animals.

12.  Amazing action sequence where Kung Fury takes on Hitler's minions. This scene is perhaps one of the greater achievements of the film. It reminded me of playing Mega Man   Sonic where the POV moves horizontally. Simply genius. 

13. Cheesy product placement. 

**14. And finally paying homage to Laser Unicorns with the beginning arcade game being laser unicorns and a laser unicorn seen in the anime sequence when Fury goes to 'heaven'.**



 Every so often a film comes along, once in a lifetime, where it makes you rethink your entire life. This is that film. The greatest film ever made.  I salute this film. And now will go watch it again. 

**Also, watch the film in 144P or the lowest setting on youtube if you can. It's better than HD. HD is good, but to get the full effect, go for the lowest setting in quality.** 













































































































 I have an HP All in one. It is old I got it in 2011. I have used it to play two games in the past: Ultima Online and Dark Age of Camelot. It's always worked fine playing UO, never any overheating problems. I've never had any problems with Dark Age of Camelot until today. I went to re-download the game and play after haven't played for about a year...

When I go to patch the game, which takes some time to patch 3 GBs... my GPU gets up to around 80 degrees and the computer shuts off so I have to wait for it to cool down. I have a fan pointed at my computer to help, but it doesn't help so much. I don't have my computer connected to a TV or anything. 

What could have changed in the past year that my computer would start overheating playing a game I've played for years on this machine? What can I do to ensure it won't overheat without having to buy anything at this juncture? 

My drivers are all up to date. I have ATI Radeon HD 5570

 One of my favorite films growing up. It's not a particularly good film, but it is pretty awesome. It's such a different superhero type movie. 
[Anyone remember this movie?](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099365/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_1) 



















 His Aunt Arctica.

   I watched this movie again today. I figured it would be different than the last I watched it which was when I was 15/16. I liked it a lot then and I loved it even more now. 

  I understand the director has made really terrible films since this starting with The Village; however, Unbreakable is quite amazing. I enjoyed the acting from Samuel L Jackson. I think, besides a few other roles it may have been his best acting job. I liked the cinematography and the music. It gave each character a theme much like superhero films. For Bruce Willis, his character had cool colors always around him, greens   blues. While the supposed supervillain was immersed in purple. I liked that contrast. 

I think what I enjoyed most in the movie was this idea of understanding our place in this world. 

I liked watching it in contrast with the influx of all the comic book movies that are popular right now. This is so different from them, even more different than Nolan's Batman films. His Batman's films attempted a sense of more realism I think, but this film captures it ...differently, much more dramatic less action. 

What are some movies similar to this? I can't think of any. It's unique.  




























































































































 Why couldn't they beam Spock/Khan back to the Enterprise while they are fighting? Chekov says it is become he can't get a lock because they are moving. But..in Star Trek (2009), he beams Kirk and Sulu back on board when they are falling without a parachute. So they were moving a lot faster/worse then, why can't he simply do the same this time when all they are doing is fighting?

Also...wasn't Kirk dead too long for them to save him. I mean, he was dead for what 30 minutes? That's...I don't understand this. So..Khan's blood can effectively raise the dead? Why don't they just harvest his blood? 




 I've seen 1, 2 and 3. I enjoyed 1 actually because it was more in space n shit. I liked Wrath of Khan a lot and the search for spock was interesting to say the least but wasn't really as good as 2, but it was better than 1. 

I read the synopsis for 4..and ..humpback whales? It just seems kind of strange. So out of 4, 5, and 6 which one is seen as next best from 2? 









 I heard some stuff about insurance money 10 million dollars not to play golf ever again. But that was over a year ago. He was a solid golfer, I loved watching him play.  





























 What order should I read middle earth books in? 

I have read The Hobbit   Lord of the Rings. 

Here's what other books I have. 

Children of Hurin, Lost Tales Part 1, Lost Tales Part 2, The Silmarillion,   The Lays of Belariand

 Oh. lol. I'm USA. It says Hawt. Why does it have to say Hawt. ugh. hipsters 




 Do you wanna add me? NNID spkeck805 




 Oh wow it changes to "On-fire"  




 Yeah I found it . it's nice.  




 whats that ? Can you buy it regularly or do you need to do a challenge or something?
 




 Yeah, it's possible she's never worked with special ed kids before and therefore doesn't understand not to put a student in a trash can. 

can confirm: am educator 




 I don't do good with the sniper weapons so I stay away from them. I do like the dynamo roller but its sooo slow lol 




 Yeah the aerospray is nasty. I've only lost two or three times with it in turf wars today. though in ranked, i dont do as well 




 411,038 




 Inkbrush. Yuck. Not a fan. Glad it worked for someone though!  




 I got mine to 14.0 (So Hawt) The Aerospray gun really is awesome for points.

 411,036 




 That's the thing. I didn't know what an amiibo was. I didn't know it was an actual physical toy thing you buy in a box and then scan on your gamepad. I bought this game through wii u virtual so I didn't buy the game physically or anything. So I was unaware you had to physically buy something to complete the 'extra' challenges. 

Edit: why was this down voted?  




 I want hot dog-o


Edit: Bonus points if you know what movie this is from 




 You did yell about that joke. Relevant username. 




 The final boss was hard enough I dunno how I would beat him with a roller lol 




 Wow. I didn't know Splatoon was so popular. I guess Splatoon really helped the Wii U come into prominence again lol.  




 No I just saw people in game with these awesome outfits and stuff and wanted them for myself. So I though..maybe I have to beat single player. So I beat single player and got the sweet aerospray gold weapon which upped my scores in turf war considerably about by 6-700 a round I was getting about 1100 on avg now im getting around 1600 with that thing, and then the Gold Roller

But I want that head that DJ Octavio is wearing and I read online you have to do the amiibo challenges, so I looked how to actually do the challenges but it doesnt say anywhere online. It just says there are challenges so I was confused. 

So I have to buy a physical toy and scan the box.  




 No. I do not. I was unaware you had to do that.  




 Ohhh...so you have to go a store and buy an amiibo? Does Best Buy have them?  




 No I am not joking.  I don't know what you mean by lack of stock joke . I didnt' know you had to actually go out somewhere and buy it in real life.  




 I defeated Hero Mode (single player) on Splatoon for the first time, all 27 levels and the main boss. Now I want to get that samurai hat and I know you get it from one of the challenges, but how do I 'buy' the amiibo inklings to do the challenges? Where do I go?  




 You're fired bud. I'm sorry.

 I lost 15 straight at one point. It was just pathetic. I tried everything, but my teammates kept going over to their side to try to kill them when they respawned....which wasn't working so it left me and one other teammate to try and get the splatzone which doesnt work when its 3 on 2 or 3 on 1. 

If you're the type of player that goes over to the enemy side during splatzone please stop. Every time you do we end up losing to the Japanese players and their god damn sniping machines.  




 I feel like this would be harder to produce than regular voice acting.  




 I need some friends. My name is is spkeck805 NNID. And my nickname is "American" ....lol because I play with Japanese all the time I figured I'd let them know I'm not Japanese. haha. 

Will some people add me?  




 Is there a way to be on your friend's team instead of it randomly placing you against your friend or on their team?

 Well the problem is I don't have this issue with ZombiU or any other game on Wii U 




 It just seems kind of crappy that we lost team points in ranked when someone DCs. You can't win a 3v4, I've never seen it. It's very rare. 

It's about 4 out of 10 games this happens.

It's only with Splatoon I have this issue.

 Does anyone have constant problem with connection? My connection is fine, it works great and I never have any problems but about 35-40% of my matches someone always has a disconnect problem and it starts us with 3 people so it's 3v4 and then we lose terribly. Or it happens to the other team, same thing with ranked games. 

Wondering if anyone else has problems in games like this. 

Do you think they will at some point fix it so when someone disconnects your team won't be penalized?

 This is why you need official anal beads. They have a string.  




 there is no dom/sub in our relationship we are vers 




  It clearly means that they are intolerant to "ANY" opinion that is different then their own.

No it doesn't.  




 That's certainly one way to interpret that definition.  




 It doesn't have to be all. They do fit the description. Those are actions, things that are intolerant. You can disagree and that's fine for you to have that opinion, but I do not agree with it. 

I never said someone that is racist is intolerant to all different opinions.  




 no. you can unlock everything in a week basically. Even the stuff on single player  "hero mode." 

It's a great game except there's only two types of games to play. Splat zone- ranked or turf war. That's it. You can't do turf war on ranked, and you can only play with friends on regular games and you may not be on their team because it is randomized. 

They have a wide variety of weapons and armor/clothing to wear, but only 8-9 maps and you can only play 2 every 4-8 hours until they change them. Every time you open the game the splat sisters talk and you have to scroll through their repetitive talking every time they change courses, which is fine a couple days- then it gets annoying and you can't skip it. 

The upsides are that it is seemingly a fun game. However, they are 4v4 matches so if someone loses internet and it's 3 v 4 you will assuredly get your butt kicked.  




 Nope. But I find this satire poking fun at the week's events to be amusing.  




 it's a joke. stop trying to analyze it.

 I usually only call someone a bigot when they refer to black people as dirty n-word, say gay marriage is the same as pedophilia, or says "President N-Word" - This is what I imagine is a bigot.

 I can't speak for someone I do not know. Mirroring your behavior is a common counseling technique though, such as what you say, we call it re-framing or summarizing. Might be different than what you are describing. 

I can't speak for a counselor who I do not know but if you felt like she was coming on to you, then I am sorry. That should not happen in our profession. It's in our ethical codes and standards that we not have dual relationships like that. It's harmful to the client. And most importantly our job is to advocate for our client. So I can see how that experience may have not helped you any. Not all counselors are like that, if she was indeed doing that, again I can't speak for a situation I had no part in. 

I can't speak to her mannerisms or the way she counsels, maybe that's just the things she does? With her hair, lip licking, mirroring, necklace touching...I really don't know. 

It's not unheard of for a counselor to check up on a client once they have terminated their sessions. She could have generally been concerned, again I do not know. 

I always tell clients that they can tell me anything, so if they had an attraction to me and told me. I would thank them for telling me, I would go over the part in the ethical standards with them and then I would refer them to another counselor. At that point, the relationship would have been damaged. It really depends how severe it was. But it would make the relationship a bit awkward. It's not a rejection so much as doing the right thing for them. There are some situations where an attraction cannot be avoided like for a school counselor if they have a student who is attracted to them. They can't refer them to someone else. So it has to be maintained appropriately. But those are younger kids who are malleable and easier to work with I think. 

Likewise, I also see a therapist and if I were attracted to her, I couldn't see her.

 It's not limited to only school aged children. It is a repeated behavior though. 

Let me ask another question. Why are you the authority on who deserves to be bullied?  




 Do you know what bullying is? 




 I didn't have an awful home life but I did take a good amount of abuse (physical and emotional) from my parents when I was younger.

This statement makes no sense. "I did not have an awful home life, but was emotionally and physically abused" 

You understand why these statements are contradictory right?

Also, 

1. Where did you stay in Cali? 

2. How old are you now? 

3. How did you get the money to get there?  




 Have you eve bullied someone?  




 You aren't meant to enter the water so it doesn't hurt. It's not going to feel well.

 Don't say no sex. Just have sex once in a while and string the relationship along until he loves you then say "sorry im straight"  




 Actually you didn't say anything wrong. I mean- that was big news this weekend, even if he wasn't gay, it's still big news. I mean...everyone knew about it.  









 I just bwiojerved and once I've done that I'm all good.  




 Well I explained in my first comment. But I can explain again. 

A daughter will watch her mother and how her mother is treated by guys and how she deals with the situation. She will watch how her mother, and in this case, how her mother deals with her brother and then she treats situations with men similarly. So let's say she doesn't call the police and just doesn't want her brother to get into trouble because of this- even though it is very serious stuff. If she has a child- that type of behavior/attitude will be passed down her child and so forth. It's learned behavior. You think it's normal because that's what you've seen from your parent(s) your whole life so it becomes your norm. 

At some point, you have to break the trend. 

But she deleted her account so I'm guessing it was fake. lol 




 Social worker, substance abuse or detox center intake specialist, community development jobs, work at a battered women's shelter, college admissions worker, probation officer, depending on your state you can teach high school as long as you take a teacher cert exam- very easy, you can be a substitute teacher. And you don't have to teach sociology- you can teach history, poly sci, or other social sciences at a high school level, public relations at a business, Human Resources at a business, senior or youth service centers. 

Lots of things you can do. And there are many resources to help you find those jobs as well.  




 That's why typically a daughter will act like her mother did in that situation 




 You can do lots of stuff with a Bachelor's in Sociology. But yes, eventually you would go to grad school.

 I did but I like to be polite.  




 Thank you!  




 Talking about killing people, raping, all that stuff is not good. It's unhealthy to be around it and it eventually will infect your life. It will infect how you deal with other people who mistreat you

 Hijacking top comment. 

I just found this post. You need to call the police and file a report on your brother. This will only continue to get worse for you if you do not. It will become a cycle. Where things may get better then get worse until it blows over, then get better, get worse...etc 

You may not be able to see this now. But accepting his behavior without calling th e police or enforcing consequences for his actions/words will affect your relationship with men for the rest of your life. 

It's important to do what you can to get away from him, not just for your sake but like the comment here, to help other people and other women in his life in the future.

" I mean, I dont want to get him to get in that big of trouble. "  He needs to get in big trouble. I know he's family but this behavior cannot be encouraged.

 ....was there water at the bottom?  




 He's married.... 




 this gif is from a video in norway it's called ["Dodsing" or death diving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p4oeO-rZ04)  




 I got a [screen shot](http://imgur.com/P9476Bp.jpg) of that alien frame flash we got who was disguised as Tom Mason's wife. Looks kind of freaky, almost like a poltergeist lol.  




 she is awesome 




 Dirty Work. 

Note to self: Sam looked. 

Hey look...hot aliens...better have sex with each other 









 If you look hard enough she's not smiling. It's more of an evil frown with a dash of psychosis.  




 415,625 




 Yeah, well she's a good actress though. But...the writing for her has been awful the past couple seasons. 

I have to watch Season 5, because I'm invested in knowing what happens. But the whole Lexi shit, was awful 




 yeah brown note. forgot the official name. thanks  




 I thought so. And it actually was in the shower this time.  




 Who Frenched her brother 




 Dear Falling Skies,


I have been a fan of your show since the first season. I have been most disappointed with this season and yet I will continue to watch the show because now I am unfortunately invested in it.
A couple things. I get that the alien's name is Cochise, but when Tom Mason says it it sounds like goat cheese or coat cheese. As a result it has become increasingly annoying to me that every time Tom Mason talks about goat cheese or to goat cheese he says his name. I saw in last weeks episode they said "goat cheese" about 15-20 times in the show. It's annoying and is really ruining the experience with the show.


Secondly, please kill the Lexi storyline it's awful. This whole season has been so fragmented like you had an idea then abandoned it and changed your mind. It's been strange. Also Moon Bloodgood's character has been written has increasingly annoying. She is a good actress don't waste her talent on such trivial lines that make her sound so whiney. Please.


Lastly, stop saying goat cheese's name so much. Please. It's not necessary. I know who he is! Or perhaps you wouldn't have had to do that if you didn't make the alien's from each race all look like each other. Humans all look different. Logically from an evolutionary standpoint it would make sense that other alien races would not all look identical. Some wouldn't even be the same height. This is a common theme in film and television with aliens and sadly you have not learned from their mistakes on this issue.


If you have not listened to anything I have suggested please listen to only this: Stop saying "goat cheese" so much. Seriously quit. It ruined last week's episode.

 Well. I DCed once. I am in the middle of inking and then I see the ink come out of the gun but it doesn't render on the ground. Then I got DCed. I don't know why I would DC though, my internet is fine. 

It's just frustrating, I want to a play a full game without someone quitting, or randomly being DCed. 

You think they will ever do a free for all? 1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1?? 




 Well, why don't they just make it so it doesn't have to be random every time? lol That way I could play with my friend. And not be against him. 

Okay. I give up. I love this game. But that is the 5th time in 9 games someone has DCed. I also got DCed twice, and I've checked my ISP, I have very fast internet and the only thing I'm using it for is this game.  




 Bah. Thanks. I didn't know if it was just me or not. 

Out of curiosity, this is unrelated, do you think we'll get more than two game options? Or they will put turf wars in ranked too? Or allow you to play with friends in ranked?

 Okay somine was set at around 8100 MB. My recommended was 12226 MB. So I changed it to 12226MB. I don't see how thatll make much of a diff though if it was set at 8GB 




 Oh I have 8GB of RAM. and 920GB of C drive 




 didnt help 




 When I set the resolutions higher i got that error message though 




 1920X 1080  but i never use this because it messes up trying to watch movies since it duplicates over to my tv screen. My TV is basically my monitor. 

When the resolution was high in the game I got the bad text. When I brought it down to 800X600 the text was fine and better.  




 Well my monitor is connected to my 55inch 4k TV. I have an HP all in one 23inch monitor for my computer. 

I changed the resolution to 800X600 and everything seems fine now. 

I looked at screen resolution on the background of my desktop and it says 1024 by 768 so should i do that for the game too?  




 Edit; So I went to full screen which fixed the text issues you see in the picture. However he game won't run full screen. I keep getting [this error message](http://imgur.com/7pfovpp)

I went back to windowed mode but still getting the same error message and can't play the game now.  




 Also, I am a noob and have never played before. Well I played for like a few hours a year ago and got to lvl . Can't remember how to fix any of this. 

Edit; So I went to full screen which fixed the text issues you see in the picture. However he game won't run full screen. I keep getting [this error message](http://imgur.com/7pfovpp)

 Well that's crap. I want a choice.  




 DUDE! I just saw you in another thread. You were late to that shit too!! 




 says the massive cock.  




 Pls OP  




 IO 




 agreed. it's fun. I like the strategy  




 ....starting right mrow 




 So much fun!! I like it better than splatzones. I wish though we could choose between the two. I wonder why we can't? 

This sniper was up on one of the pillars at Kelp Dome picking us off so, lol, I just went the long way around snuck up from behind and BAM. It's fun surprising people, it's why I like the Ink Mines. I always like running up to people and plopping it down for a suicide kill.  




 its problematic.  




 For a minute that it said Australia. ....was thinking that's not right 




 You sound horny 




 Cocking for three 




 Cocking for three 




 I hope so! 




 Yeah, I get the logic. That's absolutely correct. However... 

I had 10 comm errors 4v3 matches out of 20 at one point. That's crazy. 

Also, cats were outnumbered and we still won the battles.  




 You fuckbitch popnutter.  




 I dunno got to be millions by now.  




 very okay.  




 Well. damn. that was a waste of time.  




 So the answer is no, there is nothing else I can do with them besides reroll abilities 

Edit: Why am I being down voted? I just think super sea snails should at least get you something you can't get with regular gold you make during matches.  




 I actually was hoping he would answer the question of what this graph is and means instead of making a debate about inferences in comments.  




 I don't really care about the individual level though or the fallacy in this data, I want to know what it is saying.  




 I got 18 of them. What do I do with them? I already have all my clothes with three slots each, and I've already bought all clothes available and I have about 500K gold. What else can I use the super sea snails for? Can I buy something with them that I can't get with regular gold?  Or are they pretty much useless for me? 




 I dunno what you're doing then lol.  




 K a couple things I do. 

1. I don't follow my teammates. 

2. I get the edges my teammates miss and then I splat the large areas and try to avoid enemies. 

3. I can't stress this enough, but I go away from my teammates we aren't trying to cover the same ground, if they follow me I go somewhere else..QUICK 




 Cats were outnumbered and we still won the battles! 




 it felt good to win! Good job fellow felines!!  




 sure Aero RG. splat as much ground as u can and use your Nuke often. Kelp Dome is a mine field. I don't really worry so much with killing people as I do splatting ground.  




 no. i play ranked. but not often. i find i get paid more from regular, in ranked you have the possibility of getting nothing if you lose. but with regular you get paid gold every single time depending on how much you splat. and with the aero gun i can get 1700-2200 a round.  




 Yes, I did. You know how easy it is to get 1 million gold? It takes me a day of playing to get 500k gold. 

Super Sea Snails are worthless. If you have gold you don't need them.  




 I sure did.  




 Yeah.  




 Age 15  

"Revert completed"  




 Hmm sounds like Blankman  




 I hate it I'll be covering ground on one end at the very beginning and this guy is behind me on his roller going over what I already splatted.  




 I'm not a vegan. That's why I give my cat whatever the fuck he wants.  




 Munchkin cat*  




 this little light of mine.  




 Baby Blue   Purple People Eater  




 Nope. we arent.  




 I'm a cat and I lost 10 in a row earlier. (I had 5 teams with only 3 players, one team with two players, and the other four we lost by 5-10 percentage points- close matches)  I tend to lose when I have a sniper on my team they only get like 2-300 points a round unfortunately.  




 I like coming up with nicknames for the colors used. 

My first one was Pepto Pink. (Like Pepto Bismol) 

What else you got inklings? 

Stay fresh!! 




 Yeah it's a shame we don't get some Pepto pink in there.  




 very straight 




 Very minor....now I KNOW...you can think of word that better explains a small amount than very minor.  




 Not really. I've played in 10 games with just 3 teammates.  




 Dad aint got shit on me.  




 Fiscal 




 U fuck!ng wh4t m8? ou little !tch. 'll have you know I topped my [N4VY] SEAL class, and 1v1'd all of them with 360F twiksh0t3s. 




 I typically leave if there a teammate who follows me.  




 You're not alone I had 6 




 I did. Yes.  




 Yeah hopefully they debut the two new ones.  




 I am just B- in Ranked. I don't play ranked too often because i don't like splat zones, waiting to see how tower is. I use the aero gun and get about 1700-1900 a round in turf war. And I played for like 10 hours once on a binge so I got A LOT of gold. I bought all the clothes. Don't know what else to do other than buy an amiibo to do those challenges. It's fairly easy to get lots of gold quick. There's nothing to spend it on so it keeps saving.  




 I looked on their [wiki or website](http://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Splatfest#Reward_Tiers). It says 12 Snails for King/Queen 8 i think for Champion. You don't get anything else. All you get is re-roll abilities or extra slot to get to 4 slots. 

Stages
"As well as existing stages, the first North American Splatfest may feature currently unreleased stages.[5]:

Moray Towers
Camp Triggerfish" 




 I like Kelp Dome. The others I'm pretty tired of. Night is meh 




 Nah you're not. I got to Cat King in 3 hours and now there's nothing to do. Maybe if there was a gauge or something who said who was in the lead Team Cat or Team Dog, it would be fun to still play and want to win, but now that I am maxed out it's just like regular turf war at lvl 20. 

12 Sea Snails is cool but what am I gonna do with them? I already have 500K gold, it's not like I need to talk to Spyke for anything.  




 Phase 1: Collect Underpants 

Phase 2: 

Phase 3: Profit 




 I'm now Cat King. .....now what lol 




 No.  




 you know from experience do ya? 




 Victoria Taylor was let go 




 we are all bots except you 









 Great. What is his proof besides "someone close to reddit?" Sorry man but you see lots of that stuff. It's all speculation. 

We don't deserve to know because it's not professional for a business to disclose why they fired an employee. It doesn't matter that we use the site and generate posts or not. That is irrelevant in the firing of an employee for a business. It sucks she got let go, was a big mistake by Reddit. But it is not our business to know why she was let go, it is our business on what they are doing to rectify the situation and their mistakes.  




 I can give you the tools you need to get that one.  




 Bananas are laughable.

Yeah, it's a shame the mods turned the community private, but so it goes.


It's not a shame some mods turned the community private. The shame isn't on the mods, it's on you guys. The responses you're giving back to people aren't positive it's just the same old BS. The firing of Victoria is not our business- I get that- we have no business to know why- just so you know, she was good at what she did and you will not find someone as good as her. 

I've been on reddit a while on this username and my others, but this has made me question quitting reddit. 

Again, it's not a shame the mods stood with solidarity over being treated poorly. Reading your official response, it's just so smug and arrogant. It's like you think you can easily appease people with that crap

 "His use of "wut" was obviously ironic." -- Nah, giving too much credit for dudebro language. Of course people know how to spell 'what.' That doesn't stop them from using 'wut.' 

I like redundancy. So I use it often.  




 You said "wut" Don't lecture me on proper grammar.  




 Yes I realized it after I looked at the context. Honestly didn't look at the usernames. So I changed it. I was confused by "wut."

 Makes sense to me. Sniper weapons don't ink as much. I don't think they are good for Turf War format. Honestly, anytime I have a teammate with one I just disconnect. I played for a long time and it's just horrible They go like 2-12 with 2-400Pts. Very little ink. They just sit in one spot and try and snipe people. Even if they move around inking they don't ink a lot. 

So like I said, I understand your opinion. That's cool. I got no problem with differing opinions. I just disagree.

 Oh okay. I disagree.  




 I didn't play Rock/Pop  




 Oh. I thought cats won the battle? 51-49 




 420,582 




 For me I have a few things. 

1. Being able to change weapons while you wait for the game to start instead of going to the lobby. 

2. I get annoyed at teammates that use the sniper guns for Turf Wars, they don't splat a lot of ground which is evident by their points, and they don't even get a lot of kills to make up for it. It's a good gun but not for that game type I don't think. 

3. Not having Turf Wars be on ranked as well. 

4. Being forced to play splatzone or tower control instead of being able to have the choice to play one. I don't want to have to wait 4 hours to play tower control. 

5. More maps in rotation than just 2. 

6. Teammates that super jump to your area when you're in the middle of mayhem and they die instantly by the enemy just pointing their gun at the circle where they're jumping. 

 




 This thread is dedicated to everything in Splatoon you wish could be different or changed- including strategies with teammates, or generally any time you feel annoyed. 

This is just discussion so people can let out some frustrations- not intended to be mean towards the game- I love Splatoon.  




 Unless of course no one is on the tower for an extended amount of time in which case the tower moves with no one on it back to its original starting position.  




 How did people get 24 Super Sea Snails? I thought it was just 18 for King/Queen 




 Sometimes you wanna switch weapons because you're tired of playing with the one and you like to switch it up. It's nice to be able to do this while waiting for a game instead of having to get out of the lobby and playing with either a different group of people entirely or having to wait to play with friends. It's pretty dumb

 We both were traitors. So we cancelled each other out.  




 this has been the most difficult game to get started out of dark age of Camelot, and ultima online.  




 Rachel Dolozal here, part Native American...so Native American. Can confirm.  




 So my friend and I were on Skype and decided to play some Splatoon. Now whenever we do 'friends' we are only on the same team maybe 10% of the time- dunno why. So today we were against each other 19/24 games (I kept track). We were at the Saltrig so we went to one particular spot stopped and saw each other and just splatted in front of each other the entire game hahaha. 

It was so much fun. We gave away our teammates locations to each other if they were jumping in. If my teammates jumped in I would run block if they tried to kill him and he did vice versa. 

It was a nice change up and a fun way to do something different. I'm pretty sure the 6 people playing with us hated us, but I don't think they ever figured it out. We get about 1800 each just splatting in front of each other over and over.  




  Ok.

 Hi. Thank you for your response. As a user and a mod of a very small subreddit I want to say thank you for your candor and apology.  

I have a question for you. I am not trying to be mean or insulting or anything; however, can you please step down from Reddit? The majority of us do not want you running Reddit. Can you please step down? This is something that would be considered a great action on your part. This is a way to back up your promises. This is a good solution I think. I know you mean well, but you're just not working out well for us. You've had many chances to correct things and you have not. As a result can you please leave? 

The way your team handled this situation with mods and the firing of Victoria and everything the past year or so, is reason enough for you to step down. What has been done on here by your team cannot be made up with a simple 'text' based apology.  




 Yes that is correct. But every vote is not equal. Not every vote is a voice that is heard.  




  Ok.

 




 No it's not. That is the idea that every vote is equal. Every vote is not equal.  




 Well what I'm saying is, Victoria did a great job at what she did, why not find someone with those same qualities and things she did so good at- and have that be the job requirement? /r/IAMA mods specifically stated how well she worked with them and how pleased they were with what she did. So...why can't we get someone else exactly like that  




 Why don't you guys just get another Victoria, it worked pretty well the way she did things with /r/IAMA why not just find someone exactly like that? 

Also, does Pao plan to respond to the petition for her to be fired reaching 150K people? This is a reasonably large deal, it's not like it's just a few people that 'hate' her anymore.  




 Same demeanor as Magikarp too 




  Ok.

 




 It is self-serving. Collectively many votes are heard- but alone it's not heard except by the person who votes.  




  Ok.

 




  Ok.

 




 Ok.  




 No.  




 It's easy. I don't believe you will remember this. So I disagree. That's I even disagree.  




 I disagree.

 Why did you threaten instead of actually doing it? He/she won't learn anything from being threatened.  




 How about if it doesn't. You have to drink a shotglass full of Ranch Dressing mixed with Ketchup, mustard, mayo, cool whip, relish, and grape jelly?

 I'll eat two boxer shorts if Star Wars breaks 2.7 Billion Avatar's record.  




 What's half-life ? 




 I did. The issue was resolution.  




 So the bet is if Star Wars makes Over 2 Billion dollars Worldwide- total sales in theater, I will eat my boxer shorts.  




 Yes I know, the wiki article I posted explains that.  




 You don't go by ticket sales though. You go buy money made. boxofficemojo.com all time list accounts for inflation.  




 What exactly is Half-Life 3? 




 It won't obliterate Avatar. If Star Wars makes over 2 Billion world wide then I will eat my own boxer shorts.  









 I hate foods with diaries too. It's like, why would they write about their lives. What do foods have to write about!?!? 




 That silly game is politics. Politics is a game. Lots of people vote for who they want- and their voice is not heard.  




 Maybe. There's no real way to know that for sure. He has a shot in the democratic primary. It will either be Hillary or him. 

Look, in 2008, I worked on Obama's primary team and no one thought we had a shot over the Clinton machine either....but we won. You can win an election with a very good ground game. 

A lot of people assume that candidates win- with how they make sense of what issues people find important. The truth is, in the ground game for campaigns, rarely do you ever talk about issues. It's all about numbers. They say you gain a vote every 3 houses you talk to people. So we knocked on insane amounts of houses. To do that, obviously you have to have a substantial amount of dedicated volunteers and also you need to have a good program to use to print up all of the people who voted which way and what way in the previous primaries and a good software system to input all of the data. 

When we won the primary and I worked on the 2008 general election one thing I noticed versus John McCain was he had less volunteers on the ground and they wasted time when they went door to door. (this is just in the area I worked in Ohio). They would argue with someone to vote for McCain at their house for a good 20 minutes. If someone tells you "I'm voting for the opponent no matter what" You don't spend 20 minutes trying to convince him you move on. In those twenty minutes, you can hit 5-6 more houses. It's just a waste of a time to argue. Rarely did I ever speak about the issues with people because I didn't want to waste time- only if I thought was it worth it and I always explained why I was voting for him and for people to make up their own mind. In addition, in my area the McCain volunteers were at odds with the Republican Party volunteers (for local elections- republican party wanted to take many mccain volunteers and use them for local campaigns...) Also, they didn't work on Sundays where I was at. Which is fine- I get the reasoning behind that but while they weren't working we worked 24-7. 

Sanders has a good following if he can turn that into thousands of volunteers working for him- he has a shot. Primaries are state by state- it's certainly doable. If he picks up momentum watch out

Republicans have a good shot to win 2016 as well- if they pick a solid candidate. Romney wasn't good and while McCain was a solid candidate his VP hurt him. I think- it would help them if they changed their platform on marriage equality. that likely wont happen though 




 It is a throw away vote, it will make ya feel good, but you won't win.  




 Because he would lose. If you don't run in the big two- you lose. If he runs as a independent in the gen election he would lose, and then probably take down the democrats with him.  




 It's an interesting process. They do lie for votes because people won't vote for them in primaries if they are too moderate. Then come general election a lot of people have to go more 'middle' so opinions change.  




 Nah. It doesnt.  




 That makes no sense.

 I can't. I've tried. Website doesn't work I've been trying for a few weeks now at least once a day. I'm not interesting in reading about people talking shit and saying things they wouldn't say in person. It just doesn't do anything for me.
And if I want porn i just go to xnxx.com or /r/riskyclicks, or some other porn subreddit. But I don't have a need to talk shit about fat people, LGBT, or anything else. It just isn't something that I care to do even though I know I'm anonymous.  




 I do smoke pot for my Crohn's. High in CBD is best. 

I don't care what the entire thread was about you commented on free speech being denied because reddit banned some fucking subreddit that hates on fat people (so fucking what...get over it)- it's not. It's like you haven't even read the 1st amendment.  




 No, I hardly eat- I have Crohn's Disease incredibly hard to gain weight with all the blood and shit that comes out of my ass. Reddit banning a subreddit shaming fat people does not deny you free speech. 

Free speech only means congress will not make a law denying you the ability to say what you want. Free speech doesn't mean Reddit, a website, can't ban a subreddit if it wants to- if the guy who made it or whoever runs it wants to do it- they can. It's not much different than a mod banning someone for saying shit either. 

The only guarantee you have with free speech (with the exception of libel) is that you won't be prosecuted for what you say- it doesn't mean you won't get fired from a job, have a website ban you...etc 

  




 No sorry it's my fault I meant to reply to /u/AllRubyx 




 ? What law did congress make that denied you free speech?  




 You're allowed to do whatever you want. I'm just curious why it would be better than reddit.  




 I thought it was the best part of the movie.  




 Your free speech isn't lost. Free speech only means the government won't make a law limiting what you say (with the exception of libel, or words that present clear danger). So...you can still say whatever you want- but that doesn't mean it won't get you banned on a website for it. 

Why should I care if Reddit bans a subreddit about hating fat people? My freedom isn't being taken away. That doesn't bother me. Good for them. This is there website- they made it- they can do whatever they fuck they want with it. 

If you don't like that- why don't you just make your own the way you want it? That seems like a good solution. You can find ANYTHING on the internet. My freedom of speech isn't being limited. It never have. Just because this person disagrees with you doesn't make them ignorant nor myself and it doesn't make me shortsighted. 

You are foreseeing a trickle down where "banning subreddits against fat people...well shit...next i won't be allowed to 'fag' or 'fuck' on this website and anywhere on the internet...my life is doomed!!" 

I think you're overreacting a bit and foreseeing a future that will not happen.  




 why would it be better than reddit?

 Nah. Don't agree at all.  




 Well this match wasn't particularly as close as 6-4, 6-4. A lot of tennis players have the skill to beat Serena- but they don't. It's not just beating her- it's consistently beating her. I don't think anyone but Venus can say that.  




 I don't disagree Graf had amazing skills, but not any better than Serena's skill. Yes she won 22 slams before she turned 30, but did she win any when she was over 30? No. I think that's impressive when you consider at what age most women retire in tennis. It's even more impressive when you consider her dominance at her age. It's not like she just won one or two close ones after she turned 30, she pretty much revamped her career.  




 Yeah you are. There wasn't anyone like Serena in the past. She is unique.  




 Yeah, Court has 24 grand slams, but pro's weren't allowed to play in grand slams for a time- so i don't think you can consider hers as the number to reach. 22 is the number.  




 Strings? She's in the conversation of being the greatest collection of loops we've ever abstractly looped.

You mean for disorderly intoxication? He pulled a fire alarm. That's why the officer's arrived at the scene, his wife was too drunk to be left alone so they took her until she sobered up and could care for herself. I live in SWFL and all they did was put him in the drunk tank until he was sober which is just 8 hours. He wasn't charged. They took him for disorderly intoxication- that's pretty normal down here in SWFL since we get so many tourists. There's nothing wrong with that. Had they not pulled the fire alarm for no reason the cops wouldn't have came at all. By the way, you can get in trouble for pulling a false alarm too.

I once created a rap song. A couple years ago (mind you I can't keep a beat and I certainly can't write). I had this ex girlfriend who had OCD of her feet being touched. Whenever someone touched it, she had the touch the other foot exactly the same then clean them off as they were 'dirty'. For example, if you splashed on foot with water she had to splash the other. So my friend (a drummer) made a beat and I wrote some weird lyrics and we made a weird music video for it.

 No there is not because the actor(s) don't appear in the film so that is the reason basically. A lot of people wanted scarlette johannsen nominated for "Her" but she wasnt in the film. 




 No dude. It is not. It is YOUR OPINION. You have already lost because you think an opinion is fact. I know the definition of a fact. What you have stated is not a fact. It is your opinion. Trying to give your opinion weight by calling it a fact is disingenuous  




 That's not a fact. That is your opinion that it can. It is not FACT. 

Opinions can be supported by facts- but what you have said is not a FACT, it is an OPINION. A fact would be listing statistics (ex: The results of the statistics are...) - the opinion would be the interpretation from those statistics which is "Age disparity can create a power imbalance" The key word being "can" 

You can keep calling it a fact all you want but it is simply your opinion. Calling it a fact doesn't add any more weight to your sentence. I'm not saying I disagree with your opinion, I agree with it kind of, but it isn't a fact. An opinion is defined as indicating a belief, view, sentiment, conception, which is what you are doing. 


It's a common problem people do when they are taking to give more weight to their opinions they say "The fact of the matter is..." or "The fact of..."  They are trying to give more weight to their opinion by stating it as fact- it's not though. It's just an opinion. It's an expression in the English language and a bad habit as it misinforms people to believe the follow statement is fact rather than the opinion that it is. 

Now before you argue further, I have a degree in English. I taught literacy and I most certainly know the difference between fact   opinion- but what you have said is not a FACT. 

I'm not disagreeing with the content of what you said, it just bothers me when people say something is a fact when it's just their opinion. Kind of like how some people get bothered when someone misspells their, they're, and there.

 Ugh WoW. I have such bad memories of wow. It reminds me of this time I was dating this girl, we'll call her wolverine since she liked to scratch my backs while fucking until my back was bleeding. I didn't mind, but it hurt when I showered. 

Anyway, her roommate, we'll call her Cynthia, was dating this guy named Steve who liked to play WoW a lot. No problem there, I played UO and Dark Age of Camelot, I like MMORPGS, we even all used to play Munchkin card game together- lots of fun. 

Anyway, The issues I have with WoW are that Steve, when we were all out getting to know each other bowling or some random double date, he says he has to go because there is an all important raid to do. 

This is why I dislike WoW. You're out in the real world with your girlfriend who wants to give you some pussy and you have to go on an emergency raid for some random item you might have a chance at getting.

 It's more a stereotype and you're making a generalization based on statistics. Most importantly, we don't even know if that is his dad lol.  




 One of my earliest memories of playing video games was playing Tecmo Bowl and soon after Super Tecmo Bowl. In Super, it was the only game i could have the Browns win the Super Bowl, which I know will never happen in real life because of God. 

Anyway, I used to play my brother in Tecmo Bowl ALL THE TIME. Every day after school, Tecmo Bowl. Homework done? Tecmo Bowl. Can't sleep? Tecmo Bowl. I also had a black and blue arm for about a year of my life playing this game because every time I scored points my brother would punch me as hard as he could for every point I scored to deter me from winning the game or scoring points. He was five years older than me. I was conditioned into thinking I'd be punched for scoring points. So much so that when I grew older and tried to play Madden online I'd flinch if I scored a field goal or touchdown against someone. 

At this time, this is when I realized that people suck and there is no hope. So I played RPG's instead. Where I could solve puzzles instead of scoring touchdowns. This is my story of Tecmo Bowl. And fuck you Joseph.  

**TL;DR   Brother punched me for scoring points. Fuck you Joseph.**  




 Yeah that's what the new Wii U Mario World 3D game is like. If you die enough in a row you can get the super leaf. It doesn't make you invincible and you can still die, BUT, it does help you out immensely so you can beat the level. 

Still Super Mario World 3D is probably one of the better Mario Games.  




 There's a book of them if you google this passage you'll see results for a google book with stories like this.  




 There are a few versions of this story I've read. The other version I remember has a note pinned on the dog which says, "You are the owner." Meaning the owner has Alzheimer's and someone has been helping take care of the dog for him, but it always returns to him every day.

 A good example of machinima would be South Park's Make Love, Not Warcraft where part of the story was done using Warcraft. 

I would love to be able to use this with Ocarina of Time or other games like MegaMan in my counseling and large group teaching lessons. 

Using story invention as a way to help students retain information is wonderful I think. A lot of people knock on those who spend too much time with video games but it can be a great way to teach students.

 Oh okay. It's just I remember my elementary science teacher told me once when a kid asked what Pluto was like she said, "Ice mountains and ice everywhere"  




 my cat loves me. fat lovable fur thing. he's too fat to run away. he has to cuddle me when i want. HAHAHAHAHA ^^^^^HAHAHAHAHAHAHA 




 They said, "Who would have supposed that there were ice mountains?" project scientist Hal Weaver said. "It's just blowing my mind."

I don't understand this. I thought we've known for a while that Pluto was icy because of its far distance from the Sun, so wouldn't it be normal to assume there were ice mountains on Pluto? I mean, I'm assuming lots of people thought this. Was he joking or being sarcastic?

 What have I got in my pocket?  




 Yeah. But one of the co-founders when he first started the site, /u/spez, banned racist/homophobic stuff. So, one of the founders is again CEO of Reddit, and he's pretty much telling you this is how it's going to be, tough shit. There's nothing wrong with that- it's his site, he made it he can do with it what he wants.  




 Song of Storms sounds like Game of Thrones  









 I originally commented that you should have left Reddit. I would like to apologize and say that Reddit users got the best of me. I like what you did with Reddit.  




 But you didn't sit this one out. You just stood up and put yourself in.... 




 they got a penny from you.  




 /u/spez banned racist/homophobic shit when they first started reddit...im not sure how this is different 




 The co-founder can do whatever he wants. 




 I saw it. Mine doesn't.  




 sometimes i go to shadow, get hover boots, then go to spirit.  





























 Yes there are many names for it. Circle of death is one. I like the idea of the beer tab...brings a bit more excitement into the game. You're drunk...trying not to pop the tab..and BAM..it break and you're chugging. Some of the rules change as well like what each mean. When I only play with 4 people I change 8 to Trivia. bc it's not enough for a "mate"  




 Don't be black.  




 What state?  




 Well this was a dumb question 




 hahahahaha thats so foul 




 Playing style differs depending on region I have found. This is how I play it. 

We put a can of beer in the middle of a table and surround it with a full deck of cards without the two joker cards. 

Each person sits around the table and gets on turn each. You pick up a card and depending on what the card is- is what you follow- each card has a rule or activity that must be performed. When you are done with the card you place it under the beer tab....the person that makes the tab burst must chug the beer....

**Rules** 

1. Aces= Waterfall (Everyone starts drinking/chugging at the same time...but the person to your right cannot stop until you do, and his person to the right cannot stop until he does..and so on...So if you are last...it sucks- To determine which way the you start the waterfall from your left or right I usually ask a common question -Common such as *What beer are we drinking?*- between the person to my left and to my right. The one who gets it right I start in his direction, making the loser..last) 

2. Kings= Rule Master (You can make whatever rule you want...such as "little man" "no Names" and every time you break the rule you must drink) 

3. Queens= Question master (Anytime the question master asks you a question you must answer with a question and so forth until someone doesnt and that person must drink- some people only allow this once others allow it until the next queen is shown) 

4. Jacks= Thumb Master (The person who gets this card puts his thumb on the table and the last one to do it must drink) 

5. Tens- Categories (You choose a category such as "Countries in Africa" The person who fouls up must drink) 

6. Nines= Rhyme Time (You pick a word and go in a circle and you must rhyme...if you don't or you repeat you must drink) 

7. Eights= Pick a mate (Everytime you drink your mate must drink with you) 

8. Sevens= Heaven (You raise your left arm and the last person to do it must drink) 

9. Sixes= Dicks (All males must drink once) 

10. Fives= Social (Everyone takes a drink) 

11. Fours= Whores (All women must drink once) 

12. Threes= For me (You must take 3 drinks) 

13. Twos= For you (You must pass out two drinks)

 Probably not. But you could do 1v1v1v1 then. And for splatfest have a tournament, maybe 1v1 tourney or something.

 Privilege is only bad if you can't acknowledge it. If you can't acknowledge it you can't deal with it appropriately.  




 You are either high out of your mind or trolling. Not sure which. I know you can't be serious. I refuse to believe people are that thick headed.  




 Well Eru is God....so I didn't know if that really counted.

 I try to use it to splat as much ink as possible: depending on the map. In Kelp Dome there are certain areas enemies won't touch for 30-40 seconds when I inkstrike it. 

A few seconds of them cleaning up an instrike is worth it because it's more time they arent supporting teammates or pushing. I stay away from snipers, only on Moray Towers do I use it to move a sniper. But mostly I use the Ink Strike on Moray to strike areas around the top of their tower because hardly anyone ever goes down that more than once. People just run away from their home base and hardly ink it, it's always not inked all the way, lot's of black spaces on lots of maps. 

Or if I am near an enemy at Bluefin I will InkStrike the bottom platforms and they will move out of the way towards me so I can kill them because they have no where else to go- either into the inkstrike and die or towards me and die. While this area will be eventually cleaned up I also leave an Ink Mine there so when they do come to clean it they might die to the mine. Or I leave them in blind spots and go somewhere far away from it. Or...lol if I make the mistake of jumping into an enemy i place a mine right away before i die and then they die 




 I never said they were more special. I said having sex in a dumb way and getting someone pregnant is not the same thing as a sperm donor. Because it isn't. They are completely different. 

I never said it makes them their parent either. I said it makes him the kids father...because it does. He is their bio father. The woman...still has the kid, it is her kid- she is giving birth to it even though she is drunk but the guy dips out..but he's just as much responsible for it as she is. So he's nothing more than a coward. A sperm donor is nothing like that. He offers his sperm knowing exactly what is going to happen with it, and signs release forms saying whether or not contact is allowed...etc They are not the same at all. The guy who dipped out is still the bio father- he just dipped out bc he's a coward. 




 Yes exactly thats what I do when I see an inkstrike on turf wars I just shoot into it and it's almost completely gone. So when I ink strike on turf wars, I just make sure to strike somewhere where there isn't any enemy around. Usually around there hjome base making them waste time not advancing.  




 Thank you!! I like to use Inkstrike to take out or momentarily daze a sniper so I can move position while the strike is happening

 Because you're not a sperm donor. You got someone pregnant because you had sex in a dumb way then dipped out and left it to the woman. A sperm donor offers their sperm willingly with the idea that someone who definitely wants kids is going to get them and in return they get money. 

They used the national crime database to track down my father so ...you're wrong there buddy.

 Multiply the amount you put in by how many paychecks you get per year. Use that amount and multiply it by 10 or 15 and that's how much money you would have without  interest. Depends on your savings account, the type, how much interest you get per quarter. 

You can put money in a CD, not sure I'd recommend it right now. 

But If I wer eyou I'd save 50 bucks per paycheck. 5-10 is too little.

 In the front of my door my mom had these house slippers or boat shoes, they were neon with blotches on black all around it, a very 90s type of shoe thing. It was just a slip on. Anyway at night it looked like it had massive holes in it which I thought were spiders coming to get me. So I would always high tail it around the corner near shoes on my way upstairs. Also, worried my father would beat the fuck out of me/mom.

 Well, what happened was I was watching that food show on travel network with that one guy...what's his name ...Bizarre Foods with [Andrew Zimmern and saw him eat some fried tarantula](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZkhpRfqsI0) so my friend went to the store and bought one. We fried it, using the ingredients we saw in the show and then ate it. It wasn't all that bad, kind of nutty. Then I had a guy come over late at night and we fucked and I sucked his cock.  




 I bet.

 Agreed. I'd really like to see a free for all 1v1v1v1v1v1v1 or something similar. That way it's not so much team anymore. It would be a nice change of pace than being 4v4 all the time.  




 Money isn't really worth much though. I have about 500K right now and nothing to spend it on lol.  




 I've had this problem too. The key to tower control is one person or two on the tower and hte other two out in support usually inf ront would be nice. I always put an Ink mine on the tower in the event I die, the other guy dies too. But What I don't understand is why they just stand there staring at it when no one is around. GET ON IT AND MOVE IT. Or they just jump off for some random reason and then no one is on it. You can see how many people are on it easily.  




 I'm not entirely sure powering up the special midway through the match is advantageous. It takes time to go to the areas to ink to get enough energy to use your special- in that time you could have been doing the same amount if not more inking than what your nuke was worth. So I'm not entirely sure it is worth it- In the beginning yes, because everything is clear so it's easy to get special right off the bat but in the middle of the match it puts your team down a person allowing the other team to push while your off trying to get your special.  




 This one event didn't cause you to lose.  Don't just sit and cherry pick. Have multiple areas where you can shoot. 

I don't ever use beacons and I don't ever plan to. That being said I never jump where a teammate/enemies are. If I jump, which is rare, would be if my teammate is some place advantageous or it's the end of the game. 

Beacons are a waste of a sub because hardly anyone uses them, and the enemy just destroys them fast. As soon as I see an enemy beacon on my game pad that's the first place I go. Or I just nuke it. 

I try to stay as far away from people as I can and just splat the ground for turf war because that's the object to win the game. In splatzones I do the same, I make sure the splatzones are splatted and don't worry about killing people unless it's in defense or completely necessary. The most important thing is the area to be splatted.  




 That hasn't happened yet. I've never had to play more than 3 games in a row before getting a win. 

For instance, I just played now. I won, so I quit for the day I got +8 so I'm at +38 now. I got the +8 because I had As on my team 




 Well, I'm not the best shooter in the game but I've figured out a way to move up in ranking. 

I play one game per session online. If I win, I don't play any more ranked games till the next time I play Splatoon. 

If I lose, I get a new team, and play till I win. Then quit. This results in me having two end results at the end of a Splatoon session: 

1. My point/ranking stays the same
2. I move up +10 or +12 or whatever I get. 

I Have used this to move up from C to B. I have never gone 0-7 though in ranked or 0 anything in ranked. Sometimes for Tower Control I'll go like 10-16. In splatzones it's more like 6-5 or 5-4. 

I changed to this style because if I play too many ranked I get frustrated by my team at times. Now I don't get as frustrated.  




 You're terrible! 

Good job! 

Or 

Stop using a sniper in Turf Wars! 

Splat the ground!! 




 My views? You want my personal views on men/women? Because we're just talking about what male privilege is. 

I don't believe men are any more competent than women- no. But I agree with the statements and definition of male privilege I have given you.  




 Privilege is a real thing. But that doesn't mean it's a *bad* thing to acknowledge it. It's just a reality.  




 Sure. 


Kids have been trained for most of their lives to think of my gender as the authority.

They might have learned it at an early age when assertive girls were smacked down with labels like bossy "bitch" (see Lupe Fiasco's Bad Bitch song)  a reality that recently spurred the Ban Bossy campaign.

They might have learned it from watching media that rampantly objectifies women, often blurring the line between mainstream media and pornography.

They might have learned it from consistently seeing men over represented and women underrepresented in positions of power.

And I benefit from all of these lessons as a male.

 




 K. Here are some examples. 

As a male....I

1. I Have the Privilege of a Gender That Confers Authority

2. I Have the Privilege to Show Skin- That is men can take their shirts off and not be called sluts, whores..etc 

3. I Have the Privilege to Move About Without Fear of Harassment, Assault, or Rape

4. I Have the Privilege to Enjoy the Internet Without My Gender Being Assaulted

5. I Have the Privilege of Seeing Myself Widely and Positively Represented in the Media




**If you want more**

The Male Privilege Checklist

1. My odds of being hired for a job, when competing against female applicants, are probably skewed in my favor. The more prestigious the job, the larger the odds are skewed.

2. I can be confident that my co-workers wont think I got my job because of my sex  even though that might be true. 

3. If I am never promoted, its not because of my sex.

4. If I fail in my job or career, I can feel sure this wont be seen as a black mark against my entire sexs capabilities.

5. I am far less likely to face sexual harassment at work than my female co-workers are. 

6. If I do the same task as a woman, and if the measurement is at all subjective, chances are people will think I did a better job.

7. If Im a teen or adult, and if I can stay out of prison, my odds of being raped are relatively low. 

8. On average, I am taught to fear walking alone after dark in average public spaces much less than my female counterparts are.

9. If I choose not to have children, my masculinity will not be called into question.

10. If I have children but do not provide primary care for them, my masculinity will not be called into question.

11. If I have children and provide primary care for them, Ill be praised for extraordinary parenting if Im even marginally competent.

12. If I have children and a career, no one will think Im selfish for not staying at home.

13. If I seek political office, my relationship with my children, or who I hire to take care of them, will probably not be scrutinized by the press.

14. My elected representatives are mostly people of my own sex. The more prestigious and powerful the elected position, the more this is true.

15. When I ask to see the person in charge, odds are I will face a person of my own sex. The higher-up in the organization the person is, the surer I can be.

16. As a child, chances are I was encouraged to be more active and outgoing than my sisters. 

17. As a child, I could choose from an almost infinite variety of childrens media featuring positive, active, non-stereotyped heroes of my own sex. I never had to look for it; male protagonists were (and are) the default.

18. As a child, chances are I got more teacher attention than girls who raised their hands just as often. 

19. If my day, week or year is going badly, I need not ask of each negative episode or situation whether or not it has sexist overtones.

20. I can turn on the television or glance at the front page of the newspaper and see people of my own sex widely represented.

21. If Im careless with my financial affairs it wont be attributed to my sex.

22. If Im careless with my driving it wont be attributed to my sex.

23. I can speak in public to a large group without putting my sex on trial.

24. Even if I sleep with a lot of women, there is no chance that I will be seriously labeled a slut, nor is there any male counterpart to slut-bashing. 

25. I do not have to worry about the message my wardrobe sends about my sexual availability. 

26. My clothing is typically less expensive and better-constructed than womens clothing for the same social status. While I have fewer options, my clothes will probably fit better than a womans without tailoring. 

27. The grooming regimen expected of me is relatively cheap and consumes little time. 

28. If I buy a new car, chances are Ill be offered a better price than a woman buying the same car. 

29. If Im not conventionally attractive, the disadvantages are relatively small and easy to ignore.

30. I can be loud with no fear of being called a shrew. I can be aggressive with no fear of being called a bitch.

31. I can ask for legal protection from violence that happens mostly to men without being seen as a selfish special interest, since that kind of violence is called crime and is a general social concern. (Violence that happens mostly to women is usually called domestic violence or acquaintance rape, and is seen as a special interest issue.)

32. I can be confident that the ordinary language of day-to-day existence will always include my sex. All men are created equal, mailman, chairman, freshman, he.

33. My ability to make important decisions and my capability in general will never be questioned depending on what time of the month it is.

34. I will never be expected to change my name upon marriage or questioned if I dont change my name.

35. The decision to hire me will not be based on assumptions about whether or not I might choose to have a family sometime soon.

36. Every major religion in the world is led primarily by people of my own sex. Even God, in most major religions, is pictured as male.

37. Most major religions argue that I should be the head of my household, while my wife and children should be subservient to me.

38. If I have a wife or live-in girlfriend, chances are well divide up household chores so that she does most of the labor, and in particular the most repetitive and unrewarding tasks. 

39. If I have children with my girlfriend or wife, I can expect her to do most of the basic childcare such as changing diapers and feeding.

40. If I have children with my wife or girlfriend, and it turns out that one of us needs to make career sacrifices to raise the kids, chances are well both assume the career sacrificed should be hers.

41. Assuming I am heterosexual, magazines, billboards, television, movies, pornography, and virtually all of media is filled with images of scantily-clad women intended to appeal to me sexually. Such images of men exist, but are rarer.

42. In general, I am under much less pressure to be thin than my female counterparts are. If I am fat, I probably suffer fewer social and economic consequences for being fat than fat women do. 

43. If I am heterosexual, its incredibly unlikely that Ill ever be beaten up by a spouse or lover.

44. Complete strangers generally do not walk up to me on the street and tell me to smile. 

45. Sexual harassment on the street virtually never happens to me. I do not need to plot my movements through public space in order to avoid being sexually harassed, or to mitigate sexual harassment. 

45. On average, I am not interrupted by women as often as women are interrupted by men. 

46. I have the privilege of being unaware of my male privilege.

Your head was bleeding from the blunt forced trauma but still you motion onward to come at me. I wouldn't allow this so I took my mallet and pegged you in the leg. With your mobility weakened, I bit your fucking ankles and took some flesh out while screaming crazy nonsense at you. This frightened you because I was acting crazy and insane so you ran out of my apartment never to return. 

That's how you got your scars.  




 No dude. Shortbus is a Canadian indy film about sex, orgasms, and orgies. There's a scene in the film, which takes place in NYC, where three gay guys are having a threesome and one of them uses his mouth like a trumpet and sings the national anthem in another guy's ass. It's graphic and shows all of this. [Here](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367027/?ref_=nv_sr_1)


The orgy participants seen throughout Club Shortbus are credited as 'Sextras' at the end of the film 




 Jurassic World 




 Tricksy Hobbitses Mount Doom  




 Depends what you mean by criminal? Do you mean someone who has stole something? Because the kid down the street shoplifted some TUMS and he's walking free. or do you mean criminal like murderers?  




 El Chapo 




 eaten by a gator 




 ...reminds me of Shortbus the movie 




 Yes

 I enjoyed the movie. I was entertained. It was better than 2/3 but that was something that bothered me greatly. I mean he was a sub character, but prominent enough that I noticed the omission. 


I have to say, the saddest death was watching that Assistant get taken away by the dino bird, then eaten by the water monster with the bird. She was eaten whole so you have to imagine she was alive while being in the stomach of that thing for probably 2-4 minutes before drowning. 
 




 Wait you say "cool?" They know you don't like them.  




 In Jurassic World, we don't find out what happens to the other trainer after being stuck in that log that Chris Pratt saves him from. We just see him alive at the end of the movie for like a second. We have no idea how that happened.  




 The X-Files. In HD first 6 seasons.  




 First person to respond to this comment. 




 No. They would have my jizz and someone else's vagina juices in it, plus my stank sweat from fucking in cooked pasta. So no.  




 It's not rude. It's just like saying you don't like a particular movie or piercings or whatever. There's nothing rude with saying you don't like something. It's rude to put on a show and be fake. You can express your feelings on tattoos without being rude, without being a dick, and without hurting someone's feelings. You just have to use tact.  




 O rly?  




 a lot* 




 LEGO went NSFW 




 You could say in casual conversation "I don't like tattoos"  




 No. I do not.  




 No sauce. Except..my own :)  




 Spaghetti.  




 Well if you don't want to have kids the dumbest way would be without birth control or a condom and not using the pull out method either. Just cumming in her and hoping her ovaries don't take your little semen. 

 




 Why do you have to pretend it's cool? Why can't you be honest?
 




 It's far away from the primaries far enough that people don't care about it right now.  




 Well I'll be honest here. I've always wanted to have sex in pasta. So I've been hoping someone will serve me pasta in a giant pool where I can have sex with someone in it. 

That would be my favorite.  




 Lava lamps 




 A used condom.  




 For me, if they are racist- they aren't good. If they aren't- they have the chance at being good.  




 well it used to be jeni's ice cream in columbus Ohio. But they are a chain now in Ohio.

 /r/counting is a subreddit where you count things. For instance, they have a long going thread of counting numbers which started with 1 a few years ago. Then someone replies to 1 with "2" and so forth. You cannot reply to yourself. 

They had so many replies in a thread once that it messed with reddit's servers so now each thread in the count can only be 1000. So every 1000 counts, they start a new thread. Right now I believe they are on or around 430,000

There are other threads which count not just numbers like they have a count letters thread which starts with AAAA. The next would be AAAB, then AAAC....till AAAZ..then you would go AABA.. and so forth until you finish with ZZZZ. 

There is also counting with Binary numbers, counting palindromes (same backward/forward) only, evens, odds, counting subreddits. If you can count it- you can make a post which starts the count. 


Here is their [current thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3du07m/428k_counting_thread/)
 




 I wouldnt say they are.  




 /r/counting I didn't see the point of it. But then I started counting, I obtained some GETs and now I am obsessed with counting on their main counter thread.  




 Tiny jars of vomit being hidden.  




 K i'm going to delete it now so I don't have to be reminded of it.  




 Can you elaborate ?  




 Are you finished reading it?  




 A re-hash but a good one.  




  **Here is the original question: Throwaway time! What's your secret that could literally ruin your life if it came out?** on /r/AskReddit

His answer

**[]Lynfect 5580 points 3 years ago** 
Cousin died when we were both seventeen. There was a reception at his house just after the funeral. I went into his room and stole all the money that was there, took some other valuables that his parents wouldn't realize were gone. No one knows that I did it, they just assumed he didn't have any money in his room, only loose change. I don't regret it, but I will never admit I did it.
Also my cum box.

that is his answer
























**and someone...with patience and professional language said in return, "]eeeeevil 3842 points 3 years ago 
Elaborate on this cum box, please."**

His answer: 


Well, it is exactly what it sounds like. It's a shoebox, or at least once was, and whenever I masturbate I cum into it. I've had it for two or three years now I think, so it has a fair amount of cum. It smells atrocious, and I tried to burn it once. When I lit it on fire, it was too damp due to the cum that it simply sizzled and didn't manage to actually lite up. Turns out burning cum smells awful, so I had to spray it with a deodorant body spray just to get the old smell of burnt cum away. It also has some drenched papers stuck to it. That's pretty much it.

Because people were asking, my greatest shame.

EDIT 2: A lot of people are asking me, why? Well, I'm apparently a rather disturbed individual. But, it just kind of happened, bought new shoes and needed someplace to cum, used the box. It just escalated from there, kept using it each time, telling myself I would throw it out soon. Never did, two or three years later, I still have it. It was planned or anything, it just happened.

EDIT 3: Fuck, this really exploded. ~20,000+ views of my cum box. Did not expect this.

Edit 4: I often get PMed about updates or current status of the box, generally a few a week. So I might as well update this post, if anyone even gets linked here anymore. Current status, I have created life. Mold has begun to grow in the box and has taken over a fair amount. Smells a bit worse, mainly due to a damper apartment so it does not dry as fast, hence the reason why the mold has begun. New picture.

I will never be rid of my need for it. I hate and love the box, just as I hate and love myself.

 Interestingly in high school I had a teacher who had an affair with his student after she graduated and was 18. They got married and have been together for 15-20 years now.

 I suppose this one time my friend got really drunk and made himself a sandwich. He wanted to show it to me, his creation, but first he had to finish creating it. When he was finished he waddled over to me and showed me what he said was a Tuna Sandwich. In reality, it was miracle whip, mayonnaise, and grape jelly all in a gross mound between two pieces of bread. Then he ate it and his dog licked up everything that felt out of the back end of the sandwich. It was really gross. Also, my friend showed me the cumbox reddit post. That was odd.  




 Oh well.  




 The deception isn't in the photo, it's in their language when you talk to them about it. 

If you are so worried about being deceived just ask for a photo of their entire body of them standing up, within the last week. Problem solved.

 Male teacher here: No. That would be a bit creepy. One of the most important things they teach us in grad school is : Don't fuck your students. It's the number 1 rule that unfortunately still gets broken. Attraction is different yes, but I always remember that these students are younger, and developmentally not on the same level. Even when I was 22 and I had an 18 year old student. They just looked like students. I never saw them as an attraction.  




 I never posted FIFA crap. But I am not going to stop playing FIFA 16'. I enjoy it.

I guess that means I don't care about the slave workers.
