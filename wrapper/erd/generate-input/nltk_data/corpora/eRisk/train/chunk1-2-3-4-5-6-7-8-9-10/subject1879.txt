 I want to go back into counseling. I am miserable right now: not enjoying anything, over compulsive eating, not wanting to take my meds etc. but I'm on my parents insurance and I feel so guilty for burning through it if I go back to counseling. What if something bad happens (god forbid) but the insurance is all burnt out because of me?

 I have a hard time growing out my hair without it getting for lack of a better word, gross. Been toying with the idea of extensions for awhile, and finally let go of some cash. I'm still learning how to blend them and how to make them look best, but its been fun and overall im pretty pleased with them! These are synthetic.

 I bought jessica simpson HairDo clip in extensions and i love them. im on a college budget so i got the synthetic kind, but i believe she has real hair ones too. got them off amazon! my only complaint is the netting/weft thing is a little big for my head, but i make it work.

 Depression is caused by a chemical imbalance in your brain. So even if you're consciously trying to be happy/positive, your brain won't let it last. The chemical imbalance causes you to have low mood

I was wondering if anyone has or has ever tried an online fitness or weight loss coach. I was curious about how much it costs and anything else you are willing to share about the overall experience?

 A Home Based Program Worker for a branch of The Arc
-i got kicked out of a nursing home bc the people working at the agency were fucking morons and didnt have an appropriate professional relationship with the home
-nursing homes smell like poop and diaper all the time and hearing people moan was something that happened constantly
-had a client with ID who the supervisors didnt teach her that it was inappropriate to call me 30 times a day (literally)
-was manipulated into working with a client with a lot of medical problems who needed her colostomy bag (poop bag) changed, her period pad changed, i had to lift her and wasnt nearly strong enough/prepared
-was told to spend 6 hours with a client with basically no idea what to do

 Yeah the mom thing sounds about right :( so I'm thinking about things that don't cost money...it may sound silly but are there any support groups in your area for people with mental illnesses? Sometimes just being around people that feel similarly could help tremendously ya know  




 Hey..sorry things are so rough right now. You must feel at a complete loss. Have you ever gotten professional help for this? 




 Yeah, this is me, always. It's where the awful assumption "people aren't depressed they're just lazy" comes from. I think getting engrossed in tv or not harmful thoughts pushes away the bad thoughts. Or sometimes I can't clean my room because I physically can't get up and do it, not because I don't want to. It sucks when people don't understand. I think it's good you're recognizing it at least  




 Thank you very much  




 Hey guys,

I was wondering what everyone's favorite or go to self care is when they are feeling down. I used to go to eating, but now thy a I'm seeing a nutritionist and trying to stop binge eating I'm looking for new ways to promote self care within myself.

Thanks for any advice in advance

 As I was getting over a heart break, a song appeared in my head and I can't for the life of me remember what it is or where it came from. I'm imagining a male's voice, like a singer/songwriter maybe, singing "you don't ever want to see me again, so you won't." Theres a chance it could be "I don't ever want to see you again, so I won't" My google searches came up empty. Anything? At some point I found a John Mayer song with similar lyrics but that wasn't it.  




 Lol I told her my cousin was pregnant and was moving in with our family and I had to be around to help. None of that was real life.  




 Mmmm no haha. Screenshot before the swiping!

 Self care I can't emphasize it enough. Make sure you brush your teeth and light candles and change into pajamas and clean your environment etc etc 




 Everything in some cities in Israel are also bomb shelters (bus stops, kids playgrounds) and just seeing soldiers everywhere i mean everywhere you turn. Oddly feels safer.

 I was just gonna say!! I work in a prison and we need these  




 Self care.  I keep a check list of things I should do every day i.e. brush my teeth, make sure my hair is presentable, put on lotion. Helps so fucking much 




 alright sweet. its mostly me freaking out if its like 2 hours late once in awhile so that helped 




 thanks, makes sense! 




 im only on month 2 so hopefully it gets better but seriously not a bad idea 




 easy enough, thank you! 




 I suck at this aspect but I'm trying real hard to get better at it.

 I've had shitty psychiatrists who told me to go on weight watchers and to stop taking medications other doctors prescribed. Sorry for your luck :( you don't deserve that! 




 the trick is to make it like a casual conversation, being uptight wont help them connect with you.

 Jesus. Interesting timing because I am a mercer county native just graduating from college and currently working in a jail, so I was looking at opportunities back in jersey. They said the male officer was monitoring the female alone?? Which isn't a thing at the facility I work at. Even if a male counselor wants to meet with a female there needs to be someone else in the counseling wing  




 Yeah this! went to a school bc I fell in love with the campus and energy but turns out the Greek life is massive and it makes the school shitty  




 hi i love ths 
























 They only care in the US if you're suicidal, and even then you still have to pay the treatment costs. I have to pay 3,000 dollars out of pocket before my insurance will even look at my mental health treatment (diagnosed major depressive disorder). Sorry she won't take her meds, thats frusterating. that combined with therapy could really do wonders 




 Holy shit 




 hows your mental health care, expenses wise?? 




 In the county jail i worked at in PA, you would write a request slip to the counselor/case manager in charge of workers. at that facility, you could do inside work even if you werent sentenced, but needed to be sentenced for outside work. Be nice to the counselor! dont write 2000 requests, be patient. if they didnt get back to you in a week, write another. good for you for wanting to work, itll definitely make your time go faster.

 thanks! i definitely will  




 My former psychiatrist would always always tell me I needed to work out more, and it only triggered me to do the opposite. I've switched doctors (for reasons unrelated), we took me off meds, and this is my third day at the gym. I'm feeling great and wanted to introduce myself.

 We've only found 2 but it's not like we go to goodwill every week, not even every month. Sometimes you'll freak out and then realize it's just an inscription from a grandma or something  




 When I see the other person checking every hardcover in the store I'll know it's you  




 Hahhahahha. Also works with trivial pursuit. Every damm goodwill.  









 Hey, bud. I had a similar experience where I was someone (an ex that things should not have ended but they did) I had zero contact with for a year after things ended. I was in a relationship, but the interaction alone made me question everything in my life, left me unable to stop crying for days, and gave me my first real suicidal thoughts. It's been a few weeks though, and I came out on the other side. I don't really have any advice (other than to keep talking it out) but I just wanted to let you know to keep breathing and you'll make it out too, eventually. Your mind will focus on some other worry and it'll pass. Here if you need anything  




 You're neat. I like you.  




 Ah gotcha. What I do sometimes when I'm really bad is make myself a self care checklist. So everyday I have to brush my teeth, get dressed, eat a healthy breakfast lunch dinner, do 30 minutes of any kind of body movement a day, and check to make sure my environment is cleanish. That way no matter how bad my day is, I still accomplished those (positive) things. 

 




 Can't say I didn't think it haha  




 hey! welcome. i did the same thing sort of i went to a pediatrician for really bad tension in my neck and joints that i knew was caused by depression. when she suggested i do yoga, my mom took me to a psych. 

anyway, ive had a few stints in therapy since then, and some have been great. definitely look into SOME kind of help, theres no reason you need to be suffering (at least not without trying something)
 




 Is there any way you can get set up with a vocational rehab counselor? like at your county's visual impairment center? they might have information and guidance about this stuff  




 hey man, sorry to hear everything is so shitty for you. its shitty on my end too. have you ever considered/tried going to therapy? just asking because it wasnt listed on your post and it may be something else that you can try to turn this doom around 

here if you need to talk! 




 yes yes yes yes even up to like very recent decisions where im like YEAH THIS WILL BE GR8 and then a week later im like fuck me  




 ugh i know youre right. im just so confused like we had 3.5 sessions that were going great why bother do this???? it literally broke all of my trust for her. im so gd sensitive to begin with  




 for the love of christmas christ. im resentful about everything lmao so youre right i definitely would. i have this week to grow some balls and figure out what the hell to say  




 jesus. that must be exhausting starting and ending with new ones like that. necessary, obviously. just exhausting. hope it turns around for you. ill speak up with this one   




  i love writing and do it frequently. now im wishing i wrote as soon as i got home from it. thanks for the suggestion 




 ah thanks, im conflicted cause apart from this incident i really liked her. i think i need to be more assertive in letting her know how i feel 




 not a psychiatrist though. but thanks for the reassurance, im going to try to explain to her how im feeling next time, but honestly probably wont confront her about what she said--unless im feeling brave in the moment  




 Check out r/glitch_in_the_matrix. They'll appreciate this  




 giggled at Ty(ler) Pennington. anyway, this is beautiful. 




 hey! so it sounds like youre having cyclic thoughts, i get these too. something that has helped me (i had ones regarding death too) is everytime you realize you have these thoughts, acknowledge it. you can consciously then change the subject, and acknowledge that youre "just worrying" your brain is allowed to wander, its what it does, and recognizing that youre doing it without pulling your emotions into is helpful. hope something in this ramble helps.    




 I once heard "it's okay to grieve the time you lost to your mental illness" 

I hope this helps 




 I am so successful, and I am also severely depressed. Comparisons with depression are useless, because everyone's is so different. Your feelings are valid! 




 The amish 




 You've put into words, thank you.  




 Hey, I'm proud of you. You need this. Sending good vibes. 




 ditto. saw them at bamboozle and then went to college and found out they were the high school band of some girl on my floor  




 holy shit, yeah. winter was always bad but i am so sick of hearing people talk about winter seasonal depression. the summer is also worse for me than the fall/spring tends to be.  




 wow. this hit me.  




 alright in that case id google non profit legal aid/organizations in your area. i saw an attorney this past winter due to no heat in my apt and they laid everything out on the table--all the options, consequences, etc.  




 I would love this too 




 By any chance is she a student?  




 Please don't ever let the power go to your head. The worst I've seen in law enforcement were guys and gals on some sort of sick power trip because of they're position  









 Ran into an ex person after almost a year of no contact. It was unexpected. We made eye contact and then just kind of stared at each other. The customer who he was helping was just looking back and forth at us  




 go. personally, seeing all their social media about the trip while youre stuck working would drive me nuts
