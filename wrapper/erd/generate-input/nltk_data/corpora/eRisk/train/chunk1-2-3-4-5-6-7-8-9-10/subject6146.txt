 Years ago I found a video online by accident and I've never been able to find it again. Here's what I remember:

-I believe the salesman was a cat of some unnatural color? He was wearing a top hat and suit and I think a monocle as well.

-He was selling to a girl. She gives him a small amount of money and he gives her a sentence, something along the lines of "the purple cat is mooing" but I've tried searching that, it's gotten me nowhere. I remember "mooing" was kind of drawn out. 

-She complains about the sentence. "What, that's it?" or something. He points out that she didn't give him much money, so she hands over some more. At this point the real abstract stuff starts. I can't remember it exactly but I remember thinking it was very strange.

-I think at the end it ended up back at where they started, everything normal, and the girl is surprised and amazed if I recall.

This was quite a long time ago now, it might have been when I was about 14-15, so 10 years ago. I may have been a bit older, but it couldn't have been much more. 




 To be honest, the DM has tried that. He'll start talking like okay, we're going to continue now, and while I generally realize, oh, it's time to stop talking and concentrate, the other two tend to... Not realize and keep talking. Sometimes he'll repeat a few words three times before they finally stop talking.

The best thing I can think of would be to sit down with everyone and talk about the issue. So far, we've just been sort of communicating about the issue over text and while others are not around, but I'm still not sure what would happen. 




 I'm guilty of it too, unfortunately. I'm not the worst offender, but I'm certainly one of them. Talking off topic and getting sidetracked is a huge problem in my group, though. I swear, we could get more done in a game, or finish a game faster, if everyone could concentrate.

The DM made a rule that conversation can only have one degree of separation (and presumably has to be kept as short as possible), but it didn't seem to help much. We also tried writing thoughts down on a note card and talking about them later, but that didn't do much good either. I can tell that the quieter members of the group that want to concentrate on the game are getting annoyed. Hell, I'm getting annoyed and I'm one of the worst offenders.

I want to concentrate on the game. I do! But there are three very talkative girls in our group (myself included) and everything reminds us of some dumb story that we absolutely have to share or something.

Anyway, I'm looking for advice. I'm not the DM, but we've talked about how to control it in the past. I would like some tips on what we can do to keep the chatter down. We don't get to play often (we played tonight, and the previous game was 4/22) because of conflicting schedules, and we can usually only play for a few hours at a time, so making the most of that time would be awesome, instead of spending 25% of it talking about nothing. 




 I'm sorry, but this is kind of awful. People who have depression or are suicidal might actually want to WANT to do these things, but they do not have any energy. I know that when I'm suicidal, I can barely brush my teeth, let alone leave the house and go on an adventure...

Another thing is that people who are suicidal do care. I know there are people that love and I care about them, too. Sometimes they are the only reason I haven't offed myself yet. So the fact that they imply that suicidal people don't give a fuck about others is kind of hurtful. I'm not saying it's true for everyone, of course.

Whenever I see this image (which is far too many times), I think that the person who agrees with it doesn't really understand how depression works. The person who wrote it definitely doesn't. 









 Bacon is exactly why I am not still a vegetarian. That tofu bacon or whatever is just not the same, I don't care what anyone says. You might think it tastes okay, but if you think it tastes like real bacon, you clearly have not had real bacon in a very long time. 









 I'm going to kill myself. Not today, or tomorrow, or probably anytime soon. I just know that I am at some point in the future. It's something I live with every day, I think at the back of my mind, no matter what my mood is, "One day I'm going to take my own life."

I'm not sad or depressed right now. I'm actually rather content right this minute. It won't last though. I know it won't. It never does. It might last another ten minutes, it might last another ten days, but either way, I'll end up at rock bottom again.

I've lived with depression for too long. I started showing symptoms when I was six years old. I was officially diagnosed when I was eight. Two years ago, I was also diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder.

I'm 24 years old. I'm overweight. I have basically no friends. I have no job, I'm not going to school. I live with my mother and brother, neither of whom can stand to be around me. I can't even try to have a simple conversation with one of them without it turning into a conversation about what I do wrong.

I'm not the most important person to anyone I care about. I'm completely unremarkable in ever way. I contribute nothing to society. There's no reason for me to really keep going.

I'm not sure why I'm telling this to reddit, to be honest. I just felt like someone should know. Even if only one person sees this. I can't tell the people I care about. I've tried in the past. They either have no idea what to do or, in my mother's case, force me to admit myself to the psychiatric hospital. Going there has only given me a safe place to be until I no longer have the immediate urge to off myself. It doesn't fix problems in the long run. Maybe for some people. Not for me.

I'm just a lonely, depressed girl. One of millions. The world is not necessarily better off without me, but it's not better off with me, either. 




 I thought the picture said "saliva" and wondered why the hell you would do something like that. I had to read the comments to realize what was going on. 




 I just came here to say that Fifth Age Taric is pretty much my favorite skin in the entire game and is the sole reason I play Taric at all. 




 Thank you! I'm looking at it now, but I'm unsure of which codes are the ones I should be posting? Is it the bug check code? 




 Basically my computer is just constantly crashing and restarting. It can stay on for about 30 seconds to five minutes before shutting down. I have an HP desktop, Vista 32-bit. It's had two upgrades in it's entire life: I swapped a 1gb stick of ram that it came with for a 2gb stick (this was about three years ago now) and I recently upgraded the video card (that was two months ago). I had been getting one blue screen before the upgrade of the video card, but also was having a lot of other issues, so I ended up reformatting my computer entirely. I'm getting the same blue screen, along with others now:

-IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL

-MEMORY_MANAGEMENT

-PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA

-A blank one with no error messages at all

The page_fault one has listed three files with it at different points: NTFS.sys, win32k.sys and CLASSPNP.sys

I am at the end of my rope. I can't afford a new computer but I really can't be without one either. 




 Ohh, heh. I thought it was weird that both my friend and I had the same thing! We level together and normally stay pretty close in % xp but this was ridiculous!

I was still kind of miffed that I couldn't go kill ONE THING to level though, haha. 









 I was using my laptop, everything was normal, then it shut off suddenly and would not turn on again. It wasn't abnormally hot, neither was the AC adapter. The green light on the adapter was off. I unplugged everything, and plugged the adapter back in to the wall, the green light came back on. Then I plugged it into my computer, and it turned off again.

I tried the trick where you take the battery out and hold down the power button. Nothing changes. I also took the battery out and tried to run it on just the AC adapter, but the same problem came up.

This actually happened a few months ago, I've been using my back up computer since then, so I don't remember absolutely everything that happened. My backup computer is having a lot of issues now so I'd like to get my laptop working again if possible. I bought the laptop in May of 2010, it stopped working in July of 2011. I did use it a LOT but shut it down when I wasn't using it for long periods.

I took it back to where I bought it but they won't fix it for free because it has a messed up USB port. The port had been messed up for a while (not sure when it happened, but I noticed it before all this happened and had stopped using it) so I don't think it's related, but I couldn't afford to fix it.

Thank you for any help you can provide! 




 I don't actually know who the girl on the right is... But, to be fair, I can't identify all the people on the left either. 




 Yes yes yes yes yes. I discovered it when I was visiting my friend in another state and she let me on her computer while she was at work. I had no idea what the game was but I was curious so I clicked on it... She came back 7 hours later and had to use a crowbar to pry me off the computer.

I was never very good, though. It was really common for me to forget to check for problems in the city and only realize it when the whole place was burning down... :( 




 Strawberries. I'm sort of a strawberry creeper at grocery stores. I will pick up a container and just sniff them as hard as I can before putting them back... I don't care who's watching, I'm gonna smell me some damn strawberries! 




 I have such a love/hate relationship with this show. I have seen every episode because I feel the need to keep watching but I get so mad by the end of it. I think I just enjoy being angry at the TV? 




 "I'm blue, da ba dee, da ba die"

I heard it as "I'm blue, I'm in need of a dime."

 In my state (Texas), I believe there's a law saying they can detain you for 24-72 hours once you've said that you are going to kill yourself or something similar.

When I was in the ER after attempting suicide, I was detained before being transferred to a psychiatric hospital. But while I was there, I told one of my nurses that I wasn't interested in getting help and wanted to leave. He told me that basically there was no way in hell they were letting me go. I'm not sure what would have happened if I'd tried to just walk out, but I don't think anything good would have happened. 




 I asked that same question to someone who worked at a hospital. Basically, at least at the hospital she worked at, they make sure you haven't already tried something. If you haven't yet, they keep you there and bring in someone to evaluate your mental health/stability. If they decide you are a threat to yourself, they will keep you until you can be transferred to a psychiatric hospital, where hopefully you can get the help you need. If you have attempted something, they treat you first, then just send you to the psychiatric hospital. 




 As someone who compulsively pulled her hair out, including eyebrows and eyelashes, I can say I definitely enjoy having eyebrows. I looked very weird for a very long time. 




 Unfortunately, these are the best meds for my condition. I have gone through a lot of medicine, and this is what works best, so the first person is right: I am going to have to get serious about working out. I am a little sad that my glasses are being booed. I have adored them since high school, but maybe it is time for a change. I am always willing to try new looks, though! Luckily it's that time of year where I need to upgrade my prescription :) 




 I like this suggestion! Yoga seems like it would do me a lot of good. I did some with a friend one time and I felt very refreshed after. 




 Thank you :) I am a little sad that people didn't like my glasses, because I adore them. But I am not against trying new looks! If I don't like it, I can always change it again! 




 Honestly, I did think of that. Unfortunately, while there are alternatives, they don't work as well for someone with my condition. But as for your second suggestion, the getting serious about working out... Someone below suggested yoga, and I like that. It's relaxing, and toning at the same time :) 




 Okay. I have to know. I'm tired of my friends sugar coating it for me so I'm gonna post here. I know I have very little chin; there's nothing I can do about that. I gained weight because of a lot of medicine I'm on that I will be taking for, well, the rest of my life, and it's made me extremely self-conscious.

So, that all said, here we go.

 /r/wowtrees is such a good idea because there are so many places in WoW that are fun to be around.

For example, while I am up in the clouds, I love to mine in Deepholm. The colors just trip me out and it's just so much more beautiful. 




 I've recently found myself homeless, along with my cousin. I'm trying to find resources in Austin, Texas that can help us takes steps to getting a place to stay, jobs, etc. Neither of us have an income currently, and we are both completely at a loss for what to do or where to start. Any help is appreciated.

Edit: I should add that I'm female, and my cousin is male. 




 Big Boss. Who doesn't have a crush on him? 
























 How many girls' bedrooms do you see vs guys? Because thinking about it right now, there's a pretty even number of male vs female people in my life who live in extremely messy environments, and same for people being cleaner. 




 Honestly, this is not the first time in my life that I have cleaned my entirely too messy room to this point only to let it get out of control again, but I don't have an income. $10 a month is too much, let alone $100 or even an apartment of my own. I hope that I can keep it clean this time. I know it's early to assume that this is how things are going to be, but just getting my room this clean is a huge success. It'll be an even bigger one if it still looks like this in a month. 




 I've been diagnosed to hell and back with a hundred different things. Only recently have I found a diagnosis and treatment that is actually helping. Depression has been a major one for a long time, but briefly my doctor thought maybe I was bipolar. Last year, I was diagnosed with depression and borderline personality disorder and have been getting treatment for that, and there's such a difference. I've found meds that work, and therapy that works, and I hope this is the start of the rest of my life. 




 When a guy lives like a pig, it's "why do you live like a pig?"

When a girl lives like a pig, it's "why do girls live like pigs?" 




 Good luck!!!! 




 I get it. I lived in that mess for two or more years. I was too embarrassed to have people in my room, let alone ask them to help me clean it. I just couldn't take it anymore.

If it's too much to ask for help, at least at the point it's at right now, try and clean some of it on your own. Maybe not all in one day, or even two. Just clean one small area and keep that neat, then move on to the next. 




 I could not have done it without the help of my friend. Every time I tried on my own, I would just stare at the mess and get so overwhelmed. I didn't know where to start.

The best advice I can give is to start where you are going to be the most often. I started with my desk, then my bed, and then I just worked my way around my room until finally it was all done. Also, do it in short bursts instead of all at once. We started by doing 20 minutes of cleaning, 10 minutes of break, and by the end, I was able to work for longer and longer. Adjust the amount of time to something you're comfortable with (as long as it's not 5 minutes of cleaning, then break forever) and just remember that having a clean space will make you feel better and is something you can control in your life! 




 I've heard it before in the multitudes of therapies I've been in, but it's worth repeating because it is very true. I am in a better mood when the area I'm in is organized. 




 Thank you. And believe me, there have been pizza boxes and all kinds of gross food things in here. I hope you can find the motivation to clean, too. It helps a lot, having a clean space, even if it's just a clean space to mope in. 




 One of the reasons I got rid of the carpet for the wood floors. So much easier to clean, but damn if dust doesn't build up if you don't keep after it (which obviously, I didn't). 




 I was wondering what part gave it away. Thanks!

(also hell yeah delicious food) 




 I'm not falling for this twice. 




 Are you talking about the ancient TV? Hahaha.

I play N64 games on it because it looks better on that than it does on the huge flatscreen out in the living room. 




 We clearly aren't talking about the same Daniel. 




 Depression has a way of ruining everything in your life. It's not just being sad, it's being apathetic and unmotivated. I have very little energy for basic day-to-day activities and this took a lot out of me. 




 lmao

you know what's really funny??

that's actually something daniel would do 




 I can't stand having a bare room. I love all the stuff I have in my room! The problem is when I start keeping stuff I don't actually love and just can't throw out. 




 holy shit! yeah hey!! it's been a while, damn. i can't believe you remember what my room looks like. 




 my room is clean. who is this though?? 




 Will do! :) 




 This actually really, really does work. I would watch that show, even just commercials of that show, and think, "That's going to be me one day."

Then I decided, no, that is NOT going to be me one day. 




 WHAT THE HELL 




 It took a lot of effort and honestly, a few times, I just wanted to sit down and quit. I was just so tired of living like that, it sucks. I've lived in that mess for far, far too long. I just had to remember how much better I'd feel when it was finally clean, and how much easier it is to upkeep a clean room than it is to clean a room that is this disastrous. It didn't hurt that I had a friend urging me along to keep going and helping me out.

If I can do it, I bet you can do it too!! Just take it one corner at a time! 




 I haven't had time to screw it up again, check back in a week. 




 i got that poster when only the first movie was out okay!! honestly the first one is still enjoyable if you ignore the next however many that came out :P

and thank you!!! 




 hell yeah!!!! 




 Thanks! :) 




 It didn't have doors before, and I can't afford to buy some... then I realized a shower curtain was perfect :) I really like it! I happened to have everything except the curtain rings, which cost $1.  




 Apparently it duplicated some images while uploading. Sorry about that! Don't know what happened.

This took two days and a good friend's help, and I'm so relieved to have space to walk around. And a place to sleep I don't have to be ashamed of! 









 When I was about 14 or 15, I downloaded a song from Kazaa and now I can find no trace of it even existing. I googled the lyrics, nothing useful came up. Everything else I remember is in the title. 














 Basically, I moved out of an apartment back home and somewhere along the way, my favorite set of dice got lost.

Recently though, my car was broken into... I was really upset, they actually stole a pewter DD figurine that I was going to paint and a pair of sunglasses (that was it though... so weird), but when I was going through the car cleaning out the broken glass, I found my old dice and I was so excited I started taking pictures.

So something good came out of something bad :) 
























 I'm a female and I hate this. Some of the women who fight for 'equal rights' just want the good stuff, not any of the bad things. They want equal pay and all that, but they still want the guy to pay for dinner. It pisses me off. Equal means equal, not sorta the same but we still get to walk all over men. 




 I know :( I'm really sad. 




 I'm really looking forward to that thunderstorm, too. 




 I think I know this guy. The guy I know is named Gary, has the same car, and is way too good at DDR... 




 Is it possible to fix it? 




 http://i.imgur.com/QrhmP.png

Every time I restart my computer, any Steam game icon looks like an IE page instead. I can give it a short term fix by manually changing the icon, but it ends up changing back when I restart again. I tried the ClientRegistry.blob trick, and made new desktop icons, but only L4D2 and MTG actually fixed, and when I restarted later, the L4D2 icon was back to the IE icon. Steam is updated, I've verified the integrity and all that.

It's not impairing my ability to play the games at all, but it looks ugly and I hate it. Googling the problem hasn't helped beyond a short term fix. I could just not have icons on my desktop, but I like having them there. As you can see, it only happens with Steam game shortcuts. If I link directly to the game instead of through Steam, it has a normal icon, but then it doesn't play through Steam.

Any help you could offer would be awesome. Thank you. 




 I found out he was a real person when I did one of those "What famous people were born on your birthday?" things and Johnny Appleseed was on the list. 




 I KNEW she looked like someone else. 




 Sept 26? That's me too. 




 yep! I love the Persona series :) Pretty much anything Atlus publishes, I adore. 




 Ugh, people keep commenting on that. It's just fingerprint smudges. I know, don't touch the computer screen, but I do it anyway. They are exaggerated because of the flash on the camera.... 




 It is the same brand. What is 5htp? I am just taking D3 at the suggestion of my doctor. 




 As someone who honestly didn't know how to just "clean my room", basic tips like the ones I gave r2002 were very helpful for me. I can clean a basic mess, but this is a little beyond that. 




 I'm 25. 




 Thank you :) 




 i never thought i'd see mgs ever again 




 No, they're vitamin D3. They are the same brand though! 




 I do have a hamper, actually. It was full of clothing that I didn't want. It was also sitting in the laundry room. I got rid of the clothing, and the hamper is in my closet! 




 Everyone gets depressed occasionally. For someone who doesn't have clinical depression, it's rarely half as severe as those who do have that. Clinical depression invades your life and takes over and it's very easy to let it. It's like this thing that lives on my shoulder and weighs me down, and whispers awful things in my ear that make me want to just curl up in a ball and not do anything. It feeds on my energy and makes even getting out of bed sometimes a huge ordeal. Depression is more than sadness. It's apathy. It makes things that I love uninteresting.

I went a little out of control with my description but basically what I'm trying to say is, depression sucks out all of your energy and motivation. Some people would look at a room that was messy and think, I need to clean this! And then they would clean it. I would look at my messy room and think, this is a disaster and I don't know how to deal with it. Trying to deal with it would overwhelm me. It took someone else's help to get it like this, but it's going to be all on me to keep it like this, and depression is going to fight me every step of the way.

And thank you :) 




 Okay, I didn't know what that was so I looked it up. I'm assuming you mean the vitamin bottle? It's vitamin D3. 




 i'm pretty sure it was yesterday.

also this is the guy who helped me clean my room, and also, i do actually know him. his name is not daniel. 




 No, just asked a friend to help me out. It helped a LOT. 




 BIG whoop de fuckin doo! Try being unmotivated and depressed and getting ANYTHING DONE.

I thought /r/GetMotivated was for people who needed motivation for anything, and wanted to celebrate their achievements that required some kind of motivation. This is mine.  I'm sorry if it's not a huge deal for you. 




 Haha! Yeah! UFYH is awesome!! I got the 20/10s from there and they are a LIFE SAVER 




 Do it!!!! I believe in you!!!!! 




 * Ask for help! I could not have done this without help, seriously.
* Clean in increments. Clean for 20 minutes, take a 10 minute break.
* Clean one spot at a time. Don't look at the whole mess and try to clean it all at once! That is an easy way to get overwhelmed.
* Don't just rearrange the mess. Don't hide it. Bring lots of trash bags and not just for trash. Anything you don't want can go in those to donate! I felt a lot better knowing the shoes I was hoarding weren't just going in the trash, but to someone who might actually wear them.
* Separate things into piles and then deal with the piles. Like with like. Papery stuff, stuff you wear, I had a pile of electronic stuff. Then sort through each pile individually.
* Clean the space you are in the most first. I spend most time at my desk, so I cleaned my desk. 




 It actually uploaded the pictures in the wrong order, and duplicated some? I already posted it over there though, I should have done individual pictures for the text post. 




 Thanks for minimalizing my disorder! You might just be a slob. 




 Yes. It's hard to be motivated to do things like keep a clean environment, and if it's bad enough, even eat, shower, or do any basic day-to-day things that a non-depressed or otherwise "normal" person is able to do without really putting much thought into it.  




 I do have a Ryuk plush. I got him a long time ago, before Death Note was finished. I haven't gone to a con in a couple of years, but I've been to A-Kon, Ikkicon, and Ushicon! 




 I threw out Dream Phone, but damn, Mall Madness is way better. 




 For me, anime and depression do not correlate, so I'm not really sure. I didn't even care about anime until I had been dealing with it for a long time, and I'm not really as into as I used to be. I still really enjoy and love Fullmetal Alchemist, though, so I didn't want to take any of it down. 




 Actually, I got most of my stuff from when the original anime was big and Greedling was barely a thing. I am a HUGE fan of the manga/Brotherhood! 




 Once I got my computer set up again in the corner, I did turn on some music. It helps my mood a lot! 
























 A portion of a tree. 









 I can't stand it when someone has no experience with any sort of self harm or anxiety and says "Well just quit it then." Yeah, okay, how about you quit breathing? 




 Oh, man, I struggled with this when I was younger. I had no eyebrows/eyelashes, and a large bald spot on top of my head. Even when I started treatment, it took about 2 or 3 years before I was finally able to stop completely. I still get urges sometimes, and it's been about 10 years. I'll still catch myself tugging on hair sometimes.

People who knew or noticed what I was doing would sometimes tell me things like, "Your eyelashes won't grow back if you keep pulling them out" (they did grow back, long and thick). Did anyone ever try to get you to stop by saying stuff like that?

Congrats on 5 months!!! 




 It just looks so uncomfortable. 




 My stomach dropped when I opened the picture. 




 I learned how to spell his name by remembering that it's McConey with an AUGH in the middle. 




 I'm sure you and your dad both know what's going on inside the mind of a girl all the time. 




 So basically, I drew this: http://i.imgur.com/NlJz5.png

And I actually liked it well enough that I really wanted to learn how to color digitally on it. And I got this far: http://i.imgur.com/tVrv4.png

I tried looking up tutorials, but I couldn't find any that I liked. I also wouldn't mind any critique in the drawing or coloring itself. Except about the fact that it's not unlined art, because I like the way lined art looks. I am trying to learn unlined as well, but it's more difficult for me. At least I'm getting practice in of both!

I'm using Paint Tool SAI if anyone has any tricks or tips for that program as well. Thank you! 




 Huh! It's been a while since I played, couldn't remember. I'll look some stuff up and figure it out. Thanks :) 




 i'm pretty sure i've not even gotten remotely close. how many floors are there? 




 Right after I posted this, I realized Dungeons of Dredmor might have an ending and I'm just too terrible to get there. Can anyone let me know if I need to reach the end/play 15 hours? 









 My dad yelled at me for trying to start a fire and I cried. 




 That reminds me of the time I decided to try and get my room as dark as possible with a lamp on by layering clothes over the lamp. 




 You should try talking to your friends about doing other stuff. You could say something like, "I know you guys like football, but I'm not as into it." And maybe then you can talk about finding other things to do that you do have in common. It's easy to focus on one thing when a majority of the group can easily discuss the same thing, but when someone's left out, that always sucks. But maybe if you bring up your interests, they would actually enjoy talking about it. Maybe it just hasn't occurred to them since they all already share football as a common topic.

Alternatively, you could try and make friends who do share your interests. I'm not saying abandon your current friends, but try and meet new people! It's not easy, I know it's been really rough for me, but it's worth it. Have you tried looking on meetup.com or something similar? Maybe some forums that pertain to your interests just to have people to talk to at least.

As for the last question: yeah, I do kind of randomly ask those questions. "Do you guys ever just stop and think we're made up of billions and trillions of tiny pieces of matter vibrating constantly?" Crazy stuff. I'd be willing to bet at least one person in your group of friends would enjoy talking about it! 




 I see a lot of negative comments on this, but I like it. Motivation isn't all about losing weight or whatever. Thanks for sharing. 




 IMO, it's not socially acceptable to walk up to a smoker and say that it's unhealthy to smoke. Maybe I'm in the minority, though, I don't smoke so I don't know how often people actually do that. 




 I have the final reward from that quest chain on a Horde character! 




 I think she'd just have a total meltdown and then I'd feel guilty. 




 My grandma will comment loudly about people who don't know how to read when she sees people using the wrong door at Wal-Mart. I don't think anything makes her as angry as seeing someone walk in the exit door. I could break every single teapot she owns and she would be less angry. 




 people who want to be prepared, duh 




 When my dad didn't answer my mom's call one time when we were out of town, I knew something was wrong. Really wrong.

We finally had the neighbor across the street go check on him (she was a nurse), turned out he'd had a seizure and had passed out. He was diagnosed with brain cancer shortly after, and after two years of a downhill battle, he died. 




 I appreciate new followers, but I don't do follow for follow. I want people to follow me because they want to, not because they feel obligated, and I want anyone to feel free to unfollow me for any reason. Also, I want my dash to be mostly things I'm interested in. So if someone follows me, I might check out their blog, but if they have too many posts I don't like/care about, then I won't bother following them. 




 Thank you. I didn't even think about this. I will just try to tough it out.

I am very limited with exercise options because I have a bad back from a bad car wreck. If jogging is bad, then I will just keep walking to stay active. I need more sunlight anyway. Thank you for the information. 




 This is really helpful. I have to stop thinking about the cravings I'm having in the moment and concentrate on getting rid of my flabby belly. I think if I could survive the first week, everything would be so much easier. That's what it was like when I cut sodas out.

One week. That's nothing, right? 




 I wrote a long thing then realized no one would read it so here's a summary:

I get cravings for sweets, and I break my diet after 2-4 days. I can't find a good, sweet thing that can sate these cravings that I don't have to make on my own.

Also, I tried jogging instead of my usual walking routine. I jogged for about 6 minutes (spaced apart so I wouldn't overdo it) and walked for another 20, and ended up sore for three days, to the point where I almost couldn't walk.

So I need some tips on how to sate cravings for things I can't have (foods I can replace them with, or tips on how to just power through it), and tips on how to not be in tremendous pain after jogging. I tried stretching after, I think I did it wrong...

I also struggle with depression, so even having the will power to get up and GO for a walk or jog and stay on a diet for any period of time longer than a day is a big deal for me. I'd just like to keep going so I can punch my depression in the face. Also I'm going to Europe in March and I'd like to be at least 20 pounds lighter before then. 




 It is :)

I used the water tool in Sai. Whenever I use more defined coloring, it always turns out really strange and off to me so I am probably doing something wrong. I will check out some tutorials. Thank you for your comment! 









 I have a hard time picking just one...

Annie in Wonderland

Arcade Sona

Amethyst Ashe (love her purple arrows)

Rugged Garen 




 I thought the Impala had a bench seat in the front, did I get it wrong?

It's cool anyway :) 




 Why is "tampon" censored?  




 My mom is not very motherly at all. She told me that I was too old to need a mother (I was 19), she's called the police on me because I wouldn't go to therapy (she wanted me escorted off the property and I wouldn't leave), she told me I was useless and a failure and all I was good for was disappointment, I can't joke with her because she just gets offended at everything, when I was about 10 or 11, I made a little castle out of some cardboard boxes, and when I tried to show it to her, she told me I was too old for that kind of thing.

I know there are worse mothers out there, but I don't feel like I lucked out with mine. 




 I think it's because they're the more visible ones. The louder and more obnoxious someone in, the more people see them. The decent feminists are just normal people, so they don't stand out as much. 
























 Ah! That's the little dude in my gallery keeper :) That would definitely be something to add, thank you! 




 So the post about collections got me thinking... I don't have tons of neopoints, but they are just sitting there. There's nothing I'm saving up for. I'm just trying to make that number bigger, and that's not interesting. So after looking around, I decided to collect eyeball and eyeball-related eye-tems (hurhurhur i'm so funny)

Here's what I have so far!! http://www.neopets.com/gallery/?gu=elventhevamp :)

There are some items that I would like that I could not find though. Either they were nowhere to be found, or there was no price on the Trading Post, so I had no idea how much they are worth. Like I said, I don't have tons of money, so I'm really hoping to get them for under a certain amount each, but at the same time, I don't want to pay way less than the item's actually worth. So basically, if you have the item and want to sell it, just let me know your price and I will decide if I can afford it right now or not. If you don't have any of them/don't want to sell, but know about how much it's worth, that would be helpful, too. Here are the items:

* Jelly Spider Eyeball
* ~~Eye Candy Plushie~~
* ~~Chocolate Coated Eye~~
* Chilled Eyes with Clam Sauce
* Pink Spooky Ice Cream
* Holiday Eye Candy

Also, if you know of any other eyeball or eyeball-themed things, let me know! I checked Jellyneo's item database but I could have missed things that never actually say eye or eyeball anywhere :) And I know I'm missing Spaghetti  Eyeballs. I already made an offer on one on the trading post.

Thank you for your help!! 




 This makes me think I should collect something. Mostly I collect neopoints right now. 




 When you first realized it, how did you feel? How do you feel about it now? How do you feel in general? Did you sleep well last night? Any interesting dreams? What brand of toothpaste do you use? 




 Ever since my last (and only) serious boyfriend dumped me almost two years ago, I've had a feeling that I was going to die alone. It's not one of those dramatic thoughts like, oh god I was dumped now no one will ever love me, sort of things. Just a quiet realization. I'm going to die alone.

My history with romance is pretty shitty. The first guy I ever had a crush on admitted to me that he liked me... He just liked my friend better. The first boy I dated dumped me after three weeks, in public, in such a nonchalant way I can only guess he was never actually attached to me. I dated a girl the next year; she dumped me after four days because she decided she wasn't bisexual after all. I caught her making out with our mutual female friend a week later.

I lost my virginity to a guy who was horny and I was convenient. He got off and kicked me out. I started having sex with a guy who said I was attractive, but he wasn't interested in a relationship with me six months later, just because I was sad and lonely and would take any attention I could get.

After he got sick of me, I avoided romance for a while. I went on a date or two with guys I met on plentyoffish when I was feeling particularly lonely, but it never went past one date. Then I met a guy and started dating him. I moved in with him fairly quickly, which was a huge mistake.

After a year long, turbulent, emotionally (sometimes physically) abusive relationship, he finally dumped me after I tried to kill myself, because he decided that if I was trying to kill myself, then he must not be making me happy.

My most recent foray into romance is one that is still hurting right now. Basically, about six months ago, I fell for a guy who lives overseas; he claimed to like me too, but couldn't do a relationship, let alone a long distance one (whereas, at this point in my life, I would prefer one; physical contact makes me ill). Then a few days ago, I find out he's dating a girl (I know her as well; we all met in the same place, but they happened to live very close to each other) and is hiding it from me. I'm still trying to get over it. It's like, I know I didn't have a chance with him, but I didn't think anyone else did either. That made it okay somehow.

It's not just that, either. I get a lot of crushes on people (little, fleeting ones; nothing like how I felt about him) that quickly get stomped into the dirt. Sometimes I feel like emotions aren't even worth it.

I feel worthless in general. I've got no talents, I can't keep interest in one thing long enough to develop a talent, either. I can't hold down a job because I have panic attacks about going to work. I can't meet people because I have crippling social anxiety. I'm a burden on my mother, I don't qualify for any sort of disability (I'm trying now, but it's not looking good), I have no income. I'm useless. I can't take any classes at college because I'm too easily overwhelmed.

I don't want to be alive anymore. I don't want to commit suicide. I just want to die in my sleep. I want to stop existing. I'm so tired of being so sad all the time. What is the point of me? Nothing.

I'm fat. I can't diet because I have no will power. I'm ugly. I can't take care of myself. Doing anything beyond sitting here and feeling sorry for myself gives me crippling panic attacks. I'm boring. I don't know how to talk to people. Even my dog doesn't want to be around me these days. I'm angry all the time, or depressed. No wonder no one likes me.

I absolutely loathe my brain. It's trying to kill me, it's trying to destroy me. It wants me to feel this way. I want to know what it's like to be able to function. Not even be happy; just FUNCTION. I can't even do that, though.

No wonder I'm going to die alone.

I don't even know why I'm posting this. I don't know what I want to hear. I guess I just want to tell someone, and there's no one in my life I could say this stuff to. I feel like a burden, an annoyance, someone who doesn't really matter. I'm scared to sleep because I know if I lay down in bed, I'm just going to think awful thoughts and make myself feel worse than I already do. 




 It's less funny when the sticker has obviously been moved. 




 This works for me most of the time, but then sometimes, when it lands on the side I hoped it would, I realize I actually wish it had landed on the other. Then I continue flip-flopping. I'm so indecisive. 




 Even better, my aunt would make me edible play dough that i would slowly consume while playing with it. When I got my first chance to play with actual Play-Doh, I tried to do the same. Not a good idea. 




 The graphics in 3 are beautiful, I went back and played 1 after finishing 3, and I was blown away. I remember thinking 1 had great graphics.

The game play is great, too, but you can tell when they just wanted to show off ;) 




 Is her top being torn from that guy grabbing her? 




 That might have something to do with it. 




 I would experience vivid hallucinations while on Ambien, and sometimes I would take it specifically for them. But you are right, I would end up forgetting 90% of what happened after, and I did do some stupid, stupid things on it. I've never experimented with a proper hallucinogen, though. Honestly, when I first read the title, I thought it was asking about hallucinations in general, but after I got the first comment, I realized what it actually said. Figured it wasn't so off topic that I should delete the comment, though. 




 This happens for me when I would take a low dose, slight hallucinations, but nothing big. Those were more enjoyable than the monsters clawing at my bed. 




 It's really common to hallucinate on Ambien. My doctor recommended taking half a pill instead, and keeping my eyes closed until I'm asleep, which worked better. 




 Leg warmers, mostly for sewing practice :) Too ugly to wear IMO 




 I can imagine it wouldn't smell that great, but I can imagine some far worse smelling jobs. 




 I'm working on my self-confidence right now, and what I've been doing is challenging my negative thoughts. It's helping, slowly but surely. Try to think of reasonable explanations for why the thought isn't true, or in some cases, how you can fix it. 




 It is probably a confidence issue. If you were more confident, you might not doubt her feelings for you, or be afraid of getting rejected.  




 What makes this the worst smelling job?  




 Give her some good scritches for me :) She's a pretty dog. 




 It also makes it look like you have other, more important things than talking to her. Just text her when you want to. 




 Thanks for answering them. :D 




 The opposite is "I embarrassed myself in front of a girl and she didn't hate me after". 




 How long were you awake before you went to sleep? When will you get another chance to sleep? How long will you sleep then? What class are you going to? Do you like the subject? Do you like your teacher? Are there are lot of other students in the class? If you could have any animal as a pet, what would you pick? 




 When I was younger, I was prescribed Ambien for sleep. I also lived with  my mom at the time.

So the first night after I get it, I take one. I lay down to go to sleep, and wait for the medicine to start to work. I never really started to feel tired, but I started seeing things move. It gets worse and worse. The shadows turn into monsters, and they start crawling towards me. I could feel them grabbing my blanket and pulling it off me. I started screaming, and I actually grabbed my cell phone to call my mom (who was in the other bedroom) instead of doing something like turn on the lights. Instead of answering, though, she just bursts into my room angrily and yells "What are you doing calling me?!" as she turns on the light.

I told her about the monsters, which were gone now that the light was gone, and she made me sleep next to her that night. I laid awake most of the night and stared at her ceiling, which was covered in circus people urging me to turn the light on because they had a show for me.

That was a weird night. 




 That fur looks so soft, I want to run my hands through it. 




 You could go with a friend and make them say it. 









 I would be worried if I saw a vagina that looked like that.

 A root beer float in the summer, and hot cocoa loaded with homemade marshmallows in the winter. 




 I think I just stared at this for five minutes. I don't think I've ever stared at chicken wire that long before. 




 That I will probably never be someone really amazing or world-changing, or famous for anything. That I am part of the average. I might be slightly better at some things than others, but I'm never going to be amazing enough to be anything other than average. 




 Agreed. I hate the fact that I have to struggle and take medicine and therapy and really think about what I'm doing just stay somewhat in a normal range of emotion, and if I slack off for one day, everything can go wrong. 
























 I just finished watching through Brotherhood a third time and I don't remember this happening at any point... Thank you though. 




 This doesn't sound familiar to me. Thank you, though. 




 When he got mad, he would try to pull it out but it wouldn't come out of the sheath all the way and he would sort of wiggle it I think.

I want to say it's from either a video game or an anime, but I'm not sure. I think it was a young boy with a normal size sword. That's all I can really remember. 




 I actually quite like that saying. It's my start up message on my phone.

To me, it means something along the lines of...you can't undo what has already happened. It is what it is. You can't change how you got to this point in your life, you have to accept the way things are in order to start changing them to work towards a better future.

Also what imahippocampus said, it can mean if you can't change something right now, then you have to accept that and work with it or around it.  




 Okay... I see. This makes a lot more sense than anything I've read before (that I can remember!)

So, quick question, why does "il mange du riz" end up as "il ne mange pas de riz"? I understand that "du" is "de le", but why did the "le" disappear from the negative? Are "Il mange de riz" and "Il ne mange pas du riz" also correct?

I'm using Rosetta Stone as a refresher and I'm beginning to regret it just a bit, because it doesn't answer questions like this. 




 This is just something I can't seem to wrap my head around. Same with "de la". I think I have "des" for the most part, but I could still use some explanation for that.

I thought "de la" meant "of the", but I never see "de le"? Is "de la" the feminine version of "du"? So then what is "de"? If it's the feminine version of "de", then what is "du"? What is "of" or "of the" in French?

"Des", as far as I can tell, is used for multiples of items instead of "les" to say something like "I have some plates" instead of "I have the plates".

I've taken French classes, though I took my last one around 8 years ago, closer to 9 now, with Japanese classes since then, so I've forgotten basically everything and I'm starting from scratch with "je m'appelle train_subject6146". I've looked it up on Google before, but the explanations never seem to stick. I still can't get it... Can someone explain it to me in simple terms? 




 Awesome :) You look great in both modes! 









 I LOVE the Borealis series! I have six sets of (mostly) different colors :) 




 I want more than a trim, and I dyed my hair at least 3 times a year for 9 years. I'm ready to be my natural color for a while. You can kind of see in the pictures where I had orangey-yellow hair and dyed dark brown over it in an attempt to return to my natural hair color. Thank you for your comment, though.  




 I like this answer a lot. I've always had the philosophy of cut first, think later, because it WILL grow back, but for some reason, this one made me hesitate. I think it's because of all the "fat girls can't wear pixie cuts". Thank you! This was really helpful. 




 Can you provide me with an example of what you mean?

Thank you :) 




 I had long hair most of my life, but after a breakup, I chopped my hair off to my chin because my ex liked my long hair, and I was tired of taking care of the length. I didn't regret it, and have since kept my hair between chin and just below my shoulder length, but now I'm thinking I want to go even shorter.

I'd like a pixie cut, I think they are very cute, but I'm afraid my face is too round (aka I'm too fat) for one.

Pictures for reference:

http://i.imgur.com/opFqZy3.jpg Me with my hair down, unstyled and finger-combed

http://i.imgur.com/wZBtK46.jpg Me with my hair pulled back into a bun

I definitely want to cut my hair short, shorter than I've had it before (chin length), because my ends are really unhealthy, so any suggestions for a style other than pixie would be helpful.

For reference to body type, here's a full body picture: http://i.imgur.com/VGb4FNk.png 




 It's at 1 PM PST. I found the time zone on his Tumblr. 




 My friend says I have to be a pun master because I always make them and never notice until someone points it out. 




 I've made several attempts to clean my room and keep it clean in the past. It would always get back to how it was before really quickly, though. This time I took before  after pictures... The before pictures are really helpful. If I ever need a reminder of why I should tidy up, those pictures are there to remind me of how bad it can get. 




 Yeah, some! I'm still trying to balance out meds and stuff and I still get down sometimes but it definitely makes it easier to manage. It's one less thing to worry about and get upset at myself for. 




 Oh man that is very painful :( 




 Oh! I thought it was just items that had a higher chance of getting taken by the pant devil, not an actual item called that! Haha, thanks :) 




 I kind of figured that, but what sort of items are pant devil attractors? 




 What are "pant devil attractors"? I don't deal with a lot of high priced items (that dubloon was really pricey to me) but I would really like to avoid this happening in the future. 




 The original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/11u832/as_a_sufferer_of_depression_for_most_of_my_life/

The hard part was keeping it clean, though. And I'll admit, it got kind of out of control at one point, but before it got as bad as before, I got busy trying to clean it up again. This is how it looks today.

Someone suggested I do a 1 month update, but I kept forgetting, so here's a 3 month update instead. 









 I had 22 items in my inventory at the time. I try to keep under 30, and I keep a lot of 1 np items out to slim down the chances of my rarer items getting zapped. I always thought carrying more than 50 items was bad so I try to keep it in the 20s...

And yeah :) THAT dubloon is safely in my SDB right now! 




 This was painful to read. 




 I had literally just gotten it :( I was on my way to put in there when this happened, but Ririi was awesome enough to supply me with a new one :) It's safely in my SDB right now 




 Ahhh! Thank you!! You are too kind! :'D 




 I keep very small amounts of np out of my bank. I don't care about the trophy/avatar. I want my np to stay where they are, they are already so few in number. 




 I'm so paranoid, I usually go to my inventory immediately to put it away, but I stopped at the bank... Learn from my mistakes :( 














 She always brings pockets full of treats and she's the only person who actually gives her food when she begs (no matter how many times we tell her not to). She really spoils my dog, it's probably a good thing she doesn't come over that often. 









 I do not! Thank you Sir :) 
























 I love cooking spaghetti alla carbonara and stir fry!!

I went to Florence and Rome. We stayed in Florence for 3 nights and Rome for 1, both were amazing :) 




 Hello, Elijah Wood!! This will probably get buried, but I'm curious. How often do people ask about your eyes?  




 Hmmm, it's hard to say. I would say, a toss up between Metal Gear Solid 3 and Beyond Good  Evil. And Silent Hill 2. 




 I missed a day and have to catch up, so I'm here on a day no one is around. I brought my tablet because I was supposed to skype with a friend while I worked, but they are not online and I'm bored.

Uhh, I guess some more stuff so I seem interesting... I went to Europe in March, I love Harry Potter, the building I'm in is tall, I'm near the top, and it's windy, so there are a lot of ominous creaking noises... I liked a pizza I had in England better than one I had in Italy, but they were all delicious. I like video games, cooking, and penguins. 









 Quick ?, should I/can I mark this as solved? 




 Cool, thank you :) I've never seen one before. It looked like it had a skull on its head. My friend said it was obviously a fly that had evolved. 














 If you know where this is, please let me know. I accidentally hit the back button on my mouse before I could actually play this round. :( This is just where I was placed, right next to a dude in a panda suit. 









 I was placed in the middle of a field with absolutely 0 ways to tell where I was. There was a field of wheat next to me, and all other sides had trees. I can't remember where I was anymore exactly, but I randomly guessed South Dakota but I was somewhere in Europe.

It's frustrating but interesting!! 




 My SV: I hit 40 pounds lost yesterday!!!! Only FIFTEEN more to go!!! 

My NSV: I had stopped weighing myself because I was becoming obsessive. I was convinced I had gained weight, until I tried to put on a bra I hadn't worn since January. It was so huge on me, I was convinced my friend (who has always had much larger breasts than me) had left her identical bra at my house. It wasn't even in the "well this is a bit big but I can wear it around the house at least." After checking the sizes of the bras I had been wearing I realized I went down from a 38DD to a 36C!! How do you even miss that? 




 I learned this the hard way on my counters. I was so excited that I had finally gotten that stain out for about two seconds before I realized what had happened. 




 I've been going to therapy since I was in 4th or 5th grade. I saw the same one from the beginning until I was about 17, and I know I made little to no progress with her. I didn't want to see a therapist. I was forced to go by my mother. 

After I stopped seeing my first therapist, there was a while where I didn't see anyone. Then I saw a few different ones, one I saw for two years, I did a few group therapies, but I never took anything away from it, not really. A DBT group therapy helped a bit, but it was a therapy I actually wanted to go to. It was short term, unfortunately.

Besides the DBT group, which was more of a class than therapy, I never was wholly honest with any of them. I avoided topics that would upset me, I would spend the whole time just talking about whatever. I talked to them like I was just having a conversation with my friend. And they always let me. I was with my last therapist, who I thought I liked, when I had a revelation. *I'm giving this guy money to have a conversation with me.*

I stopped seeing him, and was without a therapist for a long time. I had started seeing a psychiatrist and I thought, I'm taking my meds. I don't even need a therapist! But my psychiatrist urged me to get one, so finally, after months, I got the energy to find someone to work with through my insurance. 

The first session was okay. I tried to tell him a sort of condensed version of my life story, but I got sidetracked after mentioning Harry Potter, and spent the whole rest of the time talking about how much I love Harry Potter. Not real therapeutic, as I'm willing to tell anyone who will listen about how much I love Harry Potter, but he said he usually just lets the client talk about anything they want on the first session since they can be very anxiety-inducing.

The second session, well. It started off okay, got bad, and then worse and better at the same time. I started off like how I went through every therapy session in the past. Casual conversation. I don't even remember what I was talking about, but after ten minutes, he held up a hand. He said he didn't think he could work with me. He had no idea how to help me. I jumped from subject to subject and he couldn't keep up, and he didn't think we would be able to work together.

I didn't know what to do. I had been dumped by my therapist ten minutes into our second session. And finding him had taken so much work for me. It takes so much energy for me to make appointments as an established client, and it takes ten times as much to have to find someone and hope they'll take me. It had taken months to find the energy to find this guy, and the prospect of having to do it all again was looming over me.

I just started crying. Slowly at first until I was a huge mess. This is kind of a big deal because I do not like crying in front of people. I barely cried at my own father's funeral, because there were people around.

I started babbling about things, and he says, "This is something we can work with."

I learned that therapy is hard. I've been going to therapists for over half my life, but it wasn't until that day that I learned what therapy was actually supposed to be about. I finally found a therapist who isn't going to let me bullshit my way through my sessions. I feel like he actually cares about me getting better. 

I'm still depressed right now. I struggle in my daily life, and even when I'm not feeling sad or worthless, I still feel hopeless. Like I'm never going to get better, this isn't going to go away, what's the point of continuing to be a burden on my whole family? And I'm still not entirely full of hope, but I feel like, at this point, I could one day be a little more hopeful that I won't have to live every day in this dark pit of depression.

I'm going to continue to see this therapist, and I'm going to try and actually deal with my issues. I'm so tired of feeling like this all the time.  I think I'm ready to learn how to be happy. 




 Put me in a room full of balloons, with various objects that could potentially pop them, and turn a fan on.

I would confess to anything so fast. 




 Well, if it's friendly, then definitely the shark. 




 I don't know that much about alligators, but what sort of shark are we going to be swimming with? I think alligators are more vicious, as long as you aren't bleeding/the shark isn't hungry. Plus, aren't alligators the ones who drag you underwater, then sit on you until you drown?

I'd rather swim with sharks, I think. 









 I did get that email! Thank you so much!! 




 Just a quick FYI, I never received an email. Not sure if it's important or not, thought I would let you know. 









 You have more than made up for it, honestly. I was hoping for just someone to tell me what to do with the spare jacket before I left!! This is one thing I don't have to stress over anymore, and it was causing me a lot because if they sent me a new one while I was out of town, no one would be here to get it, and it would be sitting on my doorstep for a week. Also, finding a jacket that is within budget and still warm enough was going to be not fun at all, but I can already tell from the jacket I got that this will keep me way warm and way happy. You are amazing. Thank you SO MUCH. 




 Oh my god I'm actually crying a little. I was going to go out and buy a new jacket tomorrow for the trip, but with two day shipping it will get here in time. This is more than I could have asked for, thank you so much. This is amazing. 




 Yes. Thank you. This helps me a lot. I've been very stressed because I'm trying to do too many things with too little time, so I may have freaked out a little more than necessary. I honestly didn't even notice it was the weekend at this point. Do you happen to know if I have to send the incorrect item back, and how it will be done if I do? Sorry to bother you with more questions. 




 I'm going out of town on Wednesday, and I have a lot of stuff to do between now and then, I don't really have time to sit around waiting for them to update Twitter... 




 I'm concerned because my friend emailed them months before the kickstarter even began, and never got a response. Recently, other people I've talked to haven't gotten responses in up to a month. :/

I still haven't found anyone who got the correct item in the end, either, which is kind of making me nervous. 




 I read that. I sent an email. I don't see anything that refers to tickets except in text, so I assumed they meant to send an email.

It doesn't answer my questions, though. Lack of information suggests that I would not have to pay shipping or return the incorrect item, but I also can't find anyone who got the wrong item and was able to get the correct item sent to them, everyone I talked to said their emails were never responded to, either. 




 EDIT: PROBLEM VERY SOLVED, THANK YOU SO MUCH RACHELPUMPKIN!!!!

*********

I ordered a medium Breath zipper hoodie and got an extra large. I'm pretty peeved because my family doesn't really have $50 to be throwing around, but my mom was awesome enough to buy it for me.

I tried to send an email to What Pumpkin, but they never responded. It has been nearly a week and I sent 4 emails*, I tried contacting someone via twitter, I emailed someone involved with WP directly... I'm about to send another email through the WP website because I want to include an attached picture of the tag  the paper that confirmed that I bought a medium that came with it.

So basically, I'm looking for someone who had a similar problem but was able to get it resolved, because I have some questions.

1. How did you contact What Pumpkin to let them know of the problem?
2. How long did it take them to respond?
3. How long did it take to get the correct item?
4. Did you have to send the wrong item back? If so, did you have to pay shipping on it?

I'm asking about returning it because I have a friend who said he'd take the big one if I got to keep it, and he lives very far away. I just happen to be going to see him next week, so I could give it to him in person instead of paying shipping to him.

And for shipping, I don't feel like I should have to pay more money for them to fix their mistake. I already have to buy a new jacket.

Thanks for any information.

*I wouldn't have sent so many emails, but I kept screwing up the information and having to send an email with the correct information, thinking that the information I supplied didn't match the information with the order was the reason for a lack of response. 




 ohhh so that's what cockles are, i had no idea either. i also had no idea what those particular shaped clams were called, i just called them clams. now i know. 




 That's all I remember. I watched it when I was very little. I remember it taking forever for the monster to come out and that I was very annoyed that it took so long. It could have been long to a child but not to an adult, my memory could be exaggerating the length, too.

I thought it was Creature from the Black Lagoon but I don't think so anymore. 




 This is really strange and I have no idea how to google it. What I've tried has given me people with similar, but not quite the same, problems.

Basically, there's a high-pitched buzzing/humming (?) noise coming from the left built in speaker of my monitor. The weird thing is that it changes depending on what is displayed on my monitor. Different tabs of Chrome or skype message windows, they all give slightly different buzzing sounds. They are all fairly high pitched, some louder than others, some lower pitched, but they are all driving me crazy. I tried disabling the speakers from the device manager with no change. I turned them down all the way. I disabled them from the sound properties.

My monitor is an HP w2207h. I use Windows Vista 32-bit. I'm unsure of my computer's technical specs... It's an HP Pavilion Slimline. It has 3 gb of ram and the graphics card is NVIDIA GeForce 210. 

It also has a weird problem where the left side of the letters (worse near the top of the screen) are slightly fuzzy and... wiggly? Is the best I can describe it. Like static on one side. Unsure if it's related, it happened for a long time a while ago, then stopped for a very long time (year or more) and recently started again (as in a day or two ago). It's annoying too, so I'd like to fix that.

Oh, and restarting doesn't help anything.

Thank you so much for any help you can offer!! 




 Definitely not. The sword was either just a normal broadsword or a katana or really anything slimmer than what Cloud used. Thank you, though. 




 I bought one from a local comic con, but I rarely wear it because it doesn't have a clasp or anything. It came loosely tied, and I tried to make a sliding knot but it's pretty poorly done. I'm curious if yours is the same? 
























 It's the 26th... It's much clearer in person. 




 Especially this one, mostly because of Joel and Ellie. Well, Joel. He's close to where I live (based on signs in the game). 




 Is it weird that I would actually be disappointed? 




 Okay, we have different interpretations. I'm done with this conversation. 




 At least it will be exciting! 









 This is what I did. I finished the first time and just thought about it, almost constantly, in the few days that followed. I just finished my second play through two days ago, and I cried more the second time than the first, which I didn't expect.

A very powerful, very emotional game. I didn't want it to end, either. 




 It's been 20 years, I think five minutes isn't going to hurt.

She can tell Joel was lying to her, yeah, but that doesn't mean she knows the truth. The way Ellie acts isn't what really tells me she doesn't know anything, though, it's the way Marlene acts.

We obviously have different interpretations of what happened, so we should just agree to disagree. 




 All I could think about was another time I saw someone fall off a horse and what happened to them. I just knew he was gonna die.

(the time i was referring to was in game of thrones, season 1) 




 That was a really beautiful house, outside and inside. Huge, too. The size of those hallways!! 




 She asks "What am I wearing?" and "What happened?" when she wakes up, there is nothing that implies that she was briefed. Also, Marlene says something about Ellie being willing to die for the cute, but the wording (which I can't remember) implies, to me, that she is assuming that Ellie would agree to it, not that Ellie definitely agreed to it. If she had talked to Ellie and Ellie agreed, why keep Joel from her? Why begin immediately? Why not wait until Joel wakes up and Ellie can tell him herself, "I'm willing to die for this"? 




 She does talk about, a few times, things they can do after it's over, or says things implying she expects to be alive after.

"I can't wait for these things to be wiped out" (after a clicker attacks her)

She also says she and Joel can go wherever he wants after it's done.

That's all I can remember specifically, but I know there are more. 




 I don't know if it's ever stated out right, but Ellie's actions, to me, imply that she doesn't know.  




 When Joel met Ellie, her bite was three weeks old, didn't they only figure out that she was immune after she was bitten and didn't turn?

I was going to add that Joel knew Ellie better because of everything they went through, but apparently I forgot to add that.

Maybe Marlene would have wanted to save her after knowing her as Joel knows her, but Joel also had lost his daughter. Marlene lost people, but never anything like that. She's young enough that most of her life has been post-breakout, and I think a lot of people live every day expecting to lose someone they care about, so while losing someone still sucks, they are more prepared for it. Joel didn't wake up that morning prepared for anyone to die, let alone his daughter, and I think he felt a much stronger sense of loss because of it. 

In any case, it doesn't excuse Marlene never telling Ellie about what they planned to do with her.

edit: fixed grammar 




 (I really hope I did the spoiler tag correctly)

I'm seeing a lot of merchandise like Firefly pendants with your name on them, or things with the Firefly emblem on them, and as much as I adore The Last of Us, I wouldn't buy any of those products, because I would never want to associate myself with the Fireflies after what they did to Ellie.

I'm not even talking about wanting to kill her for the cure. I understand, logically, that Ellie's death would not be in vain if it helped with a cure.

But they weren't even going to TALK TO HER ABOUT IT and that pisses me off. Marlene never told her, or Tess, or Joel, about what was going to happen to Ellie once the Fireflies got their paws on her.

I think Ellie is the type of person who would agree to die to save humanity, and that's why Joel didn't tell her the truth. Because HE didn't want her to die, he wasn't protecting Ellie's memory of Marlene or even protecting her feelings at all. He was protecting her life, but a life that, if given up, could mean the cure for humanity. He knows that if she knew the truth, she would be willing to sacrifice herself, and he couldn't deal with that.

Marlene has known Ellie from birth. That means she either doesn't know Ellie as well as she thinks she does, she didn't want to risk Ellie saying no and having to use force, or she was being a coward who didn't want to say anything to Ellie. I think no matter what, she was being a coward by not even saying anything to Ellie. Maybe she had convinced herself that she was doing Ellie a favor. I don't know.

I just know that Marlene makes me angry for not being willing to talk to Ellie, and either the other Fireflies were okay with that, or they were following a leader who was keeping them in the dark about things like that, and in either situation, I wouldn't want to be associated with them.

(I don't want to be associated with the hunters, either, though, so I suppose it's a good thing I don't do multiplayer) 




 I've been wondering about this, too. Wasn't it the cordyceps that infected her that were mutated? What caused the mutation? Could she infect other people? To my knowledge, she claims to have infected David, but he dies before he can turn, do we ever see his wound? 




 I noticed this in my current (second) playthrough. I don't know how I entirely missed the whole scene the first time, but then I noticed the writing on the floor, and then I saw the bodies covered by tarps... I wonder if he talked to them about it first. 

I love seeing all the things like this, bits and pieces of other people's lives that we'll never get to know more about.  




 It's very realistic and I like that a lot, but it's brutal to think about. 




 I know they are pretty rare, but they are basically just really fast Runners with more fungus growing on them. 




 I'm from Austin, Texas. My friend and I were freaking out about it, haha :) 




 Oh my god, I just understood what this could mean :( This game just keeps finding new ways to kick me in the gut  




 Damn.... I really wanted to do this, but I can't really draw that well. Would writing be acceptable? 




 I'm curious about what you wrote this on the back of. Is it significant or just neat looking? 




 I loved the ending, it felt complete enough and still left me wondering just a bit, which some people must hate, but it's probably my favorite sort of ending. 

Ellie knows Joel is lying, but she doesn't know why, or if any part of what he is saying is true. She never encountered the Fireflies herself, she was unconscious when they found her and she never woke up; she doesn't know they wanted to kill her.

She trusts Joel, though, and even if she isn't sure why he's lying and she's not sure what it means, she's willing to stick with him and "believe" his lie, because maybe she's not certain she wants to know the truth if Joel is willing to lie about it.

That's just my thought about it, anyway. 




 My friend and I joke about how Tess and/or Ellie keep finding knives that can't break and keeping them for themselves. 




 He died without showing any signs if I recall, but I don't know how much time passed between when she bit him and when he died. Tess' wound was pretty terrible within a couple of hours, though.  




 I was on a fucking rampage in that hospital trying to get to Ellie. As soon as Joel woke up and I saw Marlene, I said out loud, "I'm going to fucking shit rage if they try and keep Joel and Ellie apart." Then, of course, they did, and I murdered the fuck out of anyone who got in the way.

I would have chosen the "selfish" option in a heart beat, and I don't know if I would ever be able to pick the other one no matter how many times I played through it.

My only disappointment is that I didn't get to pull the trigger on Marlene, but I was not sorry to see her go. 




 I grew up with a brother, and the position of the toilet seat never bothered either of us. If the toilet seat is up when I go in there, I lower it. If it's down when he goes in there, he raises it. I don't understand why some people apparently make a huge deal over it. 




 Aaand, I just realized that's what OP said. I read the top comment thinking it was OP, I'm still getting used to the reddit app. 




 During winter, when Ellie was fighting David in the building. He fucking creeped me out from the start, and knowing the shit he wanted to do to her just made me sick. Everything that happened in winter was upsetting. 




 Oh I forgot to include the story with picture #5. There was a hole there ~~(it's gone now)~~ from a very long time ago, around the same time as the termites, and my dad patched it up. I included it to show that the wall was damaged by more than just termites. I can't remember how that hole got there, but it was also patched in multiple places along the top above the window, cracked from the weakened structure (similar to the damage in picture #2). 




 Thank you. I'm not sure when we'll be able to remove the drywall, but hopefully sometime this week. I'll post new pictures when we're done. 




 If I decided to hire someone instead, would we need to remove the drywall in order to get an estimate? I'm nervous about just tearing out part of the wall and then not being able to repair it until we can pay someone else. 




 We had termites in one room 10+ years ago. The termites have been gone for ages, but the damage is still there. It was in a room that no one used for anything other than storage, and it wasn't collapsing in on itself, so no one cared enough to do anything about it.

Now I'm trying to move in to that room. It needs tons of work, but the biggest, most intimidating thing is repairing the termite damage.

[Here are some pictures of the walls and visible damage.](http://imgur.com/a/7uEqs)

We aren't sure how much it's spread, obviously, but both walls face outside (? not sure of term), and I'm worried about that causing problems, same with the window. I know that the damage goes up over the window, too.

I've built walls before. I've built walls with windows before. But I have no idea what to do here. I have no idea where to start. Is it even a good idea to attempt to fix it without a professional and no prior experience with this specifically?  
























 I have Pokerus Pokemon.

edit: whoops forgot to add that I am adding you, and my FC is in my flair :) 




 Your second pokemon is Dedenne :) If you sign online (and have beat the Elite Four) on the game, I can tell you your third. 




 I was going to see if I could check all three before I told you but I have to express frustration now.

You have fairy type (my first fairy friend! :) ) and I have run into about 300 Swirlix and nothing else. I know it isn't the only pokemon in here, but apparently it's the only pokemon who wants to come out and play. 




 Sure thing. Adding you now. 




 That's okay, I don't have any poison safaris yet, added you :) 




 I don't know what people are looking for or want but I would love a Ditto. I will add others, too, to fill out my safari.

1521-2703-1193. Thank you! 




 THANK YOU 




 added!! thank you!!! 




 Thank you!! 




 Can I add you as well? I was just about to post that I was looking for Vulpix when I saw this. 




 Added you!

1521-2703-1193 




 I'd like a Girafarig. Adding you! 




 Have you hit the limit yet? I could use some Dittos!!

edit: I forgot to mention that I added you 




 Thank you! 




 Added! Also, would you check my friend code? I'm 1521 - 2703 -1193 




 Someone told me not to get Fennekin because the last evolution was ugly. I love the idea of a fire/psychic type, though, so I picked Fennekin anyway. I don't get all the hate for Delphox. I think it looks like a pokemon who could set you on fire with its mind, and that's exactly what it is.  




 "even a Texan"

You may be underestimating how proud Texans are of being Texan. 




 I've rewritten this too many times trying to clearly explain what I'm looking for without going on for ages and getting sidetracked or adding too much information, all of which are problems I have when attempting to express myself.

In text, I can revise what I'm trying to say which is helpful with the above problems, but there are more issues still. I have trouble remembering words, and it's really bad because though I can describe what the word means (sort of, I kind of speak my own language sometimes that only a couple of people can understand), I will try to say things like 'it starts with [x]' when it doesn't start with that letter at all, or even worse, the word I'm searching for doesn't actually exist and I'm thinking of a different word that doesn't have the meaning I'm looking for (for example, I'll be describing a word that I want to be a general word for different kinds of climates and people will suggest biomes, ecosystems, but none of those are right, the word I'm looking for starts with a T, but it turns out the word I want is 'triangulate' and I end up frustrated because I still don't have the word I want to use and now I have a useless word) (that is a real life example) (this is an example of too much information)

I have social anxiety and it doesn't help me articulate my thoughts at all. I don't want to keep going on, I just want to learn how to articulate my thoughts in both text and verbal conversation.

The last thing I want to say is that telling me to slow down my talking and give myself time to think doesn't help, because I've done that, and I'm still trying, but I end up not being able to think of what I'm saying and being quiet for too long and the conversation moves on and I lose my original thought entirely.

I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense, I'll try to clarify anything that is confusing or poorly worded. Thank you in advance. 




 Happy birthday to us!! I'm turning 26 so it's extra, extra special. 




 I know :D I'm very excited about sharing a birthday with Joel. Then I realized I'm getting the apocalypse for my birthday. 




 My birthday is tomorrow. 




 Thanks!!! :D 




 Hehe, thanks, I try my best every day 




 Thank you! :) 









 About four months ago, I started coming out as genderfluid to my closest friends. I'm FAAB and my name/nickname were both really feminine. I like my birth name (Erica), but I feel sort of disconnected from it, and I wanted to shed my nickname (Rikka) because I wanted to shed my names like old skin and come out as the real me. I started going by James. I know it's a masculine name, but it's my favorite name, and I didn't see any issue with being called James no matter how I presented.

Now I've got two issues.

I feel no connection to any of my names. I see Erica and I think, that's someone who isn't me. That's who I am when I'm with my mother, or my grandparents. When I see Rikka, I wince. I don't even know why. Maybe because so many awful things happened to me while I went by that name? When I see James, though, I don't associate it with me. It made me happy, at first, being called James, but now I'm just sort of confused. Is that a sign I should find a new name?

On top of having no connection to my names, I have recently been feeling more feminine, and I feel guilty. I didn't really make a big deal out of being a dude to my friends, I did ask one of my very closest friends to use male pronouns while talking to people who don't know me, and she uses them with me sometimes, which is fine still. It's not really about pronouns for me, not at the moment.

I don't know how to describe what I'm feeling really. For a while, I stopped shaving my legs, because it looked more masculine to have super hairy legs and I could just tell people "I'm too lazy" or "I wear pants all the time so who cares", but it was sort of a small thing I could have that no one could see (like I said, I wear pants most of the time). I told one friend that I stopped shaving (I can't remember why now).

Recently, I started shaving again, though. When I mentioned something about shaving my legs to the same friend, he questioned it. I felt defensive. I told him about the genderfluid stuff, so why couldn't I just say "I've been feeling girly"?

**tl;dr**

1. I feel disconnected from my names, including one I chose for myself, and feel nameless.
2. I feel guilty for wanting to present as feminine, because I'm FAAB. 




 I wasn't sure if it counted as OC if I didn't make the game, but I took the screenshot? If it isn't OC, then I can take it down and repost it without the tag 









 I was diagnosed with depression when I was pretty young. It was fairly mild, but gradually got worse over time up until a time period between 2009 up to 2012, when I hit rock bottom over, and over, and over.

I don't want to get into specifics because, well, I'm not here to talk about that. I will just say that it was two years of hell followed by a year of having zero energy and not giving a shit about anything.

I slept almost constantly. I would be up for maybe 4 hours tops (usually less, sometimes as little as 10 minutes) before going back to sleep for anywhere from 4-16 hours, occasionally even longer. It was miserable. When I was awake, I was eating quick and easy junk food because I had no energy to even make a sandwich. I couldn't even heat up a frozen dinner.

So what happened was I basically laid around and got fat. Well, fatter.

Then, in mid 2012, I met someone. I met him online. He lives an ocean away from me in England, but I fell for him HARD. I was infatuated with him and I was so happy. I had energy. I didn't hate the world. I didn't know what it felt like to be sad anymore. I never wanted it to stop.

I knew it would, though. The soaring feeling would wear off. I'd never felt like that before, but I knew myself. Nothing lasted for me if it was good, but for once, knowing I was going to fall into another depression at some point in the future didn't make me feel hopeless. I wanted that feeling to last, but I also knew it couldn't. That didn't mean I had to go back to rock bottom, though.

For the first time in my life, I wanted help for my depression. I actually wanted to learn how to manage it. I had a whole plan. I would get back on meds, I'd take them regularly, I'd go to therapy, I'd see a psychiatrist, I'd learn to function like a real adult. I'd get a job. I'd go to school. I'd save money and I would fly to England so I could hug that boy in person.

And I started doing just that. I found a psychiatrist and started an intensive therapy program. Then everything started to go downhill.

My car was broken in to. Nothing was stolen, but they had gone through everything and pulled out things I'd hidden, things that brought up awful memories that made me sick to my stomach. The guy in England told me that even though he had feelings for me, he didn't want a long-distance relationship. I had known the whole time that we wouldn't date, even though I was and still am willing to try an LDR. Actually being told that, though, was absolutely crushing.

Even though the amazing feeling was gone, and thinking about him hurt, I still wanted to learn to manage my depression. I kept going to therapy. I kept seeing my psychiatrist. But I was back to having no energy. It was a struggle to stay awake during therapy (3 hours 4 days a week) no matter how much or how little I'd slept. But I stuck with it, and I finished up the therapy program with hope.

I was still fat, though, and I hated it. No matter how good I felt about other things, if I saw myself in a mirror, I was miserable. I didn't want to torture myself with diet and exercise right off the bat, I didn't want to jump right in and overwhelm myself and quit after two days.

I cut out soda and caffeine and started drinking water in hopes that it would help me get some energy. It may have, but it wasn't much. What I did notice, though, was that I lost weight. I was 10 pounds lighter, and for someone who's four feet and eleven inches, that's actually noticeable. Still, I was overweight. Obese, even. I felt better without the soda and caffeine, but it wasn't enough. The most noticeable differences were less headaches, and my acid reflux was gone. (That was extremely exciting, I went from having to eat Tums like candy while sucking down pepcid to not having to use either at all)

Finally, I mentioned it to my psychiatrist. I hadn't before, and I wish I had sooner. With my lack of energy and difficulty concentrating on things, she decided to prescribe Adderall.

I was nervous about it at first, because I have abused prescription drugs in the past. I told myself, take it like you're supposed to. See how it works. See what it does for you.

I knew that if it actually helped me, I didn't want to abuse it because I didn't want it to get taken away like the other pills.

I was given a pretty low dose at first and my instructions were to take it twice a day, one when I woke up, one five hours later, and they should wear off by the time I'm supposed to go to bed. When I picked up the pills, it was roughly around the time I was supposed to take the second one, early afternoon, so I decided to take it.

One pill kept me up for over 24 hours. I remember looking at the clock and realizing that I'd woken up 26 hours earlier and I wasn't tired at all. I thought that was strange, but I hadn't been downing them like candy or anything. It was just a powerful drug that I wasn't used to, I told myself. But I loved the feeling of being AWAKE. I was so NOT TIRED. I should have worried, and I did abuse them at first but I denied it to myself. I'm not abusing them, I'm not doing this all the time, etc etc.

I would stay up until I was delirious with them, because I loved not having to sleep. I spent so much time sleeping, and now I wasn't sleeping!! I could do stuff!!! And I could FOCUS. The first time I took it, I played a flash game on Neopets for 7 hours. I did nothing else.

Another side effect was that I wasn't hungry. I didn't snack constantly. I barely ate. The pounds were melting off, and even if I wasn't THIN still, I was lighter than I'd been in years. I fudged the truth for people when they asked me what I was doing to lose the weight. I told them, I'm controlling my portions, snacking less, and not drinking soda. It was all true, but only technically. I was controlling my portions by barely eating anything, and no snacking is less than any amount of snacking. The soda thing, that was the only part that wasn't a misleading truth. 

Fairly quickly, though, my body adjusted. One pill didn't keep me up for a day, and it didn't suppress my appetite quite as much. When I fell asleep only an hour after taking an Adderall, I had her increase my dose.

Despite my actions when I was first prescribed it, I finally controlled myself when she said that she might change it if it's not working as well. I realized that if I kept going on that route, I'd lose the meds, and they gave me so much energy and I was getting things DONE, even if sometimes I would take them for the sole purpose of not sleeping for two days. And I had lost weight, something I hadn't done in years!!! Or ever, really, I got fat pretty slowly and just sort of stayed there.

After that, though, I stopped abusing it. I stopped starving myself. I took it how I was supposed to, and instead of avoiding eating, I took advantage of the lack of appetite to eat smaller portions.

My mood was better because I had meds that worked for me, I had lost weight and was keeping it off, now in a healthier way, and the best thing happened during all this.

I got to go to England and I got to give the guy who started all of this the hug I'd wanted to give him since the beginning.

I was incredibly lucky. My friend paid for me to go with him, and we met up with the guy I'm crazy about and I got to spend two days with him. Best two days of my life, honestly.

In 2011, after two years of absolute hell, I tried to kill myself four times.
2012 started with apathy, exhaustion, and 175 pounds.
It ended with a broken heart, a lot of hope, and 35 pounds gone.

2013 started with energy and a European vacation, and now I'm sitting here at 125 pounds (still not at my goal weight, but I'll get there!) and I'm *okay* for the first time since I was eight years old, and that's the best I could hope for.

[Before  After pictures of me](http://i.imgur.com/gbAGUch.jpg)

The first picture is actually in the later half of 2012, my heart's already been broken and I've started therapy. I'm 165 pounds and at Six Flags for my 25th birthday.

The second picture was taken in May of this year. I'm 125 pounds, both in that picture, and right now.

I don't know what typically goes in this subreddit, but this is something I wanted to say so I thought it fit. I don't care if anyone sees it or reads it or whatever, but I just needed to say it.

 I'm not a huge fan of Hot Topic overall, but I admit that sometimes I go in there for fandom merchandise (typically t-shirts) when I'm at the mall.

In any case, it sounds like she's going to have an awesome birthday :)  




 I have Luna's wand from that collection :) I was also surprised at how heavy they are. They have a metal core, I think lead? 

This is an awesome gift, you get an E. She'll love it. 




 I had some at the Harry Potter studio tour in London, it was amazing. It was very sweet, kind of butterscotchy and something else... The foam on top was thick and sweet and kind of like ice cream.

Most of the recipes I've tried use apple cider, which I don't like at all, but the stuff I had in London was what I had always imagined. It was perfect, and I'm so upset that I can't just go out and buy some. 




 Woo!! High five!!

 My DM uses fudge dice for both 1s and 20s. It can turn crit fails into crit successes or vice versa. It can also result in our fighter getting hit with our attacks ALL THE TIME. The dice really hate him. 




 i have to go play diana right now 









 If I don't use a word for a while, when I try to Swype it again, it doesn't show up and I have to add it again. It's not deleting all of my words, just old ones that I haven't used in a while. Is there a maximum number of words you can add, and I've reached it already? If not, how can I prevent this from happening? 




 It depends on my weapon set up 




 Oh, pausing. I don't really pause unless I need to pay attention to something else?

 I don't have that mod and have never played anything with it. I don't know how I got so many beacons explored. 




 Thank you for all of your advice!! I will try drones and teleporting, two things I do usually ignore because the couple of times I have had it, it hasn't gone well, but it could be bad luck or I'm just using them wrong. I very rarely am able to buy cloaking when I see it, but I will try to save for it in the future. I don't normally have that much unspent scrap. I should have spent it on my systems.

I will take all of this into consideration. Thank you. 




 I don't really have anything other than these few images...

 I will check it out and report back. Thank you. 




 I am pretty sure I don't use any mods, but I have played from my account on my friend's computer before? Also I may have installed a mod and forgotten. :|

What does the infinite space mod do? 




 In my last game, I got to the second round, but got demolished easily :( When everything goes wrong at once, I kind of panic... 









 Thank you!! I was curious because we have some little brown house spiders that get in and my friend said it was probably that, but it was much too big. We put a cup over it and moved it outside.  









 I open my eyes. I'm laying on my back and staring at a white ceiling. As I sit up, I realize that it's not a ceiling. Or maybe it is. I can't tell. Everything is the same shade of off-white. I can't tell the sky from the ground or see any kind of horizon or source of light. It's disorienting, and it takes me a moment to rise to my feet.

The last thing I remember is a screech of tires and a sudden, sharp pain, followed by cold darkness. I must have died. I'm surprisingly okay with it.

"Is this heaven?" I ask.

A voice from behind me startles me. "There is no heaven."

Turning around, I realize that I'm not alone. There are seven people, all varying ages and colors and genders, sitting around an eight-sided table, and the empty spot has a name plate with my name on it. I blink rapidly a few times, but nothing changes. "What is this, then?"

An old man shrugs. "Death," he says. His voice is that of a man who smoked two packs a day for fifty years. "Take a seat already so we can get started."

Still uncertain about exactly what's going on, I approach the table and sit in the chair with my name on it. "Start what?"

"The poker game, duh." This answer is from a little girl, no older than eight. "It's Tedd's deal."

Tedd, a young adult with dark hair and an expression of disdain, starts to pass out the cards. I'm silent as everyone is dealt five cards, but I'm still bursting with questions.

"Poker?" I ask finally. "Is there anything else to do?" I've never been good at poker. Too expressive. My mom always knew when I had a good hand because I couldn't keep the grin off my face.

"Nope," the old man says. He lays down two cards. "This is it. Poker."

I stare at my hand. It's not a good one. "What happens if we run out of chips?"

The others at the table laugh quietly. There is no answer.

I fold. 




 I was really hoping that wasn't the case :( Needing to know something about LSD and going to the LSD subreddit is pretty obvious, but what if I want to know the best way to poison a king that's not immediately obvious because they have a poison taste-tester that would be available to a maid in the castle in the 17th century? Or if I wanted an approximate recovery timeline for a bullet wound where I know all the specific details and can get estimates of most things through Google, but can't find anything about how long it would take for it to scar over and what kind of scar would it leave if it was treated in different ways?

I guess it doesn't need to be specifically for writers. Maybe something like /r/AskReddit, but for questions like those above? 




 I used to belong to a community on LiveJournal where people who were writing stories could go and ask questions, usually fairly specific, and get answers from people who know about the subject. The questions were about things like what would be a good way to do a thing, how specific parts of jobs work, effects of drugs (usually accompanied by "would a person on [drug] experience [side effect]?"), etc.

Some things are hard to google. 




 Ohh, thank you for the info!! 




 Thank you! :) 




 I know it's possible, but I can't find a satisfactory answer about how it works.

I have a level 34 mechromancer. I want to try TVHM but I've been playing DLC with a friend on normal mode.

If I switch to TVHM, will it save my progress in normal from the moment I switched modes, and vice versa? 

Sorry if this seems like a dumb question, but I only recently bought my own copy of BL2 and didn't even know TVHM existed since I beat the have with my friend when it first came out and then never really went back until now. 




 My friend and I were playing the dlc for the first time, him as a level 34 gunzerker and me as a level 32 mechromancer. We went into the orc village in the forest and fought a level 35 orc that turned into a level 37 orc. My friend kept getting crippled, but every time he hit me, I'd immediately regain all of my shields and health. It continued when we moved to another area. Nothing else was different, except the pixies seemed to ignore me, whether they were attacking us or helping us. I reset the game and it went away, but it was very weird.

Has anyone else experienced this? I couldn't find anything on Google, but I'm not really the best at googling stuff. 









 Actually thought this was in /r/thelastofus because I opened the picture before I read the title.  




 If they are resorting to swallowing a ton of pills as a cry for attention, they need the attention. Attempting suicide, even if they aren't "completely serious", is always a serious issue. 




 I found them just fine!! 




 I would love an add but my safari is crappy and I don't know what I have to offer besides Pokerus and starter pokemon.
