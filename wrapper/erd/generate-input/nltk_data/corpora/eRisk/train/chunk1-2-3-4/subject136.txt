 Its a little low on activity though.  :( 




 my credit is shot due to the holidays

Wait... what?!? How does that happen? 




 yes!! 




 It seems like this should exist already but basically what I'm looking for is a place for people who are already employed to discuss their daily work lives.

I guess watercooler talk, if that makes sense. 




 Exactly.  I'd waste even more time if I was trying to socialize.  Plus music helps me stay motivated. 




 These are good points and I'd add that since the OP has been a homeowner he should already have a good grasp on what to look for in a property.

Trust your experience.  Worst case you can leave in a year. 




 Holy crap white people are crazy! 




 Well, I'm trying to revamp my wardrobe piece by piece but my mind goes blank when I get to the store.  I'm thinking I'd rather go into the store with a plan because I mostly buy clothes when I need them or when I see a really good sale.  What happens is I buy something but it doesn't really fit what I already own.  I want to gradually upgrade my wardrobe. 




 Dangit...  Photoshop seems like too much work.  




 My biggest weakness is putting it all together.  I'll buy a fine piece here or there but not know what I need to layer it with.  I'm starting to just look at the models on clothing websites and try to piece together a matching outfit.

I'm wondering if there is something out there that would allow me to place virtual clothing on an avatar or mannequin for every piece of clothing along with a bevy of options.  Something like what you see in the create a player mode in video games but focused on clothing only.


TL;DR:  I want to be able to piece together entire outfits in a virtual setting. 




 I disagree.  It's a major pain to cancel XM radio.  They lure you with that sweet deal hoping you forget.  Then when the deal runs out they try to do it again and again.

There's no way to cancel online and you HAVE to go through their phone system and reps to cancel.  It's like trying to dump someone who hasn't faced reality.

I know XM was more than happy to offer me the discounted rate three times until I finally stood firm.   




 Looks fine to me.  Especially in the setting you described. 




 Sounds like a mob threat. 




 I'm a guy and I have it. It was a nickel sized patch in the back of my head when young.  I tried creams and injections and eventually just settled on a style that kept it low and faded in the back.

Now I'm 29 and it looks like its coming back at my right temple so it looks like I'm balding on one side.  It sucks because the dermatologists are no help.  I think its stress related. I wish there was a cure.  




 On another board I frequent someone asked "what's the point of no fap challenges?"



And someone retorted with this:


an occasional fap session is fine...  but i agree...daily? thats way too much... cats here go from one extreme to the next....  theres no middle ground... either you guys fap 10 times a day or you have to go 90 days fap-free....  moderation is the key to life...learn it.


Thoughts?  I thought he made a good point

 Pardon my ignorance, but what's an REO? 




 Yeah after looking at all the math and seeing how I might be staying here awhile I can't justify renting.

Even if it turned out to be $800 a month that's still considerably less than $1050 which I'm sure will go up when its time to renew. 




 Works for me!  this is great 




 Can I just be nice and pay you to do your job?  I'm not into bringing gifts, baked goods, and all that other stuff. 




 Based off of what you wrote, I'd cut him off.  As a man that dated a chick for 7 years and didn't really appreciate her until she left... Believe me when I say you have to move on.  It's tough and initially it will be painful but he seems a lot like I was.  Don't let your fantasy of a "great love story followed by a happy ending" cloud the truth that is right in front of you. 




 Wow.  You've given me much to think about.  I don't think i'll have to deal with that worst case scenario situation but I can't predict the future either.


I still want a townhouse but I will now expand my search to houses as well.  Since buying a snowblower and paying someone to do my lawn will be cheaper in the long run anyway.  Thanks. 




 HOA is $120 a month.  $435 not including taxes. 




 Location: Des Moines, IA.
HOA fees are around $120 a month.
I'm a senior engineer for a Fortune 100 company based in the midwest.  My job is as stable as it gets.

Anything else?  I'm more than willing to answer questions so I can make an informed decision.

Why do you guys hate townhouses?  I used to as well until I saw my coworker's setup and the low costs he was paying.  It makes sense for a young professional. 




 Here's my story.  I bought my first home about 3 years ago in GA with the First Time Homeowner's credit.  I had to move two years later and lost $20k on that home.  (Luckily I didn't have to pay the govt their $8K back)

Fast forward to now.  I've been renting a townhouse in my Iowa for about a year and a half.  My rent is $1050.  I can get similar and newer townhouse for $100K and a mortgage of $435.  The area seems stable and is actually being built up.

My questions... 

1.  Is there anything I'm not considering?  I don't want to get burnt again.
2.  Will the market ever pick up again?  I foolishly bought 3 years ago thinking rates couldnt get any lower.

I want a townhouse because I don't want to deal with the maintenance of a yard in this climate.  My thought process is worst case scenario I could always rent it and my company buys the house for market value if the ask me to move. 




 You need to look at all the other costs as well.  Is there an HOA?  what will your property taxes be?  Maintenance? upkeep?  etc.

The difference is only $75.  That's not that drastic. 




 This is honestly where I'm trying to get.  I want to be able to interchance work and play clothes seamlessly.  Any tips? 









 Doesn't matter.  The internet sleuths will track it down in a matter of minutes and it would be publicized anyway.

 I have a friend that's in the hospital.  I need an idea of something to bring.  I feel like flowers and balloons aren't manly at all. 




 This may help some of you out there.  I'm a 29 year old bachelor who makes enough money to buy whatever he wants.  But never buys what he needs.  Heres' a list of things I need that are inexpensive and would totally bring a smile to my face if I got them for Christmas.  

**Iron** -  I've been using the same cheap iron I had in college.  An upgrade to a decent one around $50 would be very useful.

**Vacuum** - Same as above.  A man is unlikely to buy himself a new vacuum.

**Nice Kitchenware (pots, knives, blender, etc)** - A nice pot here or there would be great.  When I need something I always go cheap.  Someone else springing $60 for that nice pot or a set of quality knives would be great.  I recently tried to make a cheesecake without a mixer and shredded cabbage without a food processor.  The experience was terrible.  I need new kitchenware bad!

**Logitech Harmony Remote** - I keep losing my remotes.  I need to consolidate.

**AA/AAA Batteries** -  Cheap.  But who's gonna turn down batteries?!?

Just some suggestions.

 I wish I had the answer.  It's sad.  The ironic thing is that there are more blacks in college than any other period in history yet there's probably more teenage pregnancies as well.  So we're doing better, but worse at the same time.

 True.  Is there a high availability of Spanish shows/movies with closed captioning?  I know on Telemundo they have closed captions but I can't find any dvds with it.  I also can't access the captions on through my HD tv and cable box.  (but I know they work because I've seen them on other tvs) 




 Last time I watched a Spanish movie on Netflix it only had English and France as subtitle options.  I'll check again. 




 I've gotten some from there but they don't match up.  I don't know if its because I'm watching the Latin American version and the subs are from Spain or what, but its frustrating. 




 Puedo buscar peliculas en ingles con subtitulos en espanol pero no puedo encontrar peliculas en espanol con subtitulos en espanol.  Sin embargo hay muchas peliculas en espanol con subtitulos en otras lenguas.

Can anybody help?  I'm willing to pay.  This goes for official dvd releases as well.

Oh yeah I used both *buscar* and *encontrar* in the passage above because I'm not sure which one I should've used.  

I also have a hard time finding subtitles for English movies dubbed in Spanish.  The ones I find are slightly off.  The actors are using a script so I'm sure the proper version exists somewhere. 




 did you give her a real chance? - no rebound, pity acceptance of relationship, sex only relationship, other. crap reasons to be with someone

It was a semi-rebound I guess. but I gave her a chance

were you attracted to her? physically, intelectually, emotionally

Of course.  

what are the best things about her?

She's independent, smart, attractive, genuinely fun to be with at times.

what are the worst things about her?

She is the total opposite of me and is HIGHLY emotional.  She can be rude and cut people off when talking.  Also in most cases she lacks the ability to look at herself from other's perspective.  and she can be a tad bit materialistic.

what's her favourite thing? something that always makes her smile

Makeup accessories, Hello Kitty, coffee, tea... I could go on and on.

what was the greatest thing you've ever done for her happyness alone?

I cant single out one thing by itself.  I spoiled her at Christmas though.

have you thought about her while out with friends/work wtv?

Sure.

have you always been there for her when she was sad? have you done stuff to make her happy after?

Usually.  The only problem is since she's so emotional, she gets sad and mad a lot.  This is admittedly my weak spot because I never know what to do in these situations so I just listen and try to be empathetic.  Best thing I can do is take her mind off of it.

ever thought about marrying her? giving her babies?

Not until right before the end.  I would have kids with her.  She only wants one but I think that she was open to changing that. 




 Yeah she knows.  I told her when I was breaking up that I didn't think it was fair for her to be with someone who didn't care as much as she did.  




 Actually I was in a relationship from ages 20-27 and was really in love with that girl.  So I know what it feels like.  But sometimes I feel like I'm unfairly comparing my new girl to my old one.

But I also got my heart broken in that relationship so I'm apprehensive to let my guard down and love again. 




 He's not saying it because he doesn't love you.  He might care about you A LOT, but saying it is a probably a pretty big deal to him.  He would probably feel all sorts of anxiety and pressure once he says it.

I put my last girlfriend through something similar before I cut it off since I wasn't in love as much as she was.  No one should ever have to be in a lopsided relationship.

Keep in mind my actions all pointed to me loving her.  I did everything you could ask a bf to do, but my heart wasn't all the way in it.  

If it's an issue to you it's probably worth bringing it up with him. 




 She was in love and I wasn't ready for all that.  We were together 7 months.  I feel like I did her a favor by not wasting her time any more.  But now I feel lonely and sad.  

I'd reach out to her but I feel it's a selfish move if I'm not ready to give it my all.  I really wish we could be friends and I hope she's around when I get it all together but she has a strict "no contact" policy with exes.

Any advice?  



**TL;DR.**  Dumped gf, right decision, help me feel better about it. 

**EDIT:  I think I may actually love her.  But I'm not sure.  How can you be sure?  I feel like the fact that I'm not sure means I should leave it alone.**

It's just a start.  I got bored one day at work and ran with it.  I'm sure someone else could do a MUCH better job.

My logic was to create a basic avatar comprised of cells that I could fill in with the colors of clothes I actually own.  This allows me to get an idea how colors work together when layering.

The downside is that its very hard to get patterns (plaid, etc.) in Excel.  Also, I had to make my best guess as to find the closest color to khaki and the jeans I own. 




 I took pictures of my closet then tried my best to match the colors in Excel at work. 




 I feel your pain.  I'm in a relatively small city and I feel like I have very few occassions to show off my nice clothes.
 




 This is funny.  I've been doing all my layering and outfitting in excel.  I created a person that looks like an 8-bit video game character and match up my outfits by filling the cells.

 You should be.  I do the same thing, but she's only my girlfriend.  I would expect myself to be completely open with my spouse.  Some people are very private, but you're his wife and you guys should have an open-access policy. 




 Dude this sounds like me to a tee!  *mind blown* 




 I think you're overexaggerating a bit.  People don't usually get excited when a 6'10" center does a simple two hand dunk under the basket.

 No offense to the non-black guys.  It's just that ***I've heard it all before.***

I currently use a pair of Andis T-Outliners to cut my facial hair.  I still get razor bumps but its kept to a minimum.

Every now and then I get the urge to shave with a razor and it **always ends up badly**.  I even splurged on an Art of Shaving kit one time using the brush with the lather and oil before shaving, etc.  I followed the instructions on the dvd and  STILL got crazy razor bumps.

My facial hair is very coarse, thick, and curly.  Even more so than the typical African American's.  To put it in perspective **I can use a depilatory like extra strength Magic Shave, leave it on my face for 30 minutes (double the time listed on the container), and it will still leave a good 30% of my hairs on my face.**  My facial hairs are some tough sons of bitches.

So any input is welcome.  I'd grow out my beard if it didn't look so sparse and patchy.  Also, my beard grain goes in all types of directions so shaving with cream and not being able to see the hair is a risk I'm concerned about.

A search brought me here and I'm really hoping this can solve one of my major dilemmas in life.

 I wear a 44L because I have long NBA player arms.  I went into HM and saw a blazer I loved but they only had it in 44R.  

What are my options?  The girl I was with took a look at the sleeves and said there wasn't enough material to get more than an inch and a half with a tailor.  That wouldn't be enough length.  Any alternatives to HM?  I really liked the low cost but slim fit.

Thanks. 




 Thanks.  One more question... with an exercise like squats is there an alternative to high reps?  I can do plenty of bw squats but I can barely do one legged squats.  Is there an in-between progression? 




 I dunno.  I'm new here but I've seen a lot of programs focused around a lot of situps, pushups, and pullups.  (i.e.  hundredpushups.com ) 




 The main reason I can never stick with body weight exercises is because after about 20 reps I lose interest and can't get the motivation to finish.

How do you guys push thru and do 100+ situps, 50 burpees, etc ?

Especially when breaking them into smaller sets isn't an option because you need more reps to challenge yourself but can't quite progress to an advanced version of the same exercise.

Also, how does hypertrophy apply to this as well?

EDIT:  I will check out the FAQ's for better progressions.  Thanks for the replies though!
 




 You are correct.  I have a mirrorless Sony NEX and if you don't mind shooting manual,there's no limit to lenses you can use.

 Is this in store as well? Also, when does it end. 




 Yes.  I do.

We're all human beings and make mistakes.  I regret making someone I truly loved feel horrible and worthless.  I was young and didn't understand it then, but I understand it now. 




 What you're going through right now is very tough and I don't think anything I can say will help. But take it from someone nearly 10 years older than you... YOU HAVE SO MUCH LIFE LEFT TO LIVE!!!  You're very young.

I know how you feel however.  And I know that it will be hard to realize that now and in this moment.  Focus on a goal.  Focus on something you really want (besides her) and put all your energy towards that.  




 Dude, she did you a favor.  If you don't respect yourself nobody else will.

At least you didn't have to deal with that during marriage.

Don't get me wrong, its TOUGH.  But sometimes you have to put these things in perspective and realize that over time you'll look back and be glad it ended. 




 This is just what I needed to read.  Also, for those of you who have been dumped, it's also not easy when you're the person who breaks it off.

I beat myself up constantly knowing that I hurt someone when I thought I was doing the right thing by not wasting their time and taking them through my ups and downs. 




 *In Nelson voice*   HA HAAA! 




 Make sure you're doing this for the right reasons and not because you feel "dreadful."  Also, be prepared for an outcome that may not be what you desired.

I'm interested to see how it goes because I've been on both sides of this situation. 




 Don't do it!  I had a similar situation and almost wound up with a restraining order.  That surprise stuff seems cool in the movies but in real life it might not work out like that.

Just call her and see how it goes. 




 I sat here thinking of what to say in response to this and all I could come up with was, "Wow." 




 brb. looking up "ignominy" 




 Talk to older people.  Any older friends or family you have will give you perspective on why you probably have not met the person you're going to be with for life yet.  You're only 20 with your whole life ahead of you.

The feelings you're having are natural. Give it time.  But I'll let you know now, you guys still being friends and still talking will only delay your healing. 




 I don't know if you'll see this but I am one of the most uncaring non-empathetic people you'd ever see usually. But your post spoke out to me. Please don't kill yourself. If you must get away, run away, but don't kill yourself. Trust me it gets better.  




 Obviously you already have your mind made up so just follow your heart.

Best case:  It works out.
Worst case:  It doesn't and you'll have learned a valuable life lesson in the most effective manner possible... by experiencing it firsthand. 




 It's going to take time.  There's nothing you can do.  What is it that keeps reminding you of her?  If you can you need to do everything to remove those reminders.

I had a girl break up with me but we had mutual friends on twitter.  Someone would RT her and it would ruin my day.  I created a filter in Tweetdeck to remove any tweets with her name in it.

It sounds simple but little stuff like this helped me heal and not think about her all the time.  If there's nothing triggering the memory but your scumbag brain then the only thing I can recommend is keeping yourself occupied so you don't have time to think about what could've been. 




 They're only hurting themselves with the mandatory group tip IMO.  I tip higher than the 18% normally.  But I'm so put off when I see i'm forced to tip that I just leave it at the 18% and don't tip extra. 




 Eh... If they (or their insurance) wants to pay for it then it's their prerogative.  I actually stay away from ER because the bill is usually ridiculous.  




 It's your call.  Just know if you do it you well feel horrible for awhile.  But in the long term it will be the best thing to do. 




 This is so relevant to me right now.  I wish I could upvote you more.  I'm going to save this. 




 Wow.  I know you in real life.  Small world.  I'll give this recipe a try. 




 I think it's very normal for us guys.  We get conflicted because we know we can't give the girl the relationship she deserves but don't want to hurt her feelings.

Then we end it because it feels like the right thing to do.  But afterwards we feel like shit because the girl is still sad anyway and now we're lonely.  I'm going through this process as well.  If I would have known about this subreddit I would've posted it here.

http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/16z92o/28m_broke_up_with_24f_did_i_do_the_right_thing/
 




 I just want to say that I don't think it's that uncommon at all for girl's to want sex more than guys once they get in a comfortable relationship.  I've been in that position before and it's awkward to tell a girl "No."

The rest of your post is typical relationship stuff.  You did the right thing.  You'll be alright. 




 It's probably the right thing to do.  Why did you break his heart and then ask for him back?  




 What difference does it make if it's quick?  If the other person has doubts or has made up their mind it's best to end it.  

As the dumpee you're still holding onto feelings that why you wanted it to last longer.  The other person would be doing both of you a disservice by prolonging something they didn't want to be in.  I mean, when is the *right* time in your eyes? 




 Quickly.  Either way he's going to be hurt.  You might as well let him start the healing process sooner than later. 




 This may be hard but you're going to have to separate from your feelings for a minute and think logically.

This girl...

1. Has been chumming it up with an old friend.
2. Has been avoiding you
3. Decides to break up with you on fucking Valentines Day!?!?

Sounds like she did you a favor bro.  

At best she's highly confused about her feelings and its best that she let you go while she sorts it out.  At worst she's a selfish cruel bitch. 




 Dude you are so young that none of this will even matter in the grand scheme that is your life.  Be glad you're going through it now because the experience will help in the future.

I went through my first major breakup at 28 and it was TOUGH.  Imagine being with someone for years and not being equipped to deal with the pain while all your friends are getting married.

You're 18.  You're still learning what you'll be in life.  Have fun and try to move on.  You'll meet so many women over the next few years it will blow your mind. 




 I like what this subreddit represents and all, but I feel like not giving a fuck is either in you or it isn't.  The guy that got dumped by his ex on Valentine's Day isn't going to all of a sudden stop being depressed because of a few words on here.  It takes multiple failures and an internal resolution to get to that point.  And the time it takes for that to happen is different for everyone.

Most people have to get to a point where they decide *"enough is enough!"* and change their life.

I'll leave you with a quote from Anthony De Mello.  It's in the context of relationships but I think it applies here:


"It didn’t make sense to me for many years until I suddenly discovered 
that people have to suffer enough in a relationship so that they get disillusioned with all
relationships. Isn’t that a terrible thing to think? They’ve got to suffer enough in a 
relationship before they wake up and say, “I’m sick of it! There must be a better way of 
living than depending on another human being.” And what was I doing as a 
psychotherapist? People were coming to me with their relationship problems, with their 
communication problems, etc., and sometimes what I did was a help. But sometimes, I’m 
sorry to say, it wasn’t, because it kept people asleep. Maybe they should have suffered a 
little more. Maybe they ought to touch rock bottom and say, “I’m sick of it all.”  **It’s only 
when you’re sick of your sickness that you’ll get out of it.**  Most people go to a psychiatrist or a psychologist to get relief. I repeat: to get relief. Not to get out of it"

 Because it can make a subpar photo look good.  Also, its easy to apply at the press of a button. 




 I dunno.  Heartbreak is probably the worst pain I've ever felt and I've been through A LOT in life. 




 My head exploded and ascended into the atmosphere when I saw what [this guy looked like.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laStiu_sUd4)  




 True.  But it's gotta sting knowing that the Cardinals, Seahawks, and Buccaneers have been. 




 The only NFC team that has NEVER been to the Superbowl.  That's gotta sting if you're a Lions fan. 




 Be glad you've been spared the pain of heartbreak then. 




 I'm struggling right now with all my relationships.  I just broke up with my girl because my heart wasn't in it and it was the right thing to do.

See [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/16z92o/28m_broke_up_with_24f_did_i_do_the_right_thing/)


The problem is I underestimated the friendship I had with my gf.  It wasn't perfect but at least I had someone who was obligated to put me before everyone else.  At least I had someone to vent to.

Now that I'm single and depressed nobody is around.  I have friends, but I always feel like I'm bothering them and they all have other priorities whether it's kids or a significant other.  

So this leaves me by myself.  Who am I supposed to talk to?  I feel like nobody understands me.  Even when I was in a relationship I was the type of friend to drop everything and be there for a friend in need.  


I don't have the best relationship with my family either so I truly feel Forever Alone. 




 I agree as well.  I've been depressed lately and have been rolling with the mantra, "When in doubt. Write." I have a ton of journal entries over the past two years.  It's therapeutic. 




 I don't wish mental problems or depression or anxiety on anybody.

On the outside everything is great in my life.  Good job with great salary, tall, handsome and athletic but inside my mind I've been to hell and back.  For a while I was taking Prozac but I quit it cold turkey against my doctor's orders.  That was about 2 years ago and I think I'm much better but when I have my down moments they're BAD.  It used to be better because I had my girlfriend to talk to but now I don't have anyone I feel like talking to about my problems because they all *seem* so unimportant in the grand scheme of things. 




 Doing pushups in the office would be taboo where I work.  I once did it during a brainstorming session amongst four other people in a non-formal setting and was told it was the most unprofessional thing someone had ever seen. 




 Michael or Christopher.  You're basically giving your kid no originality and asking for mistaken identity problems later. 




 This is good stuff.  I've got a Spanish learning blog where I'm applying this.  I'm also going to start a GMAT prep blog as well.  I figure if I type out daily lessons of how to study effectively then it's just as good as me teaching a live person. 




 Told my ex I cheated on her.  Even though it was the right thing and I never did it again, the next few years of our relationship were hell.

Had I not said nothing and just acted right things would have been much better. 




 Knowing when and how to end a relationship. 




 At least you're being honest.  It's hard as fuck being a black guy when you have to deal with those stereotypes tho.  And be honest, you know there are just as many white people who fit those stereotypes as well. 




 What's your racial makeup?  I'm pretty sure to get into this you have to fit a standard profile right? 
























 You're not weak.  You're just human.

Give it time.  But seriously, control what you can in order to heal faster.  i.e. don't go browsing his social media.  You'll only delay your progress. 




 When are you applying?  This fall or Fall 2014? 




 Depends on your profile (current job, undergraduate major, etc)honestly.  Your GMAT score is awesome, your GPA is actually higher than mine by a little so to hear you say its low is hilarious.

But a 3.2 in Engineering looks much better than one in Theater. 




 He's still in the "honeymoon phase."  He's probably not in love for real.  Pretty soon the allure will wear off.

More importantly, you have to be strong and not worry about what he is doing.  It sucks but all you can do is try to remove all memories, fill your time with things you enjoy, and move on. 




 I'm in the same situation.  Long arms are great for basketball for terrible for suit buying. 




 No prob.  I'm glad other people benefited from it.   




 I agree.  Every situation is different.  But I guess my post is assuming that you've done all you could to make it work but they still don't want to be with you.

I see that situation all the time on here and people are lost and don't know  what to do.  So they come on here and wonder how they can get their ex back because they've become so dependent on them and the thought of being without them is too much.

I'm just offering another way to look at the situation. 




 I wrote this in my journal as a reminder to myself.  Maybe it helps you guys:


**So you want to get her back huh?  (A conversation with myself)**


So you want her back huh?  You guys have spent 7 years together and she is the love of your life.  She is highly compatible with you and it feels like life situations are the only reasons you’re not together…



Hold your horses.  **You want to know how to get your ex back?  It’s simple.  MOVE ON.**  Assume you’re not going to get her back and live your life.  Be happy.  I know at first you thought that if she saw how miserable you were then she’d want you back.  *This is a horrible strategy.  All that does is create pity and guilt.*  It doesn't make someone want to BE with you however.  The same things that made you attractive in the first place are going to be the same things that would win an ex back.  If you’re happy and living your life you will be attractive.  

It’s basic laws of attraction here.  Think about it, if the roles were reversed.  Has seeing someone sad and upset made you like them more?  No.  Actually, hell no.  Even if you feel bad you still don’t want anything serious with that person.  People like other people who enhance their life, not bring them down.  But if the situation were the opposite and you saw an ex happy and having the time of their life without you, you instantly want them back in some way shape or form.

  
The irony of all this is that when you’re on that journey you completely forget about trying to win the other person back.  You’re genuinely experiencing happiness.  Things get to the point where you don’t even know if you’d want to go back down that path with your ex. 




 Story of my life brah.  I'm a successful engineer who has went way farther than he ever imagined.  Now I sit at my desk and ponder what's next.  That's the problem with goal chasing... You're never satisfied.  I tried to impart this wisdom on my ex girlfriend who is grinding for her PhD at the moment.  I told her that once its all over and she has a job, she'll understand what I'm going through.

What sucks even more is that you can't complain about it because people won't understand and will say you need to be grateful for what you have. 




 What subreddit are you referring to?  I'd like to see the before and after shots as well. 




 I'm stealing this tactic.  It may prove useful in the future. 




 sauce?!?!? 




 As someone who has been there before and held on way too long, I implore you to find SOMETHING... ANYTHING... to put your mind and energy to.  

Whatever it is you've always wanted to do, put your time into that.  Ever wanted to learn the guitar?  Go for it.  Ever wanted to learn how to code?  Well now all you have it time.

Trust me, it's the only way.  Because the only thing that's going to help is time and you might as well use the remaining time you have as efficiently as possible.  You MUST do this because the alternative is you could look up and still be miserable 2 years from now.

It's going to be tough but stay strong.  Eventually she'll be just a memory and it will be hard to feel any emotions about the situation. 




 I sat here for awhile looking for words of encouragement to tell you but honestly I know how that feels and nothing anyone told me would erase the pain.

So, I hope you get better.  Just know that you'll always have this community to vent to when you need it.  It does help to know that others have went through similar situations. 




 I remember doing this and getting yelled out.  "Why would you want to remind me of that?"  was her response.  LOL.

I'd say don't do it but you're probably going to do it anyway. 




 I had a 7 year relationship go awry when I was 27.  Have been spending the past two years trying to move on.  So yeah it sucks, at age 29 having to pick up the pieces again.  It's not the end of the world though.

Although I wish I could have seen it coming earlier and been settled in a new relationship by now heading towards marriage (maybe) 




 Sounds like an excuse to leave in my opinion.   




 I've been thinking about this alot.  Sometimes I can listen to a song about a breakup and smile knowing that others have went through the same thing.  Other times it just makes me sadder.

What do you guys think?

I kind of want to watch *Swingers* and *500 Days of Summer* again for some perspective but I'm scared it will make me really sad.  when I first saw them I hadn't experienced heartbreak so I could relate. 




 The first cut is the deepest... 




 I wish I could have read this two years ago.  (Ah, who am I kidding?  I still would have ignored the advice)

Good stuff tho! 




 Whoa, just let me say that I completely feel for you.  Me and my ex of seven years broke up when I was 28.  After all the ups and downs it was just over.

Like you she was my first 'serious' relationship and the first female I truly loved.  I wouldn't wish that kind of heartbreak on ANYBODY.  It's been almost two years and we're still cool but it still hurts.  I've had a girlfriend since then but I wasn't ready so I ended it.

All I can say is that you gotta try to do what you can to stay focused and give yourself time to heal.  The late breakups suck because by this point in your life you're thinking marriage and a family.  To have the person that you had in mind for that end it with you is a huge shock to your life.  Honestly, when I read posts from 18-22 year olds on here I can't help but chuckle.  They have so much life ahead of them and are way too young to be worried about it.  But I've also learned that getting your heart broken is HARD no matter how old you are.  Like they say, the first cut is the deepest.

I feel like I'm rambling but even though i'm only a couple years younger than you, understand that time heals everything and you STILL have time.  If you have a good circle of friends you can count on that will speed up the process.  I didn't have that.  Most of my friends went through this years ago and are married or heading towards it.  Reading articles and reddit posts with other people's experience helped me a lot.  PM me if you want to talk more.  




 This is good basic advice. That's what makes me so sad about my ex, she went from always being available to being consumed with her phd then breaking up with me. We're cool and tried to be friends since we were together for 7 years but I keep getting my feelings hurt because she's terrible at making the time to be a good friend. I told myself I'd wait until she graduates this year but I'm already pulling away.  




 I disagree with this. He has plenty to lose. Take it from me, I'm 29 and I can relate from having a 7 year relationship ended. Every time I break NC and reach out, I feel worse than before. Like he said it's selfish for him to contact her because he feels bad. She probably felt worse. Contacting her will probably only anger her and have him feeling worse. Best thing to do is move on and get over your oneitis. It's tough, especially at this age since it's the time when you feel like settling down.  




 Wow this is all too real.  Especially reason #1.  People will say you're jaded though.  I appreciate this discourse.  Thanks! 




 Understood.  But be honest, does part of you feel like your ex is preventing you from giving someone new a chance?  I feel like I'm doing this sometimes.  Whether consciously or subconsciously. 




 *bro hugs* 




 I tried therapy during the time I was on medication.  I went to a few sessions.  The jury is still out on whether it helped or not.  She gave me some good books and dvds though.  I'd continue to do therapy if it wasn't so expensive.  I get just as much from having a deep conversation with a good friend.  I miss my friends.  :( 




 Wow.  This is exactly what happened with me.  But trust me, you will have a day when you get angry and resent her for it.  You will have a day where you say, *"Why couldn't you stay together and accomplish your dream?  Why wouldn't you let me be your rock as you go through this process?"*  Truthfully, everybody needs support when they embark on a tough journey. 




 Holy shit!  Four years?!?!  People tell me I'm crazy for not moving on after TWO.  Stay strong my friend! 




 How do you get started with Cognitive Therapy?  Do you need to see a professional? 




 What you're saying makes a lot of sense.  I think I don't need medication because I'm not severely depressed or suicidal.  I still have my bouts but I was fine for the most part after withdrawing.  It's only an issue now because I've went through a major heartbreak and its sending me into episodes more than normal.  I don't want to do meds but if things get worse I may have to.  Being dependent on meds is my biggest fear though.  :( 




 I'm only speaking from my experience.  My doctor wasn't open to me trying alternative methods.  I tried Prozac for awhile (combined with Klonopin to help me sleep) and the results weren't good.  His solution was to keep taking it.  That's when I stopped trusting him. 




 That's awesome.  What does it look like during regular use? 




 Thanks.  I've taken GABA and 5-HTP as well for a boost.  I have a bottle of St. Johns Wort taht I never opened.

How is light therapy working for you?  I think I have SAD 




 Even if he doesn't want to talk you should say something to at least get it off your chest.

Oh and plan an exit strategy 




 I think it going away depends on a variety of factors.  My relationship with my ex-gf lasted 7 years so it's tougher for me to move on.

Sure we can talk more if you want.  Its therapeutic.  Maybe we can help each other. 




 I'll give it a try. 




 The past keeps haunting me.  Every little thing is a reminder of the *good* times.  But surely it wasn't always good?  

Why does our brain do that to us?  :(

It's been almost two years and I can't even remember why we ever argued. 




 My tips...

1. Work on getting yourself together before you even entertain her.
1. Occupy your time and mind with other things.
1. Go out and meet new people.  Make new friends.
1. Ask yourself, if she really wanted to be with you would she be doing this?
1. Give it time.

You may want to not talk to her either.  I suggest NC because keeping in touch with her is only going to prolong your suffering.  Based off what you typed, she doesn't seem real considerate.  It's natural for you to think about her.  You're going to have your down moments.  You guys were a major part of each other's past, but that doesn't mean you have to be a part of each other's future. 




 Where's the 5th starter? 




 Usually I do good.  I'd say at least 70% of the time.  The other 30% of the time my scumbag brain plays games with me.

It doesn't take much to remind me of my ex.  It could be as simple as driving by a Target and thinking, "She loved to shop there."

I wish I had that device from Men In Black that erased that part of my memory so I could live life fully without constantly being reminded of my failure. 




 Oh I totally agree.  I'm just speaking on what usually happens.  




 It's the right choice but it will eat at you for AWHILE.  Trust me, I'm going through it now.  But in the long run you'll be glad you walked away and spared them future pain. 




 Ah... good ol' NC.  I'm torn on if it works or not.  It's definitely for you and not the other person.



I've been NC by someone before for years and didn't even notice it.  This person still contacts me from time to time and still can't let go.  So in this case I'd say it's not working.

Another ex went to the extreme and blocked me from everything and pretended like I never existed.  She seems happy but when someone brings me up or she gets a reminder I think she comes crashing down.  Maybe it will work for her.

Lastly, I've tried it with the love of my life and I just couldn't do it.  Most I ever lasted was 10 days.  But every time we talked and I got some stuff off my chest I felt better.  What I wound up doing was a progressional NC that went from us talking daily to weekly and me blocking her on twitter and gchat.  Not having everyday reminders of her definitely helped in my ability to move on in life but I still haven't 100% let go.  I'm working on it tho.

**TL;DR:  NC may not work and won't make sense in every situation.  Use your best judgment.**  




 Completely agree.  I ask people what they're thinking about and they respond, "Nothing."


I'm like how can you possibly not think about anything?!?!  The concept blows my mind.  Ignorance is bliss. 




 Your relationship wasn't perfect.  Your perception of the relationship was perfect.  These new found developments have shaken your perception of the relationship and you don't want to come to terms with reality.

"When people show you who they really are you should believe them"


I apologize if any of that was harsh.  But to be honest, as a man, I've been on the other side of this.  If you're really a good gf he'll regret it and come crawling right back. 




 Story of my life breh.  Sadly it's a blessing AND a curse.  My over analyzing makes me a great engineer but its terrible in other aspects of life. 




 Calms me down and relaxes me honestly.  Luckily I don't have addictive tendencies. 




 I thought this dude was saying "You're going to die alone." and thought to myself, wow what a depressing track to study to.

But he says "Before I die alone" 




 I haven't seen any online either.  I checked all types of blazers and they were all regular.
