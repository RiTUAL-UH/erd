 emm I'll have a look :) please post here to get the community going :) thanks for the interest, I'll look for the seeds now. PC/XBLA? 




 Whoever said that looks like a penis has a pretty fucked up pair of balls 




 Hey r/minecraft, 
I recently made a new sub for players and fans of Survival Island. There you can post seeds/stories/links and posts related to the Survival Island style of playing Minecraft. You can also post sets of Goals/Objectives to be completed in game.

It's only a new sub, So it will need admins/moderators, but most of all it needs a community, There isn't much on it now, but hopefully we can kick it off soon, So any Survival Island fans on r/Minecraft, Let's get this community off the ground 3

www.reddit.com/r/survivalisland

 1. Build a minecart rail
2. Craft TNT
3. Construct a watch tower at least 15 blocks high

5. Build a fireplace using netherrack and brick. (stone/clay)
5. Create a full set of iron armor.
6. Build a tree house :D
7. Start a farm, 6 plants minimum.

 So uh...I see your "report" succeeded... :) 




 whatever, It's only a post :) 




 haha how? 



















 This has more than likely been brought up before, but I would really like to see different colored beds in the the game, Eg. The normal bed recipe with green wool = bed with green sheets. They recently did something similar, different color planks of wood. I think it would be a nice feature in the game.  




 atheist bro-fist 









 Fair point, and I fully respect your opinion, but I mean 2 million is a huge number of subs, surely they're doing something right

 Yeah, I think this one is around 1.3/1.4 which is more than a year ago 




 That sounds really really cool Hahaha :) 




 :) Thank you, it's the right thing to do for something of so much effort and time  




 that's a brilliant strategy :) I will try that myself :) 




 No problem :) 




 Ah but the bed is featured, indicating that this relativity map is of at least Beta 1.3 




 Night is on its way, but do you dig down and sleep off the night in a dingy 3x3 dirt hole, or do you dash to a village and sleep safe inside the warm walls of a house? 




 Buuuuuurn 




 Precisely ;) 




 Haha I didn't make it, I found the image a long while ago and decided to share it, credit to the original creator, must have taken him ages 




 Yep, sheep can naturally spawn in pink, very rare, but yep, they can 




 This is only a prototype after all, Perhaps in the future there will be an improved and updated version :) 




 Yes, unfortunately :'( 




 I fucking love you guys hahahaha 




 I agree 




 Hmmm, I can't remember the original source as I've had this image for about a month, But I would recommend a Google Image search for 'minecraft relativity diagram'. I will have a look around for you and link one to you if I find a bigger version ::) 




 Knew you guys would love it ;) 




 Yeah, imagine all the cut and paste and stuff, credit to the guy 









 Cause y'know, everybody drives boats

 Jeeeeeesus :( 




 Personally, the posts on this sub intrigue me, but are they some people out there, maybe even on this sub, that get off on this stuff? 




 Maybe it's because I'm not a gun-crazed American, but I don't get how this is on the front page 
























 Im just staring at the middle aged woman in the background 









 The fuck? 




 Nope, panorama shot on my S3. Hard to get it pixel perfect cause I had to move my hands, I have other pictures if you want extra proof  




 Thanks man 




 I did a panorama photo on my S3, so I had to move my phone to get the whole thing, hard to get it pixel perfect :)

 Anyone else have no idea what is actually going on? 




 Hello Michael. I want to play a game. 




 It's so refreshing to see something that looks awesome in the default texture pack 









 Could be a tegenaria atrica?  




 How long that take to happen KalTheory89? 




 EDIT: A. Versicolors are my favourite so woukd that be a good first timer? 




 I live in Ireland and looking for a low maintenance spider thats easy to handle and is calm. Average room temperature around here is 21º celsius which I think is around 60/70 F. I dont want to splash out the cash on a heater as I just want a low maintenance spider. What would be a good suggestion for an absolute beginner? And should I raise from a spiderling? 




 Never heard of them 




  I have been handling spiders I find for a while and havent been bitten. As far as I know they're so small the bite is painless and not noticeable 




 Thanks,  great answer. Georgina it is! 




 Answer: Quite simply, There are no big insects on the Emerald Isle! 




 How do you differentiate between male and female spiders?

 Patience....glue 




 Could be a recluse, That shit is dangerous 




 Its ok, the NSA will remember for us. 




 Nah, she looks about 16 to me 




 I agree great story, That's what the spirit of a spiderbro is all about!  




 Great answer, this really cleared it up. 




 From hearing all these heartwarming fables and tales of arachnid loyalty and bravery, I really want a spiderbro. Thing is where I live, Ireland, there isn't any big guys out in the wild. The biggest wild spiders you get here have a body the size of a large pea, and that's no exaggeration. I had a spiderbro once when I was young, Unnamed but valiant and the time has come where I want a watchful guardian, who protects me from the pesky flies of irish summer, a spiderbro like Viktor, or Gustav, a brave companion to stand tall for the summer months, but all the big busters (pea bodies) are nowhere to be seen. Anyone know how to attract a house/bath spider? (Bath spider is what I've always called them, as they always climb up the drains and chill) This would be a big help as I'm allegeric to most insect repellents, which is ironic. Thanks guys. 




 Oh my god this is so beautiful :') RIP Spiderbro 




 Most of you guys here own an arachnid so I'd just like to know why I see a lot of dead spiders on their backs with their legs curled in. 




 I kept watching this when I realised it looks like there's a dick on his shirt 




 'A metric shit-ton' is my new favourite phrase 




 Ironic how the god of floods is found submerged for over 1000 years... 




 Anyone see the little face with the orange lights and grill before anything else? 




 It's just like modern art, ugly, beautiful,  all depends on the eye. Personally, I like it. 




 I particularly liked the skulls 




 I've seen enough Final Destination movoes to see where this is going... 




 Nice post, poo_smudge 














 Simply block the other accounts when they appear, it will stop them coming up again. You still get all the tweets from your favourite comedy feeds and much less spam. 




 This reminds me so much of the Sign Painter from World Of Goo...

 Hey bud, I found a seed for 1.2.5 :) It's 2475069397829075708. 
It has only one tree, many resources (diamond) and an easy to find dungeon, and also some sugarcane. Hope this helps. Can you please advertise and support this community so we can find other survival fans like us :) Best of luck with your survival island :) 
























 Thanks, I'll get some cotton

 Blackhawks and Bruins are playing tonight and I won't be around to see it. I stream games on my laptop so does anybody know where I can see the game in full another time? I dont have any sports channels  tv subscriptions.

 Ok well first of all, by the expensive headset on your neck and the fact youre indoors in the dark, I'm going to be bold and assume you're a hardcore gamer. If this is the case (and I could easily be wrong) I'd recommend getting out of the house a lot.
  Go out to malls and observe the other guys there, not in a homosexual way, Look out for their hairstyles and types of clothes theyre wearing. Also might be an idea to look at the attention theyre getting from girls, say do they have a gf with them or is he talking confidently to a female store clerk. If you you fond a certain style or hairstyle that fits,  go for it!
   I would recommend getting active! Maybe you already are, but heading for a run once a week, or playing an intense game or sport with friends for an hour is great for you. You will notice your skin will start to look better and also your body! 
  From the picture you look like a real nice guy and a great, warm friend. But I'd take into account the steps ive given you and try up your rating even by 1 :)
   Also, this entire paragraph is from a guys view, so call this 'bro to bro' advice. 
  Hope all goes well! :)

 Hey guys, just want a few more subs to visit. I know there's r/survivalisland and I'm pretty sure there's a redstone one, any one know any more? Maybe pocket edition? 









 This is the 95th time I've seen that gif here 




 All I'm seeing is Finn fucking the shit out of that sword 




 I love how the guy is just there like 'dammit, not this shit again bird' 




 I live in Ireland so trust me heat is not a factor here in winter! 




 A tarantula need only eat a cricket once a week to survive healthily and happily. They can live up to around 3 weeks without food I believe, depending on the activity of the spider. However small spiders can fast longer because their bodies dont need as much fuel. Hope this helps! 




 Must be hard for this little guy to find food, great looking spider. Post this to the guys over at r/tarantulas, They love seeing high-def pictures like this! 




 I'm a big fan of spiders but this really took my breath away

 If you've seen the Lord of The Rings trilogy, we all remember the Shelob sequence. It would be sweet to recreate the scene a little, have a nice suitable enclosure and match it a bit to the movie. Then, Put the Frodo and Sam 'Warhammer' (a game involving painted detailed inch-high figurines) on the outside of the shelter. Thoughts? 




 It's as if she's popping out a clothes store fitting room with a new outfit!  "Hey OP, don't I look fab??"

 She's gorgeous!  Well taken care of and great that you kept a good eye on her during her molt. Lovely spider! 




 I love the eyes on spider 2 :3 




 Woodlouse hunter spiders have an orange/red tint at maturity so that might explain it. Hard to scale
