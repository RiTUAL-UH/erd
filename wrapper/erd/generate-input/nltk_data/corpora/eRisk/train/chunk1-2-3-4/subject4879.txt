 just because he's sitting in a normal chair doesn't mean his legs are functioning. I imagine wheel chairs get uncomfortable after a while, and maybe the chair hes sitting in is stationary, so he couldn't set his wheelchair up anyway.  




 how much money did you originally pump into this? 




 my aunt is a heroin addict. the second time she went to rehab, she met her eventual husband, another addict who fathered her child. shes obese beyond belief, and is ruining the lives of my grandparents. she has never had a job, and has lived off the kindness of others for decades. anyways, whenever we would have family dinners, she would be invited, just so we could get her 8 year old son into a positive environment for a little while. know its small, but one of the things she did that got under my skin the most happened on my aunts birthday. i was sitting at the kids table, (im too old for it, but i was playing with my little cousin) and my cousin was super excited to eat the cake we had. he spent all of dinner talking about it, just pumped up, because he never got to eat awesome food at home. anyways, desert rolls around, and my aunt gives him some cake. now, as i said, his mom is super obese, so we never give her cake and what not. as hes trying to eat the cake, she keeps nagging him to give her some, and threatening to ground him and shit if he doesn't. eventually he gives it over. it was just so fucked up to see something as innocent as a little kid eating junk food to be poisoned by such a terrible person. of all the things she has done to my family. stealing away her sons childhood is the most unforgivable. 




 i have read killing joke, dark knight returns, long halloween, all the really popular stuff. wondering if there are any super important batman reads that arent as popular as those titles.  




 not enough people live in most of these areas to justify the billions it would cost to build these stops. i hate awkwardly busing around as much as the next person, but this isn't an investment that would ever pay off.  




 clearly the work of drug kingpin, todd cannot be stopped 




 I drop my phone a lot, looking for a VERY sturdy case, at a low cost. help? 




 Thank you, its good to hear that there are other people out there who understand what this is like. I just don't think I can ever fully explain what I am feeling. Like when I first tried to explain things to my family, no matter how much I said, I could never really describe what I felt. I know I need to use the resources at my disposal, I just don't really know how. How can I be honest with other people, if I have a hard time being honest with myself?
 
























 I mean 2014. The april exams 




 Thanks. Does anyone know when the winter exam schedule is posted? 




 What is the last possible day I can have an exam in april? I am applying to summer jobs, and i need to know what the absolute date latest ill be available is. 




 I have never been planting before, and am applying to a few companies in Northern Ontario. just wondering if there is anything i should or shouldnt say in my applications/interviews.

Thanks 




 Im in first year and planning on applying to the drama program through playwriting. can anyone tell me about the portfolio submission process? what kinds of writing they are looking for? odds of being admitted? thanks 




 how bad of an idea is it ti use cr/nrc in first year? 




 could you tell me a bit about the course? what types of assignments, difficulty of exam, how good the prof was, thanks  




 need another course, preferably something with a light workload, pretty much has to be a humanities course.  
























 Just wondering when I will get my exam marks back, i wrote them yesterday, and this morning. they are humanities exams. one of them was for a seminar, if that's of any relevance. thanks! 









 whenever i open the camera app, and navigate to my photos, my phone screen goes black for a few seconds, and i hear a click, and it restarts. everything else works fine, only a few months old. running 4.4, not rooted, hoping someone knows the source of this bug, and whether or not its just kitkat being glitchy, or something is wrong with my phone. 




 reminds me of the clover field monster. 




 awesome, thanks for all the info!

i hate to bother you with more questions, but i was wondering if you knew any ontario companies as well? 

I'm trying to apply to as many companies as possible, I'm really hoping to plant this summer! 




 Im a student, but I'd like to treeplant at least for the next 4 summers, potentially even after I graduate. are there any companies you can recommend applying to, as a first year planter? 




 whats the advantage of planting in the west? and is it possible for first year planters to get jobs out there? 




 sweet, thanks 





























 this finally confirms my suspicion that girls in fact do shit. i have been lied to for years. 




 http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=25490293 any thoughts on this bag? does anyone have experience with herschel? 




 i was hoping to spend at most around 70 dollars, but that might not be an option considering some of the other responses.  




 "oh shit, i saw a picture of a shark, it must be in my room! lets get the hell outta here!" 




 looking for a new messenger bag, for cycling, school ect. already tried mec, the options werent super great. thanks! 




 this eerily reminds me of the change in dynamic between lucky and pozzo in waiting for godot. 




 i call bullshit. you have to write your instructor's name on your essays, exams, pretty much everything. either you REALLY never went to class, or this is a complete fabrication.
