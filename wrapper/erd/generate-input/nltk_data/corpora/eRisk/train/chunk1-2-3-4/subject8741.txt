 Damn skippy! 
























 It could be the reason. It's cool though, thank you for your concern :-) 
























 Thank you, I haven't herd of this site but, I'm going through it and it's very comforting to see others with issues as well. I greatly appreciate it. 
























 I have auditory hallucinations and delusions of grandeur and paranoia. I basically have voices that are there talking major awful shit about every single thing I do. And during social interaction it distracts me throughout a conversation. But with my diagnosis, I can tell when the voices are not real, it's just really tiring though. The paranoia and grandeur is very tough socially speaking, it has ruined countless relationships so, I don't really bother with it anymore other than at work...And that's made things a little bit more stress free. I am not violent physically or emotionally towards others. I have a strong stance against abuse of all types... but, as far as what I told my Dr. and therapist, it took  a very long time to realize this wasn't normal, as well as being able to admit it to another person. Then they prescribed me Zoloft and quetiapine
