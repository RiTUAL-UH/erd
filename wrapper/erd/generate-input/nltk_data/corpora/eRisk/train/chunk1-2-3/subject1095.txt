 The last line is pretty much the same as the first so how could I not? Of course it wasnt until after I read the whole thing did I realize I've been duped. 




 On the flipside generic canned ravioli is just as good as the name brand and you can get a bigger can for the same price as a regular one. 




 At least make it illegal to perform on infants who have absolutely no say in the matter. 




 I feel like I am the only who has never seen sushi at a gas station. 




 If anything it was an act of God for his chute not to open.

 I was gonna say Cocaine energy drink, but it was put back on sale not too long ago apparently. So I am going to say KMX energy drinks.  




 Yall dont happen to have coke with lime do yall? I'll totally trade a case of cherry coke of some. 




 I forgot all about those flatbreads :( 




 If I remember right these came up in an old thread and someone found a way to order them. . . 




 The Talib set-up is rather unique. . .set-ups like that are kinda hard to find...like a remote. 




 Ah Chingo Blingo. Had a chance to see him at a show in south Texas a while back. No one in my family wanted to go :/

 So edgy 




 Ah the Mighty Boosh. 




 I skipped to last line only and still assumed he was just a metal-enthusiast.  




 An excellent profession. Keep up the good work.

 The fuck kind of gif is that? 




 Did. . .did you just kill yourself? 




 Perfume: Story of a Murderer did that for me.  




 El Mariachi, while Banderas probably couldn't reprise his role from the sequels it would be nice to see it made with a budget that isnt a couple hundred dollars. Still a great movie. 




 As a Catholic, I concur that most Catholics seemed to liked it. 




 Just remember everyday is another struggle, until you wake up one day realizing you arent struggling anymore. 




 Spice used to be a brand name of synthetics, but now it is just a common term to mean any synthetic weed. 




 Been over a year since I quit. Usually smoked 10g's Over 2-3 days, but had days where I would burn through a whole bag. Got pretty bad with it. I only smoked it out of a pipe so I would collect the ash/partially solid matter  and then shift it just enough to get the white ash off. Would basically smoke and resmoke until it just couldnt be lit anymore, strangely each hit was just as strong as a fresh bowl. Most days I would smoke until I pass out for like 15-30 minutes then toke up again repeating the process until lunch/dinner with the coma-naps getting longer as the day went on. I also woulx wake in the middle of the nightbjust for the sole purpose of getting another round in. Shit took its toll fast, mostly psychologically (sometimes voices but mostly just horrible paranoia/anxiety) but did notice chest pains and was constantly coughing shit up (tooks months of being off it to finally clear it up) I did pawn shit that was and wasn't mine to pawn just to get the next sack. Credit Cards were already pretty much maxed by the time I started using, but coincidentally my minimum payment was about as much as a sack was, so the cards stayed maxed out. 

My advice is to try to come to terms with the debt pile and slowly work it off. If you havent already, destroy the cards. You can always get new ones, but the wait for the replacements should help curb any craving or momentary loss of self-control. If you aren't completely ostrochised from your family, maybe have someone take control of your funds for a bit, the first couple months are always the hardest to resist the urge to re-up.

Invest in an e-cigarette. Doesn't even have to have nicotine in it. The act of blowing out smoke can help alleviate the urge to start smoking it again.

If your drug counselling is a group setting, try to be open to the others' stories and experiences. You might find some inspiration in their life experiences. 

They'll probably suggest this at counseling, but maybe look into a Narcotics Anonymous group. I never did do that, but it can definitly help with the healing process.

As for depression, that is a whole 'nother beast that I've struggled with my whole life. Hopefully yours is just due to temporary chemical imbalances and not hereditary. Either way /r/depression is a wounderful community at your disposal. 

Everything I said/suggested is purely from my own experience. Make sure you communicate with your doctors everything as they will know the best way to help you. 




 ...which is why you can usually be out and about if you are 17 or older. . . 




 I want to believe. 




 Moby. I was the only person I knew that likes him and just couldnt bring myself to go to his concert alone. 




 If anything he'll make a good manager, probably. 




 Yea it was definitly some kind of sketch pricing scheme, but shit a deals a deal when you just wanna get high. 




 Shit or even just a Christmas Special or something. 




   This whole debacle has potentially made that much more difficult here.

I think, if NZ is really going to have a rigorous screening process for the legal highs, then this will help with the education/protection for addicts regarding it all. I mean pretty much anyone can grow weed, but how many times have you heard of someone cooking up their own version of spice in their backyard? So as long as the new screening process isnt just a red herring that they hope people will forget about, then it will be more conducive to a healthier legal high culture.

 




 I don't know about other places, but when he had it in Texas it went for about $30/10g or $20/3g, depending on brand which is way cheaper than $20/g kush or $50/14g korn. Of course the perceived tolerance IME shoots up pretty high pretty fast with the synths so what you're saving just goes towards more of it. 




 I could see that. No accepted pharmaceutical use doesnt mean it cant be straight up recreational. 




 Times like that i smoke a little bowl then go on a long spree shifting through the ground up getting it as clean as possible. 




 I've noticed Indica's do the same thing to me mostly. You ever start noticing all the ambient noises around you and start putting voices to them? 




 Extreme Paranoia? Moldy Weed? Shady deals gone wrong? 

Any and all stories that others could learn from are appreciated.

Particularly looking for stories from users that don't/can't smoke anymore due to bad trips.  




 Easily could have been at Harvard, but smoked weed and played WoW last years of high school. Didn't walk but graduated the summer after one dual credit at a local community college. 




 FTA: "The New Zealand government's **testing regime**, expected to be **as rigorous as** that applied to **pharmaceutical drugs**, means that it could cost manufacturers of legal highs over $1 million NZD (£500,000) to have each product approved.

I'm sorry but I don't see the problem here. Is this not what we wanted? A stable product that isn't going to change its chemical make-up everytime a new law takes place? I don't pretend to know NZ politics, but I know as a former US spice user that I do wish I knew exactly what I was using and wish America did something along these lines instead of wave after wave of bans. 




 It was poorly advertised and was a rather limited release. 




 Mine would be the fan-made trailer about Robin.

For actual trailer it would have to the original spiderman with venom before he was redone in the final cut.

 Man fuck this last year. Fuck it royally. Fuck the fact that I got promoted. Fuck the fact I kicked the several year long spice habit. Fuck the fact I got laid for the first and only time. Fuck it all. I still fucked up at school for the 3 or 4th time and am probably suspended from the system. . . again...I still drove her away with the creepiness and general beta-mindset. . ..still broke all the time cause I have poor money management skills...behind a couple months on my cards and will have student loans starting up again now that I'm out of school..
Fuck the fact old friends are back in town graduated and not responding to texts or calls. ..man fuckall this. At least I have my music.

Only people to remember it's my birthday is my ma, cousin, sister. Oh yea and the student loan company emailing me happy birthday trying to collect. But it's cool I get free movie tickets whenever I want. Oh and I get free stuff today at the smoke shop...
 




 So I've been looking for the lyrics for Big Rube 4:38 (Interlude) On Cool Breeze's Album and have had zero luck. It is even omitted from rapgenius. I was wondering if anyone knows whats up with that and if anyone has said lyrics. 
























 Now this week they added my state to their no ship list. . . Am I just incredibly lucky or did I get them in trouble? LOL 




 Would you play them straight through, or would you start out with some highlights? 




 As seen on Snoop Lion [here](http://i.imgur.com/v2OxaH7.jpg) 

I have always been a fan of that style headwear, but just never could find them.

 Dammit....this is the same day as Lykke Li in Kansas City. . .and I already bought that ticket. 




 Libraries arent everywhere, sadly. 




 It's not on the 65% list. Also the only New 52 it seems is Hawk and Dove vol 1. 




 I wonder how functional it is. 




 The Presence, but I feel that is cheating a bit here. 




 If I say yes, will they make a Hawkman movie(s)? 




 Is Brightest Day worth it? There are some newer trades that I want, but might hold off on to take advantage of the sale. 









 The illuminati dick. You forgot about that. 




 Ah man. Thank you very much. If it wasnt between paydays I'd give you gold. 




 [Here](http://i.imgur.com/T2qAIC3.png) we go. 




 No...at a low resolution she kinda has that face. 




 Any particular reason you don't like horror themed books? How about the other books in the Dark section of New 52? 




 Face 




 Maybe because she kinda sorta looks like Natalie Portman. 




 Think you can make one for mobile. The second one almost fits, but the text gets cut off slightly.

 I'm just questioning your definition of recent. Those have been on reddit for a minute. 




 recent 




 I never liked any of the reddit apps. 

.compact all the way. 




 Just give a little jiggle and giggle? 




 But it is still at the discretion of the venue. Looking at you Outback -.- 




 Put it in his face get that shit understood!

I was thinking something by TumTum, but this one reigns supreme. 




 As long as it isnt the purple one. That one isiffy at best for smell.

 The itchy arms makes me think this is legit. I miss salvia. 




 Dafuq kind of title is this. 




 Well I had been on celexa for a minute, so just another salvia trip as far as I could tell. 




 How about for some extra inches :3 




 I dont know if is safe, but I was on celexa when I did salvia a couple times. 




 I doubt any bus stories could top that. 




 OP cropped out the mfw 




 Batman Eternal, Futures End, JL3000, Swamp Thing Vol. 4, Aquaman and the others.

Others: Cyclops, and might try out nailbiter 




 I actually like Brownsville :( 




 No. If you sage a post, it won't get bumped back to the top. Any post that isn't a sage post essentially bumps the OP's post. 




 Glad I came to the comments. The $20 credit almost won me, but alas I have no Kindle. 




 I was kinda hoping DW 1/2 or 3 would be the first titles from the series, but this is a pleasent surprise. I wonder how hard it would be for them to port #7. . . 




 Makes me want to dust off my PS2 to play this. 




 Being a Catholic President?  




 You should watch Mr. Nobody. It is on netflix. 




 Cesar's Tacos is a delicious local chain. Can't really think of much else even though I've been here since I was born. 




 Here is to hoping for The Question getting his own. 




 I never heard of these plans to make a live action Paprika. Now I am sad it probably is not going to happen. 




 Frankenstein! This had a good run and is collected in two trades. 




 I hear good things about Lucifer. I'm going to check those out after I finish Sandman. Same with the Death Trades. 




 Shoulder Rubs. I just can't stand them at all. 




 I don't like HEB for the fact they are so far away from where I live. 




 My thoughts exactly. It would be way too loud in there. 




 She turned the alarm on and then left? I know for my system that turns on the motion sensor and would be tripped if someone walked through the house. . .

 Vampire Academy 




 A couple weeks before the end of the year is not the time to be cracking down on petty things like uniform IMO.  




 For New 52 I like the Batman Eternal weekly. The story is great and I cant wait to see how the Commissioner comes out of this. 

I've been pulling most of The Dark comics ( Justice League Dark, Phantom Stranger, Pandora) but havent quite read them yet since I am missing a couple issues here and there. The trades for them all are great. For Swamp Thing and Animal Man I just wait for their trades and have yet to be disappointed. 

Justice League United seemed to start out strong so I'll keep checking it out.
I do recommend Sword of Sorcery: Ameythst trade if you can find it. Since it was a short run it is all collected together.

Secret Origins is a nice take on the origins on well known heroes. 

Not exactly New 52, but still Vertigo, I do enjoy Sandman: Overture. However it is only two issues in and it is months in-between releases. 




 Picked up Sandman: Overture 1 and 2 the other day and absolutely loved it. So I decided to start reading The Sandman. Finished the first two volumes and I was wondering when a good time to read the Death trades would be? 




 Buy me the hoodie and you got yourself a deal. 




 Ceasar's Tacos is by far the best chain anywhere. 




 He has a Libertarian view on drug usage. But according to the end of [this](http://www.examiner.com/article/moby-talks-dating-natalie-portman-gay-bashing-and-drugs) interview he has been sober since 2008.

EDIT: Found [this](http://news.beatport.com/blog/2013/06/10/at-movement-moby-gives-us-the-lowdown-on-class-a-drugs-the-internets-diminishing-returns-and-playing-really-loud/) interview where he says "And I’m not “anti-drugs.” I’m not saying stay away from drugs. . .Have a great time, just try to have a degree of moderation and self-care applied to it." 




 Despite having the strategy guide as a kid, I could never get very far in DW2. 




 I feel he would be the one to help me acheive the ego death to finally go full vegan. It is sad tho after trying LSD when he was a teen it caused him to have a panic disorder. 

He's a remarkable and highly respectable guy. Even just his wiki page is a good read. 




 Either LSD with Moby or some MDMA with Lykke Li.

If neither are available maybe some weed with C.S. Lewis or St. Francis of Assisi.  




 No this is the internet. 




 Pull forward until stream starts so it you know where it is going to go. Then relax and let it do its thing. 




 So you are telling me you have zero food in your house and always eat out? 




 A newer one goes something like: "You'll never know, if you never do."

I can't help but think that this is subliminal advertising to get you to drink Mountain Dew. "Do the Dew" 




 Am I the only guy that uses his foreskin as a sort of guide when taking a piss? 




 In English class I fell asleep while the class was reading the book we were studying. I woke up in the middle of the teacher relaying the story about how her son committed suicide years before at our school. I just feigned sleep until we went back to reading. 




 Empire Ants by The Gorillaz 




 Tarantino originally said he scrapped the movie after the script leak. He only recently said he will make the movie after all. 




 Probably [this](http://imgur.com/hsFZeLM) picture of Lykke Li. She's a goddess. 




 In WoW if you say 'lol' in Orcish others see it as "kek". 




 Can you even catch hiv from mosquitos? 




 Apparently it was all from a relatively new, but bad batch/strain of synthetics that just went on sale. 




 It was meh. I fell asleep watching it. 




 The Secret Circle. The ending was still great tho. 




 Have a phone but cant afford a computer.

 It is a thing. But you totally probably have a sadness fetish.  




 But then she would still leave due to him popping a sympathy boner. 




 I found a copy of the limited box set for rather cheap and was wondering if it would be worth it. I saw a couple examples of it online and was rather intrigued. 




 Like the idea that his member is just not long enough? Oh ok...cool ideas, at least they got a tree planted before his ED kicked in 




 There is still magic. 




 Your gaydar is broke bro. What else do you expect from a /v/irgin 




 I just started Sandman Overture and i dont know what the fuck is going on, but I like it.

Only recently started with Marvel. Deadpool vs Carnage, All New Ultimates, Hulk, Nightcrawler, and All New Ghost Rider. Figured I'd start Marvel with some fresh #1's 




 I was thinking a Captain Morgan pose. 




 Do those subtitles actually exist? 




 Would love to see it over DFW 




 The quality of 0 is still null. 




 And they wonder why places like Fort Hood get shot up. 




 It's from the [Kim and Cookie Interlude](http://rapgenius.com/2814746) on Stankonia. Shoot I always thought it meant toe up. Like mind-blowing good sex or something. But I guess torn up still makes sense. 




 I had some ask me years ago how do I assign myself to an orientation if I never had sex with anybody. . .I was a little dumb-founded and didn't know how to retort.  




 Yea man that poodle was kinda hot

-Cpt. Jack Harkness 




 Unless maybe his individual room was locked? 
























 I kinda wish he was like the Vertigo Lucifer, but how would they have pulled off Mazikeen. ╮(╯▽╰)╭ 




 Just the mini series. I've been wanting to check out the Books of Faerie myself. 




 Looks like that one guy from the Mighty Boosh. 




 Is Diamond the only vendor source? 




 Look for small clues, like someone constantly sniffling or rubbing their nose, people taking short breaths. . . 




 Can anyone hook me up? Either as a third party or with a contact for a LCS that can help me out? My LCS's havent heard about this and there are a couple TPs i wouldnt mind getting. 




 I wish they had extended the sale by just one day T.T . . .I would get paid the day after Batman Day. 




 I'm tempted by the buy 2 get 1free online with the discounts....just wondering if instocktrades is still cheaper. . .gonna have to mess around with some numbers 




 Wait. . .so you harass her until she fucks at work?  




 It is about what was left on the loan yes. In the middle of paperwork currently to determine how they will setup a payback plan. 




 In response to your Edit 2.0:

I mean they do make test kits to find out what powder is what. . . 




 With $27k , I can pay off the attorney general and still have 8k to put towards my other loan that is close to default. 




 Is that a question or a declaration? 




 They bring crime, litter, SWINE FLU

So just like your average american? 




 It is all the red meat he eats. 




 I work the morning T.T 




 Harley Quinn's series just finished its first arc, so the next issue will be a good jumping on point. 




 Yea it is kind of an ego killer when you realize that you passed the halfway mark of your late father's life. Shit sucks when you realize you are no where near where he was at this point in life. 




 Whoops seems I was just thinking of the Baby Formula vs Breast feeding controversy of Nestle Mexico. . . 




 I believe it was Mexico. 




 Well it has a slight reference in Justice Leeague 3000, but so far is stand alone. 




 Heads up, get ready for some pretty big feels with this title. I actually cried a little in volume 3, and got kinda sad in some of the others. Still need to read the last  5 trades and the select single arcs trades.

The Deluxe Death Trade that collects all her stories in one is a decent related title at a good price. And After volume 4, it would be a good time to start the Lucifer trades if you are interested in how his story continues. 




 A couple of my favorite from the New 52 are Sword of Scorcery vol1. , Hawkman and Justice League Dark. 

If you end up liking the darker side, there is the Sandman Series from Vertigo (which is like a Mature part of DC)

Last piece of advice, instocktrades.com has trades at an awesome discount price for most comics. 




 Yea started the East of West and recently Saga thanks to the Image humble bundle a month or two ago. I need to go back through EoW again to remind my self whats going on also. 




 I started late with my **Justice League 3000** pulls so I just got the first two last week (a local LCS wanted $20 a piece so did Midtown for reg. Price) and read all 8 just the other day. It is an interesting story and how it ties in to Future's End is interesting when they mentioned they have 97% of all metahuman DNA from the island 1000 years ago. Happy to be current on it.

Ordered Outcast #1 from Image with those two, since it sold out everywhere I looked. Decent take on Exorcisms and looking forward to the explanation of his blood burning the possesed.

Read through the other day the Batman Manga Death Mask. It was an interesting story with a little background of Bruce in Japan.

Currently working on the first Hellblazer arc in Original Sins TP and enjoying it so far. 




 This should be next banner. 




 Honestly the movie with Keanu Reeves was my first encounter with anything Constantine. I know almost quite literally everyone denounces the movie as being a Constantine film, but I love it none the less. My first comic ecounter was the New 52 JLD and Constantine trades, I tried catching up with the single issues, but never really put much onto it so I just wait for trades.

Just started Hellblazer vol. 1, and am still in middle of first arc, I find it intetersting, but am going through it slow since I'm reading a couple different books at the same time.

My vote for next title is Lucifer vol. 1. 




 Fag is common brit slang for cigarrette. The first time I ever heard it, yea same reaction, but that was long before I read Hellblazer. 




 All the Xx_'s are due to the name they want being taken, so that is accurate. 




 FYI, Goobers is a chocolate covered peanut candy. 




 I'm hoping he appears in Future's End at some point. 




 It's a horror comic, also by Image, it sold like crazy everywhere near me. 




 For my it was between that or Outcast for my pulls. I chose Outcast and am going to wait for a trade on Wicked/Divine 




 My Nightwing vol. 4 is still in the mail :x 




 Watched first season of Arrow this past week on Netflix. Unfortunately season 2 isnt on it yet and my local libraries dont have it yet. Anyone know when it is supposed to come to netflix?

I've been meaning to pick up the New 52 trade of Static Shock. Does he show up anywhere outside his series?

That Marvel 100th Anniversary issue of Spiderman was fun. Kingpin in a tech-venom suit, like woah. 




 Considering they've had leaks, I don't see why they wouldn't. 




 You dont think NSA intercepts their own messages?  




 It is just that there is not only THC in weed.  




 Django Unchained TP- Gotta have some Django

100th Anniversary #1: Xmen - Really enjoying these anniversary issues.

 I'm guessing until at least this Wednesday, it has been up for at least a week already so not sure how much longer it will be. 




 Right? Well if I am to afford at least the weekly's in my pull list this week Imma have to cook my lunch/dinner at home for work. 




 I'm guessing one is the older version and not the reprint. . . 




 It is just that doesn't Constantine and Zantanna have a sorta of history together? I think she would be better to have a show on NBC if their shows end up doing well. 




 I would like to see Doctor Occult or Tim Hunter. 









 I heard you can ask for honey butter on a chicken strip sandwhich. Never tried tho. 




 Being mutilated as a baby

Fucking disgusting. 




 What kind of shit phone you have? I read it just fine. 




 Sleeping until I have to go to work at night. 




 Purfume: Story of a Murderer or Spirited Away. 




 Excellent story 




 It is the southern equivalent of Disney workers saying "Have a magical day" or something that. 




 You can't prove that. 




 All of y'all being taller and longer than I only justifies my confidence issues, at least in my mind :( 




 Check out the Sandman Series by Vertigo if you are wanting a Darker feel from your comics...shoot I started reading them when I was 22 last year.


Incase you didn't know a good place to find a lot of trade collections is instocktrades.Com  




 I was thinking it was this, just wasn't 100% 




 So jealous. What collections are these exactly? 




 Dark House is leaving soon and was Decent enough. 




 Credits are part of the run time.  




 Well it is exactly 3 hours with the 15 minute previews. 




 There is this one thing. . .what is it called. . .Reddit Platinum? 




 Shoot I work in a cinema and dont really understand what the difference is, but if someone had brought that to my attention, I would have gone to the booth and verified that the current playlist matches the projector's settings. I mean the correct format is right there in the name of the movie file.  




 Maybe he was a fan of the Sandman comics series. There is the short story in one issue where the Dream of cats tells this cat it is talking to that basically if enough people (or cats) dream the same reality at the same time the true reality can be changed. It was a rather sad story actually. 




 I was high the first time I watched Paprika, so naturally I didn't fully remember the ending. Be me, a rather overweight guy, showing it to current crush and everything getting super awkward when the fat guy gets the hot girl at the end. . .the moment was so cringe-worthy. 




 It was a little hard to follow, I'm giving a couple more issues to really decide. 




 Batman Eternal, Future's End, Sinestro, JLD, and maybe Harley Quinn #0 Director's Cut.

Others: Trees, C.O.W.L., Doop, Amazing Spider-Man, Savage Hulk, All New Ultimates, Ghost Rider, Deadpool vs Carnage, (Damn seems all my marvel pulls are this week imma be broke T.T) and need to get MPH from last week. 




 Glad I'm not the only one captivated by Trees. 




 East of West easily. 




 If they extended their service area to the suburbs on the edge of Dallas, I would actually use the service. 




 Hellraiser. I guess I just waited too long to see it. 




 I thought it was funny before I did pot. 




 Why would you say before taking it off if she never takes it off in the .gif?! 




 Maybe I have a hard on for inconcievable bugs? It doesn't matter. 




 Unless you are on xbox. . .just saying. 




 Well. . .arent there tofu steaks? 




 So we need to break down the military budget into what % of it is actually used for military research and not just straight arms productions or troop employment/deployment then? 




 If it is a Driver's License it does apply, but if it is just a straight up ID, I'm not sure. 




 I watched Unbreakable, with Bruce Willis and Sam L Jackson, for the first time the other day. Was a very interesting look at the question: What if there are superheroes, but they dont know it yet? I highly recommend it. 




 Current Runs from last week: Batman Eternal, Future's End, Harley Quinn, Ultimate FF, Elektra,

Currently slowly working through the First Lucifer Trade from Vertigo. 




 I'm preparing myself for the Hobbit Trilogy marathon that is sure to happen in december.  




 I talked to a police officer the other day at my work and apparently there is a sort of underground prostitution ring on myspace in various cities. 




 If the response was worthwhile others would let you know by the way they respond. 




 It has been off and on. 




 If it hurt us after the leak wouldnt it have hurt us before the leak? 




 Shoot it wasnt too long ago that tardigrades were all over reddit. I learned what a water bear was due to it being a meme. 




 Ive been wanting to get into the Books of Faeirie honestly. But I am up to book 6 of Sandman, but been having trouble finding it locally. 




 I wouldnt mind a DC one, dunno if you have any Vertigo but that would be dope. 




 I didnt see that being who was placing the hits on Harley. Decent enough surprise. 




 And thats why i live in the burbs 




 I didnt know it implied sexual orientation that phrase as Big Boi said in his song Back Up Plan:

I was young, full of cum, down for the skeet skeet, not dumb . . . 




 I feel like the mirror isnt exactly haunted, but begs the question that it attracts mentally unstable people. 




 I disagree, but I tend to be liberal with my judgement of short films. The last one and "O" are the weirdest. "F" tho is indeed wtf worthy. 




 Its just no matter what theme I set those couple things stay green.

Edit: looks like it is only the black theme with the green everything. 




 Shit...I wouldnt have updated if I knew it would be like this. . .it feels so wrong. 




 Everything is green. Like the letters on the keyboard when I type, the loading bar in the internet browser, and who knows what else. I tried changing the theme to all black option, but that only fixed the HTC news reading list.

Is there some way to change it? 




 I give up. I cant find a mutant with the name: O______ R___ . . . 




 So do you get a family discount on the nights she works? 









 I'll only have enough PTO by then for one weekend (〒︿〒) 




 Part of the Outkast experience is also the dungeon family being apart of it, IMO.C-Bone was there so I got a little more than one third if anything. 




 You would think, but I'm so conflicted. I've already met and seen Big Boi in concert, so that's one half the Outkast experience. And then there is rumors this is Li's last album round. Considering I'm from Texas it's an additional 3 hours to ATL than Kansas City. 




 I'm looking for an album that is solid all the way through that would compliment the discography of those three.
