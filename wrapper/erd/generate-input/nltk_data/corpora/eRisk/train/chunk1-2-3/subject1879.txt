 I want to go back into counseling. I am miserable right now: not enjoying anything, over compulsive eating, not wanting to take my meds etc. but I'm on my parents insurance and I feel so guilty for burning through it if I go back to counseling. What if something bad happens (god forbid) but the insurance is all burnt out because of me?

 I have a hard time growing out my hair without it getting for lack of a better word, gross. Been toying with the idea of extensions for awhile, and finally let go of some cash. I'm still learning how to blend them and how to make them look best, but its been fun and overall im pretty pleased with them! These are synthetic.

 Depression is caused by a chemical imbalance in your brain. So even if you're consciously trying to be happy/positive, your brain won't let it last. The chemical imbalance causes you to have low mood

 A Home Based Program Worker for a branch of The Arc
-i got kicked out of a nursing home bc the people working at the agency were fucking morons and didnt have an appropriate professional relationship with the home
-nursing homes smell like poop and diaper all the time and hearing people moan was something that happened constantly
-had a client with ID who the supervisors didnt teach her that it was inappropriate to call me 30 times a day (literally)
-was manipulated into working with a client with a lot of medical problems who needed her colostomy bag (poop bag) changed, her period pad changed, i had to lift her and wasnt nearly strong enough/prepared
-was told to spend 6 hours with a client with basically no idea what to do 

its endless. if you live in central PA and are in the human services field, talk to me before getting a job.. 




 Kevin Breel was supposed to talk about effective social media use at TedXyouth, because depression and suicide was too serious/deep. He talked about it anyway, it spread like wildfire on the internet and now he's touring the nation. Any thoughts?
