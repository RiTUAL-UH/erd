 No Goblin Techies though :( 




 To preface this, I have no problem with foreigners queuing for US servers if they can speak English. But if you can't speak English, you shouldn't be allowed to queue for US servers. Because once again I'm playing ranked captain's draft tonight and all but one of my teammates speaks English, and guess which one immediately steals captain? Yep. And then proceeds to pick a team that none of us want, and go 0-20 intentionally feeding the entire time while buying couriers and sending them into the enemy. 

Something needs to be done. Reporting doesn't do anything permanent, they'll be back in ranked doing it again in 5 games. An idea I saw in some other thread was a kind of flag where if a person is queuing for US servers but can't speak English, you get enough people to flag them and they can't queue for US servers any more. I fully support this idea. In a team-based game such as DOTA you really do need all 5 people being able to communicate and work together. I've met more than my fair share of Russians, Hispanics, Germans, etc. who come to US servers simply to troll and ruin games for us. And if people try to flag English speakers, whether they're trolling or butthurt or for whatever reason, I'm sure it wouldn't be hard to ask a few basic English questions to prove you can read/speak/write it.

What if reddit designed some sort of petition and submitted it to Valve? Or something. We talk all day about wanting something done, would it be possible to actually get the ball rolling here and try to get this fixed? This isn't just another circle jerk complaint thread, but if anyone is actually interested in coming up with a solution and trying to get it implemented I'm fully for it and will support in any way I can.

 









 Randomly three hours ago I went from being able to play fine to having a good two second lag in everything in the entire game. I usually queue for US East/West servers, but even tried a Europe East/West one and it was the exact same. Nothing changed on my computer, and nobody else is using my internet.

Anyone else experiencing horrid lag tonight?

 Also if anyone has links to articles explaining what's going on over there like I'm five, that would be much appreciated. I've tried to read some things but honestly it just confuses me.

 I'm considering a career in Audio Engineering to help my electronic music production passion and was wondering if there were any on here that would be able to give me a quick run down on what you actually do and can do with the information and degree earned from a major in Audio Engineering. 

I don't know if this is related, but if I want to work with speakers and setting up audio/visual music and light shows and etc., what would that be? 

Thanks guys. 

















































 A couple friends and I were thinking about starting a business down the road, and one of the things I was thinking I could help out with was marketing for it, but really have no idea what it's like. 

What are the kinds of classes that go along with that major?

What kind of job work would I be doing in the future? If this would vary from company to company, is there any kind of guideline or across the board generalization of it?

Is the job market good for people with this degree? As in is someone with this degree a sought after person for companies and businesses?

If our idea falls through, is this degree something I'll be able to fall back on in the future? 

These questions may be kind of vague, and I apologize if they are, but any help at all is much appreciated :)

 Me and some friends are debating on whether or not to drive to Chicago this weekend for Skream and Benga, and I was wondering what their shows have been like recently? I remember a video from not too long ago of people complaining they were starting to play "brostep" at their shows and was curious if it would be worth it still. Are they playing tunes from their early days where each set was an absolute banger or are they playing mostly their new stuff which I personally am not too big a fan of? Thanks in advance.

edit: [This](http://www.clubtix.com/images/event/full/1601_image_1.jpg) is the event page and line-up for the night, we're all mostly going for Feed Me but wanted to know if Skream and Benga would be worth the trip too.

 Basically it was Friday, their last day of school before winter break. She's 16 and she left after 2nd bell to go to a friend's house and get drunk. She was expecting to be back to school in time to catch the bus, but ended up getting really sick and got into an argument with her mom about not being home, resulting in her mom telling her NOT to come home, and that she doesn't want to "see her face again". So she stayed overnight at this friend's house, and went to another friend's house the next day to stay. Her parents are divorced, and apparently right now she is en route to her dad's while her mom is talking to the police about "pressing charges" for truancy and being a runaway.

What I'm wondering is, what are the possible outcomes? If you're a runaway, I believe the police just take you back home right? If you're a truant, if all they do is hear about it, and don't catch you in the act, I'm assuming the only thing they will do is tell the school and let the school handle it, correct? And her mom currently doesn't know she was out drinking, but apparently an ex-boyfriend who heard about all this is spilling the beans to her mom and may tell her, so if the police find out about underage drinking what would result of that? And is the friend she drank with and stayed with, who is about to turn 18, in any danger of punishment? 

Any help is very appreciated.

 Mine would be the yell Eminem does in "Just Lose It", for the lols. 




 Mt. Washington here :) 




 Mine personally was through rage comics and hearing about f7u12.  



















 Here is the link: http://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/marijuana

Some things I would like to point out to potential readers: 

"In 2009, marijuana was involved in 376,000 emergency department visits nationwide." Check the link, our own government doesn't even know how to properly site sources. The link doesn't even mention the word Marijuana anywhere in it. "Drug related" does not mean strictly marijuana. 

"And the science, though still evolving in terms of long-term consequences of marijuana use, is clear: marijuana use is associated with addiction, respiratory and mental illness, poor motor performance, and cognitive impairment, among other negative effects." Their source on this one is valid. However http://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis_myth9.shtml has legitimate research stating otherwise. An interesting thing I've noticed: the government always quotes "science" or "scientists". They have their funded websites saying everything the drug does to you and how it works and how bad it is. But in textbooks and every pro-marijuana website out there, actual college studies and experiments are sited. Ones that result in favor of the pro-marijuana side. Just thought that was funny, that even though the "science" favors one side, actual real-life tests with real-life humans prove otherwise. I encourage you to read the other 13 myths they bust. They site every study and source too. 

"Furthermore, the Administration opposes drug legalization.  Legalization threatens public health by increasing availability of drugs and undermining prevention activities." Alcohol is legal. Nicotine is legal. Nicotine is a drug. Alcohol is a drug. It is possible to overdose on alcohol, and it happens every day, and impossible to overdose on marijuana. Millions of people die each year from these two drugs that are perfectly legal to consume if you are of age. I'm not saying there are no marijuana related deaths, but if the government tries to say they oppose drug legalization, they can not turn a blind eye to the things that kill Americans every day. Potentially fatal drugs are even prescribed to people; drugs like Vicodin, Percocet or Morphine. 

Does anyone else see this as an outrage or is it just me? The government and anti-drug agencies endorse half-truths and force opinions based on pure bullshit or skewed facts. 

Maybe this is just a rant from a sad ent, but I would love to see the day when people told the facts. Even if it meant their position was compromised. The fact that it was only a click or two away from our petition is what really frazzled me. 

I will support the petition wholly, and I hope all you fellow ents will do the same. Marijuana will be legal, or at least decriminalized, some day. I'm awaiting it eagerly :)

TL;DR: Mad ent rants about government's stance on marijuana. 














 Something along these lines: At a set time during the day, but not too often to make it annoying, have the image of a small bug slowly walk across the screen and see how many people you can trick into thinking its a real bug.

 r/dota2 apparently doesn't have a sense of humor. 




 And actually it completely counts. If that had been ranked, you would have lost MMR because of that game. And intentional feeders are far more prevalent in lower "trenches" than above 4 or 5k. 

If I play 10 games in a day in the high 2k/low 3k bracket, it's almost a 100% chance that I will lose 1 or more games due to a feeder, whether it be intentional from the start or feeding from lack of skill, effort or giving up for a multitude of different reasons.

And to take a lighthearted jab at you in jest, I've won games with an intentional feeder on my team. If you're so good, why couldn't you? Just saying. 




 I don't think people above 4k actually realize how the 2k bracket works.

If you're playing a carry and you're farming, 70% of the time you will be flamed for not participating in the minute 10 team fights your team is stupidly engaging in, 50% of the time resulting in a teammate giving up and playing even worse.

If you're playing mid and you don't gank side lanes immediately upon hitting level 6, especially if a sidelaner dies once, 60% of the time you will be flamed and that member will give up.

If you're supporting and your carry dies you get flamed, even if its a 2v3 engagement and it was his stupidity that got him killed, and he gives up.

From what I've read, yes this happens above 4 and 5k, but it happens FAR more often in lower "trenches". I would actually bet money and highly doubt a 5k could take my account and win 10 games in a row just based on the fact that if you don't play like your teammates think you should, they give up and it basically becomes 4v6 or even worse 3v7, because the member(s) that stopped trying are essentially dead weight and benefiting the opposing team more than your own. 

 




 You're fine. What is your MMR, just curious?

Also dotabuff for that game, because it's easy to lie over the internet ;)

Graduated in 2012. I can't find the source, but IIRC we were ranked #36 in the country in academic level for public high schools. We were the #1 high school, both private and public, in Ohio.

To graduate with Honors you had to meet 7 out of 8 requirements. The only requirement that I didn't meet was GPA. Examples of other requirements were a passing grade in Physics AA or higher (passed AA with a D) and Calculus AA or higher (passed AA with a D), and certain amounts of other credits (for example I took Photography and Digital Imaging for an extra Fine Arts credit).

I found out three days before graduation that I was graduating. And with Honors! My senior year I was less than 10 recorded absences away from failing the entire year. 

 




 Just tried to find a match for the first time today, spent 10 minutes looking for a server.

Are they fucked again? 




 I bet you play on US East. 




 Yeah it's either AJ or Whitworth, as said below. But neither of them really have any misconceptions. 

Honorable mention to Kevin Huber, top 3 punter in the league. 




 Reply to this comment so I see it 




 Do it then. 1 person doesn't win a game. If so, if you calibrated to 3k then you would win every single match until you got back up to whatever MMR you are now.

Do it if you're so confident.  




 I'm already the best person on my team every game. And in most games, the whole lobby.  




 I played as Sniper with a pocket Omni yesterday. It was essentially 3v5 because the Slark fed and Huskar got butthurt that Omni prioritized me over him (Huskar was pretty garbage) and spent the rest of the game afk farming instead of helping team fight. 

We actually would have completely won if Huskar hadn't have given up. DP pops ult, Husk and I both ult her, dead DP, no push. They had one or two lanes of racks at 30 minutes, and me and pocket Omni were staving off their final pushes every time, but as I was maybe 500 gold from a Rapier (which probably could have won us the game) I finally died, had to buy back and they took the final racks. Sniper and SF are both incredibly overpowered right now.

http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1320883650 




 My volume was up much too high for that.

RIP ears. 




  they must be doing something else better than you that allows them to win games and get to that MMR.

Yeah their team probably carried them to their wins. I'm at 3k and I'm consistently top 2 best players in the lobby. The ONLY thing that keeps me from winning every game is the rest of my team. If I'm mid, my side lanes feed. If I don't play mid, the mid loses and their SF goes 18-0 and we lose in 28 minutes (and before you say you should have ganked the SF, I try to. If the mid sucks, it's incredibly difficult to execute a proper gank). Couple that with people in 3k still thinking if you're mid you should be ganking at 4 minutes and "wtf why would I gank mid that's your job", and you can see the issue.

I've analyzed plenty of my own replays, and while yes there are mistakes that I make, very few of them are game-changing in any way. 

I'm not sitting here saying I'm perfect, but MMR is not an accurate representation of skill in any way. If it were, it wouldn't be a static +/- 25 based solely on win/loss. It would be based on player performance. 1 person can't win a game every time. Yeah you can snowball and give your team the best possible odds, but 1 person will not consistently win a team-based game.  




  If you're on the same team with them (and at similar MMR), it's likely you're also "legit clueless"

That's actually completely not true. It took me 10 minutes to explain to a South American yesterday that certain abilities (in this instance Culling Blade and aghs Laguna Blade) pierce spell immunity. And I'm at 3k. Or the stupid amounts of MoM Slarks I see every other day.

I've lost every game since calibration on this account (roughly three weeks of playing) that I don't play mid. It's obvious at the end of the game that I'm the best player, I have the best gpm, xpm, KDA, etc. regardless of win or loss. So I need to be in a core role, because a good core carrying shit supports will win games way more often than a good support supporting shit carries. 

 It's likely that person you think is clueless does something well that you do poorly.

Yeah, feeding. 




 I'm still hoping Zim comes back to us. 




 Can confirm. Completely blew off high school, graduated with a 2.2 GPA and Honors status from one of the top 50 public high schools in the country.  




 DIET Mountain Dew? That shit is disgusting. 




 Single player games tend to bore the hell out of me, so if I want to have any semblance of fun playing a video game it has to be multiplayer. Call of Duty used to be my crack, but it's since gotten boring. I've logged more hours on Dota 2 than I'm proud to admit, and I'm being completely honest when I say this, the only thing that makes me stop playing this game is the fucking South Americans. I'd been playing for basically the past 12 hours, with a couple breaks to eat and watch a couple episodes of something, and I just closed Dota because I lost 50 mmr because of fucking South Americans.

The game is beautiful. The players are the worst thing in the entire world. I keep coming back because I love the teamwork aspect and all of the crazy mechanics, and keep getting turned completely away because of third worlders. This game would be perfect without a toxic community (South Americans).

 The point is that money is used by ultra-wealthy individuals and corporations/organizations to influence political legislature. And that's not okay, considering the politicians are supposed to be acting in the interest of the masses, not just the 1%.

It boils down to if you were a senator or congressman, who would you support? Ten million people who gave you nothing, or one person who gave you ten million? This is a capitalist society where money rules everything. And it's fucked up.

 The most harmful thing about marijuana is being caught with it by any type of authority that doesn't allow it.

 When I was barely a week or two old, my psychotic aunt took fingernail clippers to my nails thinking she was doing my mom a favor.

This made me cringe. Well done.

 We now go live to Ollie Williams with the blackie weather report. Ollie?

*IT'S RAININ' SIDEWAYS* 




 Don't we always have a ton of cap space to work with, but the front office just doesn't utilize it well? We're never the team making big moves. 

Yeah we just signed AJ Hawk, but even though he's a recognizable name, it's not like he's top 5, or really even 10, at his position. 




 The Colts have won the AFC South all but 4 times since '02.

In 5 years, that number will be 5 at highest. 




 For only 2 years though? And he's getting up there in age. 

I'm surprised I had to scroll this far to see a Bengals flair though. Initially I thought we would be one of the front-runners for him, but hopefully we're looking to grab someone younger. 




 We know what we're doing (by we I mean the Bengals organization, *not* the fanbase), we're putting faith in him. Whether or not that's the right decision will be figured out in the next few seasons. I'm always one of the first to criticize Dalton but he's led the Bengals to the playoffs more in 4 years than Carson Palmer did in 7, with comparable weapons.

Cutler's been around since '06, Dalton only since '11. 

You also have Tannehill in Tier 6 even though he's started 3 seasons and hasn't seen playoffs once. 

Not trying to nitpick super hard, but just saying.  




  Tier 6 (We go to the playoffs with this guy)

Considering Dalton's led us to the playoffs 4 years in a row, even though we didn't make it past the first round he should still be Tier 6. This year's loss wasn't his fault, we were missing our first 3 or 4 string WRs. 




 FUCK YOU I WON'T DO WHAT YOU TELL ME

 Best against Medusa though. 




 I love to lane against Kunkka as Nyx. Even though the Carapace cooldown is longer than Tidebringer, if you get your timings right you're in for a lane of lols. 




 I completely lost it at that point. +1 




 Hello! I'll be in Las Vegas this coming week for the first time and love beer. Suggestions?  




 Troll a problem in team fights? Pick Omni.

Troll a problem for split pushing? TP 2 heroes to tower and kill him/counterpush.

He's not broken. 




 Lydia is a fucking bitch. 




 3k. Nothing spectacular. But the second I get BoTs, whether it's early or late, I turn my focus to getting kills. Even TP'ing in at the last second to get a rocket kill is a huge boost for your team.

It seems to me at least that tinker isn't just a solo hero any more, he does rely on the team around him. I don't think that makes him bad, it just reduces the stomp factor. 




 Valve would probably do this. 




  if someone ganks you before travels and take your stack, you've almost lost the game singlehandedly for your team as you're now a liability during his most effective window, he falls off a lot, and to catch up you have to vacuum your carry's farm.

That's true for almost any traditional mid hero. Gank the sniper, gank the viper, gank the zeus, gank the storm, etc. Just because there are ways to counter him doesn't mean he's bad.

Maxing Q/W in lane is extremely strong against most heroes. I've gotten more kills then I can count because of a rocket to drop them a tad, wait for it to come off CD (this works best against mids that don't run bottles), laser, rocket, rearm, rocket. It's definitely not as easy as it was before, but in my personal opinion he isn't bad. 




 Tinker just relies on a team moreso now than he did before. He's also not supposed to be a carry, he's a core. There's a difference. March spam defending T3's is still not something to be underestimated.

I'm 12-4 in my last 16 games as tinker. Granted, this is on my smurf account so many of the games were against lower skilled players, but really he's not fundamentally different from a Viper mid. Viper falls off late game, but it's his participation in the 2-3 hero ganks/skirmishes in the 15-30 minute range that can give your team an advantage. The way I played him, I would almost stop farming creeps altogether and consistently solo kill the heroes I was able to. This frees up farm for our hard carry, gives me ~400 gpm if I get two kills a minute (which shouldn't be hard unless you're losing or the enemy team picked a lineup that groups up early mid game and pushes), and sets the opposing team back on farm and levels because I'm constantly killing 2 of them.  

Tinker was almost always weak late game. BKB completely countered him. He's a hero now that can still stomp in the hands of a skilled player, but not everyone can pick him and win a game solo. He was overpowered before the eblade/march nerfs, but I actually think he's balanced now.  




 It takes a lot more skill to be a dominating tinker after the march nerf than before. While that doesn't necessarily change pro play as much, it destroyed him in pubs. 




 My winrate as tinker is higher than any hero. He's not a bad and weak pick, but these days you can't take over a game like you used to be able to. I would go something like 30-2 in a 40 minute game before the eblade/march nerf because I had BoT, SR, Blink, Dagon1, Bottle before 20 minutes from ancient stacks and that's enough burst damage to fuck almost anyone over anywhere on the map at that time. I would just pick off supports for the next 5 minutes, get my eblade or Dagon5 and then I was near unstoppable.

You can't easily do that any more, so tinker is less of a mid-game dominator and relies more on his team for assistance. It doesn't make him bad, it just makes him less of a snowball hero.

 




 The age of dagon/eblade ended with the nerf to march and eblade. Don't remember exactly what patch that was though.

Although I still play it occasionally. The projectile on eblade wasn't even a huge nerf, you can still 100-0 someone if you just blink on top of them, eblade and light them the fuck up, depending on the hero of course.  




 This needs to be answered. 




 We need the best DE available imo.  




 Did anyone else think that said RTZ and got extremely confused?

 Andy Dalton 




 Bengals have 2 SB appearances plz edit 




 Jeremy Hill. The guy only started maybe half the games last year but put up really big numbers for a rookie. If all of Cincinnati's offensive weapons stay healthy, he could get a lot of room to work with and put up even bigger numbers. 




 They've been the Redskins since the 30's, if I'm correct. Nobody said a word about it before last year.

It's not even an issue, it's just people causing drama to cause drama.

 Because DotA servers are currently really shit. Especially the US ones. 




 I used to play CM carry when I first started out. Tranqs, Dagon, RoA, BKB, Blink, Eblade/Veil. Shit was disgusting. 




 Use bear as distraction...new meta 




  People in this MMR do not have trouble farming adequately

At almost 3k? Oh yes they do. Not all, but a very generous percentage stop cs'ing as soon as 15 minutes hits. It's not uncommon at all to see a 40 minute game end with only 2 heroes above the 150 cs mark.

 valve plz 




 Lol it wasn't someone in the game, the servers just choked on a massive dick for everyone. 




 Blink, TP scroll/BoTs, Force Staff.

I'm saying Force Staff because positioning is key throughout any stage of the game, especially post late game when items don't necessarily matter as much and it all depends all team play. 




 I play the game because I like playing the game. The items are cool, but since they provide nothing other than cosmetic value and no advantage for my hero mechanically, I'm not butthurt that I'm not getting any.

And you shouldn't be either, considering it's completely free to play. 




  What if players **had** to vote

No. It should be optional. 

 




 First punter in post season history to throw a TD pass? Is that really true? 




 First punter in post season history to throw a TD pass? Is that really true? 




 Commence breaking of reddit. 




 Woah, this thread is making reddit implode harder than Wilson. 




 Just got to this game thread. The fuck is happening out there? 




 What song is this? 




 Since nobody mentioned it: Gladiator 




 Don't forget Poorly Drawn Lines! 




 We need another solid CB to replace Newman. Dennard is looking promising, but another definitely wouldn't hurt. 




 Uh, he just finished his 4th year and still hasn't fixed his overthrowing problem. That's a pretty big deal.  




 This wasn't on Andy. We were missing 5/6 of our top receivers for this game. This game came down to Marvin Lewis proving once again he's incapable of winning big games, and also our D Line not being able to pressure Andrew Luck, resulting in the Colts offense to execute whatever they wanted. Andy didn't play spectacular, but this loss isn't on him. 




 It isn't all his fault. Yes he overthrows, that's the only consistent thing he's done in 4 years, but we were also missing 5 of our receivers. This game came down to the coaching staff, 90% Marvin Lewis, once again proving they are incapable of winning big games and our defensive line not being able to put any pressure on Luck, which allowed their offense to basically do whatever they wanted. I'd say this loss was only 20% Andy's fault. 









 Their win just made our playoff chances easier. While I'm not one to root for the Steelers in almost all situations, the win did us a favor if you look at playoff implications over the next two games of the season. 

Do I think we CAN win both games? Yes I do. We have the tools and we have the talent to pull out the wins. Do I realistically think we WILL? No. It will be a pleasant surprise if we do, but the coaching staff just isn't good enough. Look at this year's primetime games and games against top teams. We get behind early due to lack of preparation, abandon the run, and rely on the under pressure side of Dalton's passing to get us back into the game. And then we get stomped to the tune of 43-17 (Patriots Sunday Night), 27-0 (Colts), 42-21 (Steelers), 24-3 (Browns on Thursday Night) because he is not the elite quarterback that wins you games.

If we lose both games and still make the playoffs, you have the Steelers to thank. Just saying. 




 This game was atrocious. The ONLY good thing about this game was Marvin's call in the last 30 seconds that saved us from losing. Everything else was an absolute shit show.

Dalton showed us once again how much he can choke. Our defense, albeit being quite talented, missed multiple tackles and interceptions that ended up leading to big plays for TB. The offensive playcalling was better, but we fell into the same trap at the end where we were extremely predictable. There were also many stupid and unnecessary penalties, though the ones on Green and Newman were definitely questionable. 

We did not win because we were the better team. We won because we got lucky that Tampa Bay shot themselves in the foot harder than we did. If there is anything to take from this game, it's that the Bengals are still the same inconsistent team that can squeak out victories against sub-par teams and get stomped by good ones (Patriots, Colts).

I will be genuinely surprised if we don't end up 8-7-1. 




 These teams prioritized drafts that were aggressive early and had the main priority of taking down towers while simultaneously being good at defending their own. Their mindset was to get an advantage before their opponent, capitalize on it, and snowball to the point where they either took the Ancient or built an advantage so large that the enemy team essentially would just give up. It was objective gaming. The object of Dota is to destroy the enemy Ancient while also defending your own, not to farm heroes for 60 minutes.

If you're playing for five million dollars, are you going to play the game like Call of Duty and just kill everyone on the map, or are you going to play to win?

Quit crying. 




 Noticed this in both games I've played today, that when I pick a hero and go into a game I'm unable to open the shop or left click on the mini map to move the view around. I have to completely exit and restart dota in order for it to work correctly, and this has never happened to me before.

Anyone else experiencing this?

edit: I've spent time before the games watching TI4 replays, as someone mentioned below that it can be caused by spectating. In queue for a game currently, haven't watched a replay since last restarting dota so I'll update after I find a game.

edit2: Seems the big is indeed caused by watching replays. I don't want to say it's caused by spectating, as I've spectated live games in the past directly into a game and it hasn't happened.  




 In the jungle, if you wanted to maximize efficiency from Midas, does it matter which creep in a camp you use it on? For example early game in a Satyr camp, using it on one of the smallest satyr's will definitely give you more gold than just killing the satyr, but would the time taken to kill the biggest satyr normally instead of midas'ing it vs. the smallest satyr to get to the next camp outweigh that? Same goes with the wildwing's or wolves, do you want to Midas the main creep or one of the two smaller ones? 

And as far as experience goes as well, would you want the 2.5x from any particular creep or am I just thinking into this too deeply?

 




 IG, Vici, Newbee, they're rolling over teams with their massive amount of early push and most teams are just letting them do it. 

Shadow Shaman is the core hero in this strat, and yet I haven't seen him be first phase banned in any of the games so far. I can understand not giving up a Doom or Dire Lyan, but teams are also still first phase banning Batrider against Chinese teams that hardly pick him. 

And when they do first pick SS, why are teams not 2nd phase banning a DP? Unless you draft a lineup specifically tailored to defending a tower against BOTH of those ultimates at the same time, they're just going to take each tower uncontested, have more gold than you and end the game in 30 minutes because they're playing objectively. BKB doesn't stop the physical damage from both of their ultimates, if you're fighting into that you need to have a significant advantage or else you'll get ran over, and that's exactly what's happening.

The metas are different for each region. Heroes are valued differently in each region. Yes, it's starting to mix now that teams from different regions are playing each other a lot, but to me it just seems that Asian teams are drafting and banning significantly better. It seems that EU teams are drafting against Asia teams based on the EU meta, and that's not exactly what you want to do. Another example I can think of is constantly giving Universe his tidehunter, which is what wins EG a big percentage of their games. 

Thoughts?  




 Well that was fast. 




 Just downloaded whatever game client update they just implemented, and I'm trying to select the hero for the three votes. When I select a hero, it shows up in the box and then disappears and goes back to the "select hero" option.

This happening to anyone else? I've closed and re-open dota and it's still doing it.

edit: Just checked the client update post and noticed it was indeed confirmed as a bug. Carry on. 




 To preface this, I live in US East. When I'm awake between the times of 6-10 AM, not many people are playing DOTA on US East servers so it can take upwards of 10 minutes to find a game. My ping to EU West is under 150, so sometimes I queue there to get faster games. 

How the fuck do people play on this region? In the 15 or 20 games I've actually played on this region without fail at least 3 of the 9 other players do nothing but troll and flame the entire game. You don't even have to do anything to them, they'll just start flaming you for no reason. At least on US East you actually have to make some hostile action or comment to initiate the flame war.

What's more surprising is that I've always thought that EU players were supposed to be more skilled than US players. I'm no pro, I'm around 3k and the 3k players on EU play like players I've seen under 2k on US. Some of my games yesterday morning were played with some of the worst players I've ever had the misfortune of playing with. 

I know a lot of people, myself included, rag on US servers for having south americans ruin games, but your EU servers are ruined by your very own Europeans.

What keeps you from smashing your computer monitors every time you connect to a game? 




 In the final results screen after a match you can commend or report, is there any way to commend or report after you've disconnected? I just played a game where I wanted to commend a couple people but habitually clicked out of it before I remembered. 




 Was playing a game earlier against a PL that was able to farm a lot more securely than myself, and we already had ways to deal with his illusions so instead of getting a BF I got BKB Basher (was up against a lion tide and shadow shaman) and was repeatedly told by my teammates than I was an idiot and BF is way better. 

We ended up winning after their Tide abandoned and a few big team fights because of my BKB, avoiding Ravage and their massive amount of disable, but did I make the wrong decision? From what I've heard BF is a farm accelerator, I already built a midas and there was no way even with a BF I was going to outfarm the PL, so I got items that helped me take fights immediately. 

Thoughts? 




 Does anyone know what games are featured in the BTS intro? When the commentators yell "He's still alive" and "They're all dead" etc. 




 When you're killed, say the enemy has a mythical sword and a couple uncommon cosmetics equipped; how does it decide which item is highlighted under their portrait? Is it by rarity, random or what? 




 Aside from the internet bill you already pay, this game is completely free. Yes, there are an endless amount of things you can buy but you are not REQUIRED to buy anything. 

That being said, I would be more than willing to pay 5 dollars a month if that's what it took for Valve to implement region locked servers. Maybe not even all of the servers, you could leave the US West/East how they are, but people who choose to pay get a server called US Locked where you can only join if your IP is actually in the US for example. 

I love the teamwork and strategy and everything that goes into this game, and when three out of my four other teammates can't even speak the language of the server they're on it really just ruins the experience. And I know that is true for multitudes of other players in this game.

This would probably lead to longer queue times and bigger gaps in individual MMRs between players in games, as I know it will probably be the minority who would actually pay for it, but I'd rather wait an extra couple minutes for a game than get one in thirty seconds that is full of South Americans.

Thoughts?

Edit: Looks like half this subreddit got their cereal pissed in this morning.  




 Not sure if this is intended, or if I'm doing something incorrectly, but I was playing a game as Enigma yesterday, had my Soul Ring in my inventory and when I would click, hold, and drag to swap it to another slot in my inventory it would activate it. I've never seen this happen before with any items, not Treads or Phase or Mek or anything.

I played a game with Tinker a little bit later and don't think I noticed it happening, although I was sleep deprived at that point and maybe I just didn't move the soul ring or didn't notice it happening. Thoughts? 




 I know a little bit about how to draft and run them and when, but if anyone has a good explanation or a handy link they might be able to throw my way that would be much appreciated!  




 Is this intended? Got LP the other night because I got kicked from a game, couldn't reconnect, had to abandon. Played through a LP game where a few people abandoned, but my team won and I didn't get credit for the win but I figured it was because of the abandons. But just now I won a game with no abandons or anything, and didn't get credit for the win.

The tooltip only says "match-making". Does Low Priority not count as "match-making", or is this some kind of bug?  




 Like how you can watch the D2CL, etc. in-game, can you do the same with TI4? 




 When you physical attack with a Deso in your inventory, does the debuff get applied before that first instance of damage or is the attack damage applied, and then the Deso debuff applied? 









 So I abandoned one game because the captain was a troll and picked 5 hard carries while laughing at us the whole time, and my computer froze during another game later and I got an abandon for that so now I'm in low priority. It said I have 5 games remaining, but I've played through 2 so far and it still says 5.

Anyone know why this is? 




 Is this true? Granted, he can't carry as hard super late game with equal farm as a Spectre or Anti Mage maybe, but if the average game time is around 40-50 minutes, isn't he still a very viable option provided he can actually get the farm? Whenever I try to pick him in CM there's always someone telling me he isn't a hard carry, but when I play him I go solo offlane and usually build AquilaPhaseSnYDeso/Diffusal/Butterfly/MKB and can literally 4 or 5 shot supports. And his ult reveals invisibles, and provides movement speed and extra gold for the whole team.

Thoughts? 




 Dotabuff, I'm Weaver: http://dotabuff.com/matches/579545847

I was the captain too! Solo offlane weaver, lion TP'd up a couple times for a gank because they were pushing the lane really hard and after a couple kills and a quick linken's and even quicker butterfly it was over. 

I just wish I could do this in all pick or even captain's mode really. Nobody ever trusts me when I want to solo lane a weaver, even though some of my best games in unranked pubs were weaver mid. 

Kind of also looking for feedback though, I played a pretty flawless game but it wasn't perfect, if some dota pro's in here have some advice for me I'd gladly accept it!

hashtagroadoutof2.4kMMR 




 So Mask of Madness causes you to take additional damage according to the tooltip. How does this work in conjunction with items like Blade Mail, or passives like Centaur's Return? Because you are taking more damage via the MoM, will you be dishing out more damage as well or does it not work that way? 
























 The prettiest people do the ugliest things. 




 Wut? 




  it's kinda pointless to discuss strategy in pubs

Uh, actually that's most of what this subreddit is for considering 99% of the people on here only play pubs. It's actually more pointless to talk about pro dota considering, again, that 99% of the people on here are not pros. And neither you nor OP specified which you were referring to.

Bye Felicia. 




 Yeah but that applies to any hero, not specifically these 4. 




 Well, there's this super cool thing called Google that I guess not many people have heard about that has dozens of guides on how to play this hero. 

But since you're lazy and I'm bored, you start off by maxing your Morph ability and Waveform, stopping off to take your Ultimate at 6. Morphing to agility gives you more damage, but less health, and morphing to strength does the opposite. Finding the correct balance in the early game takes practice and depends on the lanes. If you're in a safe tri lane, you can afford to morph more agility for damage to ensure last hitting because you won't be taking near as much harass as say if you were running mid or offlane.

The way Morphling wins late game is having a shit ton of damage and a shit ton of armor from maxing out your Morph ability on Agility. You build items that give you survivability, such as Linken's Sphere, Butterfly, I've seen Skadi Morphlings before, etc. The Eblade build, or Shotgun build, is used to blow the everloving fuck out of one of the enemy heroes, usually a key support or utility hero, at the very beginning of the fight making it a 4v5. The Eblade nerf hurt this build however, so I'm not sure if it's still too viable. Morphling is rarely run in this current meta. Eblade increases magic damage taken, and a maxed out Agility Adaptive Strike plus a Waveform does a metric fuck ton of damage and will usually 1 shot somebody below 2k health, maybe even more. I'm not bored enough to do the math. This however falls off in later portions of the game when enemies build BKBs and get more health in general.

Your ultimate is used in multiple ways. You can make a replicate of the enemy hard carry and use it to attack for your team, or make a replicate of a teammate to send to another lane to jump to to continue farming when you've pushed your lane too far out. Additionally, you can instantly replicate out of a sticky situation in a fight where you might die by sending the replicate out of the fight or keeping it back beforehand.

If you're ever in a pickle, you have two options. Replicate out, or start morphing to strength to gain a ton of health and hopefully survive where you might have died.

The general build I used to run was Acquila  Treads  Linkens  Eblade  Butterfly Skadi, and by that point the game was usually over. I haven't played Morphling in months however. Once you have Eblade, you want to be running around with maxed or almost maxed agility to pull off your Shotgun combo effectively. 

Morphling isn't a hero that can 1v5 and destroy the enemy team, usually. Because he requires the maxing of agility and reduction of strength to do the most damage, he is vulnerable and requires heroes around him that can protect him and pull aggro off of him if needed.

One cool thing to note is that you can Morph to strength or agility while stunned (definitely) or rooted (I believe). However, not while silenced. So if the enemy team has silences that could fuck you over, consider building a Manta.  




  Tinker gets destroyed by Sniper in lane

Wut? My 3k Tinker shits on Snipers in lane. Fuck going March build, just rocket spam him. Maybe it won't work in Very High Skill brackets where Snipers run bottles, but if you're in "the trench" Tinker should easily win. 




 Blink, Laser, oh no troll bkb'd!, Ghost Scepter, Rearm, Ghost Scepter, Rearm, Ghost Scepter, Laser, Profit. 




 Anyone who's good knows he's not a support. Wait until your trash tier carry stops farming at 10 minutes to go teamfight before he's ready, secure lane farm for yourself and let him die, dominate the mid game kill stealing with your ult and laugh in their faces when you carried harder than they did.

 




  where the only time I'll need it are if I get an Illusion rune or for some reason build a Necro book. And in that case I can just CL cycle them if I need them to do something different than what my hero is doing, yeah?

 




 Mine, keeping in mind I don't use quickcast. That's probably because I don't use mouse movement and have never really seen the point of quickcast:

123456 - spells (Played WoW for 4 years where your spells took up 1 through =, so hitting the 5 or 6 is already muscle memory and not an issue at all)

TAB - select all units

CAPSLOCK - cycle through units

Space - Select Hero

Q - attack move

E - Stop/Cancel

ZXCVFR - items

WASD - Camera Move

Basically the difference I'm seeing is that if I use mouse movement, that frees up 4 buttons to use for control groups. But what I'm also seeing is that only helps me play micro-intensive heroes, which I have no real interest in playing anyway because they just aren't my style, and that's less than 5% of the hero pool. Control Groups are useless on something like a Lion or Magnus, where the only time I'll need it are if I get an Illusion rune or for some reason build a Necro book. And in that case I can just CL cycle them if I need them to do something different than what my hero is doing, yeah? 

My hand position rests with pinky finger on Shift, ring finger on A, middle finger on W, index finger on D, and thumb on C, so all of the above buttons are able to be pressed instantly. I do use Edge Pan as well though, so I suppose I use a mixture of Edge Pan and WASD. 




 Why are they inferior? If I'm using keyboard controls, my mouse is free to go wherever I want it to, rather than it being on the edges of the screen using Edge Pan or MMB.

It's not any slower, because Edge Pan and WASD movement are both dependent on what your camera speed is set to. Mine is set pretty high, and my WASD actually moves my camera faster than what MMB does.
 




 I can see how the control groups would be more efficient for illusions and summons. 

But if I'm playing a Weaver, Tinker, Centaur, Magnus, QoP, Lion, Crystal Maiden, Earthshaker, or any of the other heroes that don't require the use of illusions or summons 99% of the time, what are control groups used for?

And I know I'm going to end up typing something in caps in chat more often than not, but eh. It'll work. 




  select illusions/summons 

I've got that on TAB for all and CAPSLOCK for cycle currently.

 select hero button

Space bar.

 chat commands

Actually that would be useful considering I'm still using the default Y+mouse direction for those. 

 awfully slow compared to all other methods.

Really? I've got my camera speed up pretty high, it doesn't seem like it's any slower than Edge Pan or MMB.

I dunno it just feels like I'm not grasping the concept of why WASD is so bad.  




 The way it looks, if I want to move the camera up with MMB, I have to click and drag down. What if a hero is running up and I want to follow it with the camera, using MMB, and cast an ability on them? I'm dragging the mouse AWAY from where I want to be casting my ability, meaning I'll then have to move my mouse back from the bottom, to the top to cast an ability on the hero. Whereas with WASD I can just hold the keys and keep my mouse free to click wherever I want. Edge Pan would work the same as WASD in that sense, but MMB seems like it would be way more garbage. Unless I'm missing something.

edit: I was missing the option to Reverse Camera Grip. 




 Attack-move is Q, I have Stop bound to E. 

I never use the Move command, if I want to send a unit somewhere without issuing an attack command I just select it and right click it to where I want it to go. 

I figured out above how to cycle through controlled units, something I had always thought I could do but accidentally unbound some time in the past. 

I played WoW for 4 years, where your spells took up 1 through =. I have no problem at all doing the quick reach to hit a 5 or 6 if necessary if I even choose to play those heroes.

Currently my setup is 123456 for skills, WASD for camera move, ZXCVFR for items, TAB is select all units, CAPSLOCK is cycle through units now that I figured that out. 

I don't know, I've never felt like I had any issues being able to play any heroes this way. I consider Tinker one of my best heroes and playing him requires hitting up to 7 or 8 different keys in rapid succession, of which I have no issue. The only issue I can see might arise is with micro-intensive heroes like Meepo or Chen, but micro-intensive heroes don't interest me so I don't really care to change my entire setup to accommodate heroes I don't want to play anyway, you know? 




 Okay, I had bound TAB to select all units some time in the past. Went ahead and switched that, thank you. 




 What other things would I need to utilize those keys for though? I don't have quickcast hotkeyed to anything, is that something I should be using? It sounds like a neat idea, but I also don't think that the time it takes to press the hotkey and actually click the mouse for me (near instantaneously) is worth keybinding 4-6 keys for.

I suppose I could keybind control groups to the keys for micro-intensive heroes, but I try to avoid playing those anyway because I just don't like them. 




 Also, random question, but is there any way to hotkey a button that scrolls between different units? For example if I pop my Manta Style and want to quickly send my 2 illusions and hero in different directions, would there be a button I could hit that selected specifically 1 illusion, and then if I hit it again, specifically the other illusion, hit it again, back to hero, again, back to 1st illusion, again, back to other illusion, etc.? 




 Why is it better though? And if you use Edge Pan or MMB, what's the difference between keeping it on 1234 vs. QWER? 

Currently I use do WASD as camera, and have my 6 item slots bound to ZXCVFR. XCV are the items I use most in a game (Blink, Phase Boots, Force Staff, etc.) with R usually being hero specific items (Hex, Ghost Scepter/Eblade, Dust). I don't have any problem hitting these keys because over the years my finger dexterity has only gotten better (just ask my girlfriend ;)).

 




 So I've been playing Dota 2 for about a year and a half now. It was the first game of its kind I'd ever played. Before that, I'd played Call of Duty and World of Warcraft among other games extensively on the PC, so I was no stranger to PC online gaming.

I've never bound my Dota 2 spells to QWER, I've had them as 1234 the whole time because after a good 7 years of online gaming, 1-9 were always spells, switching weapons, killstreaks, etc. and WASD was always camera or player movement of some sort. It's so ingrained in my muscle memory that I figured it would be more detrimental for me to switch that around and try to learn something new than stick with what I've always done, and could also hinder my performance in other games. 

What is the advantage that binding your spells to QWER gives in Dota 2? A second part, and most of the reason for asking this, is that I've recently picked up one of [these](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41%2BcyeIQuSL.jpg) mice. It has two buttons I could use to bind things to in Dota 2 that I haven't experimented with yet, and was wondering what might be the most beneficial things in the game to bind to it. 




 Mute them all and just play your game. Focus on learning. Watch your replays too. If you're dying a lot, look at WHY you're dying. Were you in the enemy jungle without vision? Did you commit to a fight you were outnumbered in? Should you have backed out instead of going for that last kill? 

There's no one quick trick to getting better at Dota, it all just takes time and practice. 




 Eh Lion actually isn't as great as you'd think. Lion's burst is great in the early game, but Sniper and Troll should always build a BKB, Axe usually does, and Jug has built in Magic Immunity which completely counters Lion.

Lina, however, would be decent if you're able to farm an Aghs Scepter because the Scepter changes your ult's damage type to Pure and allows it to pierce spell immunity. 




 Then you just need to play more. Stick to one hero for a while just to get basic mechanics to become muscle memory. One mistake I made at first was trying to become a jack of all trades/master of none. 

Also I'd recommend playing the Limited Hero game mode. Those heroes tend to be simpler to understand, have less complicated synergies/mechanics, and greatly reduce the amount of "what the fuck was that" potential in a game.  




  tinker 

Before the March/Eblade nerf yes. I rose 500 MMR by spamming Tinker. Shit was insanely easy.

Now though it's way harder to win solo as a Tinker. If your team won't push with you, you're not going to win.
 




  Winning mid is more about your skill vs. the enemies mids skill then anything else

Debatable depending on your MMR. 

2k, yes because you RARELY get support rotations into the mid to gank. 2k is the mindset where if the mid isn't ganking a sidelane the minute they hit 6, it's a reportable offense. 

4k however, if one team's support rotates a couple times even just to apply pressure and the other team's does not, the former team's mid may win out over the latter even if the latter is more skilled. 




 I wouldn't. Naga is a hero that relies pretty heavily on coordination within the entire team to be utilized correctly.

You rarely get that in solo queue.  




 I've gotten multiple on Bloodseeker, Weaver, Sven and Crystal Maiden but I think that's it. 




 Watch pro gameplays. Usually the commentators do a great job (depending on who it is) explaining what's going on, item choices for heroes, why teams are doing specific movements around the map, etc.

I've learned way more watching pro gameplays than I ever would have just playing the game. 




 Omniknight's ult counters them because they all rely on physical damage.

Vengeful Spirit is pretty good because you can use her ult to swap an important carry out of a death situation, and if you die your 3rd skill reduces the enemies' physical damage output.

Dazzle is good because your ult gives your team +armor and the enemy team -armor if you land it on everyone, and Shallow Grave will keep an ally alive for a potential escape against all but Axe.

Disruptor can be good if played correctly, by Glimpsing initiators back out of the fight or dropping a huge ultimate on 3-4 during a fight.

Ghost Scepter is an item that makes you invulnerable to physical damage, is great against these heroes.

Heaven's Halberd disarms the enemy, so they can't physically attack anyone for the duration and also provides evasion.

Just to name a few. 




 Slark destroys Sniper as well. 




 Did you even read the hero names? Sniper is THE hero for low MMR games, and has been since Dota 2 came out. Axe has always been picked in low MMR games too. Troll is the only one of the four that hasn't been a consistent pick for 3k MMR. 

And like the other reply said, 

 you have to remember that the people who play against them are even worse at countering them then the axe troll and jugg pickers are at playing them.

Bye Felicia. 




 Lol what? These heroes are picked every game from 1k MMR to Pro Tournaments. You're an idiot. 




 http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+get+better+at+dota+2 




 A:256

B:30

2.7k MMR 




 Troll and Axe both need nerfs in my opinion.

Troll needs his base movement speed slightly reduced, and maybe a slight reduction in health in melee axe form to be balanced.

Not really sure how to make Axe balanced but he's way too strong in the laning stage. 




 Yeah my comment was tongue in cheek regarding the horrible nature of South Americans specifically on this video game.

Calm it down. 




 Average 




  Very High Skill


 0 BKBs against a Tinker/Ogre/Zeus with 3 Dagon 5's.

lolwut 




  What the hell is the problem if I want to play something other than AP or CM for MMR?

You do. It's just hidden MMR. Kappa. 




 There's a difference between picking something inappropriate for your team and randoming a hero you have no idea how to play but keeping it just for the extra gold.

 




 I played a game like this earlier tonight. 2 people on my team said nothing throughout the entire draft, didn't lock heroes or anything. 

3 of us had already picked PL, Clinkz, Jakiro. The final two randomed Naga Siren and Tinker. Neither had any clue how to play the hero they randomed, and barely spoke English (surprise surprise).

Needless to say we got completely stomped because Tinker fed the shit out of the enemies' Sniper mid and the Naga was only good for using her Ult to escape and throwing down maybe 1 or 2 good nets the entire game. I reported them for Intentional Ability Abuse, was happy to see two notifications pop up later in the night that they got put into low priority.

Tinkers one of my best heroes. If the stupid Peruvian had spoke English I could have swapped him, but alas, another game ruined because of South Americans. Typical Dota 2. 




 I believe if you die with rapier the item is no longer bound to you, meaning you no longer own it.

Contrasted to if you drop your Yasha, even if someone picks it up, that item is still bound to you and only you benefit from the stats. 




 Lol. 




  Juggernaut can perform normal attacks during Blade Fury, but these attacks will deal no damage to enemies being affected by Blade Fury.

From the Dota 2 wiki. How is this supposed to work? Does this mean you can't auto attack an enemy while BF'ing unless they're already magic immune? 




 Christ. With that team composition you deserved to lose.

Also, the guy's friend is retarded. If he raises it any more than 500 he's just going to get stomped back down to where he was in the first place.  




 Take a break and do something else.

 




 I don't understand why everyone is crying about it.

If you have a huge lead and the enemy outplays you and wins a teamfight, it's your fault for getting outplayed and losing a teamfight that you should have won. 

How is this any different than previous patches where teams would draft insanely good T3 tower defense with a 4 protect 1 carry strat, lose all outer towers at 20 minutes and defend for the next 30 until their carry became unkillable? 

 




 Dear South America: 

Please cut off all internet access to your favelas. 

Sincerely, World. 




 That's a good mentality to have and makes you a better player. I've learned to never trust or rely on random teammates in video games, because 90% of the time they'll fail you.

However in this case, split pushing would have just stalled the inevitable further. If the Sven and LS didn't build MKB for 60 minutes, they were trash and you weren't going to win.

If they had built MKB, you probably would have won considering a couple teamfights could have gone your way and you could have transitioned those into Roshans or tower pushes. But that's Dota.

 Alt clicking is great because South Americans that queue on US E without speaking a word of English can still communicate the cooldowns/availabilities of items and spells. In a game such as this where communication is arguably the biggest key to victory, and Valve refuses to region lock, it was kind of needed. 

I for one am against making the game too much easier. Making things easier is what kills online multiplayer video games. I used World of Warcraft as an example in a thread earlier. In my opinion that game is absolute shit now after they lowered the skill cap for literally everything in WotLK. Call of Duty is another good example. 4 was one of the greatest games ever made because it was barebones, simple, and required heavily on reaction time and pure gun skill. Look at the shit they did with MW3 and BO2, as examples. They made weapon attachments that were literally hacks in previous games (Target Finder, Dual Band) and those games are shit now.

There was a suggestion earlier that was put forward by an alleged 4.2k player saying warding was too difficult and "it's a needed change" that Valve should implement a special courier THAT GOES OUT AND WARDS FOR YOU. Shit like that would ruin the game, and is an absolutely stupid suggestion.

I don't exactly know where I was going with this reply, but changes that make communication easier I'm all for. However, mechanical changes are when you cross the line. Skill shots are a great example. If they made landing Slark's Pounce any easier, it would be too much. Or WR's Shackleshot. In-game timers that were visible to players for Roshan or enemy buybacks would be too much. Just a couple examples I thought of.  




 You probably wouldn't have won even if you did split push. Your bat and sven were trash. 




 Maybe not at minute 4, but a riki with some farm hiding off in the trees blink striking in on an underleveled support running out of fountain? Or ganking couriers?

It obviously isn't a great idea, and I wouldn't advocate it, but it definitely could be annoying. 




 With heroes like Troll, Jug, Axe, Sniper, Lion extremely strong in this meta it's almost impossible to pub stomp with her. 

She loses hard to heroes that can burst her down quickly, and that's what the meta is about right now. 




 And then get initiated on immediately by a blade mailed Clock/Axe/LC. Fun times. 




 Some of them are good ideas. Alt clicking allied spells to indicate "Use ____ Now" in chat could be very useful.

Then some of them, like the alleged 4k player suggesting a specific courier be put into the game that wards for you, are fucking retarded.

But that's how this entire subreddit is so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Why the fuck won't my shrug ever work? It's always missing its fucking left arm.

I kind of like this one better though so ¯\ _(ツ)_/¯ 




 I actually haven't seen one of those in a couple months.  




 It could work. 




  for you lefties

What does being left handed have to do with any of this?
 




 Because you're in the lead and you lost a fight. That shouldn't happen.

Don't think of it as being penalized for losing a fight, think of it as the other team being rewarded for winning a fight that realistically they shouldn't have won due to your advantage. They outplayed a stronger opponent, and deservedly get more reward. 




  At this point, the Glyph being refreshed after a Tier 1 tower falls is just dumb and appears to be a gross overreaction when combined with the comeback formula.

Maybe when combined with the formula, but do you remember TI4? 20 minute gg's because you win a team fight at 15 minutes and take 3 towers afterwards was stupid.  




 He can be used as a niche last pick sometimes, but Huskar relies on lack of coordination on the opposing team to be useful. He's a great pubstomper because he ults in and people go full panic mode, but that's not how pro teams operate.

And no pro team wants an initiator whose initiation ability drops themselves to half health right off the bat.  




 Just do what I do. If someone on the opposing team is flaming me, get 1-2 of your teammates and make it your sole objective for the next 20 minutes to gank them whenever possible and make their game extremely unfun.

Or just mute them, outplay them, win the game and type JAJAJAJAJAJAJAJA [Their Hero Name] over and over as you kill their Ancient. 




  i believe that if people didnt feed nobody would complain

You have too much faith in the internet. People will flame you for anything and everything. 




 99% of the time the pros get aegis immediately barring some sort of engagement going on in the pit at the same time. I've rarely seen a pro team do rosh and sit for more than 2 seconds without picking up aegis/cheese.

in b4 "BUT X PLAYER IN X GAME RAN AWAY AND DIDN'T GET IT UNTIL HE WENT BACK 5 SECONDS LATER" 




 If you were going in first, you were doing it wrong. The correct way to win that lane would be for CM to go around behind her when the wave was closer to your tower, freeze her, then you run in with your whirling axes. At that point she should be easy food.
 




 Meepo, Earth Spirit and Invoker every time because I've never tried to learn them. Most of the time I'll repick Chen/Enchantress but I've had decent games with them.

Otherwise I can pretty much play every hero in the pool. Aside from those, I'll only repick if I randomed a hero and the enemy team had already picked a hard counter. 




 As the title says, when is the best time to buy BoTs in a game? I expect this depends on the hero, like with a tinker you want them ASAP, and with an AM it's good to pick them up early to split push and farm lanes more effectively. And sometimes you don't need to buy them at all.

But is there a general rule of thumb for when to pick up BoTs on other heroes? What I've been doing is if I can tell that if I complete my next item and doing so won't leave me a spot for a tp scroll, I'll go ahead and buy BoTs and prolong that item a bit longer to ensure I'm not caught in a position where I need to TP somewhere for a teamfight or defense. This usually comes around the 30-40 minute mark (3k MMR here, so it's not like at that point I'm fully 6 slotted or anything), both on supports and cores.

Thoughts? 




 4.2k and you don't know how to ward? That's pretty sad. I just played a Lion solo support. They had weaver and invoker, so I had dust on me from minute 1 until the end.

Good gold management and the fact that both ours and the enemy team's outer towers were all taken out around the 35 minute mark allowed me to sell my Tranquils and purchase BoTs, meaning I could keep BoTs, Magic Wand, Blink, Force, Observers and Dust on me. Our viper bought a gem relatively early as well, so whenever we felt like dewarding I went around with him and dewarded. Since a couple of us had dust, we didn't need the gem in team fights and we kept it in base.

Didn't have a problem with space management once in the entire game, and managed to ward throughout a 55 minute game as a solo support without any issues.

You're 4.2k and you can't figure that out? Once again: SOUNDS LIKE A PERSONAL PROBLEM. Get better. 

Peace out. 




 3k. But I don't see anyone else supporting your suggestion, and I haven't seen anyone else complain about warding being difficult. If people thought this was a problem, you'd have support. (See what I did there?)

Do I WANT to leave my dust or bracer in stash to go ward? Not particularly. But I'm also not going to propose a stupid suggestion to "fix" something that isn't even a problem. It only takes a couple minutes to ward, then you get your item back, then 6-10 minutes later you do it again. It's part of being a support.

Good players don't have a problem warding.

So once again, it sounds like a personal problem.  




 There were a lot of factors in addition to it for me in real life too. It was also just my personal opinion that the game in general just felt too easy. 




 Consumables aren't needed after minute 10. If you're running around with tangos or a mana potion taking up a slot at minute 20+, you're doing it wrong. Wards take precedence.

Magic Stick/Wand falls off after 20-25 minutes. As a support, you'll have enough mana to cast enough abilities to where you won't need the boost, and if you're gone on first in a gank attempt, the stick charges probably aren't going to save your life enough of the time to warrant holding onto it. If you feel like holding onto it, put it in your stash, go ward, TP back, grab it from stash. Wards take precedence.

If you're holding a bracer at minute 40 and claim you don't have a spot for wards, you're doing it wrong. Bracer only gives somewhere between 100-150 health. That's enough to survive 1 extra attack from their carry, if that. Applies to components such as Null Talisman, Void Stone, Ring of Regen, etc. Put it in your stash, go ward, have it delivered back. Wards take precedence.

Dust or Smoke as well, either put it in your stash or give to an ally, grab it back after you ward. Wards take precedence.

Warding is YOUR job as a support. Wards take precedence over all but 3 of the things you listed above, especially considering it should only take 2 minutes tops to place them before you can get the other items back. If you're playing correctly and warding at the correct times (hint, NOT running blindly into their jungle when all enemy heroes are alive and missing from the map) then none of this is an issue. You also have 4 other heroes on your team that can assist you in this entire process. Your position 4 has an extra slot? Give them the Observers. Your Batrider and Storm Spirit want to gank the Riki farming too aggressively in bot lane? Pass them the Dust. A change isn't needed at all. Get better. 




 Definitely practice your last hitting. At up until 3k, that's the biggest thing that can give you the edge over your opponents. 

Also learn item builds on heroes. For example you're buying a Null Talisman on the Spectre games I looked at. Completely useless and a waste of gold on that hero, meaning you are less effective in the laning stage than you should be, giving you a hard start on a hero that usually needs a good start to be effective. Shadow Blade is also useless on that hero, and to some extent Spirit Breaker as well.

You're also not really picking strong heroes to play. Visage and Elder Titan are probably way over your skill level, and Spectre isn't really that strong right now and definitely not in your MMR where most of your games are 30 minute 1 sided victories.

My advice would be to learn some bigger tempo controllers, outfarm your opponents and control the game. But that doesn't mean run into 3 heroes solo and expect to triple kill them. Solo pick off heroes are usually the best because 1. Players in that MMR rarely buy wards or TP scrolls, and generally don't have the map awareness to utilize them properly and 2. Players tend to farm and play way over aggressively. Punish that with a Shadow Bladed Slark killing a solo hero at your top T2 when their team is in their jungle or other lanes, for example. 




 You can't re-calibrate. What he's referencing is creating a new account, power leveling to 13 and doing ranked matches again to see if you place higher. Which is completely pointless if you aren't any better than when you calibrated the first time. If you are, then you'll be higher. But the thought process also is that if you're truly better than the 9 other people in the lobby, you should be able to single handedly carry your team to victory and increase your MMR that way on the account you play at normally. 




 Maybe you should have only punch it 2 times. 




 rekt 




 And you sound like the kind of person that if you're not good enough to do something, would rather have it changed to be easier than getting better and improving your personal skill.

Like I said too: If you're a good player, the current mechanics aren't a problem in any way. 

If you're a support, you should always have a slot designated for Wards. Just like a good player always designates a slot for a TP scroll. It's part of the role you're playing. Wards are more important than the component of an uncompleted item that could stay in your stash until you've completed it fully. In 99.9% of games, the position 5 support will never be six slotted to the point where you have to drop something more important for your team than wards.  




 You pay a monthly or yearly subscription to be able to play WoW. It's been four years or so since I last paid for it, so I don't remember the actual cost of it. 

What I mean by making the game easier is that they implemented purchasable (with real life money) items into the game that made basically every aspect of the game easier. Power leveling (leveling from 1 to the level cap) used to take a lot of time and effort. After these items, you could do it in a fraction of the time. These items were extremely powerful and took out a core aspect of the game where you had to sit and think about the benefits of choosing one item over another. Basically you bought these items, they scaled with your level (IIRC) and you never really had to worry about your itemization until you hit the level cap.

They also (from my experience) nerfed raiding (going into a dungeon with 5, 10, 25, etc. different people) so that instead of having to figure out strategies and use tons of teamwork to be able to down a boss, you could blow through it easily because none of the fights were anywhere near as difficult, coupled with the fact that you had these really strong items.

They earned more money because the game was more accessible to millions of other people who could buy it, load it up, and be able to get that feeling of accomplishment very quickly instead of having to work for it, as opposed to the game being a challenge and potentially turning people away because they couldn't figure it out or weren't good enough to get through certain parts. 

I started to despise it because everything I'd spent tons of time working for for the past 4 years was now extremely easy. The sense of accomplishment went away. For me, if a game isn't challenging, it isn't fun. 
  




  Agreed, but taking time to micromanage such a petty task (unloading items in order to ward) takes away from the much more important micromanagement that takes place during battles and map control.

If you're a good player this isn't a problem at all. If you're not a good player, then it sounds like a personal problem.  




 I used to adore Blizzard. Played WoW for about 4 years, from around the time AQ was released pre-BC to right before the Cataclysm expansion.

Could just be my personal opinion, but halfway through WotLK they completely destroyed that game. I understand their model, making the game so easy an 8 year old can be successful makes it more appealing to the masses, which makes them more money; but it got to the point where everything was so easy that the game was no longer challenging in any way. 

If that happened to Dota 2 it would be a very sad day indeed. 




 Link to dotabuff? If you're 700 I guarantee the reason you're so low is because you don't know how to farm.

Tip: Stop playing ranked for a bit, learn a hero that can come online early with heavy snowball potential (Drow, Bloodseeker, Slark, Troll Warlord, Axe are some of the easier examples to play and can also utilize the jungle well) and practice your last hitting in bot games. At 700 MMR, spend your first 20 minutes farming and not dying or participating in stupid fights. ONLY enter a fight if you know you will survive and will be able to get a kill or two out of it (for example if three enemy heroes are tower diving at less than half health. TP in, clean them up. Profit.) My experiences with lower MMR players is that they'll horribly farm for the first 8 minutes and then spend the rest of the time running at you Call of Duty style instead of continuing to farm. 

If you can come out at 20 minutes with 2-3 items and maybe even 4-6 levels ahead of them, go around and continuously pick them off if they're solo and transition that into tower pushes. Nobody at 700 MMR is going to be coordinated enough to kill you at that point. 




 I've tried to do this way too many times. I like this idea. 




  wasting time in such micromanagement can be potentially game-costing.

The ability to micromanage throughout a potentially 60+ minute game is a big part of what separates great players and teams from mediocre ones. 

 




 Not really. There's a big difference between not being able to play at all and a minor distraction. 




 If I'm sitting in front of my TV, at a bar, or even in the seats of the stadium itself as a spectator, it's impossible for me to injure a player.

As opposed to DDOS'ing a Dota player which can be done from anywhere across the world. 




 This only matters above 4k where you'll get differences of 100-1000 MMR between teammates.

The difference in player skill relative to MMR between a 1000 player and 1500 player is almost zero, same for a 2000 and 2500, and probably even 3000 and 3500.

 [This could be my alarm.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDz9B9VGcpQ)

I think I remember hearing that he used to be a radio announcer or DJ before he got into Dota, which would explain why he seems like the most experienced behind a microphone. Is this true? 




 I just can't stand his voice. That's not something he can really control, so I can't fault him as a person for it, but I just can't listen to it. 

Honestly he casts like a 16 year old on a sugar rush.  




 My problem with Zyori is that his jokes suck. All of his attempts to be funny, in my opinion, just completely fall flat. He's also completely wrong about... well, everything a lot of the time. He'll sit pondering something for two minutes when it's plainly obvious even to a 3k "scrub" like me that watches maybe 2-3 pro dota gameplays a day what the answer is. 

He's gotten a little better than he used to be, so I guess the progress is good. But if I see him casting a gameplay replay of teams that I either don't know or don't necessarily care about on dotacinema I won't watch it. Compare that to Tobi, Sunsfan/Synderen, Godz, Kotlguy, where I would watch the game even if it was a pub. 




 I like all of BTS except Lysander. I cannot fucking stand Lysander. 




 I want to start off by saying ~6 months ago, I despised Capitalist as a caster. His tone and demeanor in general was just so... smarmy. He even replied to a comment I made in a thread where I bashed him. Since then however, he's actually really grown on me and I don't mind watching his casts. So if you're reading this Cap, I apologize for my previous comment and keep up the good work :)

Kotlguy is also quickly becoming one of my favorite casters. I don't know how long he's been in the scene, but I've really only discovered him in the past month or so. It's funny though, and this could just be me personally, but when he casts with Zyori (who is still really terrible) he tends to cast down to Zyori's level as opposed to if he's solo or with somebody different. 

What happened to Ayesee? He was everywhere around TI4 and I don't think I've seen him since. 

Somebody like Tobiwan, I'll watch games he's casting even if I don't know the teams because he's just the best in my opinion. Very knowledgeable and entertaining as well. Godz sails in the same boat, although he doesn't cast nearly as much. 

Who are your guys' favorites, least favorites, honorable mentions, dream caster combo's, etc. and why?

edit: Completely forgot about Sunsfan and Synderen because I haven't seen them in forever. Another two favorites! 




 /r/nocontext is having a field day with this thread. 




 Bane/SD Mirana +1 was used heavily around TI4.  




 It's pretty core on Puck. His whole thing is being as evasive as possible. 

It's pretty core on Jakiro too unless you have a reliable setup stun already on your team to set up ice paths. 

It's not core per se on Invoker, but it makes landing his spells a hell of a lot easier.

And Eul's is great on DP for the movement speed, but again not necessarily core. 




 It might work for solo pick offs, but in a team fight if they notice your MoM on while dueling you're going to get bursted so hard you'll end up losing most of your duels. 




 Exactly. 




 Sounds exactly like when I try to play at 4 AM US East and get teams full of South Americans.

Seriously. They "farm" for 10 minutes and spend the rest of the game just running at you. It's fucking annoying. 




 Weird, it shows up in the text box if I go to edit it. 




 This is the account I've been playing on for the past few months, not my main though. Ignore the Ogre, Slark and QoP games, those were fresh after a blunt to the face and I always play terribly when I'm high. I also meant to queue for Normal, not Ranked, but marijuana ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

http://www.dotabuff.com/players/206703220

I'm not sitting here saying I'm pro, but the only one of the Latest Matches losses that was anywhere close to my fault (aside from the above) was the 4/8/12 where I lost mid to a smurf SF. 

The hardest part about getting out of 2k/3k is that 90% of the time your team doesn't know the correct course of action. People in 5k know that at around 20 minutes if you smoke gank and get 2 or 3 pick offs you're in a great position to take Roshan uncontested and then transition that into a 1 or 2 tower push.

At 2/3k you rarely ever see a smoke bought for starters, and generally people just don't listen to anyone else on the team unless you get extremely lucky. Even though I'm spamming ROSH ROSH ROSH, nobody fucking does it. That's the biggest obstacle. 




 No synergy? Did you miss the part where his Astral gives you invulnerability for 4 seconds and it only takes 3 to reduce your Blink cooldown after taking damage? That seems pretty damn good to me. 




 The first few times I got ganked by 3+, Astral'd myself and Blinked away were very nice feelings. 

It makes you almost as elusive as a Puck. I don't know the interaction if, for example, Alchemist puts a Acid Spray under you. I'm assuming you wouldn't be able to blink fast enough so in that situation a Force would be better. Maybe it depends on the game, but I'm just surprised I've never seen anyone do it. 




 See when I play mid or carry, I hold a 500+ gpm over 80% of the time, even when I lose. Looking at your last hits and gpm/xpm my stats are essentially the same.

I guess the difference is consistency? If I don't have a 500+ gpm every game I'll never get high skill? 




 Assuming you have full mana on every Orb attack as well, though.

I just personally think for the same price, the Blink gives far superior utility than the little bit of damage and lesser mobility you get with a Force. 




 Copied from above:

Force gives 130 mana. At level 1 Orb, this increases your Orb attack by 7.8, at level 4 Orb it increases your Orb attack by 11.7.

That's not really much to write home about in later portions of the game, considering you usually max Orb last (I usually put a value point in just to have, but I always max Astral and Aura first). It might be a nice little boost right when you get it, but I still think the effectiveness of Blink outweighs that heavily.

It might be a nice little boost right when you get it, but I still think the effectiveness of Blink outweighs that heavily.

As far as the item slots, if you start with a Null and pooled tangos, you'll use the tangos and get Bottle, then Treads. So you're at Null, Bottle, Treads, TP Scroll. You have two slots left. Blink and another Null fills that until you can sell a Null for whatever you build next (Scythe, Aghs, Shivas), and that extra Null gives you 6 Int, plus other stats as well for a fraction of the cost of a Force.

 




 It could still be as useful for initiation as a Blink, but nowhere near as useful for escaping. If the enemy team has Dust, if you try to Astral and Shadow Blade out, you're just going to get dusted and killed.

As opposed to Blink, where if you Astral and immediately blink into trees or over a cliff, you can get away much easier. 




  too much damage

10 damage is nothing. You can get 12 damage from 2 Null Talismans, which together only cost 940g. 




 Because against good players the invisibility from Shadow Blade is almost useless. And it costs more. 




 PL isn't the ricing, split pushing rat like the days of old though. You don't really want to spend the whole time farming any more.

PL is a fighter now. You should be fighting as soon as you get your diffusal. Doppelganger doesn't necessarily help you fight like Lance and Rush do. You can have Treads, Vanguard or Vlads, Diffusal by 20 minutes. If you max Lance and Rush, you're going to destroy the enemy team.  




 I know OD is in a pretty shitty spot right now with having a ~5% pick/ban rate for pros in the past 7 months, but it's one of my favorite heroes to play. Recently I had the idea of building Blink Dagger instead of Force Staff. I'm not going to say I invented it, but it isn't something I can remember seeing anyone else do.

Force Staff has been considered core on him for as long as I can remember. It gives you 10 Int and a bit of mobility on a 20 sec CD for 2250 gold. Dotabuff matches played this month with Force Staff: 828,013. Win rate: 45.77%

Compare this to blink dagger, widely considered one of the best items in the game for almost every hero. Same exact price as Force Staff, but much better mobility on only a 12 second CD. Plus it is a far more reliable initiation tool, as well as escape mechanism. If you Astral yourself, at max level, it is 4 seconds. Blink damage CD is only 3 seconds. You will be able to reset your blink cooldown while inside Astral and give yourself a far better chance of evading death than with the Force Staff. Dotabuff matches played this month with Blink Dagger: 26,988. Win rate: 56.90%

Obviously you can't go by dotabuff winrates for everything, but I'm wondering why nobody else does this? Especially considering this month more people picked up Shadow Blades on OD than a Blink Dagger. BlinkAstral is almost equivalent to Nightmare and Disruption as far as an initiation tool, and is great for saving teammates that also have Blink Daggers because of the cooldown reset.

Does anyone agree? Is there some piece of the puzzle I'm missing? 

Also, what would make this hero viable in competitive play again? The consensus seems to be changing his Aghs upgrade. If you changed the Aghs upgrade to Pure damage, and maybe re-scaled it a little bit, would that be enough? 

He's still a mid dominator against popular mid heroes in this meta. Take Shadow Fiend for example. Astral reduces an enemies total mana pool by 52/91/130/169. If you're able to continuously get Astrals off on the SF in lane, he's not going to have enough mana for Razes, and you'll be able to cs far easier, effectively shutting him down without the use of support rotations.

Thoughts? 




 I said I was agreeing with you. I think he's viable.

I'm saying as a general rule, there is a difference between pubstomping and pro competitive. 




  but that dopple is critical for farming.

It should be worth noting that the only reason Doppelganger is good for farming is that it can essentially work as a pseudo-blink. Purge was talking about this in a recent cast, I believe it was Starladder Secret v LC Game 2.

One of your illusions does 0 damage, the other only does 20%. If you're doing 100 damage, that means the Doppelganger illusions are only increasing your total damage by 20. 

IMO you should max Rush and Lance first, keeping Doppelganger at level 1 to be used solely as an escape, unless you are under tons of pressure in which case you may need the reduced cooldown. 




 I agree with you, and see your edit, however keep in mind there is a big difference between pubstomping (even at high skill) and pro competitive. 




 I don't know how many people know this, but when the hero selection screen shows up (where you can scroll through all the heroes horizontally), if you type the letters of the hero name, it will auto scroll to that hero. So when it loads, if you type S-N it will go to Sniper and you can lock it in.
