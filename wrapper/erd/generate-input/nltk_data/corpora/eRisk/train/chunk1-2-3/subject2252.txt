 Basically, you turned Bruce Wayne into Adam West, minus the plot devices 




 I meant for the purpose of this thread, but I didn't see anything along the lines of overused characters in my flair list, but since other threads like to love on a character for a day or two, my thread will be just fine 




 I figured Ditto would transform Into the first thing it sees with Imposter,  so in theory, couldn't it transform into someone else?  




 I'm only asking because the anime never seemed to give a conclusive answer for ss2 winning,  imo. The Manga might have expanded on it better. Also, I tried to put the time limit on for fairness, but apparently I created a Lolstomp 




 This whole thread just became "can God create a rock so heavy that even he cannot lift it?" 




 r/whowouldcirclejerk 




 What if he doesn't see MMH first? Who would Ditto likely see in that case instead? 




 Yes, this has probably been done before, so if there are previous threads discussing my idea, by all means, link me to them.

My thought is that Goku would only have about half an hour or so on Earth in SS3 and he can't hold the form for too long. Would he be able to defeat Majin Vegeta in such a short time span (something like 7 or 8 minutes) using SS3,  given their fighting styles and knowledge of each other? Defeat here meaning incap, since Goku wouldn't kill Vegeta at this point in DBZ.

If Goku cannot defeat Vegeta in that short time span, then allow Goku the full hour or however long he would be allowed on Earth in SS3 for the fight.

If it is a total stomp, well, I can't think of a good thing that would help Vegeta that is also in the DB universe at the moment.

Edit: how do I add a flair or whatever for frequently used characters,  because I know these two see a lot of time on this thread (not necessarily against each other though) 




 HULK STOMP!! 




 I was going to post some complaints from my employer here, but compared to everyone else, mine is actually wonderful. We make everything from scratch, and people can even watch us make our products. My only complaint is that we are understaffed for the amount of business we see.

Context: I work in a pretzel shop (Ben's) in North-Central Indiana. 




 Alucard. One of the few stomp cards I dislike playing, for the most part.

He stomps rounds 1-5 easy enough, because if you kill him, he just comes right back. 
No wait, include round 6...He shoots Jake and eats Finn.
Round 7- The Lich: I give this to Alucard 7/10, depending on whether he unlocks control level 0, or he stays at control level 1.

For those who don't know: level 0 us basically where he unleashes the army comprised of everyone he has ever killed/consumed. 




 r/whowouldcirclejerk would probably say Batman, given enough prep time 




 Round 2: Dudley loses an ear. 




 What kind of style does Dudley have? I know Balrog was modified and based on Mike Tyson, so there is that 




 Ash Ketchum hasn't accomplished anything be wanted to do that he said he would do when he left Pallet Town. And he would likely be good leaning, but not be that efficient because nothing he ever does seems to make the villains of his world really go away 




 Any of the last three characters I selected in Marvel vs Capcom 3, so Deadpool, Wolverine, or Virgil 




 Definitely Pol Pit here 




 Thanks for that! 




 This sounds like a bakery I heard about in California, where they specifically employ felons and former gang members. I can't think of the name of said bakery right now though.  




 Did someone say gold? 




 I'm asking because I was wondering if I was the only fraternity member (Phi Kappa Tau) who noticed that members of his chapter talk about topics that seem off from the fraternity stereotype. The main things I've noticed are that I can get away with talking about anime when I want, and there is a huge circle jerk for Doctor Who (gotta spell out that Doctor part though). 









 I want to gild you, but I can't. 




 From what I understand, Deadpool is basically immortal. He may not be able to defeat everyone in 6 hours,  but, given the style of his comics, he would break 4th wall before being erased, and the audience wouldn't let him be erased. 
Also, I wouldn't take me seriously the moment I start mentioning Deadpool without good explanations.  




 If it turns out to be Captain America, grab an enemy of the Avengers (probably Ultron) the end. 

If it isn't Captain America, then my appeal is going out to Goku, because he always seems to give the benefit of the doubt and second chances out the ass, so what would be the odds of him ignoring me at this point in time, as a citizen who needs help turning over a corrupt system?

Also, I'd play reverse psychology on any villain I could. It is underhanded, but hey, we can't all be the saints of tomorrow. 




 Deadpool because Deadpool. Haters gonna hate 




 South Park Mickey Mouse stomps! Seriously,  he would view Capone as someone who is in the way of him making money, so he would dispose of him like the rest of the Disney could stars. 10/10 




 Johnson does at least 45 minutes- an hour of cardio several days each week, so that isn't too big of an issue. The issue for me is that a 3v1 turns into a stomp for the 3 in this situation. How about Johnson runs a gauntlet against them in order, and he is allowed an hour's rest in between each fight?

Edits: I changed "bug" to "big" 




 1. Batman can learn the situation and everything a lot easier than Barney so yeah...Batman wins round 1.

2. Barney would obviously be funnier, given his track record when it comes to dealing with criminals and whatnot.

3. How fucked is Gotham? Very. There is no way Fife can deal with any level of criminal if he isn't hardly able to deal with the people of Mayberry doing little things here and there. He would be a comedy character in a not so comedic world.

4. There would be no crime in Mayberry because Batman would either have everyone locked up, or he would have struck fear into their hearts. For a recall election,  that would likely never happen seeing how the master detective can deduce the situation (see #1) easily enough to win the affection of Mayberry and its citizens.
 




 Includes cat. Gets karma... 




 Definitely weed on the left side.  




 So, Cap would still have all of his combat training and muscular structure,  but he wouldn't have the shield,  correct? 




 Definitely Saitama going God status time!! 




 Do you count the super serum (iirc) as a power? I mean, it is technically a chemical he is exposed to, but it's kinda blurry for me on whether the serum counts as a power 




 This is likely true for me as well, since he is more than many levels smarter than most people my age (20) at 14 




 Time traveler kills Batman before he is born. Time traveler kills his parents. Time traveler kills infant batman. Time traveler kills 10 year batman. Time traveler kills 14 year old batman. 

Point is, this needs more specific details. Because time traveler goes back In time and kills batman before he becomes a threat to anything.

 I have two answers for this. 
Keeping in the same universe, I wanted to see the actual conclusion to the Majin Vegeta/SS2 Goku, not the plot device involving Majin Buu.

From different universes, I want to see Korra (after connecting to the spirits of past Avatars) fight someone like Picollo (post-Nail, pre-Kami for balance purposes)

Yes, I am going to be the guy who likes DBZ hypotheticals, but realizes that there are more characters in the series than Goku.

 Do any of the Furian (sp?) Powers from the Riddick universe break physics? I honestly don't remember too much of it not being able to have some kind of semi plausible explanation 




 Bender would get too lazy to fight,  more than likely. Remember that he isn't motivated go do much of anything,  unless it is for him. 

The Joker could probably use Bender's alcohol dependency to lure him into some kind of trap related to vaporizing Bender or making robots obsolete. 

Overall, I would say Bender at 7.5/10 because he would recognize when he is being conned, and he is also a frickin robot, so he would likely use any of the million or so things he's pulled out of his body/ass to kill the Joker.

Thought: in the episode of Futurama where the electromagnetic cosmic abnormality opens, Bender literally shits bricks as an act of fear. So he could be scared, shit bricks, and then kill Joker with those. 

Crime: They'd probably rob a super sized bank, and then Joker would burn the money because he is fuckin insane. 




 Question: is Superman Prime allowed? Because if so, throw everything out of the window, Prime will just rewrite the entire scenario to make himself because he is a dick slinging Superman like that 




 Probably Atom Ant. He would likely become molecularly unstable (my guess) due to the sheer size increase, and he also would not be able to avoid detection in any situation that his ant size is considered favorable. While he would still retain his super speed, flight, and super strength, he would lose that stealth factor that I mentioned earlier in this post.

Tl; Dr: Atom Ant doesn't get to be sneaky 




 I see the Neo Tri - Beam being brought up as Tien's only hope, but the problem with that would be that more than likely, Frieza would survive, if even a little, and recover before Tien would be able to defend himself again due to the toll on his body, resulting in Frieza walking to Tien's body and finishing him, Mortal Kombat style, because fuck that guy for challenging the former supreme ruler of the known universe, Lord Frieza. 




 There are so many re rolls happening right now, just on the sheer account of feeling too godly in the first fight. Example: Nanite Reality,  aka, Reality Warping. Not fair at all in my honest opinion

 I can understand how they would together (one can believe in a higher power that helps them feel comfort in their insecurities, and at the same time, be used as an exaplanatory gap for things science hasn't yet confirmed/refuted, and be able to practice science properly) I used to think that science and religion had to be separate, especially with the theory of evolution/Creationism, but I have seen, since about 2 years ago, that science and religion can coexist, until one starts interfering with the exercise of the other (Ken Ham's Young Earth Creationism/ atheists who believe that religion being around science will stupify the minds involved) 




 People who use bad gym etiquette; examples range from not cleaning up after oneself, or just standing around talking in an area where I need to be for an exercise, such as people who gather either around a set of dumbbells I would like to use or all around the squat rack.

How much of what my recruiters push is complete bullshit (they aren't focused on me getting an education, but rather they keep trying to push the possible high salary that can come with being a nuclear engineer?

 "Ora! Ora! Ora! Ora! Ora!"

That is the cry of Star Platinum trying as hard as he can to protect Jotaro from the swarm. I want to believe that with the power of precise movements and the urges of Stand master preservation,  Star Platinum would fend off all the bees, but I do not think he could move fast enough to protect Jotaro from a swarm of the bees stinging him. Maybe they could do the heart stop thing to prevent blood flow so the venom doesn't circulate while it gets separated from the blood cells and removed from the body,  but I doubt that would even work.

 Generally, the chapters that haze are becoming more and more of the minority amongst Greek Life as a whole. Honestly, there are other ways of building the bonds between members that will last a lifetime. Personally, spending time around all of my fellow brothers doing things like catching dinner or even hanging out playing Xbox (not stereotypical CoD or sports) makes me feel like we are all connected beyond our memberships in our respective chapters. 

I do not have any hazing experiences myself, as I'm not big on hazing people, and there wasn't really any type of initiation requirement or anything of that sort that could be considered hazing, within the wordings of both public perception and our National Fraternal Constitution.

 Alucard (Hellsing) vs Wolverine (Marvel)

1. In character, both of them would likely fight, since Wolverine as a mutant would likely be someone Alucard would hunt. I feel like most rounds would be a contest of Alucard's souls vs Wolverine's healing factor. I would give the victory to Alucard's souls and vamperic powers. Alucard 6.5/10

2. Bloodlusted: if Wolverine can chop off Alucard's head and rip out his heart on a speedblitz, then Wolverine would win (odds are about 4/10, IMO) More than likely, Alucard would go level 0 and Wolverine's healing factor would not be able to keep up with the sheer amount of injuries he would suffer. Alucard 6/10.

3. Prep: Wolverine would know what to do to actually kill Alucard, and Alucard would know how to beat adamantium skeletons and healing factor, but I would give this to Wolverine 6/10, because I think prep helps Wolverine more than it would Alucard 




 You mean out of his hair?  




 You're* FTFY 




 My Raditz is in the top percentage of Raditzes.  




 I lived in Missouri, but am now in Indiana.

For Missouri,  we would just smoke a bunch of meth and go berserk. 

For Indiana, we will steal the nation's corn supply. Mwahahaha 




 That was my exact reference.  




 Adam West portrayed Batman in the 1960s 





























 As the titles implies,  I made an agreement with a friend. Basically, he is not going to drink for a month if I don't smoke for a month. I made a joke in a conversation and now this is a serious thing. 




 The character customization in Tactics was really enioyable 




 Holy -expletive- the music is gripping and beautiful. Is it an original production or taken from a classical piece 




 DBZ Abridged: Tien. Because he's the serious character. That's the joke  




 That's an obscure FF reference if I've ever seen one 




 Give Goku Batman's preptime abilities and overall intelligence. That would be a fun what if, like what if Goku suddenly has an IQ of 1000 and can come up with better plans than "we need to hit this thing really hard"

Edit: he could beat Superman in that chili cook off posted earlier 




 This is a matter of preptime. I've heard and seen they are both ridiculous at it (beware of circle jerkers). 

Round 1: both get a week of preptime to figure out how to appease the hunger of Galactus.

Round 2: both get 6 months to figure out how to take down a higher tiered member of a different universe. (Loki vs Superman, Batman vs Thor)

Round 3: both get 5 years to prepare a contingency for something that they should not/cannot do by themselves. Situations are Loki vs Darkseid and Batman vs Thanos.

Bonus 1: The two fight to incap, no prep. (Bats doesn't kill in character)

Bonus 2: one month prep, fight to kill (bloodlusted)

 This is Offspring. How fuckin dare you 




 Acid will do that to you 




 I would do that if I was somewhere closer to a legal market  




 I don't get any rashes or such. I usually just sneeze if there is too much smoke around,  so it could just be that 




 *you're 
And does that actually make a difference? 
Also sorry I'm an asshole 




 It seems ridiculous, but almost every time I smoke, I start sneezing and getting watery eyes (like allergies, not the natural bloodshot). I would think that you could since you could technically be allergic to anything since it depends on the body's reaction (despite most of the wonderful highs I've had over the years) 









 I'm losing my mind over your grammatical error 




 I've seen this twice in the last week. Baader-Meinhoff phenomenon  




 I poked too much smot. 









 I would say Tool or System of a Down honestly. Maybe Between the Buried and Me, not sure

 Anecdotal evidence follows: 
Marijuana can provide a psychological dependence, rather than a physical one (like, you will mentally crave it rather than physically) and this can be just as addictive and difficult to break as a physical dependence. One of the biggest signs to determine if someone is addicted to marijuana is to check their spending habits. If they are sacrificing necessities for weed, then you have an addict on your hands. 

Hell, anything can become an addiction if it fucks up the rest of your life enough  




 People always give me shit for casually smoking mids  (I break out dank for get togethers  and special occasions) 
The way I look at it I may have to smoke a little more, but I get a half of mids for the same price I get an eighth of dank. 
I wanted to hear r/trees' thoughts on the subject.

 I just realized how visually beautiful and incredibly informative Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey was, especially on the second watching. [9] 




 Was Rick Rubin involved? Because he is involved with a lot of clipping in music from what I've heard through my music holes  




 Update: I was way too high to field any questions,  and Reddit doesn't notify me sometimes when people reply to my threads. To clear a couple things up, one of my friends was throwing bread at me because I was hungry. The munchies inspired the breads. And I wish I was a bird, but not like a pigeon. Actually, I wouldn't mind being around Mike Tyson  




 I started eating the bread. AMA 




 I believe Mackelmore even said something along the lines that Kendrick Lamar was more deserving of the award. Correct me if I'm wrong 




 The award won an award for being an excellent award?

 How long did this take to make? I love the design! 




 You have probably heard of Metallica.

You might have heard of Baroness. 

You probably haven't heard of Behemoth.

And one I think no one has heard of is Deathgrips. I've met one person in the last 20 years who even vaguely knows of them/him, depending on your viewpoint.  




 Just because a fag is a fag doesn't mean we all have to be fag loving cocksuckers

 I was looking for something to watch on Netflix when I decided to search for Keanu Reeves (I wanted to watch the Matrix) Instead, I settled into a film called Man of Tai Chi, directed by, and somewhat starring, Keanu Reeves. 

Man of Tai Chi was a pretty good movie to watch (not top 5 or anything) but it is a great martial arts film still that is packed with action and elegance. 




 But are they real?

 I kept asking myself why it seemed like everyone on Elpis sounded Australian...then I realized who likely did the voice acting.

 I'd rather know when. If you know how, then you will avoid everything related to the how. If you know the when, then you can live as much as you can until that particular time you die
