 Throwaway.

Need your kind advise on how I can get approved on SSDI for depression. I applied once 3 months ago but I left my application incomplete (didn't resond to SS Admin's follow-up questions) and so was denied.
 
1. Is it true that I must apply and be denied two more times before I can appeal?

I have been depressed since childhood but wasn't diagnosed until my mid 30s (I'm male, 57, those were different times). 

I am also documented as extremely allergic to all SSRI since I was first diagnosed (extreme, explosive dihreahha beginning within 2 hours of ingestion, and then every 45 minutes, lasting for 14 hours). 

For 25 years, docs kept trying other SSRIs, one after another (even though I always told them about past extreme side effects), hoping I wouldn't react. I would always abandon each due to the same side effects.

Now 25 years after diagnosis,knowing what we know now, we've tried all the other, older meds but they don't work.

2. How best for me to proceed with the next two claims?

3. Any protips, things to watch out for?

Thanks 




 ScumbagInc, do you know about /r/depression? 
























 Thanks. Attorney took 25% of the amount accumulated since you first filed and were denied or that *and* 25% of SSDI into the future, too? I ask because, is there a minimum money involved for them to be interested?

Edit: also was the SSI appointed lawyer the one who won your grant, or some other? 




 Also, watch /r/IAmA. I am about to post (in 8 minutes) an IAmA request for anyone who has tips on getting approved for Social Security Disability Insurance due to depression (request for recipients, social workers and attorneys). 
























 There was a specific judge who envisioned the power of electronic communication in the future (today) and ruled to break up ma bell (AT T). Also huge was the TeleCommunication Act of 1996 (where Bill Clinton and Congress gave media corporations the digital spectrum free of charge).

You should look for docs on Comm history or Comm law. I remember seeing one or two of them in college. They were PBS or 60 minutes or something maybe.

Edit: email any media professor and you'll get a list. 




 Most unfortunate on so many levels.
