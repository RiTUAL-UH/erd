 I already got my refund! it was approved than two days later BAM 


































 How does the maintenance records look? that is very important for a car with 100k miles! 




 I am looking to purchase this honda with 39,000 miles for about 13k the auto check looked good except it was used as rental at one point. Still the price is really good and the mileage is very low any advice ? 
























 Thanks, I was thinking that or 29th! but a second opinion helps alot! 




 Hi everyone I really need this picture to be sharpened or better quality. A small date is what I really need to know on the picture. Its very important to me. If anyone can help I will really appreciate it.

 Thank you very much! 




 My brother is the one gifting or transferring it to me. I purchased the car already from him. I just need to take the title to register it. I don't know whether to say it was gifted or just transfer it. Or if there is a difference.
