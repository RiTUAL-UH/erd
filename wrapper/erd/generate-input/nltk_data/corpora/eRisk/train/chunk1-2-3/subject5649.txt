 Schindler's List. 


10th grade; our teacher was a stubborn old ass who didn't give us the slightest fair warning, didn't even mention any permission slips. 

We all ended up in a sort of state of shock.


I was in a very, very dark place for a while after that.  




 Came here to say exactly this. People who have seen this movie share a bond, almost like being the only two people to watch a person jump off a bridge. 




 That's why i always point out what i specifically think looks good, like their hair or shirt. The "reason" for them looking good helps defeat that whole "They're just saying that because i actually look like i just got out of a windstorm after rolling around in a sewer and they pity me" thing

Congrats man 
























 My name is Inigo Montoya.


You Killed my father.


Prepare to die. 




 Hell no it's not. Things eventually get better at some point, so knowing that helps. Thanks though 




 Back a while ago my catch phrase was always "See you on the flip-side" or "Maybe in another life." What people didn't realize was i was borderline suicidal, so those phrases had a whole deeper meaning to me. 


But things are kinda ok now. So i guess this is the flip-side.  




 Look. Buddy. I get it. Some monks up on a mountain top yelled out some crazy chants and now you're supposed to save us from the dragons. It's your destiny. But let me tell you a little secret; i've always known I would be a shop keeper. It was decided when I was very young I would run the village shop. You could say that's *my* destiny. 


Now, just because I knew my destiny, does that mean I was given all I needed scotch-free? Hell no. I had to work for it. No one taught me how to manage books, or keep inventory. I had to learn, work hard, and it's the time I spent working that made me into a great shop keeper; not the so-called "destiny" I was given. 


So listen here, buddy. I don't doubt you could be the hero. But me giving you these weapons for free? That's only gonna hurt you in the long run. The monks ain't gonna make you a hero; only you can do that through building yourself into the best possible warrior you can be. By working hard, and training. I get it, I get it. I may seem like a jerk, after all what kind of impact will having to work for four gold coins make? Well, not having to work will make you lazy. Let me tell you friend, it's a slippery slope. Soon it's four coins, then it's walking around enemies and cheating your way through dungeons, and suddenly you find yourself in front of a dragon trying to *cheat* your way out. 

So trust me, when you take the time to earn the money for this here broadsword, you aren't just buying a broadsword. You're buying character. 
























 Awesome jawline, awesome hair, adorable eyes.


 If I saw you in a coffee shop I would definitely do a double take over the top of my book :] 




 Bit late but funny story; the person taking this picture actually locked me out after this. They have a video of me screaming and pounding on the door in boots and a bikini shin-deep in snow ;-; 




 Actually there haven't been any (knock on wood...) 




 Damn. Burn.
