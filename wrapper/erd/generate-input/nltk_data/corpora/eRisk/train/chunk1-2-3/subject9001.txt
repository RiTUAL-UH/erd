    I've decided to come to you guys for help figuring out what’s up with my kitten. Money is too tight to take an otherwise healthy cat to the vet, but I would very much like the opinion of a professional.  She is five months old and just barely half the size of her siblings, and she has been very slow developing.  Can you wonderful pet doctors here at r/veterinarian help me out?
   
   Here's some background information: My 1  1/2 year old cat has had two litters of kittens. Her first litter was underdeveloped, half were stillborn, and some had no fur. They just didn't look like normal kittens. Unfortunately none of them survived.  Her second litter was much better, two didn't make it, but we ended up with 5 healthy kittens, three girls who we named Freckle, Princess, and Valerie, and two boys named Jake and Pluto. Valerie was MUCH smaller than the others, and also looked much different in the face regarding her facial structure. She had no problems latching and nursing, in fact she nursed the most out of all of the kittens. As the other kittens started to explore, she preferred to nap, or just sit there and watch. 
  
   The other kittens grew fast, and started eating their moms' dry food at around three and a half months, with the mother cat nursing less frequently. Valerie couldn’t chew the dry food, her teeth were too small it seemed, but she could chew wet food. For some reason the food seemed to make her bloated and constipated, so we stopped giving it to her and just fed her kitten milk replacer that she would lap up from a little bowl. She stayed the same size, only gaining a bit of weight and filling out a little bit. After researching, I began to cook for her. I fed her eggs from our chickens and ducks, fish, and occasionally chicken or pork. I would feed her three times a day. After the dietary change, we noticed her growing! She also got more active, chasing her siblings around and even spending some time outside with them.  (We live in a rural area, so our other cats spend a lot of time outside).  
   
   At five months, Valerie is just barely half the size of her litter mates. Her teeth are still small, and she can’t chew hard food.  She has hard time breathing sometimes, and she slightly wheezes most of the time.  I have also noticed she seems to have bad eyesight. She has kept the high pitched kitten-like mew, also.  Other than that, she acts just like a normal cat. She loves being held, and will follow me around and meow at me until I pick her up. She is very friendly, and a big cuddle-bug, and enjoys scaling couches and curtains, jumping, and wrestling with her siblings. She doesn’t like being outside, so she is a full indoor cat. I have spent hours searching what could be wrong with her but the closest thing I could find is pituitary dwarfism, or hypothyroidism.

 In the second to last pic you remind me of Ariel :) love your transformation, the eyebrows are magnificent! 




 That commercial scares the shit out of me! It always seems to come on when I'm watching late at night alone with all the lights off, too. Fuck that commercial. 




 I would be trapped in a large, deep, murky body of water floating helplessly as I tried to make out the black shapes swimming around under me, getting closer and closer. 




 Well there's a radiator on under the table, so I think she's sleeping there because it's nice and warm :) 









 I thought the same thing! 




 If you have stretched ears and don't clean them, what happens is dead skin cells build up in between the jewelry and your ear which causes a rather raunchy stank. 
























 I'm pretty sure they'd take you anyways, you'd just be in debt afterwards :P 




 My kitten does that too! I haven't got a clue why, though. 




 Something like this triggered my fear of deep/dark water. I was 11 on a vacation with family in Florida, we rented a boat to go snorkeling. I swam maybe 50 feet from the boat, when I felt something stinging. I looked down and there was jellyfish all around me. I completely freaked out, and almost drowned. Still have nightmares about it. 




 I do the exact same things! But I eat my boogers because I enjoy it. It's nice too, because I rarely get sick.  




 No white after Labor Day. 




 Thanks for the reply! This was very useful, I looked it up and she does seem to have many of the symptoms associated with this.  




 Thanks for the advice! I'll definitely try cleaning out her nasal passages, just to see if it makes things a little easier for her. I don't think the kibble was too large, as she has no trouble eating pieces of meat bigger than the dry food. As soon as I have extra money I am planning to take her to the Vet, but until then I'm trying to take care of her as good as I can :) 





























 Bad Diary Days by Pedro the Lion. Originally heard it as a cover, fell in love with it, and then looked up the original and fell in love with it even more.  




 I was introduced to this magical delicacy over thanksgiving. I ate the entire tray of them.  




 My favorite shirt in sixth grade was a bright orange tight fitting shirt with white stitching that I colored green. It was slightly see through too, so I thought it was cool to wear different patterned tank tops under it. How I 
thought this was a cute look, I will never know... 




 Oh my god, I'm not alone! I usually notice it and just squeeze it out. 




 This is so true! I grew up on military bases, and some military wives have to be the most horrible people I've ever met. My mom has had "friends" go to the Sergeant Major of my father's unit saying that she burned us with cigarettes, locked their children in closets (she baby-sat these women's kids a lot), and some other made up shit. Why? Because one of these women was cheating on her husband and my mom told her that she didn't think that what she was doing was right, and said she did not want to associate with her anymore. Luckily the Sergeant Major realized they were full of shit and just wrote it off. Military wives can be vicious. 




 For humorous purposes. 




 Wow, I am too jealous of your hair! It looks amazing :) I have the same type of hair you do, so I'll definitely have to check this out if it makes your curls look this great!  




 Maybe he means pedestrian as in somebody who doesn't stand out?
