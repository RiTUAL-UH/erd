 A lot of the time I have trouble communicating why I feel so unhappy because there is no one core reason. I hate it when people say "You're not making any sense." after they ask me repeatedly to explain how I feel even after I tell them "I don't know" ... 
























 I try to count back from 10 but it's still really hard... what do you do to calm down? I get really angry like a spike of emotion, then I get angry and sad at myself for being so petty
