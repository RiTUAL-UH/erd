[I Am Legion - Make Those Move (Teddy Killerz Remix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4P_lwiH9Hs)

Also look out for the record label Critical Music. They are putting out some real deep, intelligent but also dark tunes. And they sound more stylized and less muddy and hardcore than most of the dark dnb tracks, what i like. 




 It's not just that she's strong, Diamond plays a pretty mean Shyvana. I spectated some of his games and he was constantly  keeping up with the sololaners level-wise. He even outleveld and outfarmed them and that is pretty amazing as a jungler. His overall playstyle reminded me of Meteos's but a notch higher (cause he's Diamond/#nofanboy #nohomo) 




 How i will manage to watch all the games even though i'll have school:

1. Stay up all the weekend until atleast 6 am and sleep until 5pm. Pretty easy if you're going to get wasted anyway.

2. Wake up around 5pm at sunday, buy a 2l coke and a bunch of energy drinks at the closest gas station and pull an allnighter to watch the first day of games. Don't sleep at all and go to school at 8am.

3. Since you are going to be a zombie at monday evening you can easily go to sleep around 8pm.

4. Wake up at 3-4am at tuesday morning and continue watching the games. I'll probably miss the Fnatic vs Gambit game though since that one starts at 8am. Maybe i can skip the first lesson, not sure about that one yet.

5. Repeat for the whole week.

6. Profit? 
























 Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, The Godfather, Forest Gump, The Lion King

It's pretty bad i know :( 









 Dude that Hochi Remix has a drop like none. Sick! 




 So how do they get out?
