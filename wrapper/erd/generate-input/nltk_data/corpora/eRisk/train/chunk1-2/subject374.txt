 Had a coughing fit while bending over my bathroom sink, the angle I was standing at made my back seize up and I ended up damaging the sciatic nerve that runs down my leg and into my foot which meant my left foot was numb for about 3 months. 




 The day after your period ends...FREEDOM!! 




 Mr. Burns: Smithers, are they boo-ing me?

 8 years ago I applied for a retail job selling handbags, the store manager told me that there was a promising second in charge role opening in the next few months and because of my experience he had worked hard to negotiate with HR so that I could be paid an additional 10 cents per hour...the pay would have come to $10.20 per hour. I appreciate his efforts but it made the company sound a bit too thrifty. 




 Thanks for the advice!! :) 




 Does anyone have any home remedies that actually work to cure a stubborn cold? 




 Lonely Hearts Club 




 Room for one more?? :( 




 You interpreted the question just fine. Your comment still stands. 




 Receivers - what were you really thinking when you got them? 




 Awesome!! Congrats :) 




 No beating around the bush - I like it! 









 Good work! 




 Congrats to you both! 









 Taylor Hanson. Yes. 




 When I was 23 I was diagnosed with severe Aplastic Anemia (rapid depletion of red and white blood cells as well as platelets) the same thing Marie Curie died of. I was given a pamphlet after my diagnosis that stated 80% of people diagnosed who do not receive treatment die within a year.  




 Unconditional love and support from true friends...and BACON 




 My mother stood up for my eldest bro when he didn't want to do a blood test to see if he was a bonemarrow match when I was severely ill and needing a bonemarrow transplant...her reasoning - he doesn't want to take time off work.  




 Attractive guys crying and watching Transformers...that Optimus Prime... 




 care to elaborate? 




 Not weird at all! I can completely relate.

 sorry!! 




 Mine had a great laugh. 









 Making sure my vag doesn't appear to be munching on my pants in a hungry fashion aka cameltoe 




 My ex used to do the same thing except he would ask me to wash and dry his outfit for him!! 




 Up until the beginning of this year I had been friends with this person for 11 years since our uni days. In hindsight, it was a toxic friendship - I had to constantly walk on eggshells for fear of pissing him off, he constantly had tantrums, was very calculative and he only helped others if it benefited him. Everyone was scared to stand up to him because we didn't want to rock the boat. 

After coming home from a road trip with a group of friends to celebrate my birthday I spoke to a mutual friend about how hurt I was that this friend constantly sulked, got angry and even gave me the silent treatment for a couple of hours. This "friend" had told me on my birthday that when friends piss him off, he likes to make them feel like shit. That was the last straw for me, that's not what friendship is about. 
This mutual friend told this guy what I had said and obviously this "friend" of mine was royally pissed and started ignoring me while trying to gather a merry band of idiots to turn against me as well. He managed to turn another friend I had known for 11 years against me but was unsuccessful with the others. (We're all in our late to early 30s)

We never patched things up, I was very upset about it all for months but then I started realising that I was finally free of this toxic influence in my life and I could now enjoy the friendships I choose to nurture. It's not about how long you've known the person, it's about the kind of influence they have that matters for example, whether they're positive and supportive people. It's still very awkward when our original group gets together but it's OK, I'm spending most of my time now with wonderful amazing friends. 




 It's the simple things in life for me, I'm trying to appreciate what I have and concentrate my energy on the things I enjoy the most in order to find my own inner happiness and contentment. My biggest problem I'm trying to work on is to continue to work towards issues within my circle of influence rather than factors that I have no control over (circle of concern). 




 I'm from New Zealand - my impressions of the following states:

Texas - Steak all day everyday
Florida - Key Lime Pie
Louisiana - Creole shrimp, okra and collard greens
Maine - Clam Chowder
NYC - Street vendor hot dogs
Hawaii- Spam
Illinois - Deep dish Pizza

 




 People who don't know how to queue and try to cut the line or stand beside you instead of behind you. 




 Not seeking professional help when I first needed it, instead I've wasted years going through periods of depression and self-loathing - not realising that I was the reason for my own unhappiness.  




 Bacon. 




 Good luck!! :) 




 A Beef Wellington would impress me! 




 You ABSOLUTELY need to give it a shot before you move away! Good Luck! 









 Were you guys able to recover from it? 




 Did they work? 









 If only I could figure out how to clone you....I'd make a fortune :) 




 Yikes! You're ridiculously hot and in my humble honest opinion - heads and shoulders above the rest of the boys on here ;P Keep on keeping on :)  




 Sherlock - Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are awesome! A 2 year gap between seasons is far too long though.
 
























 A rough looking homeless guy approached me at the bus stop in the city, I figured he would ask for spare change or a ciggie - he instead asks me "what's a lovely girl like you doing in a dump like this". Sweet man made my day. 




 Tampons and sanitary pads 









 I had a PICC line inserted when I was 23 (severe aplastic anemia) right in the bend of my elbow. It was definitely a strange experience that coldness. Hope you're all good now! 




 Done. You're welcome. 




 Thanks everyone! Hope you had an awesome Xmas!

 The movie Shaun of the Dead - watched it on our first date

 Check out this Greek restaurant - so good we ended up going twice during our road trip - http://www.costastaverna.co.nz/ 




 haha nice!
 




 I can be quick-tempered and tactless 




 I don't visit my immediate family because they're cold and miserable people who don't care about anyone else but themselves. I wish I knew what it was like to grow up in a loving home.  




 Shaun of the Dead - great date movie that one! 




 I was on a school camping trip and we had gone snorkeling one afternoon, our guide for the day can't have been more than 5 years older and was smoking hot. I wasn't a huge fan of breathing out of my snorkel so I was slightly panicking. When I saw from my underwater view that everyone was perched on a rock resting I was stoked. I was even more stoked to see that among all the perchers was the smoking hot guide in a wet suit that hugged all the right places. I "accidentally on purpose" grabbed his junk as he helped me climb up onto the rock. I was 12. 









 I've been losing confidence in myself lately which makes me worried about doing a shit job, so I was hoping for advice on how to be a better leader. Thank you all for your suggestions! 




 You had me at "meat" üçó 









 thanks! 




 should the results be up for everyone now? 




 Distractions, time and zero contact 




 Aye? Her automatic payment had already processed, she went ahead and made another payment through online banking because she didn't read her invoice that stated she didn't have to do anything further - we're happy to refund the second payment back but I don't see how that's our "system's fault" that she didn't read the information on her invoice. People have a responsibility as a consumer to read the information they are given for a product/service they subscribe to. 




 I'm trying to see if my mate's bro is full of shit :) 




 Wow! That's pretty cool! Always wanted to try doing a past life regression session myself.

 Smeared her own shit all over the toilet walls

 That's just one that bugged me, I didn't have time to add any of my other stories. There was a time someone wasn't happy with our policies (her bill was very much overdue) she was yelling and swearing for approximately 19 mins straight and after telling her my surname (she asked) she completely lost her shit...."what kind of surname is that?" blah blah blah and questioning whether I was "even a New Zealander" - that stung a little bit.  




 I organised it for her, no worries there - just would have been nice to take ownership of her own error. 




 A customer had accidentally paid her bill twice, she lets me know that she wasn't aware she had an automatic payment set up and stated that she was a busy teacher ("grappling with reports etc.") so she picked up the invoice and paid it without thinking. She suggested the "system" should be clearer to remind her about the automatic payment. The bill clearly states she has an automatic payment in place and that she does not need to worry about making a payment....no wonder she's grappling with those reports... 




 woot!  




 hahaha exactly!  




 I heard you bleed heavily for 4-6 weeks after giving birth..is this true?? 




 Hmm ok it's similar to when you're busting to go to the bathroom for aaagessss and that feeling when you finally go and you kind of shudder from the relief...kinda like that :) 




 Lunchtime.
