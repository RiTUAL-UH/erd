 Its really weird, a year ago I couldn't even have imagined ever being this happy again. Even if I thought things were better, I still felt really bad and just assumed this is what "normal" is like. It feels really strange sometimes now. 
























 I wish you all the best - keep trying and don't be afraid to change things in your life if you feel you need too.
