 just because he's sitting in a normal chair doesn't mean his legs are functioning. I imagine wheel chairs get uncomfortable after a while, and maybe the chair hes sitting in is stationary, so he couldn't set his wheelchair up anyway.  




 how much money did you originally pump into this? 




 my aunt is a heroin addict. the second time she went to rehab, she met her eventual husband, another addict who fathered her child. shes obese beyond belief, and is ruining the lives of my grandparents. she has never had a job, and has lived off the kindness of others for decades. anyways, whenever we would have family dinners, she would be invited, just so we could get her 8 year old son into a positive environment for a little while. know its small, but one of the things she did that got under my skin the most happened on my aunts birthday. i was sitting at the kids table, (im too old for it, but i was playing with my little cousin) and my cousin was super excited to eat the cake we had. he spent all of dinner talking about it, just pumped up, because he never got to eat awesome food at home. anyways, desert rolls around, and my aunt gives him some cake. now, as i said, his mom is super obese, so we never give her cake and what not. as hes trying to eat the cake, she keeps nagging him to give her some, and threatening to ground him and shit if he doesn't. eventually he gives it over. it was just so fucked up to see something as innocent as a little kid eating junk food to be poisoned by such a terrible person. of all the things she has done to my family. stealing away her sons childhood is the most unforgivable. 




 i have read killing joke, dark knight returns, long halloween, all the really popular stuff. wondering if there are any super important batman reads that arent as popular as those titles.  




 not enough people live in most of these areas to justify the billions it would cost to build these stops. i hate awkwardly busing around as much as the next person, but this isn't an investment that would ever pay off.  




 clearly the work of drug kingpin, todd cannot be stopped 




 I drop my phone a lot, looking for a VERY sturdy case, at a low cost. help? 




 Thank you, its good to hear that there are other people out there who understand what this is like. I just don't think I can ever fully explain what I am feeling. Like when I first tried to explain things to my family, no matter how much I said, I could never really describe what I felt. I know I need to use the resources at my disposal, I just don't really know how. How can I be honest with other people, if I have a hard time being honest with myself?
