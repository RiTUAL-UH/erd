 I've must've wasted more than 15 pieces of paper trying to wrap my mind around this.

A tank is half full of oil , which has density 920kg/m3. Find the work (in joules) required to pump the oil out of the outlet. Assume g=9.8m/s^2.

The tank is a right circular cylinder and is lying on its side. The radius is 1.5m and the pump extends 1m. The length is 6m.

I had to rewind some parts at least 3 times because I couldn't see the screen through all the tears.

 And even if you decide to lose just one more pound, be sure to post more pics. Your handsomeness is always welcome :)   




 Try [electro-swing.com!](http://electro-swing.com). they have lots of different genres of swing, lengthy dj sets but really awesome tracks!

I like minimal beats too. Beats are suppose to compliment a good swing track, just like salt and pepper are suppose to compliment a good steak.

 Sweet. He's in Vancouver now. Lucky us.  




 This is a fantastic source, thanks so much. 




 Thank you! 




 My sister believes that at some point Canada had a climate similar to one at the equator, before the Ice Age. I know that Canada has sub-tropical and arctic climates but I can't find any information to refute her. 

Is it possible that at some point in history northern part of North America had a desert or rainforest climate? 




 Ay Ah ah ah Ay! 




 The earth is 3 million miles (5 million km) closer to the sun in January than in July.
