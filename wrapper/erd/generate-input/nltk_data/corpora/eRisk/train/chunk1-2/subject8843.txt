  There is a significant difference in the interpretation of scientific studies when compared with the desired

Scientific studies do seem to work in terms of statistical significance, as the article says a sleeping pill such as Rozerem makes you fall asleep ~15 minutes quicker and makes you sleep for 20 minutes longer. Considering the potential side affects of the morning hangover and addiction that would seem to be a small benefit. Why do you disagree with this? 




 I sometimes find that I am similar. If I get a good nights sleep then I seem to be punished for it the next day by being awake for about 24 hours even if I am tired after 18.

I am currently trying Magnesium Citrate and 5-HTP which are showing some early signs of being useful, have you tried those? 






















































 Thanks. I had heard a theory that if you already have enough serotonin then neither 5-HTP nor l-tryptophan will help. In fact if they convert to  serotonin then you may end up with too much and not be able to sleep, hence causing insomnia. I guess it works for some and not others.  









 When I can't sleep I find that I MUST get out of bed for a while or I will just lie there awake all night long. CBT treatments will also recommend getting out of bed and going to another room so that you don't begin to associate bed with being awake. It is possible that you managed to get into a light sleep and were then woken up but light sleep on its own is not very refreshing. 

People who have sleep apnoea apparently find it hard to enter REM sleep. There is a possibility that is happening with you as you are unsure if you are sleeping or not. See if a partner ever notices you not breathing or snoring. If you snore and it stops for a while that can be an indication as well. 

I used to get music repeating around in my head - it is infuriating. I eventually got rid of it with a very silly sounding exercise. When ever I noticed it I would think 'STOP' and push the music to the outer reaches of my mind. It took a while (a few months?) for it to completely stop but I have not had that issue for years now.
 




 Has anyone tried these? My initial reactions are hopeful but I am the same with every new thing I try. They often fail within a few days suggesting that I am just getting the placebo effect due to the excitement. It would be good to hear from others who have experience or opinions. 




 You may want to try 5-HTP and or L-trytophran which are both available at health food shops. They both convert into Serotonin which is then converted into Melatonin at night. Commercial Melatonin comes from a cows brain and may not be as good as that produced by your own pineal gland. 5-HTP and L-T are the base building blocks of Melatonin and so may be better.

Commercial Melatonin is also very strong. A healthy adult male should produce about 5-25mg of Melatonin from the pineal gland. If you are taking 1 gram at night then that could be 40 times more than is expected. A book called "Reset Your Inner Clock" describes in layman's terms how having too much Melatonin in the blood when you wake up can shift your next nights sleep onset time by up to an hour. I would hypothesise that going to sleep too early may result in insomnia. cet.org are developing a micronized form of melatonin that mimics the natural cycle of melatonin produced by the pineal gland. Melatonin never worked for me - I am now trying 5-HTP and L-T but I am taking L-T in the afternoon as it seems to make to too buzzy if I take it just before bedtime. 

Are you sleeping now your parents are back?
 




 I saw a TV programme years ago about sleep paralysis. A lot of artwork from the 16-17th century depicted demons sitting on the chests of people lying in bed. That is derived from people experiences of sleep paralysis. 

There are two nodes at the base of the brain near the spinal cord that control waking and sleep. They are meant to act like a switch so that you are either awake or asleep. In people with sleep paralysis they both stay on, so the person is asleep but thinks their dreams are real. 

It sounds scary, I am glad I just seem to have insomnia and not that. Sorry not much use but I found that TV programme interesting - it has stuck with me for a decade or more now. 




 Magnesium is supposed to be a relaxant and I have found that seems to be useful over the last few days - that is all I have been taking it for. Magnesium Taurate is apparently the best absorbed but Magnesium Citrate is also meant to be good - Magnesium Oxide has a poor absorption rate. It apparently works by pulling Calcium out of the muscles which helps them to relax. If you are doing heavy lifting then it may help with the aches and pains and also help your mind relax. 

I also have also heard that Melatonin does not work for some people but does work for others. For those is does not work for then the base building blocks of 5-HTP and L-Tryptophan convert into Melatonin. I found that 5-HTP kept me awake at night and so I am taking it at lunchtime to increase Serotonin levels. Serotonin should then be converted into Melatonin at night. It is too early for me to know if this works for me yet.

All of those are sold in health stores as supplements and so may be useful. They are cheap to try and maybe you will have some luck with them. Good luck!

 




 Could you let me know why you think the article is 'bullshit content'? It looks at 9 scientific studies to form an opinion. You may disagree with the derived opinion but that doesn't make it a 'bullshit content'. If you think the quality is low then I would appreciate your reasoning as to why so that it may be improved. Thanks. 




  sting from a single source, but I do mind posting bullshit

Sorry, I am new to social sites and haven't figured out how to use them yet. I will try to take what you say on board.
