 I'm sure I'll get flamed for this, but true friends don't write each other off for life choices. My BFF is pregnant. If she's happy, I'm happy.  




 Really want to respond with "You know what day of the year I love NOT having kids? EVERY SINGLE PAYDAY." 









 After I told my grandmother that I didn't want to have kids, she told me that if she could do it all over again, she wouldn't have them herself. It was just what you did back then. She is MORE than supportive of my choice. She tells me not to get married either! 




 I work in IT security. There is definitely a market for that in Richmond, and I believe it will continue to grow. A lot of people at my company moved to Richmond from the DC area - some for this job, and some before they started working here. It's becoming such a common thing that I really think the Richmond area will be an exponentially bigger place, population-wise, in 20-30 years.

My company (a Fortune 10) is hiring right now for quite a few positions. Shoot me a PM if you want to talk about what you've been doing specifically. 




 You're spending too much time and energy trying to justify your life to other people. I've done this myself too. Just let it go and focus on living your life, not explaining why you are living it a certain way. Sure people will say dumb things, but if they weren't saying something stupid and insulting about the childfree life, they would be saying something stupid and insulting about something else. It's what people do. 

Go live your life with no regrets.  









 I wouldn't say anything to them. Honestly, they are already WELL aware of the crying and are probably going crazy themselves trying to stop it. Not even parents like hearing that racket nonstop. 

This is just one of those reasons that apartment living sucks. In my last apartment, the guy below me had a dog that barked all day long while he wasn't home. Drove me insane. I love dogs and have one myself so I was understanding to a point. Eventually I mentioned it to him and he tried a bunch of things like leaving the TV on etc but nothing stopped it. He ended up getting rid of the dog. I enjoyed the quiet but felt pretty shitty after that one. 

 




 If he has a problem with how you are handling it, he should help HIS child with his homework. It's nice of you to help SS, but that isn't your kid and you have a right to have a limit where once somebody hits that limit, you don't help them anymore.  




 I don't mean comedy. I mean bad poetry, angry performance art, and stuff like that. With VCU here, there has to be some of this around. 




 There was blood left at the scene, but if the suspect hasn't been arrested for a felony since then, their DNA wouldn't be in the database and would not pop up as a match. 




 Wow. That's scary. I would say 99% of the drug related homicides I ever saw were gunshots. Stabbing someone like that is pretty... Personal.  




 Interesting. Well regardless, it's an interesting read.  




 God. Never would have imagined someone doing that ! 




 I'm in this area a lot and I'm confused by this. Knowing that turn, it seems like the only way this guy would have been hit is if HE hit someone ELSE coming the opposite way on Broad.

To be making a left turn onto that street, he would have been going east on Broad. The street he was turning into is a two-way street, but coming off of that street onto Broad is a right turn only. Unless some idiot thought they could turn left out of there. 




 I saw this mentioned in another thread, so I looked it up out of curiosity. Not much out there on it, except for a video that Henrico County published:

http://henrico-va.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?publish_id=98

According to that video, there were drug overtones. The overkill also points to the suspect being someone they knew. 

I'm surprised there isn't more out there about this. I used to work in law enforcement and I'm pretty well-versed on cold cases, missing persons and unidentified bodies around the state. I'd never heard of this one until today.

The police have samples of the suspect's blood, which wasn't very useful at the time, but with the DNA advances since, all they need is a name. Given their ages, the fact that they knew a lot of people, and the possible drug activity, SOMEONE probably knows what happened that night - someone other than the suspect, I mean. There was a struggle, and the suspect would have had a large/deep laceration on his hands or arms.

Anyone remember this?

 




 Hey guys! I came across a book at the library I wanted to share here. It's called "The Skeleton Crew" by Deborah Halber - all about the web sleuths out there solving cases like this. 

I used to work in law enforcement investigations and there was another thread where people were asking me how this happens, how people go missing and aren't reported etc. This book gives some insight on this. 

"The Missing" by Andrew O'Hagan is good too, it's UK based but the same scenarios apply there. 

 




 Either or both. I ran into a LOT of this misogyny on dating sites. Well, this type and worse.  




 Yes, any time I hear a man tell a woman "the truth" it's always something hateful disguised as being helpful. I guarantee he is currently on a dating site engaging in this same behavior.  




 Knew we wouldn't have to wait long for a misogynist to come along and try and bump the OP down a few levels. 




 thank you! 




 Ah, I get it now. Thanks a lot! 




 I'm confused how that generates taxable income. I've already paid income tax regardless... right? 




 thanks!! 




 I recently got a very nice raise (30%) and I'm trying to get my finances straight. I currently contribute 8% of my salary to my employee-sponsored 401K which comes directly out of my paycheck, so I don't even notice it missing. I chose 8% because my employer matches 50% of what I put in, up to that point.

I have opened up a rollover IRA to roll over my old 457 plan (government version of a 401K) from an old job. Right now it is a traditional IRA, but I apparently have the option to do a one-time conversion to a Roth if I so choose. I haven't figured that one out yet.

My question is, with either a traditional or a Roth IRA, do those contributions have to be taken directly out of my paycheck? I have a couple of different savings goals right now so I would like to have the option of manually putting the money in every month, at least for awhile. I'm a "saving personality" so I'm not worried about blowing the money if it doesn't come out automatically. I just want to have little leeway so if something comes up that I want to do (like take a trip or something), I don't have to deal with changing my contributions through my employer. If I can just transfer money over to the IRA like I do my savings account - manually every paycheck, and adjusting by more or less depending on what's going on in my life - I would prefer that.

I've googled this and haven't found an answer. I'm wondering how that would work with taxes. If I'm doing it after I get my paycheck, then the money has already had income tax taken out of it. If I put it into an IRA, will I get taxed twice? 




 Couple more things you have to keep in mind for older cases:

1) A lot of missing persons cases got brushed off back in the day. Either they wouldn't take reports for cases like this, or they would take a report and not do anything with it, leading to -

2) At my department we had a few cold case missing persons cases that slipped through the cracks and were never entered into the national database NCIC (probably because the case wasn't taken seriously at first - in which case the missing person status wouldn't pop up for regular review by the reporting department (by NCIC guidelines). So they end up forgotten... and flash forward to today, they aren't in the online missing person databases that are available now. So there's basically no way to easily connect them to unidentified bodies.

Oh and 3) it was a LOT easier to change your identity before 9/11. It was WAY easy to just slip off in the night and start using a different identity. These days there is more of a paper trail if you go missing voluntarily. We had a lady disappear, family thought she was dead... a month later her SSN pops up in public records and lo and behold, she's in another state. She just said screw it and left without telling anybody. We only were able to track her because she kept using her old information. It's harder now to just make up a new identity without getting caught. Years ago, it happened all the time.


 




 Yep... all of this, 100%. 




 But from what I saw in my old job, a LOT of missing people fall under these types of categories:

- homeless/transient, so no one really notices them "missing" 

- left on their own accord as an adult. From what has come up about Grateful Doe/Jason, sounds like he had already left voluntarily. Add to that the fact that he was following the Dead, thereby entering "transient" territory above. 1995 was a different time, no cell phones and Facebook to keep tabs on people. 
- established pattern of leaving for long periods of time. when they don't come back, people assume they decided to leave for voluntarily, for good this time.

- drug/alcohol problems, which in turn lead to "established pattern of leaving" or homelessness

- bad or no relationship with family, or family all deceased

So generally, lots of people (sadly) are in situations where no one notices you missing, no one cares you are missing, or they assume you just want to be left alone and not found, so it doesn't occur to them to file a missing persons report. I'm sure a lot of people also assume that the police won't bother putting a lot of manpower into a missing person report unless it's obvious that the person is a) underage; b) has a severe medical condition or mental disability; c) signs of foul play exist, or d) it's VERY unusual behavior for the person. And sadly yes this does happen. 

One of my hobbies is street photography, and I come into contact with a lot of homeless and "train kids" who ride the rails around the country. It's a whole subculture of people. Who would notice these people missing? Also with homeless/transient people, there's usually a dislike/distrust of the police. After all, they get harassed on a regular basis, typically. If they ARE traveling in a group and one of them disappears, I don't think it would be likely that they would go file a police report. Same with homeless people that stay in one area. Going to the police about this stuff just doesn't generally happen. 




 I used to work in law enforcement - in Virginia - as an intelligence/investigative support analyst. I have a passion for missing   unidentified cases, and still do, even though I left the field.

The Grateful Doe case was one of the cases in my state that really bothered me deeply. I spent many, many hours - over the course of many years - researching the case, trying to match Grateful Doe with missing persons reports across the country. I used what law enforcement databases and resources I had to try and figure out who this young man was, or even who the Caroline's were. Something, anything to help.

Obviously all of that effort was fruitless, given that he was never reported missing. I figured that might be the case - it happens a lot, for a variety of reasons.

When I saw the new developments recently, I actually cried. I am so happy this looks like it will finally be resolved. I'm also glad to see that Jason was a happy person who looked like he truly enjoyed his life and was living it the way he wanted. A lesson to us all...
