 Whole new meaning to "With bells on." 




 This guy walks in, sits down at the end of the bar and orders a stiff drink. 

Bartender comes back a little bit later and since its a pretty slow night, he decides to chit-chat with the customer. After a little bit the bartender asks the man what he does for a living. 

Customer says, "I'm a Center for the Dallas Cowboys."

Bartender replies, "Man, it must be really tough having to do that."

"Its not too bad. I enjoy it" 

"No, I meant being openly gay in Texas." 




 No, I sleep on my stomach/side. 




 And I really hate normal people sized things. 

It's just cool enough for me to want to be completely under a cover, but no, it's feet or shoulders, you don't get both. Oh and if I manage to crumple myself into a small enough ball, my feet still hang over the edge above the ankles. 

I wish I could just bring my futon mattress up here. 




 So... When does your centerfold come out? 









 Fuckin' Timber Creek man.  




 Fuckin' chavs.

 I feel like everyone is kinda small sized, but I don't think I'm that tall.  




 Other than car issues, work, shit like that, there is no reason a single, childless adult should ever be late.  




 Is Corgi plural for Corgi? 




 And when we find a way to better deal with the radioactive materials we can handle it then. People act like technology doesn't advance.  




 Its OK, hun. Don't you worry your pretty little head with big thoughts like this. 




 Holy crap. 

It's about detail, like how 8-bit graphics on a standard definition screen isn't the same as super fucking high def. 

Jesus. Can has reading comprehension? 




 Yes, you can see a defined version of east and west, but what they're saying is that the dots aren't an accurate visual representation of where these people live.  




 Better than a glass of scotch. 




 I just realized, if I hadn't read the title of this post, I would have no idea what this ridiculously in-depth article was about.

 Am I the only one here who has to be mentally attracted to someone before I can keep it up? 

If you're a bitch, you're a bitch and no amount of hot can make up for that. 




 "For a few hours."

If someone you know is depressed, encourage them to see a doctor. Obviously being active does help, but seeing a doctor should always be the number 1 priority. 




 Seriously, I just want a lay and this chick is willingly taking a facial? 




 I can see how that is confusing. 




 A little, give or take ~500 miles.

 "a bit unfairly bad to the new owners" 

The new owners did a shady deal with the property owner to force the old owner out with no chance of being offered a new lease.

 Sometimes I wonder how much of my life I spend on trying not to seem racist or sexist (while being neither), and what I could be doing with that time instead.

 Associating Cuomo in the title suggests there is some scheme to undermine the other candidate, who I might add is not named in the title. 

All you end up with is Cuomo being involved in the arrest of challenger to his office. 




 Invoking Cuomo's name is editorializing the title.

 There have been 3 serious incidents at nuclear plants.

I really appreciate it when a lady figures I'm actually a giant teddy bear. 




 So no objective purpose = no purpose? 




 Yeah. 




 The Beacham was offered the location, they accepted. Beacham ownership didn't have anything to do with the decision to not renew the lease, but didn't think twice about taking the space.

 I couldn't possibly comment on that being a completely accurate statement. 




 Hey, I work there, here's what I know, the weekly article that's up is pretty full as well. 

The Landlord isn't renewing the lease. 

Last day is probably August 30th or 31st. 

This is about all 3 spaces as they are owned by the same company, BarBQBar, Eye Spy, and Sky Sixty.

 I know its a bit out of context for a lot of us, however I've been mostly free for a bit now, though I feel lie I'm starting to fall into depression again. (Bi-polar II / manic depressive since I was a kid.) 

Back story; Met a lovely lady a year (around abouts) ago at a mutual friend's birthday party. Nice woman, perhaps a bit drunk, talked a while, facebook friends later. 

Get to talking, she's pretty cool, works in graphic design, responds positively to advances, sexual exchanges including suggestive photographs even though she's in a relationship (I knew) plus she's 13 years older (I'm mature, she's immature). 

We continue talking, life, love, sex all that, advances that she reciprocates to the extent of still being with someone. (Nothing ever happened though it very well could have. Yes, I know. Cheats with you, cheats on you.)

Around her birthday, her BF dumps her, kicks her out, for reasons that she either didn't tell me or he never told her. After a while she agrees to go to lunch with me and then the next week come over and let me make her dinner and watch a movie with drinks. 

Week later, she has to skip dinner because she said she found out he cheated on her and was feeling sick as a result, then tells me later that week she has started seeing someone and that she is confused why I would be upset about this as she told me she couldn't date someone who worked at a bar or who was younger. 

I didn't take this as she thought I would, and that she thought she made that clear before. Back and forth for a few weeks, things said in anger and with inhibition on both sides. 

Anyway, I get past that, ask her how its going, blah blah blah, ask her about her drinking. 

She says she stopped a few weeks ago. (lightbulb) I say good that she stopped drinking so much as it elt like half the times I talked to her she had been. 

And of course, it appears she was. 

Fucking of course, clearly no one could be interested in me unless they were drunk half the time. I don't even know why I try. 

This is more of a rant about the slide of someone with the history of depression than the life of, But, IDFC shit happens. 









 Kid: I don't know, what color are the firetrucks in Miami?

Dad: I don't know, it's Your-ami. 




 but if they did, they might still be married. 




 I was diagnosed when I was 11. Every step I have taken since has tightened the noose around my neck. High School was easy, living with the possibility of escape in alcohol is difficult. I'm 27. I work as a bouncer in a club. I might be good at it, but the discount on drinks is worth even more. I work 3 nights a week, and the nights I'm off, I spend $40-80 on cheap whiskey. 

Ever wonder what life is like when you have barriers no one will break?

I like to call it The Slide. You know its happening, you know why, but there isn't a damn thing you can do about it.

Do you know what its like to ask for help and the only response you get is silence? Ever wonder what life is like when you ask yourself if you have to kill someone to fucking notice? 

I don't want to die, but what reason do I have to live? 
























 For artists in design, web and general media.

Something the size of a pen that could detect what color something is. You'd put it up to the color you want to 'collect' and you could store like 500 or so colors. Then you could hook it up to a computer and you would see all the different colors you caught and the hex code and the Pantone or other companies info on the color. 

There would be different levels of product- RGB or CMYK; 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000 captures; how nice the pen looks (like a nice fountain pen); bluetooth connectivity to your tablet or phone so you can check the color if you'd like. 



















 I've been working on a campaign for a local candidate and I needed to find a way to describe him in a tagline. So I was thinking about it all day Friday and off and on the week prior, and just chilled all weekend. So this morning, I woke up had some breakfast, went outside for my coffee and a smoke and as I'm finishing both, BOOM. 

It's perfect. Simple, progressive, clear, and wraps him in a neat little envelope. 

FUCK YEAH. 



















 Its all fun and games until someone loses a rib.
