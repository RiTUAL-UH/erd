 I did. I was always an incredibly morose, aloof child and was diagnosed with depression and on meds since I was 10. I'm 25 now and it really makes me sad to think that I've been this way most of my life... Even before actual diagnosis. I feel you on that. It makes it hard sometimes to imagine a truly happy life when I've been sad for most of mine and that really hurts to think about. I envy people a lot of the time who can at least look back on the happy years of their lives, but I guess I just hold into the idea that I've had to be a stronger person because of it, even though I feel weak so much of the time.
A specific memory I have is of being a little girl and getting out if having to go to birthday parties. I would get invited because they invited the whole class, but I never felt welcome or like I would be able to have fun. I used to sleep with bags of ice on my chest hoping I would get a cold. If that didn't work, I'd drink a bunch of hot water and blow my face with a hot hair dryer to convince my mom I had a fever so I wouldn't have to go. Being a depressed child really is strange. 




 High fiving or one chain link fence from a mauling??
