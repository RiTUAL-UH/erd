 This is incredible! 




 Kipper. I loved his super grown-up British accent. 




 OMG I LOVE THIS SHOW!!! I would probably still watch it today if I could find it. 




 Wait. Lego LoTR is for kids? 




 The feels! 









 70.

No 69 jokes? 




 At first I thought he was standing backwards over his bike. 




 I came here to say there's a good pun in here somewhere. This was it. Thanks, redditor. 




 TIL the meaning of the word "scause". 




 Been in that sub now for an hour. Thanks. 




 Good lord. 




 Thanks for being the source of my internet failure this morning, OP. 




 It took me a good minute to figure out what was going on here. 




 I saw this while laying in bed last night and immediately regretted my decision to be on reddit at 3am. 




 I made myself a busy person. Job, school, two companies, significant other, friends who will still come back if I ignore them for a while. I only really get bored on the weekends when I'm trying my best to ignore my work email. 




 OP what are you, gender-wise?

I only date men, but I'm attracted to other women almost as equally. 




 "If you were a true psychopath you wouldn't ever admit it"
or
"You can't be a sociopath because you do xyz-thing-that-normal-people-do"

Bitch shut the fuck up. It took me years of therapy to be able to admit it and start doing normal things and unless you have an advanced degree in abnormal psychology, I don't want to hear your opinionated "facts" about what ASPD/psychopathy is or is not. 




 Can we please go back to this tradition? 




 I-95 south to 295 south, then went the wrong way on 64. Apparently 64 and 295 meet up more than once? 295 always confuses me because I always seem to be taking 295 south, regardless of which way I'm traveling. 




 I have 600+ hours in the Elder Scrolls series. 




 It's a drive I've done a few times, so I didn't bother with the GPS. I was running on maybe 6 or 7 hours of sleep since Friday morning, and had worked 37 hours over the course of two and a half days, so my brain was not anywhere near working properly. 




 I just drove home from an extremely exhausting weekend event. This was suppose to be a four hour drive, and it turned into nearly six and a half, with no stops and no traffic.

I get on the highway to go home, heading south. About 45 minutes in there is a junction and I can either take I-64 East or I-64 West. In my exhausted state, it somehow makes sense for me to go east. I'll note here that I live in southwest VA. So I'm driving along and I see a sign that tells me VA Beach is around 65 miles away or something like that. That should have been my first clue. But instead of wondering why I'm being told how far away VA Beach is when I'm suppose to be traveling away from it, I think "Oh cool I'm close to VA Beach, maybe I'll stop there!" And I keep driving. **For an hour.** Finally, I see a sign about the infamous bridge-tunnel, and that's when the red flags start going up in my head. I very slowly realized my mistake. It was not a good realization. I was already exhausted and just wanted to be home, and I'd just added two hours, at least, to my trip. Also wasted a quarter tank of gas. I angrily turned around and made my way home.

tl;dr Went the wrong direction on the highway, didn't realize for an hour. 




 Example: boyfriend texts me to go pick him up. I'm sitting on reddit writing a particularly lengthy comment. I text him back with a lie, saying that I was finishing up a work email and would be on my way in a minute. I didn't even think about it; I just said it.

Anyone else lie about the most asinine things for no reason at all? 




 I usually become suspicious of somewhen when I notice their reactions to things. I think a huge tell (and one that's really hard for me to fake) is the reaction to a bad situation. Example: my friend left my apt the other night, I immediately got into bed because I was exhausted. Friend knocks on door and says car has been towed. I'm just like "well that sucks. Goodnight". I assume normal people would want to help or something. I got called out on that. So if I see someone have a reaction like that when they should be more engaged, it throws a flag. Then I observe their other behavior and figure out if I think they are part of the 1% or if they just have trouble dealing with certain situations.

Also ITT: "let's argue about how many psychopaths we may or may not come in contact with." C'mon guys, we've been doing so well lately. The reality of it is this: the best guess that science can give is that 1% of the population suffers from some severity of ASPD. That's 1 in 100 people. In a typical day you will probably come into contact with more than 100 people, assuming you do things like go to lunch at a restaurant or work in a building with other people or walk around a college campus, etc. I think the more valid point is that you don't directly interact with over 100 people a day. So while the likelihood of you being in close proximity with a psychopath is not terribly low, the chances of you actually befriending one is slim. 




 It's less mood and more preference. I hate the cold. I hate the rain. I want it to be 75ºF and sunny at all times. When it deviates from that I don't like it. It doesn't change my mood though. 




 You're literally just naming suicide missions. 




 **This is the greatest story I've ever seen in this sub.**

I'm usually the bitch who's guilty of sweater-stealing (I think I have three that belong to the boyfriend right now), and I'm assuming she's not a psychopath, so I have nothing good to offer.

Please keep us updated on how this turns out. 









 The article cuts off the reason why the people who beat up the gay couple can't be charged with a hate crime. Anyone know the reason? 




 Learned this playing Alchemy. 




 Yep, pretty much this. 









 Hi all. New to the sub. I've never actually been involved in any migraine help community and I don't actually know anyone else who is afflicted.

I've been having weekly migraines since I was a teenager. I read a lot about going into a dark, quiet room and laying down, but that never seems to make a difference. I noticed a while back though that I seem to be temperature sensitive. During the migraine, I go through hot and cold changes. One minute I'll be burning up and having cold sweats and then the next I'll be shivering, like the cold is coming from the inside and no amount of sweatshirt or blanket can make me warm..

Also, laying down makes everything worse. I find that the pain is most manageable when I'm standing or walking around. I spend a lot of time pacing the floor.

Do these things happen to anyone else? Any opinions or tales from experience? Dunno if it's helpful or not, but I'm on sumatriptan 50mg. 




 We see it all the time. Someone tapping their foot or fingers to the music in their car, or even music in the doctor's office waiting room. Why is that? 




 Here's the background: for as long as I can remember (at least as young as 10 years old) my ears have felt clogged up. I try to yawn or move my jaw around or hold my nose while blowing to try and get them to pop, but they won't. Sometimes I have autophony. When I try to make them pop, I just hear some crackling, like they're trying to, but the pressure won't equalize. I can't go under 5-6 feet of water without it being excruciating because the pressure won't equalize. Oddly, I have zero problems with flying. It's extremely uncomfortable and I just want my ears to be normal. I've had hearing tests done and I have no loss of hearing. They've tested the pressure behind my eardrum and found it to be normal.

I've been to 4 ENTs. The first 2 told me I had allergies and told me to take daily Claritin and stay indoors. Tried daily allergy meds for a few months with no change. Staying indoors is not an option. I've never had allergy problems in my life, but I was willing to give anything a go. After that didn't work, ENT told me I would just have to live with it. Third ENT told me the same thing.

Fourth ENT was the first to actually try real solutions, and even though he couldn't fix me, I still thank him enormously for trying. He put me on two months of steroid nasal spray. When that did nothing, we decided to undergo the placement of tubes in my ears. I had that surgery three weeks ago. There is still no change. At my follow-up yesterday he has now told me there's nothing else to be done. He says sometimes the nerves send a signal of fullness to the brain so that it feels congested when it's really not. I can't accept this, because then the water depth wouldn't be an issue and I wouldn't get that crackling sound when I move my jaw around. Also, the autophony probably would not be an issue if it was just pesky nerves.

reddit, there must be something to be done. The congestion makes me want to stab holes in the side of my face as if that would help relieve it, and it feels like this all day, every day, for the past 15 years at least. I will answer any questions that may help solve this mystery.

Please help! 
























 I have both a MBA and a MBP. I need to transfer the same set of files to 250 USB drives. I've been doing Google searches for good software to complete this, and everything I've found is either Windows only, or it's designed for hard drive back-ups. Any software suggestions? Thanks! 
























 I use the two-finger trackpad gesture to go to the previous web page (quick for looking at pictures and such). Worked fine for the three weeks I've had this laptop. Installed RES 10 minutes ago and now it's not working. It causes Safari to freeze the current web page. The program itself works fine, other tabs that are open are not affected, but the tab that I'm in to try to swipe back freezes, regardless of if it is reddit or not. When it freezes, it moves maybe 10 pixels to the right, as if it's started to swipe back, and then sticks there and becomes unresponsive. I'm unable to open a new tab or navigate away from the current page. If it's the only tab open I have to restart Safari. I am able to close out of the affected tab.

 I'm in the States. I have a tiny portfolio, partly because I can't really share the stuff I've done for the company I work for. I do front-end development/design work. I specialize in HTML5 and CSS3, with some jQuery thrown in for things I can't accomplish in CSS. I can do enough PHP for an email contact form. I would like to do personal/resume websites or small business pages, mainly static pages, but any opportunity I can take to help build a good portfolio would be appreciated.

Shoot me a PM if you need some work done. 









 I'm creating a video in iMovie 10 that needs to play as portrait on an iPhone 5. I can't find a way to make the video the correct size/aspect ratio. It needs to be 9:16 (I'm pretty sure). I really would just like to be able to crop the sides off the picture. Any advice or help? TIA. 




 My boss has tasked me with doing video editing, and seeing as I'm a programmer, I have zero clue about what I'm doing. I've watched enough YouTube tutorials to know how the software works, but now I'm getting into the content and I'm lost.

There is around 30 minutes of work-out video and I need to cut it down to a 30-ish second preview. There is only one camera angle, and it's relatively wide. I have no control over filming; I just get the finished videos handed to me from above.

There are over 20 series' I need to do this for. I'm using iMovie 10.0.3 on a MacBook Air.

What should I be looking to pull into a preview? Just playing around with the first series I managed 23 seconds, including a 4 second title. I just took a few seconds here and there showing different movements and with the trainer saying motivating or explanatory things, and crossfaded them together. Now I'm stuck on how to end it, and I really don't think the current 23 seconds that I have is any good. This is content that will be pushed to clients, so I need it to be at least halfway decent.

Everything I find by doing a Google search relates to movie editing and things with different camera angles and lots of dialogue and none of it is relevant. Any tips or advice is much needed and greatly appreciated. 




 "“A lot of doctors and other mental health professionals just throw up their arms, and say, ‘What’s the point of even identifying antisocial personality disorder? What are we going to do with these people?’” said Donald W. Black, M.D., a professor of psychiatry at the University of Iowa Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine in Iowa City."

Not even the mental health professionals know what to do with us.

Also, that is the longest name of a university department college I have ever seen.

[Article here](http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2013/04/06/surprising-myths-facts-about-antisocial-personality-disorder/)
It's an article titled "Surprising Myths  Facts About ASPD". I'm not sure if the article is worth the read, mainly because I doubt the validity of some of the data. Maybe worth a skim through. 





























 I'm not a particularly active person, but I'm not out of shape by any means. I do this thing every now and then where I'll run a mile and some every day or two, over the course of maybe a week, and then I stop for a month (or three). Is there any actual long-term benefit to doing this? I lack motivation to get into a runner's habit (working on that) and every now and then I get on a running kick. To put it in perspective, I use the Nike Run app and it tells me I've only run 11 miles so far this year. I tried to find some article to post, but no luck. 




 I'm pretty drunk. Thank god for autocorrect. I also just discovered video Snapchat so I think all my friends will either hate me, or be very amused, in the morning.

That is all.

Goodnight Reddit. I'm off to drink another bottle of wine. 




 I've done some reading but have yet to find any good research done on the observed differences in how ASPD presents in each gender. I know it's much more prevalent in men, so most of what I can find online is from the male perspective. What differences, if any, have you noticed when working with ASPD patients of both genders? 




 There have been a few embedded discussions here recently relating to the difference between men and women with ASPD. I've been doing some reading in a few psych medical journals to try and find some concrete research on it, but the majority of the studies use prison inmates. I have found that the current statistics are estimated at there being 1 woman diagnosed for every 3 men.

Has anyone done any research you can share? Or what have you guys observed if you know any ASPD people of the opposite gender? I know we have at least one other active female member on here who I'd like to hear from.

Edit** More info

I posted this over in /r/psychotherapy as well, to see what the therapists and psychology professionals had to contribute. One person said he/she noticed that men usually acted alone, where women usually had an equally antisocial male counterpart. Found that interesting. 




 Slow internet at work, so this is every single one for me. I feel like it takes away from the (supposed) awesomeness to see it before it's fully loaded. 




 I ask because I went to VA Tech and today is the 7th anniversary of the shooting. I went to high school with the shooter and two of the girls who were killed, one of which I knew decently. Because of those things, I always have some semblance of an emotional response to this day, although I can't figure out what it is. Sadness maybe? Remnants of what that day was like? I don't know. My emotional palate is small. Regardless, it's a day I stay away from people because everyone is emotional and doing that whole "we're part of something greater" community thing and I can't stand it. Some people a few years ago wanted me to go to the candlelight vigil at midnight, so I did. I spent the whole time reading everyone else's faces. It was people-watching gold.

I also have the unpopular opinion that 33 Hokies died that day, because I include the shooter in the death count. I said this to one person, once, and will never make that mistake again.

But other shootings and violent acts/natural disasters, I don't feel anything for at all. Boston Marathon, Sandy Hook, hurricanes destroying cities, etc. I have that attitude of, "well, that happened" and I barely give it a second thought. 









 I have a very small, old dog. I've found that I can just feed it and walk it and it doesn't require any attention other than that because he just lazes around the house all day. It's nice because he's barely there, so I haven't had an opportunity to really get bored with it, and he doesn't bother me. It's like having a moving piece of furniture that I have to buy food for.

It should be noted I suppose that I haven't had the desire to harm animals since I was young. People, yes, but I like animals. 




 These are happening naturally.

My first one was about a month ago. I was drifting off, and then my body felt like it was buzzing. It got so intense I could hardly stand it. I assume I entered the dream state at some point while the buzzing was going on because all at once the buzzing stopped and I was floating off of my bed, toward the ceiling. I know it wasn't an OBE because I looked down at the bed and my body wasn't there. I floated until I bumped into the ceiling. I was terrified and mustered all of my strength and screamed, which took me out of the dream. My roommate later told me that he'd heard me scream. I was so scared by what had happened that I couldn't sleep the rest of the night. Instead, I stayed up and researched as much as I could about lucid dreaming.

I was afraid to have another one through the following nights, but enough time passed that I stopped worrying about it, and I wrote it off as a one-time freak occurrence.

Until last night. I was drifting off and felt the buzzing again. Instead of being scared I tried to focus on it. Next I knew, I was floating around and out of my (closed) bedroom window. I dreamed I was exploring a little historical town. I was playing around with running and floating, and just controlling myself in general. The dream was so vivid. Normal dreams for me are blurry, or hazy, but this one was crystal clear, like I was really there on a bright sunny day. I could look around and go where I wanted. It was devoid of other people tho, or any action. It was just a little empty town, and me learning how to control my dream self.

I also noticed that I was aware of what my physical body was doing. I realized in the dream that I could float if I got a running start and kicked my legs, like swimming. I could feel my physical body moving my legs while I was doing that. Or if I turned my head to look at something, I knew my actual head was turning too. It almost felt like a part of me was caught between asleep and awake.

It lasted maybe ten minutes. I came out of it suddenly when I heard someone whisper "hey" in my ear and it sounded like it was whispered into my actual ear, and not my dream-self ear. (Note that I sleep alone.)

I'm very freaked out by the whole experience. I have done some research and looked through r/luciddreaming and noticed that a lot of you do this intentionally. Is it uncommon for it to happen naturally? Any advice as far as controlling it or dealing with it? Is my experience in line with a typical lucid dream? It's a frightening experience for me and any words of wisdom are appreciated.

tl;dr: Started having LD naturally. Freaked out. Help. 





























 Do we know of any others with a vortex manipulator? And we don't know any other handsome time agents with them. Hint drop by Moffat maybe? 





























 Making a mock business website to add to my "I'm new to web dev" portfolio and my positioning is making me want to put my head through my computer screen.

Can someone please offer some insight as to why the positioning is off and ways to correct the issue?
