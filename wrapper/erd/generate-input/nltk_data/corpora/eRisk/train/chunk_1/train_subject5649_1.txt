 Schindler's List. 


10th grade; our teacher was a stubborn old ass who didn't give us the slightest fair warning, didn't even mention any permission slips. 

We all ended up in a sort of state of shock.


I was in a very, very dark place for a while after that.  




 Came here to say exactly this. People who have seen this movie share a bond, almost like being the only two people to watch a person jump off a bridge. 




 That's why i always point out what i specifically think looks good, like their hair or shirt. The "reason" for them looking good helps defeat that whole "They're just saying that because i actually look like i just got out of a windstorm after rolling around in a sewer and they pity me" thing
