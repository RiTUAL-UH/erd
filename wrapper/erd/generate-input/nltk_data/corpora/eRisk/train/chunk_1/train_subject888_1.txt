 interesting! good to know (more incentive to stick to beans, rice, and salads...the good ol' unprocessed staples of my diet). 




 tea—or more specifically the caffeine in tea—is indeed a diuretic. despite that, though, i really don’t know what to make of your case. really quite bizarre!

edit: grammar 




 Thank you for the reply.

I have mainly been reaching out via company websites' "Contact Us" forms, and have received a few lukewarm—but thoughtful—responses. 




 Hello,

I need some help. I am only 20, but so far college has been quite rough for me and I believe working with tea is my true calling. Upon discovering several small, ethical tea companies around the country (America), I have begun reaching out but so far have not been too lucky.

My passion is clear, I think, as is my willingness to work. Am I doing something wrong? Are these companies looking for something specific that I am lacking or perhaps failing to mention? Is there just not a great labor demand among these smaller companies?

Please respond with any relevant or potentially helpful information; particularly if you work for/have worked in the tea industry. This is my dream and, as I said previously, my true calling in life. Thank you. 




 I personally recommend ZeroWater! It is the only five-stage water filter on the market that removes 99.9% of dissolved solids in water. They are available on Amazon in differently-sized pitchers and dispensers, and from my personal experience, are ideal for tea (and general water drinking). :-) 




 Just out of curiosity, why are you against the recreational use of marijuana? Not trying to incite a war or anything. It's just not an opinion one hears a lot these days. 




 Thanks! 




 If you're in the mood for something a bit different (smokier) than your standard Earl G., Harney amp;amp;amp;amp; Sons' Earl of Harlem is supposed to be pretty excellent.

I've been meaning to pick some up myself, because their teas are pretty damn awesome:

Also—and I am speaking from experience here—Rishi Tea's Earl Grey Lavender is absolutely delicious (and pretty luxurious, particularly with some cream and honey):

For something a bit less pricey and in bags (although the flavor profile may not be as "interesting"), here is Rishi's plain Earl Grey in sachets:

 Does anyone know of a place to get a good tea needle and knife? I tried Amazon, and perhaps I was just not patient enough, but everything seemed pretty questionable and/or overpriced. 




 Yes! I live in Western North Carolina (where Panther Moon is based) and was able to try a few of their puerh teas at a tea festival in Black Mountain.

Everything about their tea 'friendship caravan' was wonderful; although they were very busy I received a thorough explanation on each tea I tried, all of which were delicious.

I ended up taking two ounces of a 2009 Zhang Lang sheng/raw puerh home, which was nice because I have been too lazy/forgetful to invest in a tea needle and knife. The tea is of superb quality—very fresh and light for a puerh—although if you want something with more age or in a different family of tea altogether, I can personally vouch for the value and quality of Panther Moon Tea Co. 




 They don't have to be books about dealing with grief or mental illness, nor do they need to have 'saved your life.' Just try and recall any book that has helped you break a depressive cycle or gain some new, maybe reinvigorating perspective.

Please avoid religious texts if you can.
