    Friday October 11th 2013 is a sad day. The heating has gone back on. One is not amused.    
    
    
    @kentprivateeye that WAS the plan! We are the lowest paid, not sure if that's an official stat but it's true!    
    
    
    @kentprivateeye happy to recommend you for insulation?!    
    
    
    @kentprivateeye I'm not choosy, I tell people we can insulate anything!

    My biggest regret of 2013 was not seeing The Stones at @GlastoFest or Hyde park.    
    
    
    My biggest regret of 2014 will be stripping completely naked at @theboyroos and @pinkgypsy1 wedding    
    
    
    Before the vows    
    
    
    I was wondering where @dean_itfc was and then he pops up like a rash    
    
    
    My absolute highlight of 2013 was having my tweet favourited by the greatest rock and roll band ever pic.twitter.com/1chvSKLjon    
    
    
    @kevinbridges86 a bar in Ramsgate (fucking miles from you) used to sell it on draft. In pints. Mad.    
    
    
    @rockgod1970 when it appeared you were the first person I though of! It's twitter top trumps!    
    
    
    @rockgod1970 I unfollowed him!    
    
    
    @Adem that's when @pinkgypsy1 said they were shit! Never liked her #itwillneverlast

    @theboyroos @Adem @pinkgypsy1 fuck all bless her, fuck all    
    
    
    I predict @rockgod1970 is desperately tweeting celebs. Between wanks.    
    
    
        
    
    
    Thank god for twitter, how else would I have known its raining?

    How gay is Will Young!    
    
    
    @GazetteMargate let's hope so, sort of    
    
    
    @pinkgypsy1 I have googled it, looks ready enough    
    
    
    @pinkgypsy1 easy not ready

    @JasonManford ah! So THAT'S why you are back on twitter!!    
    
    
    I used to know a sweet young lad called @dean_itfc , I dunno what happened to him, I think he may have died in the arms of his sweetheart?    
    
    
    @OSLioness @Se_Railway @VirginTrains I used to work in Warrington and it's really not worth Â£380

    I have a child. It does not eat. At all. In 8 days, maybe 2 slices of bread, 1/4 tin of spag, handful carrots, an orange. How do I fix it?

    @Andrewq1978 she must be hungry! She has not eaten! She would easily eat a chocolate bar though!    
    
    
    @Andrewq1978 she isn't eating though, yesterday she had half s small tin of spag and a satsuma but that's it, nothing today so far    
    
    
    @GoodDeedLaura thanks, I am convinced its behavioural rather than anything else, frustrating though!    
    
    
    @RRRamsgate I guess there is fruit in it?

    Anyone know of and ideally recommend a cheap, online kitchen co.?
Loads of people have said order online but no one has said where!!    
    
    
    @RRRamsgate how bizarre!! Just on that site, is it straight forward, ordering etc? Did you design it?    
    
    
    @RoyalBarkBisc the kitchen itself, probably go to AO for appliances    
    
    
    @RRRamsgate ta, I'll look into    
    
    
    @RRRamsgate that's what we have done!    
    
    
    @RRRamsgate nah, we have had them do it twice! They should be about Â£5000 cheaper then we would buy off them!    
    
    
    @RoyalBarkBisc I think wren are quite expensive, they are opening up Westwood soon, trying to avoid big companies    
    
    
    @RoyalBarkBisc ta, I'll have a look

    We had 2 men round yesterday to quote to repair our roof, the quotes were Â£420 and Â£60!    
    
    
    @MadgeHooks a while back we had a quote for Â£600, it's just random numbers out of a hat!    
    
    
    @rockgod1970 oddly, but more sensibly, the Â£420 one    
    
    
    @BritishGasHelp you and me both! If anyone asks you about their broken meter in east Kent tell them the engineer is busy, thanks!    
    
    
    @MadgeHooks I don't think you are taking this very seriously!

    @Tesco there's a lot the store can do, 1) try smiling, she really must hate her job!    
    
    
    @Tesco  2) does she really think I am going to try and con Tesco out of 60p?    
    
    
    @Tesco 3)does she really think I would walk across a car park in the bloody rain? For a mars bar?   Unless I'd paid for it? Receipt in hand?    
    
    
    @Tesco manston, Ramsgate

    Woah! Surely you can't live with a 15.5 yr old wife in UK even if legal in your own country? #benefitsstreet    
    
    
    focussing on  wrong people on #benefitsstreet , the hard workers living in fear of their lives or the actual scrounging scum?

    I do suspect if I was a celeb in the 60s and 70s I would have been in court today #operationyewtree    
    
    
    @rockgod1970 you've been in hiding since 1998!    
    
    
    There's a Chinese takeaway in St Mary's Bay and it's proudly displaying its 3/5 food hygiene rating in its window, this makes me queasy!    
    
    
    @amyeee hello The Girl, can you ask The Boy if a thing for listening to iPod whilst swimming is a good thing? What's the thing called?

    @kathlaaaa still an ox? Will power alone or crystal meth?    
    
    
    @kathlaaaa well done! After a week it's easy, just ask Pete Doherty    
    
    
    Sonia has done alright for herself.  Martin must be kicking himself.

    @posiekins I assume that's a joke?!    
    
    
    @posiekins you should go to sunny beach, right up your street

    @posiekins @Andrewq1978 they must of, that's why it took 3 days to find him, they knew he was there but wanted to be sure

    @rockgod1970 @ThanetGazette @Nigel_Farage is that you in the onsie?    
    
    
    #margate let itself down with the @Nigel_Farage protest today, most of them goons probably didnt even know what they were protesting about!    
    
    
    Parenting skills have nothing to do with being on benefits! They are due to intelligence and common sense #benefitsstreet
