    Time to start saving for a Skyline    
    
    
    @LaurenWeale where were your halo and wings then?    
    
    
    @LaurenWeale I didn't see them, and besides, it's not a scary costume    
    
    
    @LaurenWeale ahh beat me to it 😉

    Been a pure lazy day today 👌    
    
    
    Saturdays can suck my nuts. Just want work to be over so I can go out and get wasted tonight    
    
    
    Some students have their head stuck so far up their arse it's unreal. Absolute fucking weapons    
    
    
    The question is, do I start drinking now?    
    
    
    Hype clothing is just the worst    
    
    
    Has Miley Cyrus always sounded like a man?    
    
    
    @SJM306 will Scott Mullard ever learn to read his tweets before posting them?

    Wasn't going to but a dump valve is rather tempting...    
    
    
    @SJM306 gold wheels are happening soon...    
    
    
    I'm glad that the video of me punching myself in the face exists 😂    
    
    
    Standard Sunday viewing of Blades of glory 👌    
    
    
    If I stopped caring about most things I'd probably be so much happier    
    
    
    I get bored too easily    
    
    
    Made a mistake with my grammar on an Instagram post. You know what? Fuck the system, it's staying that way

    @SJM306 I may have to invest in one...    
    
    
    @SJM306 it's probably the best mount that I own    
    
    
    I need to man up    
    
    
    Soooo cold 😢    
    
    
    I'm not about paper cuts, fucking sucks!    
    
    
    I'll be honest, I am going to go and see the Lego movie when it is out    
    
    
    Too much effort to put my phone on charge    
    
    
    I need to stop imagining that I've replied to texts and actually reply to them    
    
    
    Actually having a bit of a social life and some fucking great nights out has killed my bank account 😢roll on the 18th    
    
    
    @LaurenWeale I get distracted 😖    
    
    
    @LaurenWeale there's sawdust in there somewhere

    Spent my Friday night catching up with series 3 of Fresh Meat, worth it.    
    
    
    I'm quite happy just to stay in bed all day today

    @SJM306 hell no, I've got lots to do...    
    
    
    A day of doing nothing really helps to get over being ill    
    
    
    "Omg Coca cola advert, it's Christmas" it's November, shut the fuck up and sit down.    
    
    
    Instagram is broke, fuck my life.

    Moto GP time 👍    
    
    
    Those Hondas are so much faster on the straights    
    
    
    Sort of fixed my car door now on to ironing, not as manly as car maintenance but still productive    
    
    
    So hungry 😩    
    
    
    Jesus. My 13 year old brother had to ask me what a wheelbarrow was, he described it as a thing with one wheel that carries dirt    
    
    
    Really want to go to Africa on Safari    
    
    
    Boring snap chats are no fun    
    
    
    Man, people on Facebook do my fucking head in    
    
    
    Would white alloys look ridiculous on my car?    
    
    
    So hungry still, anywhere still open where I can get food from?    
    
    
    Find it so weird having a Monday off    
    
    
    At home on my day off listening to Goldie Lookin Chain. Life 👌    
    
    
    Wish I had someone to spend my days off with    
    
    
    Everybody and their mums is packing round ere    
    
    
    Why don't I live in the countryside 😔    
    
    
    I like the way you die boy    
    
    
    Dear @CapitalOne I don't have or want a credit card with you, please stop sending me shit in the post    
    
    
    The first song that I ever downloaded from iTunes was Hummer by Foals, Jesus    
    
    
    How can you not like Die Antwoord?    
    
    
    I fink u freeky    
    
    
    Proper slacking with everything recently, needs to change!    
    
    
    Wet roundabouts 😏    
    
    
    Sometimes I miss after work beers    
    
    
    Sort of happy at the moment    
    
    
    Finally watching Monsters University    
    
    
    @TomAFCTU :( yeah I did    
    
    
    @staceywilliamsz so far yeah :)    
    
    
    Why am I watching Spider-man 3?    
    
    
    I think if I could be anyone it would have to be James Franco    
    
    
    Want to go to stage 2 but it's a lot of money 😩    
    
    
    Original pirate material    
    
    
    Well fuck you too iTunes. All that time downloading music and syncing my phone for it not to actually work    
    
    
    @ChrisLumbard yeah that's exactly what's happened :/ I synced my phone like 3 times and still nothing    
    
    
    @ChrisLumbard don't make things easy do they, reisssudpro@hotmail.co.uk    
    
    
    @ChrisLumbard cheers man, I'll give it a go tomorrow. I updated my phone yesterday so whether that's part of the issue I'm not sure :(    
    
    
    I wanna know your name    
    
    
    In its own little way my body was trying to say that you better stop drinking brandy    
    
    
    Bonus next week, do I? @GoPro pic.twitter.com/LwG2GAJfP0    
    
    
    "She's of the female genre"😂    
    
    
    "I've been swearing like a flipping docker"    
    
    
    So many things I want to do to my car, need more money 😔    
    
    
    Yes! So happy Lotus are running @H_Kovalainen for the last 2 races, good luck fella!    
    
    
    Faithless are spot on 👌    
    
    
    I'm in the house, I'm in the mother fucking house    
    
    
    How I try to entertain my self on my lunch break, I'm useless #bored #useless #gohome http://instagram.com/p/gshNB0kfLR/     
    
    
    No one takes me seriously so why should I?    
    
    
    Vines with little goats in them are the best    
    
    
    So had to go through all this bollocks of restoring my phone because Apples updates are shit, now I've lost all my album artwork 😡    
    
    
    Some people in Telford really infuriate me. A smelly guy has just stood next to me for no reason while I'm waiting to go into work 😡    
    
    
    Flux by Bloc Party is one of my all time favourite songs    
    
    
    Singing in the staff room is not a good idea    
    
    
    The amount of things I've done and places I've been to this year is dreadful, feels like I've done nothing 😔    
    
    
    I've got something to put in you    
    
    
    Glad @ShaunAFCTU and I brought 99p CDs a few weeks back, still finding bangers when listening through    
    
    
    @ShaunAFCTU Shaun, I want to take you to a gay bar    
    
    
    Not going to be the first person to say this and I'm certainly not going to be the last, the roadworks in Telford are a fucking joke!    
    
    
    Ha! Alfie thinks he's a person. Silly cat, that's a humans chair #cat #britishwildlife http://instagram.com/p/gwDvUrEfAv/     
    
    
    Is it weird that I want to go to Finland?    
    
    
    @LaurenWeale I'm the best that's why 😉    
    
    
    And today on Telford Town centre radio, Miley Cyrus    
    
    
    Rather be at WRC Wales than at work    
    
    
    Been paid today, so I can stop living like a pikey    
    
    
    Should probably put a passcode back on my phone but I only tell it to people when I'm drunk anyway    
    
    
    Beer + Pringles = 😋

    Never going to the Railway in Shifnal again    
    
    
    @ChewyLovesYou it's just an absolute smelly shit hole    
    
    
    Sucks going out on Saturday night and then driving to fucking Wales on the Sunday morning    
    
    
    @ChewyLovesYou no idea, it's full of 40 year olds, smells and has a really shit dance floor    
    
    
    Does he look like a bitch?    
    
    
    Just purchased a Christmas jumper for the first time ever    
    
    
    Pretty much spent my bonus and none of it has gone on Christmas shopping    
    
    
    So glad I've got a 4 day week    
    
    
    Bored as funk    
    
    
    Can quite happily say that Pineapple Express is one of my favourite films    
    
    
    These images floating around of some dickheads killing lions and other animals for "sport" are fucking disgusting    
    
    
    Do I purchase a pair of Converse? Been about 6 years since I last had a pair    
    
    
    Can't be arsed with stress anymore

    Forever wanting a Skyline 😩    
    
    
    I was in my own world Saturday night but hearing about some of the other stuff was great 😂    
    
    
    The fact that James Franco has made a shitty action film with Jason Statham still won't put me off saying that he is my favourite actor    
    
    
    @stephstar18 please stop sending my boring snap chats    
    
    
    Ian Watkins is going to die in jail

    Why does uploading photos to Facebook have to be such a fucking painful process    
    
    
    I know I've already tweeted my love for it recently but I fucking love Flux by Bloc Party, fucking gem!

    @TheJewkofIsrael that's sounds 10 times worse than what just happened to me ha    
    
    
    Swear someone is taking my car out for a rally sesh when I'm not using it. So filthy!    
    
    
    Not going to bother getting excited about anything anymore, so if something happens it's a bonus

    Some days I'm just a complete prick. Today is one of them    
    
    
    Got excited earlier because it looked like we might have to evacuate the town centre because of the fire alarm, it got sorted though 😔    
    
    
    Love it when you see someone that blatantly has a mail order wife 😂    
    
    
    @raeganedwardsxo I think that's just Telfords customers in general 😒    
    
    
    @raeganedwardsxo just working in the town centre makes me want to commit suicide ha    
    
    
    When I get home from work I most spend a good hour just sat around in no clothes    
    
    
    Wanna do something tonight 😩

    @SJM306 nahhhhhhhh    
    
    
    Can quite honestly say that I still feel like the biggest dickhead on the planet. Didn't listen to my friends and acted like a twat. Sorry.    
    
    
    @SJM306 basically I fucked everyone over on the weekend and behaved like a twat    
    
    
    @SJM306 yeah basically I won't go there on here    
    
    
    @SJM306 yup    
    
    
    So I managed to iron a hole in my tie this morning and completely fuck the iron up. Day has started great    
    
    
    @ChrisLumbard @TomAFCTU @sophie_crook @BBCR1 @WRDavies @ShaunAFCTU I'm confused :/    
    
    
    So glad that I put Panic at the disco back on my iPod 👌pic.twitter.com/Yu4mxJYCiC    
    
    
    Whatever happened to I Haunt Wizards?    
    
    
    Sub Focus - Turn back time 👍    
    
    
    Last minute Reiss should be my nickname 😖    
    
    
    Although it sticks out like a sore thumb, I'm kinda getting used to having a gold wheel ha #subaru… http://instagram.com/p/i6BykDkfEl/     
    
    
    Hate prepping for something important    
    
    
    So I fucked my hand up about 2-3 weeks ago and I'm still getting lots of pain from it, don't want to go to the hospital though :/    
    
    
    Well, fucked that up :/    
    
    
    It's like literally everything I do and every situation I get into recently I just take my brain out and do stupid things    
    
    
    I see Passat drivers are becoming the new BMW drivers...    
    
    
    Over killing it on listening to Sub Focus a lot but can't help it, so good!    
    
    
    I mean Splash alone is so fucking good    
    
    
    @raeganedwardsxo sucks doesn't it :/    
    
    
    If I knew exactly how much money I've spent since I last got paid I think it would send me into depression    
    
    
    @raeganedwardsxo I don't wanna 😫I went out so much over Christmas 😢    
    
    
    Water speakers, yay or nay? My current speakers have conked out and I don't want to spend ridiculous money on new ones    
    
    
    @SJM306 sound quality good?    
    
    
    @SJM306 I want one of the House of Marley speakers but not paying like £200 when I can get those for £15    
    
    
    This girl needs to stop walking by every morning because I think I'm falling in love with her    
    
    
    Album of the week, song of the week #BiffyClyro #bubbles #onlyrevolutions http://instagram.com/p/i8wTwGkfG9/     
    
    
    Literally all I do when I get home from work is listen to music. It just calms and relaxes me so much ☺️    
    
    
    Someone please explain to me why I've had Yeah by Usher stuck in my head all day :/    
    
    
    Just have the same songs on repeat at the moment    
    
    
    I'm the least you can do, if only life were as easy as you I'd still get screwed    
    
    
    Back to feeling quite happy again 😊and a mid-ish week chill with friends is always good 👌    
    
    
    What a shitty day    
    
    
    Also today has been one of those days where working in customer service makes you realise how fucking terrible people can be    
    
    
    @ChewyLovesYou yes please :(    
    
    
    I just can't take myself seriously with how short my hair is at the moment    
    
    
    @ChewyLovesYou Ooo you know what makes me happy 😁    
    
    
    Constantly listening to this song, just too good #SLDGHMR #Youlovehercozshesdead http://instagram.com/p/i_cmWzEfPm/

    @SJM306 people need to know about the struggles on my life    
    
    
    I should love Saturdays but when you have to work on them you just can't 😤

    Don't want to be here today    
    
    
    Definitely earned a few pints tonight    
    
    
    Been a while since I've been to Spoons so tonight should be alright to be honest    
    
    
    Knife Party could remix any song and I'd still love it more than the original    
    
    
    I'm also ready like an hour early, what's that about???    
    
    
    I could not be any more un-colour coordinated if I tried

    Got to be such a pikey this week, can't really afford to do anything 😖    
    
    
    Over the next few weeks I just plan to have as much fun as I can and also get very drunk 😁    
    
    
    I'm getting so desperate to try and find someone to go and see Chvrches with me 😖    
    
    
    @MissFarmerJones my old car was like £130 for the whole year 😣oh well knew this when I bought it ha    
    
    
    Top song 👌pic.twitter.com/FQ2zRk93lF    
    
    
    Had to mystery shop Nationwide today, only reason I agreed to do it is because there are some very attractive women that work there 😏    
    
    
    On my lunch breaks I'm quite happy to just sit by myself listening to music. Just anti-social really    
    
    
    Thanks for your Facebook status on letting us know you're in labour 👍some people man    
    
    
    Work, home, food 👍    
    
    
    These songs always put me in a better mood when I'm a bit down, no particular reason why, just good… http://instagram.com/p/jKNbaTkfOd/     
    
    
    Looks like I'm off to my first football match on Saturday then    
    
    
    It's gonna be a long week 😞    
    
    
    @AshCloke of course 😉    
    
    
    I don't like being a prick and flashing people but if you're going to overtake fucking over take! Or just move over to the other lane!    
    
    
    Saturday could possibly destroy me. Sounds like it's drinking all day and I don't think I will survive ha    
    
    
    @ChrisDorning @hannah3890 beautiful 😂    
    
    
    @hannah3890 if that isn't proof I don't know what is 😉    
    
    
    Silly things make me happy 😊    
    
    
        
    
    
    Absolute fucking joke    
    
    
    Half 11 lunch is absolute fucking bullshit too    
    
    
    Always walking into door handles 😑    
    
    
    So angry already and I just know the rest of the day isn't going to be any better    
    
    
    Walking home actually improved my mood a little    
    
    
    The days where you don't give a shit about anything are great 👍    
    
    
    Thank god pay day is tomorrow 🙏    
    
    
    Get January out of the way then it's hardcore saving 👊    
    
    
    Think I want Snoop Dogg to be my best friend    
    
    
    I need to stop buying white t-shirts 😖    
    
    
    Dreading getting my car looked at

    Well this is odd. Been paid but don't want to spend anything yet 😶    
    
    
    All I'm thinking about is next week pretty much    
    
    
    I think the reason I'm always cold at home is because I wear hardly any clothes 😐    
    
    
    Didn't like ASAP Rocky at first but I will admit he's growing on me    
    
    
    Ever driven a car where the brakes don't work properly? I have.    
    
    
    May have to sell everything I own 😒which isn't much anyway
