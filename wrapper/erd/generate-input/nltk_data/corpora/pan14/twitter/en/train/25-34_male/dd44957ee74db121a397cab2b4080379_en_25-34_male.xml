    @jsvtraffic The turnpike is a mess but finally moving. Probably going to take crews all night to get the ice that has accumulated.    
    
    
    @NBCPhiladelphia I have a video of me stuck in traffic. Check my Instagram feed.    
    
    
    So some of my Instagram pictures may end up on the ABC and CBS news tonight.   That should nudge my @Klout score.  Heh.    
    
    
    Apparently my video is on cnn.  I should have combed my hair. http://instagram.com/p/hrZp61CUmq/     
    
    
    Just passed the accident. They are still another 20 or 30 cars that need to be coat away.    
    
    
        
    
    
    @VictorFiorillo I wasn't very happy to be stuck 5 hours in the traffics stoppage.  Although I did have fun tweeting all day.

    @CoconnellFox29 Look good on TV. I was stuck on the turnpike all day today.  Heh.    
    
    
    @CoconnellFox29 same here.  A national news broadcast used one of my Instagram videos. Heh.    
    
    
    @CoconnellFox29 I know right?  Heh. But they didn't put my twitter handle on it.  What kind of dog and pony show do they have over at @ABC?    
    
    
    @JohnBolaris @jbolaris @phillydotcom good read.    
    
    
    @katiefehlinger So what's the deal for tomorrow?  What time will I be slipping and sliding on crutches?  Heh.

    @jsvtraffic @erikashych Olf.  I feel ya.  I was stuck on there a few weeks ago for 5 hours.    
    
    
    @jsvtraffic Two 5+ hours closure of the PA turnpike going west bound int he same general area does not reflect well on PENNDOT.    
    
    
    @jsvtraffic Snow squalls shouldn't cause a completely disruption of the highway system.  (Including I-78)    
    
    
    @jsvtraffic There is no westbound highway access for the past 5+ hours other then Rt 30 (blah) and 422 (ends in Reading).

    @jsvtraffic Welp.  401 for me.  @CBSPhilly  says turnpike to be closed for another 2 to 3 hours.    
    
    
    @jsvtraffic @CBSPhilly Probably less ice to remove then the major accident 2 weeks ago.  Still... I ain't taking the Turnpike back.    
    
    
    @drew More like... D'ohlwallet.   #seewhatIdidthere    
    
    
    @jsvtraffic Any word with the turnpike being closed what secondary routes are going to become congested? I'm going to guess, 322, 23, 401,30    
    
    
    @jsvtraffic Nice job ;)
