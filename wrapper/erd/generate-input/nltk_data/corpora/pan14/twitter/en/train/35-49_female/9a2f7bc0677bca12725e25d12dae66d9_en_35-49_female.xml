    hubby & little girl - torchlight; little boy - minecraft; university girl - streaming starcraft tourney. i'm the only one unplugged at home!    
    
    
    of course, in tweeting, i got plugged for a minute. and now to let go yet again of my gadgets - appropriated by the kids. back to the book!    
    
    
    been up since 7AM, and have been reading in absolute peace! they're all still asleep! ‚ù§    
    
    
    too lazy to get coffee    
    
    
    began working on my talk two weeks ago in an effort not to cram. seems my brain will cooperate only when i'm down to the last few hours    
    
    
    in my effort to work on my talks & ppts, i have followed 20 more tumblr blogs, stumbled upon a few ideas for writing, looked at pix of cats    
    
    
    after successfully avoiding work while earnestly trying to work since 7AM, I guess it's time for coffee ‚ù§    
    
    
    of course, the important ideas will come later, when my crazy kids are all bustling and howling around me and i'm caught up being "mommy" ‚ù§    
    
    
    last night was nuts - watched the starcraft tourney as my kids cheered & explained to me what looked like cockroaches charging at each other    
    
    
    years & years ago, the hubby tried to recruit me to starcraft - I do play Diablo after all, & developed a mean sorceress before Diablo III    
    
    
    all i ever understood were "We require more minerals" and "Zephraim Cochrane, is that you?" everything else, Greek

    so how many ways will the 10 million be split? #NapolesSurrenders    
    
    
    is the president entitled to the 10 million reward? or will it go back into his pork? #NapolesSurrenders

    the timestamp is a nice touch, don't you think? #NapolesSurrenders    
    
    
    does Napoles get the 10 million? she did lead to her own capture - and it's honest money for a change bwahaha #twisted #NapolesSurrenders    
    
    
    no photos? #NapolesSurrenders    
    
    
    i wonder, did the Palace consultant linked to Napoles who got fired get the 10million? #NapolesSurrenders    
    
    
    @patriciaroxlee wow, then it's a two-way preemptive split. 500,000 each - not bad, right? :)    
    
    
    @iampameetupaz haha sabi nga, scripted daw! that or what, nagdoorbell lang sya bigla sa palace right? :)    
    
    
    what happened at 9:37PM, yung pagring ng doorbell? or pagbukas ng pinto? or pagtanggap sa kanya ni Noynoy in his pajamas? #NapolesSurrenders
