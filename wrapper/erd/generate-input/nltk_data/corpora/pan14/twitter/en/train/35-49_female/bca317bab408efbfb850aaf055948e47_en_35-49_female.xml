@archaeologyman You have the internet so it can't be all bad ;-) Merry Christmas!    
    
    
    @4fifty1 Nice!  I mean not the hiding from Christmas but Marrakech sounds nice.  Couldn't hide in London? Or Shropshire?    
    
    
    @4fifty1 @shelter Â£260 I think.    
    
    
    @vickybarlo Wooo - where did got for Christmas?    
    
    
    @mredwards Merry Christmas!    
    
    
    @vickybarlo Nice!  Visiting family or just going away for Christmas?    
    
    
    @crimeficreader Merry Christmas Rhian! Hope you've been well?    
    
    
    @Chiddle84 Yup - and I had to laugh at the heat tweet as my parents have a wood stove which makes you not able to breathe after 1/2 hour.    
    
    
    @crimeficreader New home?  Still Wales?  We're all well here. Spending Christmas home thankfully.    
    
    
    @Chiddle84 Haha! It's when they decide that they can't afford the heating bill but yet will be able to chop wood at 90.    
    
    
    @vickybarlo Well I hope it's a nice one for you too! x    
    
    
    Looking forward to chatting with my family tomorrow although I hate when we get passed around with 'So & so is here, remember them?'    
    
    
    @stevyncolgan Awww sweet - you have the grandkids tonight? How freaking magical is that?    
    
    
    @stevyncolgan Statistically the average time is 5.15 am. Ho ho ho :-)) Merry Christmas Mr Colgan. xx    
    
    
    @LSpurdle Yep. One year I talked to someone who I thought was a nephew for 10 minutes before I realised it was a neighbor!    
    
    
    @LSpurdle This year we have a secret weapon.  FaceTime with bad wifi.  We get annoyed 'Opps, so sorry! Wifi is bad'.    
    
    
    Thanks @Just_Will_I_am for starting the #royalpardon for Alan #Turing! @AlanTuringYear

    Good morning and a Very Merry Christmas! How is everyone today?    
    
    
    @AboutLondon Merry Christmas!!! We're up already as C has been asking to open presents since 5. How is A? x    
    
    
    We gave C the cover to her new phone saying it was a promise for a new one in Jan. Her face was a picture when she got the phone. :)))    
    
    
    @AboutLondon Was there enough sparkles on the shoes? ;-) I can not believe you got her Mousetrap. That game is pure evil ;-)    
    
    
    @AboutLondon Damn yes have replied. Should I stick with email/ tweets?    
    
    
    @AboutLondon Tweets it is then! Stuff from us has been opened but nanny is doing 20 gift Treasure hunt later.    
    
    
    @AboutLondon I got an air popcorn maker and season 1 Columbo!    
    
    
    @AboutLondon Mousetrap has been ban from my house. Many memories of hours setting up for it to be over in 2 minutes. I never had patience!    
    
    
    @AboutLondon Normally they did it with advent but C didn't have time in morning this year. They do riddles & directions (north south etc).    
    
    
    @AboutLondon Sweet! Love the steam train book!    
    
    
    @GiantDespair You too Phil! Merry Christmas! x

    @4fifty1 You got a pug? (Autocorrect really wants you to have a pig btw.) @truongthomas    
    
    
    @truongthomas @4fifty1 Like I said, I'm not going anywhere today. It'll be worth the wait by the sounds of it!    
    
    
    @4fifty1 @truongthomas Ha! I should have known better. Pig might have been right after all ;-) x

    @wood5y And to you! Hope Santa was kind to you?    
    
    
    @mdoness I know I should be happy that she still has the spirit but more grateful she went to daddy at 4am ;-)    
    
    
    @wood5y Dear Lord no. I'm not allowed in the kitchen which is fine by me! I might be asked to help peel carrots... Maybe.

    I've been left to watch the dinner while M drops C's friend off. This can only end in disaster as I only just figure out 1 pan is sprouts.    
    
    
    @M_Fkill They seem to be shredded with bacon and cashews. We're having Boxing Day dinner tonight as too stuffed yesterday.    
    
    
    Evening all! How is everyone tonight?    
    
    
    @DianaPitchers It wasn't good AT ALL but I don't eat vegetables.  How was London?

    @stujallen Same here.  I've such a huge TBR pile right now.  I did get Columbo Season 1 on DVD though :-)    
    
    
    @stujallen Wasn't that a brilliant ep?  I watched it twice.  Would love Murder, She Wrote dvd next. Bit obsessed ;)    
    
    
    @4fifty1 Cool.  So are all the pieces thrown in the air at the moment or just the ones you feel like ignoring? ;-)    
    
    
    @stujallen I keep hearing that but so far I've had NO luck finding them cheap.  Maybe I'm looking in the wrong places. Amazon?

    Tomorrow we're heading to Ikillya (Ikea) - too soon to start crying now?    
    
    
    @diddles54 @scrufflove  I've tried to have C look at things online but w funky walls, we have to see the stuff.    
    
    
    @travellingcoral I can't stand crowds, shopping and quesâ¦    
    
    
    @mannyc C is getting new bedroom set but we need to see the stuff as this old house doesn't have normal walls. Was it crowded?    
    
    
    @diddles54 @scrufflove She better ;-) Currently her room is all over the house (but we managed a lot of bags to charity). x    
    
    
    @travellingcoral C wants a new bedroom set from there.  :-/    
    
    
    @mannyc Seriously, we're on the top floor of an old house.  Straight walls aren't an option & we have sloping ceilings.    
    
    
    @mannyc I tried to talk them going tonight as they were open until 10 but we were playing Diary of a Wimpy Kid ;-)    
    
    
    @scrufflove @diddles54 So true!  And I muse remember that I DO NOT NEED CANDLES! xx

    @stujallen Hope the day goes quickly for you!    
    
    
    @kevtan1066 Planning to be at ikea for 9 for lunch ;)    
    
    
    @ypldn @AboutLondon 4 step sisters (didn't live with us). Yep 2 hours dial up only at night until 2001 when another type of line installed.    
    
    
    @acediscovery Sounds like you had a nice time with family over Christmas - but nothing like going back to your own home ;) Safe travels!    
    
    
    @AboutLondon We should have left an hour ago but Frick & Frack are moving slow. Mug here was the only one up with alarm. AGAIN!    
    
    
    @AboutLondon Breathing and I still have a complicated relationship but getting better. ;-) Any update on virgin coming out?    
    
    
    @AboutLondon Haha - you've done really well, much better than I would have been! Here's hoping it's a quick fix! x    
    
    
    @travellingcoral I know - and trying to keep control of the budget at the same time- *think happy place* ;-)    
    
    
    @scottkeir Thanks Scott! @zakmensah    
    
    
    @AboutLondon I heard about it but thought it was in Europe (literally only heard name). Now want to learn more (we're on our way to Ikea!)    
    
    
    @AboutLondon Just back and we did really good!  Everything will get delivered tomorrow. Ikea is about an hour away from us so it takes long.

    @AboutLondon Sorry - C just decided to go swimming with her friend and we couldn't find googles. Her room is same size as office downstairs.    
    
    
    @Longhouses1 Oh no - been out and about and survived Ikea already :-)    
    
    
    @diddles54 LOADS of candles and C managed quite a nice new bedroom set which was even on sale! How are you? x    
    
    
    @zakmensah @LebelAube I remember Sackler centre in @V_and_A did a program where they lent out cameras to family to snap their fav object.    
    
    
    @Longhouses1 Yes it does.  Been planning it for days now!

    @AboutLondon It's in a freaking warehouse in East Midlands.  Hoping @UPSHelp can help me get more info as should have been here yesterday.    
    
    
    @AboutLondon I'm so freaking annoyed it's not even funny - but if they have a good excuse then they should say what it is grrr    
    
    
    @AboutLondon It looks like it got through customs warehouse on 26th so hopefully not *fingers crossed*    
    
    
    @Longhouses1 Fees were paid in the states so I better not have fees to pay! @UPSHelp

    @drlucyrogers Being Very LOUD.    
    
    
    @jamiezoob Excellent here - in the middle of redecorating which is a royal pain but will smile when it's over.  Sickness bug?    
    
    
    @jamiezoob Not when it's for an 11yo thinking that she's 17.  Compromises are fun to deal with ;-)    
    
    
    @drlucyrogers @mattdawhit And I'm waiting for Google Glass. The door has been knocked 3 times this morning - NOT for me GRRR    
    
    
    @drlucyrogers Well I just went all American on UPS as they claim not to find the address and will try tomorrow.    
    
    
    Right now - UPS is not my friend.    
    
    
    Evening all! How is everyone tonight?    
    
    
    @LSpurdle So annoyed - promised to be here on Friday, then went back & forth today. Driver claimed it was wrong address. Getting refund.    
    
    
    @implausibleblog After putting C's room together, I'm very warm ;-)    
    
    
    @Cornettofairy Deep ;-) I'm totally PO'd at UPS. However, got C's food put together so happy for that!    
    
    
    @miss_scribbler Hooray for brushing off flu! Where's your new pad?    
    
    
    Only just got C's room done but she has new wardrobe, king size bed and bureau. When I said done, I mean furniture is put together.    
    
    
    @miss_scribbler I'll keep fingers crossed for you!    
    
    
    @ypldn Yes!  I owe you money.  Will try to pay tonight or tomorrow (have money but need to find little machine for transfer)    
    
    
    @LSpurdle Me too!  The promised tomorrow between 10-1.  Any plans for NYE?    
    
    
    @miss_scribbler We usually go to the square at midnight which is always fun.  Unless I'm too tired ;-)    
    
    
    @ypldn I know! And well thought out to get the transport tickets :-)    
    
    
    @LSpurdle You up for working on app on Thursday?  I mean I'm free whenever.    
    
    
    @travellingcoral Haha - lets not talk BF but the King size was because the double wasn't in stock.  Got it for same price!

    @gopaldass We usually go to the square with everyone but if it's raining we're going for quiet night with family. Either way is fun.    
    
    
    @gopaldass Very sharp but you need your social media information on there in contact also.

    @acediscovery Yes there are a few of us trying to go March 22 - you interested? And you're coming Jan 13th right?    
    
    
    @crimeficreader Lovely! Here's hoping the army isn't too demanding ;-)    
    
    
    Top tip :-) RT @mikimoo9: If you are visiting a museum today, enjoy! But do bear in mind the staff's aching heads... :-P    
    
    
    @fleming77 Never - just that the fireworks kept them up late ;-)    
    
    
    @acediscovery @PaoloViscardi @HornimanMuseum There is possibly a grant to help with that - they have outdoor gyms in Wolverhampton.

    @Dr_Biscuit I would if I had oneâ¦    
    
    
    @M_Fkill Only if they are from the states.  UK debit doesn't work. Should have No CC option but not appearing. :-/ @Dr_Biscuit    
    
    
    @ThomasMarzano I'm still loving them and learning what they can be used for.    
    
    
    @M_Fkill The killer is I only want to download a free app that is only available in the states. @Dr_Biscuit    
    
    
    @ThomasMarzano Yes - and my response is that these same 'tech overruling life' happened with Smartphones. We humans adjust ;-)    
    
    
    @ThomasMarzano Trade offs could be reworded as progression.  Things *will* be different but doesn't always have to be negative. :-)    
    
    
    @ThomasMarzano Agreed (think we're agreeing on both points).  This is why they are development stage.    
    
    
    @M_Fkill @Dr_Biscuit Genius!  I wasn't trying to d/l app first - it works!

    .@mia_out I think smartphones already killed that.  I see a lot of potential for Glass.    
    
    
    @mia_out So I presume you don't like photos in public venues also? Shame that glass owners are prejudged.    
    
    
    @skirrid Kermit is staying for a bit :)    
    
    
    @mia_out Well it seems specific to Glass as you don't expect venues to request smartphones to be handed in at the door.    
    
    
    @mia_out No - both outcomes are the same.  People thought it odd to hold a phone up to take a picture 5 years ago.    
    
    
    @mia_out Oh I 'get' your point, I just don't agree.  It's a bit extreme to the reality of Glass use.    
    
    
    @mia_out If ppl want to take a pic, they will regardless of medium.    
    
    
    @mia_out Assuming that everyone with Glass is out to take pictures of you also doesn't hold much weight. Pics are only part of their use.

    *whew* Internet is back.

    Me to C:  Stop growing up.
C (hugs me): Stop getting old and cranky. 

HA!    
    
    
    @DianaPitchers Exactly.  Wonât let it slip again. Was travelling a lot last year. @kidsinmuseums    
    
    
    @stevyncolgan Is there a vegetarian option? ;-)

    #GoogleExplorer Charged battery to full last night and left Glass âonâ but idle util 12.27 and battery at 11%.    
    
    
    Itâs amazing! RT @AnneMHayes: I need to get to @BM_AG to see this exhibition. Looks brilliant! #Photorealism    
    
    
        
    
    
    @Chiddle84 True - but you have to remember these are beta. iPhone batteries werenât brilliant at first either ;-)  LOVE THE HAIR!    
    
    
    So today weâre learning about Henri Matisse as a poster needs to be made.    
    
    
    @stevyncolgan I was kidding!  I donât do vegetables - bring on the rabbit and bacon! ;-)    
    
    
    @viperdudeuk Iâve addressed battery in this post: http://www.mardixon.com/Â  - it is depending on what you do/how long it last. 4 hr avg.    
    
    
    I just had to give my phone to C to add names to Instagram to me.  #feelsold    
    
    
    #GoogleExplorer What sort of things are you interested in knowing about Glass?  I want to share relevant information.    
    
    
        
    
    
    @viperdudeuk PS Iâm answering in a bit more in-depth in the article.

    @archaeologyman You have the internet so it can't be all bad ;-) Merry Christmas!    
    
    
    @4fifty1 Nice!  I mean not the hiding from Christmas but Marrakech sounds nice.  Couldn't hide in London? Or Shropshire?    
    
    
    @4fifty1 @shelter Â£260 I think.    
    
    
    @vickybarlo Wooo - where did got for Christmas?    
    
    
    @mredwards Merry Christmas!    
    
    
    @vickybarlo Nice!  Visiting family or just going away for Christmas?    
    
    
    @crimeficreader Merry Christmas Rhian! Hope you've been well?    
    
    
    @Chiddle84 Yup - and I had to laugh at the heat tweet as my parents have a wood stove which makes you not able to breathe after 1/2 hour.    
    
    
    @crimeficreader New home?  Still Wales?  We're all well here. Spending Christmas home thankfully.    
    
    
    @Chiddle84 Haha! It's when they decide that they can't afford the heating bill but yet will be able to chop wood at 90.    
    
    
    @vickybarlo Well I hope it's a nice one for you too! x    
    
    
    Looking forward to chatting with my family tomorrow although I hate when we get passed around with 'So & so is here, remember them?'    
    
    
    @stevyncolgan Awww sweet - you have the grandkids tonight? How freaking magical is that?    
    
    
    @stevyncolgan Statistically the average time is 5.15 am. Ho ho ho :-)) Merry Christmas Mr Colgan. xx    
    
    
    @LSpurdle Yep. One year I talked to someone who I thought was a nephew for 10 minutes before I realised it was a neighbor!    
    
    
    @LSpurdle This year we have a secret weapon.  FaceTime with bad wifi.  We get annoyed 'Opps, so sorry! Wifi is bad'.    
    
    
    Thanks @Just_Will_I_am for starting the #royalpardon for Alan #Turing! @AlanTuringYear    
    
    
    @DianaPitchers Congrats :-)    
    
    
    @SBarryCooper @Just_Will_I_am @AlanTuringYear Absolutely.  And just to be sure - everyone here knows @Dr_Black & @bletchleypark right?    
    
    
    Woot! A delivery from states is in the UK.  I'll have to wait until Friday but at least it's getting closer :)    
    
    
    @ge0_ff Hooray!    
    
    
    @drlucyrogers I still have to wait until Friday and then figure out how to use them but still ;-)    
    
    
    Eek - 30 minutes until SANTA!  Night night all! Sleep well with sweet dress when you get there!    
    
    
    @SaminaKosar @LSpurdle Good luck! May we all survive 'The Call' :-) Merry Christmas! x    
    
    
    Good morning and a Very Merry Christmas! How is everyone today?    
    
    
    @AboutLondon Merry Christmas!!! We're up already as C has been asking to open presents since 5. How is A? x    
    
    
    We gave C the cover to her new phone saying it was a promise for a new one in Jan. Her face was a picture when she got the phone. :)))    
    
    
    @AboutLondon Was there enough sparkles on the shoes? ;-) I can not believe you got her Mousetrap. That game is pure evil ;-)    
    
    
    @AboutLondon Damn yes have replied. Should I stick with email/ tweets?    
    
    
    @AboutLondon Tweets it is then! Stuff from us has been opened but nanny is doing 20 gift Treasure hunt later.    
    
    
    @AboutLondon I got an air popcorn maker and season 1 Columbo!    
    
    
    @AboutLondon Mousetrap has been ban from my house. Many memories of hours setting up for it to be over in 2 minutes. I never had patience!    
    
    
    @AboutLondon Normally they did it with advent but C didn't have time in morning this year. They do riddles & directions (north south etc).    
    
    
    @AboutLondon Sweet! Love the steam train book!    
    
    
    @GiantDespair You too Phil! Merry Christmas! x    
    
    
    @Bashtafarian Wow!

    @truongthomas @4fifty1 Enjoy the walk - nice weather here but I'm not going anywhere until Friday.    
    
    
    @truongthomas @4fifty1 Now that is freaking adorable! S/he needs antlers.    
    
    
    @4fifty1 You got a pug? (Autocorrect really wants you to have a pig btw.) @truongthomas    
    
    
    @truongthomas @4fifty1 Like I said, I'm not going anywhere today. It'll be worth the wait by the sounds of it!    
    
    
    @4fifty1 @truongthomas Ha! I should have known better. Pig might have been right after all ;-) x    
    
    
    For those who weren't up at 5:30am - MERRY CHRISTMAS! 

For those who were up at 5:30am - you crashing too?    
    
    
    @wood5y And to you! Hope Santa was kind to you?    
    
    
    @mdoness I know I should be happy that she still has the spirit but more grateful she went to daddy at 4am ;-)    
    
    
    @wood5y Dear Lord no. I'm not allowed in the kitchen which is fine by me! I might be asked to help peel carrots... Maybe.    
    
    
    @dusty_jacket What an angel!

    @SumoJim So when you get bronchitis I'll remind you of it. ;-) I have been blessed with pneumonia this year again - slows me down :)    
    
    
    @SumoJim Went to doctor Monday as thought it was happening again. Stupid lungs. But nothing compared to tough Brody!    
    
    
    @SumoJim It's been hard, let me tell you ;-)    
    
    
    @ypldn This was the non serious ... Not much difference. Merry Christmas Yannick! pic.twitter.com/uGUDMi57m9

    Just tried to FaceTime mom. She told me to call back in 20 minutes.  I told her she has to wait until Dr Who is over. Daughter of the year.

    @janetedavis We were waiting for most of the family to get over to moms before FaceTime. Up until now, it'll just be parents arguing ;-)    
    
    
    @custard1980 Amen.  But I'm still going :-)
