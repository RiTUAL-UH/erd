    Helicopter over Placa Catalunya. Like they are about to extract Osama Bin Laden. #acampadabcn    
    
    
    #acampadabcn Damn helicopter. No way to sleep. It is making loops over the Placa. Likely it is filming the operations. 20 mins now.    
    
    
    Stanno sgomberando, stando a Twitter. Totalmente realistico. Sono Mossos, polizia locale, nettezza. Hanno isolato la piazza.  #acampadabcn    
    
    
    #acampadabcn I am almost at P. Catalunya. City center empty as usual at this time in the morning.    
    
    
    #acampadabcn i am there. No violence here.    
    
    
    #acampadabcn please stop tweeting there is violence in pl. Cat.  If you are not here. There is no violence. They are cleaning    
    
    
    @puffosaltatore si sto camminando nella piazza. Tutto pacifico    
    
    
    #acampadabcn sit in a bordo piazza per bloccare veicoli nettezza. Tante telecamere. No violenza. Slogan e fischi    
    
    
    #acampadabcn resistenza pacifica dove passano veicoli nettezza.  Mossos spostano di peso per far passare veicoli metro a metro. No violence    
    
    
    #acampadabcn protesters sit silently in the center of the placa. I can see them from outside. Sitin outside slows trash vehicles    
    
    
    #acampadabcn 4 sitins. 1 inside and 3 outside. All peaceful. Police very professional compared to Italy    
    
    
    #acampadabcn clapping and communist chants. No one can enter the placa, but who is inside can leave. No one does though    
    
    
    #acampadabcn more than 10 trash vehicles in line waiting to leave. Mossos created a cordon around them    
    
    
    #acampadabcn lots of mossos moving. They are going to let the vehicles out?    
    
    
    #acampadabcn probably 1000 people inside the placa and 2500 outside. They clap to eachother inside-out    
    
    
    #acampadabcn manganelli e telecamere. Fischi    
    
    
    #acampadabcn mani alzate e resistenza passiva. Punto stretto con molta pressione    
    
    
    #acampadabcn ok the vehicles passed. Limited violence    
    
    
    #acampadabcn sono alle ambulanze. Ho visto 4-5 contusi, spaventati. Tensione cresce per stupidita    
    
    
    #acampadabcn tensione solo dove escono camion nettezza. Dentro continuano a raccogliere rifiuti. Altri sitin tranquilli    
    
    
    #acampadabcn resti di piccioni. Li hanno mangiati??!?? Dead pigeons remains. Eaten???!!??    
    
    
    Elicottero fisso su angolo dove escono camion, a filmare    
    
    
    #acampadabcn protesters' block grows on the carretera    
    
    
    #acampadabcn no violence in last 20 minutes. Everyone is here now. Maybe 20k people. I go to work.    
    
    
    #acampadabcn Helicopter still up there. Going back to have a look during lunch break...    
    
    
    #acampadabcn The helicopter was gone by 1.30pm
At 2.15pm I went back there and protesters where rebuilding their camp.    
    
    
    #acampadabcn helicopter again. Protesters marching on the ramblas towards the plaza    
    
    
    #acampadabcn march extends from boqueria to catalunya. Maybe 20k again? No mossos, only guardia urbana for the traffic.    
    
    
    #acampadabcn Plaza *packed* with people.    
    
    
    #acampadabcn loudspeakers. Female voice speaking. Even the carreteras are packed with people. All shops and hotels open including fnac & kfc
