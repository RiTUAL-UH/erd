    Listening about introducing Social Business Strategy to the C-suite! #smtlive    
    
    
    Companies saying Social Business Strategy is important, but are still challenged by making this an integrated program, with ROI. #smtlive    
    
    
    Being social for the sake of being social, is not a benefit at C-level. #smtlive    
    
    
    "Push vs. Pull" strategy. I'd like to hear more about that. #smtlive    
    
    
    Social Business Strategy, how does this affect staffing & headcount? Good question. #smtlive    
    
    
    Value in listening, as part of Social Business Strategy. I like that. #smtlive    
    
    
    Most CEOs are not on Social media... #smtlive

    Companies saying Social Business Strategy is important, but are still challenged by making this an integrated program, with ROI. #smtlive    
    
    
    Being social for the sake of being social, is not a benefit at C-level. #smtlive    
    
    
    "Push vs. Pull" strategy. I'd like to hear more about that. #smtlive    
    
    
    Social Business Strategy, how does this affect staffing & headcount? Good question. #smtlive    
    
    
    Value in listening, as part of Social Business Strategy. I like that. #smtlive    
    
    
    Most CEOs are not on Social media... #smtlive
