    11 already!!! Still loads to do before beer o'clock.    
    
    
    Windows XP this morning. I'd forgotten how much it makes me want to take a sledgehammer to a computer.    
    
    
    HP Photo & Imaging Director, like digital Hotel California - you can de-install any time you like, but it just won't leave.    
    
    
    OK. Simple Monday task: 1) Scan expenses receipts, 2) invoice customer. Now turning into an epic. I'm going to explode soon.    
    
    
    Finally, we have scanning capability again!  HP + Windows XP, productivity gains up there with the quill pen.    
    
    
    OK, I give up. It's costing more to claim than the actual worth. Time to negotiate a per diem.    
    
    
    BTW. Up yours, Microsoft. And up yours, HP.    
    
    
    Early lunch. Watching This Morning on ITV. Phil Schofield  & Holly Wotsit have just done a piece on how to improve your sex life.    
    
    
    With live actors demonstrating positions. Although they're not allowed to do 'the movements' according to daytime TV rules. Hilarious.    
    
    
    Now we've got a bloke dressed as Elvis cooking via webcam from Spain. Seriously, the things we miss when we go to the office.    
    
    
    Or perhaps I took the wrong cold remedy pill this morning?    
    
    
    Elvis is about to do duck in orange sauce instructed by Phil Vickery    
    
    
    Why don't they put this stuff on at night??? It's brilliant.    
    
    
    Elvis isn't wearing an apron. The rhinestone outfit is bound to show up the suace splashes. Uh-huh-huh.    
    
    
    Sadly I have to leave This Morning's Cook In with Elvis to go to the office and relative normality. My eyes have been opened.    
    
    
    @stuarthoward That looks fantastic

    Is against ageism in job advertisements. Particularly from public funded organisations.    
    
    
    One small change makes the point: "Looking for people to front a PR campaign:white's only, tyne&wear/northumberland". Pretty bad now, huh?

    @ajkavanagh Every little helps, I suppose.    
    
    
    Why am I ready to sleep now when I was wide a-bloody-wake at 4am this morning? No time for sleep, I've things to do!!!    
    
    
    @ajkavanagh 38974 is a lot of followers. But perhaps not enough to affirm deity. Are you saying the prayer came from 'down below'?    
    
    
    @ajkavanagh With a bit of social media coaching, he could make 50000 double quick... "I've just worked in a mysterious way , please RT" .    
    
    
    @justingsouter Of course, you could get @god up to 50000 followers no problem.

    Cooking risotto. And drinking beer. Who says men can't multi-task?    
    
    
    iPhone has just suggested 'Subaru' whilst I was trying to type 'signature'. I've never used the word 'Subaru' in my life (up to this point).

    @EmmyPips I always like it when people cut one leg shorter than the other - though I'm sure that won't happen to you.    
    
    
    It's clearly bed time. Confused between #NEFOLLOWERS and NEE FOLLOWERS!    
    
    
    @AlexJReid I was pleased to learn that, with iPhone 4, Apple had invented digital zoom.    
    
    
    @leeanne_b Really? Punch Ed Balls. Guess he's like Marmite. Diane Abbot - made a great speech on civil liberties during the 42 days thing.    
    
    
    @LeeABaker Happy Birthday, Matey. Forty again? I had a decent meal in the Silkroom the other week.    
    
    
    After 2000 years of stony silence will @HadriansWall reveal its secrets? Well no, but the lady takes a really nice photograph. #nefollowers    
    
    
    Just noticed John Prescott on here, spewing out his odd brand of class hate . Surely you'll be struggling with 140 caracters Mr P?    
    
    
    @docuguy Yeah, but do you really want to end up eating mutant produce from Monsanto et al? #organic    
    
    
    @PeteWatson_PB I predict drunkenness    
    
    
    Cat came in this morning COVERED in poo. Birds dive bombed him to protect a nest - top defensive move. I'm working on a way to adapt it.    
    
    
    @ajkavanagh It was pretty funny actually, especially as the wife got to clean him up. And he's quite the patient patient, which helps.    
    
    
    Off to Lui's in Tynemouth for gargantuan veggie breakfast.    
    
    
    @ajkavanagh Avoidance involved 'bootcamp' on the beach, which nearly killed me. Need to find better avoidance strategies.    
    
    
    Top breakfast btw    
    
    
    @AllotmentAli I use F-Prot from Frisk. Fast, cheap, unobtrusive, and works really well.    
    
    
    @PeteWatson_PB Well, ultimately the football will disappoint, the lasting memory will be of an arm round a stranger  - your new best mate.    
    
    
    Fabulous. RT @woodss: RT @ryandownie: Pizza Hut Ireland are giving out a free Pizza every time a goal is scored against France.

    So far I'm watching most of the world cup via terrestrial channels, on a retro Sony TV set, and really enjoying it. 100% reliable too.

    As I can't be arsed to blow a vuvuzela for 90 minutes, wondering whether I'll be allowed into St. James' with a hoover for next season.    
    
    
    @subtitling I was just disappointed that Lord Saville didn't say "UhUhUhUhUhUhUh.... 'ows about that then?"    
    
    
    This ambush marketing that Budweiser are getting huffy about looks like fun. Unless you're Robbie Earle .    
    
    
    Using @icomptroller to invoice a client in Finland requiring EU reverse charge mechanism for VAT - easy peasy
