    \ curious as to what y'all think about the concept of indentured servitude as\
    \ punishment for nonviolent crimes. to clarify i don't mean *slavery*, at least\

    \ property rights (fraud, theft etc) then they have to work without pay for a\
    \ period of time.\r\n\r\nthis could be done two ways\r\n\r\n1. the criminal could\

    \ sending them to a prison where they simply are turned into more violent criminals,\
    \ we send them to work without wages for a period of time relative to their crime.\r\

    \ town, there are *zero*. everywhere only has the typical adjunct \"party beers\"\
    . i usually just buy my beer to drink at home. but i'm going on a road trip soon,\
    \ and i'm looking to visit some good bars on the way. i want to know what qualities\
    \ i should look for to determine whether a bar is worthwhile before i spend too\
    \ much time/money without the best experience? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i've only\
    \ been to two. both weren't exceptional. the food was great, but the beers were\
    \ average (still better than adjunct lagers). the concept is interesting to me\
    \ though. reminds me of old medieval taverns where the local tavern keeper brewed\
    \ their own beer.\r\n\r\nanyways, what has your experience been? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
    \n\r\n \"let us therefore hold it for certain and firmly established that the\
    \ soul can do without everything except the word of god, without which none at\

    \ justification, of salvation, of joy, of liberty, of wisdom, of virtue, of grace,\
    \ of glory, and of every good thing. it is on this account that the prophet in\
    \ a whole psalm (psalm cxix.) and in many other places, sighs for and calls upon\
    \ the word of god with so many groanings and words.\r\n\r\nagain, there is no\
    \ more cruel stroke of the wrath of god than when he sends a famine of hearing\

    \ the sending forth of his word, as it is said, \"he sent his word and healed\
    \ them, and delivered them from their destructions\" (psalm cvii. 20). christ\
    \ was sent for no other office than that of the word; and the order of apostles,\

    \ accomplish before you die?\r\n\r\nmine follows:\r\n\r\n1. drink a pint of guinness\
    \ in a dublin pub. (which dublin pub is the best?)\r\n\r\n2. drink *calvinus*\
    \ which is brewed only in geneva.\r\n\r\n3. drink at the wittenberg brewpub in\
    \ wittenberg germany.\r\n\r\n4. visit all of the belgian trappist breweries. \r\
    \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i've heard guinness is better from the tap. i like their stout\
    \ (the import version). i was just curious is tap guinness kegged with nitrous?\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n me, i like traditional beer styles. stouts are my favorites,\
    \ and i also love the traditional ale styles. i rarely ever try cutting edge,\
    \ innovative, or nontraditional styles (odd combinations/ingredients, hard liquor\
    \ in beer etc) beers. they just don't interest me. plus, with all the stouts out\
    \ there to try, i have enough on my to-drink list! about as nontraditional as\
    \ i typically go is something like a peanut butter milk stout.\r\n\r\nwhat about\
    \ you? how often do you venture into the new styles of the beer world?\r\n\r\n\
    edit; sorry about the spelling mistake in the title. i cannot type well on a tablet.\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i love watching youtube beer reviews. i'm a big fan of\

    \ \r\n\r\nwho do y'all recommend? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i'm gonna be honest. i\
    \ do the unthinkable... sometimes, i drink budweiser. now i usually drink craft\
    \ beer. but sometimes, is there anything wrong with just drinking a cold one the\
    \ same way you'd drink a coke? \r\n\r\nsometimes my more snobby craft beer friends\
    \ hate on my for drinking bud or yuengling while watching the game or barbequing.\
    \ the fact is, when i'm doing those things i intend on drinking more than six\
    \ beers, and drinking them easily. i'm not drinking them for complexity etc.\r\
    \n\r\nanyways, how do you feel about the snobbier side of craft beer? do you avoid\
    \ macro's at all times?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i'm just curious\
    \ what the various approaches are. do you have a regular time for family worship\
    \ (devotions)? what do you do during that time?\r\n\r\nour family does every night.\
    \ we open with a psalm or hymn, then we will read either a question from the larger\
    \ catechism or the heidelberg. afterwards we will get into whatever we are studying.\
    \ sometimes we go through a book of the bible, sometimes we explore a particular\
    \ topic, sometimes we use a book or other material (notably paul miller's material).\
    \ we usually close with prayer time for various and sundry requests. though we\
    \ don't have kids yet, when we do we are considering using the new city catechism.\

    \ if i had to narrow it down it would be a toss up between thomas watson, thomas\
    \ brookes, and samuel rutherford.\r\n\r\n1.  watson's *art of divine contentment*\
    \ was phenomenal.\r\n2. brookes's *precious remedies against satan's devices*\
    \ has probably had more of an impact on my walk than any other book.\r\n3. rutherford's\
    \ *letters* taught me a lot about compassion, and still provide a continual source\
    \ of comfort and pastoral encouragement when i am away from home.\r\n\r\nwhat\
    \ about y'all? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n consuming alcoholic beverages,\

    \ reading chomsky for the first time. up to this point i've never paid much attention\

    \ seems...inconsistent. how can someone who supports liberty, anarchy even, support\
    \ the welfare state and the un? am i missing something? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n the only responses everyone is throwing out are;\r\n1. gun\
    \ control - obviously a bad idea. i shouldn't even have to expound on why.\r\n\
    2. lock away mentally unstable folks who \"seem\" violent. - another obviously\
    \ idiotic and oppressive idea.\r\n\r\nwhat are some common sense ways to approach\

    paying the consumers directly to watch an ad to convince them to buy the product\

    \ sum of money to reach the amount of people just one ad on a regular television\
    \ program reaches.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n some of it has to do with the fact that\

    \ wikipedia article](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/classical_conditioning) explains\
    \ it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n it is hard to explain. each department has a lot of\
    \ independence. they are not exactly in the same chain of command. more like several\
    \ cooperating entities with their own chains of command. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \ kind of. they have different roles. if a crime happens within the city, and\
    \ is confined to the city, it is usually the local pd who takes care of it. if\
    \ it is a county wide thing, a crime involving several cities, or outside of city\
    \ limits, the sheriff will usually handle it. if it js a statewide thing, or something\
    \ on state land, the troopers get it. \r\n\r\nthat being said, there is a ton\
    \ of cooperation between departments. there is also conflict. sometimes sheriff's\
    \ and deputies overstep their bounds in city limits, and vice versa. it is a more\
    \ organic relationship.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n sheriff's dept. is the *county*\
    \ police forcr, local pd's are the *city's* police force, and state troopers are\
    \ the *state's* police force.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n what if there were a travel\

    \ kapital* is on my reading list, i have been a little intimidated by it though,\
    \ it is quite the beast. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n well they would if they were communists.\
    \ but they are not. \r\n\r\n\r\nchina is communist in the same way the u.s. is\
    \ capitalist, i.e. not at all. do you believe the u.s. is an actual capitalist\
    \ country? no. we are a mixed economy. we are a hybrid of semi-free markets and\
    \ government intervention. china, n. korea etc are the same way. they started\
    \ out totally communist. now they are hybrid states, centralized totalitarian\
    \ authority states mixed with some form of limited market economy. \r\n\r\n\r\n\

    \ am aware. but obviously other nations have nuclear weapons. if we were a stateless\
    \ society, how could we protect ourselves from other nations with nuclear weapons.\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i am a pretty staunch libertarian, strong advocate for\
    \ decentralization, and near ancap. i have a few reservations though. perhaps\
    \ y'all could help me.\r\n\r\n1. what happens to nukes in ancapistan? obviously\
    \ worldwide anarchism is not going to happen overnight, so even if the u.s. becomes\
    \ a voluntary society, russia, china etc will still have powerful weapons, and\
    \ might seek to take advantage of what they see as a vulnerable situation. how\
    \ do we as a society of individuals protect ourselves against these weapons? also,\
    \ what happens to the nukes the u.s government owns once it disbands?\r\n\r\n\
    2. along those lines, how does a voluntary society protect itself from a sadistic\
    \ individual obtaining a wmd? say someone gets the money and ability to buy a\
    \ powerful weapon. how do we stop him from killing thousands?\r\n\r\n3. if the\
    \ u.s. government disbanded, do you not see it as likely that another nation would\
    \ try to use coercive force to take over? how could we possibly arm ourselves\
    \ well enough to prevent that without a professional military.\r\n\r\n\r\nthese\
    \ are just a few of my reservations. i definitely think liberty wins, and that\
    \ ancap ideals can be implemented over a small scale, but i have a really hard\
    \ time seeing it as a large scale option... \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n gerbils, hamsters,\
    \ ferrets, guinea pigs... all domesticated rodents. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i agree\
    \ with what you are saying. leftist descriptors are mostly slurs nowadays. some\
    \ libertarians do not understand the ideas behind leftist philosophy. this coming\
    \ from a diehard capitalist.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i obviously disagree with them\
    \ on fundamental issues, but the ignorance of many americans about socialism and\
    \ communism really bugs me. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\

    \ career. maybe y'all can help me with some questions.\r\n\r\n1. i am currently\
    \ a shop supply specialist. i oversee the order of parts for the motorpool, schedule\
    \ services, keep track of inventory etc. a lot of supply and maintenance management.\
    \ how do these skills translate into railroading?\r\n\r\n2. are the hours as bad\
    \ as i hear? being in the military has gotten me used to long hours, being away\
    \ from my family, but i have heard many horror stories about railroading. \r\n\
    \r\n3. how are the benefits? \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i know y'all probably get\
    \ a lot of these posts. i am sorry! \r\n\r\ni am interested in podcasts about\

    \r\n\r\n\r\n as the title says i am an avowed laissez faire capitalist libertarian\
    \ looking to engage some socialists respectfully. i have some honest questions,\
    \ i am not trying to argue or pick a fight, just looking for a civil conversation.\r\
    \n\r\n1. what do you think the biggest misconceptions are about socialism?\r\n\
    \r\n2. what is your opinion as a full socialist about mixed economies (like the\
    \ u.s) where the market is neither totally free or totally socialist?\r\n\r\n\
    3. do you see any difference between laissez faire capitalism and crony capitalism?\r\
    \n\r\n4. what books or media would you recommend to me so i can honestly understand\
    \ the socialist perspective?\r\n\r\n5. what would change in the u.s if it became\
    \ a fully socialist country?\r\n\r\n6. what things do people think would change\
    \ in the u.s. if it were a socialist country, but would actually remain the same.\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\nsorry to lump my questions all together, i did not know of a better\
    \ way. \r\n\r\nthanks! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 1. how long have you been a wobbly/how\
    \ did you become a wobbly?\r\n\r\n2. what has the iww done to improve your life?\r\
    \n\r\n3. how do iww members view other consolodated unions? it seems there are\
    \ many who want \"one big union\" but they are all fragmented.\r\n\r\n4. how has\
    \ the iww changed to fit modern workers needs in your opinion?\r\n\r\n5. do you\
    \ think the iww is on the decline? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n **my 5 questions:**\r\n\

    \n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i am super obsessed with wanting to try [this](http://buy.rogue.com/rogue-sriracha-hot-stout-beer/).\
    \ has anyone here tried it? what is it like? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i get the basic\
    \ idea, i know what socialism is about, and i know that \"libertarian\" originally\
    \ refered to socialists. i still don't get it.\r\n\r\n1. is libertarian socialism\
    \ any different than regular socialism? how?\r\n\r\n2. what the heck is anarcho-socialism\
    \ about? isn't the state a fundamental piece in the socialist theory?\r\n\r\n\r\
    \nany other info would be great. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n hey\

    \ i think it was style. it was too short, too quick.. i barely had interaction\
    \ with the setting, characters, or background. the \"hook\" was done poorly i\

    \ and leaves me without razor bumbs. creates a very good lather. i use a badger\
    \ hair shave brush and straight razor. \r\n\r\n* captain's choice bay rum aftershave.\r\
    \n\r\n**in the shower**\r\n\r\n* lava soap. it contains grit, so it cleans well.\
    \ my wife loves the smell, and it is easy to take on the go. i use it as body\
    \ soap and in my hair.\r\n\r\n**on the counter**\r\n\r\n* brylcreem. this stuff\
    \ holds my hair combed and parted without making it look gross. a real classic.\r\
    \n\r\n* old spice classic deodorant. i have tried the newfangled and fresh smells,\
    \ but nothing beats the classic. my wife loves the smell more than anything, which\
    \ is a great bonus.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n just curious, what is in your bathroom?\r\
    \n\r\nwhat hygiene products do you use and why? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n will give\
    \ sources when i get home\r\n\r\nthe worship of baal and moloch included child\
    \ sacrifices. many scholars believe the worship of ishtar included (forcible?)\
    \ temple prostution. herodotus includes accounts of temple prostitution in his\
    \ work. \r\n\r\nas a confessional presbyterian, i do not believe god has changed\
    \ his message. i do not see a break between the old and new testaments. i see\
    \ the scriptures as one covenant of redemption, with various stages of completion.\
    \ we are simply in a later stage of the plan. the law still stands but has different\
    \ implications for us after christ than before. it has not lost its validation\
    \ though.\r\n\r\n\r\ni can go into more detail in a while, once i have gotteb\
    \ home, and provide better sources if you would like. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n god\
    \ called for the death of these pagans as judgment upon them. he was establishing\
    \ a kingdom of righteousness amongst a people of violence and wickedness. he was\
    \ violently overthrowing their exploitative wicked religions, in order to plant\
    \ his people in the land. \r\n\r\nthe application to today is that god takes idolatry\
    \ seriously. although the actions might not carry the same physical ramifications\
    \ today, god's atttitude about those actions have not changed. \r\n\r\n\r\nwe\
    \ are no longer in a time where our world is run by overtly bloodthirsty pagan\
    \ taskmasters who offer human sacrifices and sexual slavery to their gods. imagine\
    \ living under barbarism like that, would you not support the violent overthrow\
    \ of such a system? \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i agree. there are true libertarians\
    \ on both sides.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n they were created by god. i believe in\
    \ microevolution, that society and civilization has evolved over the years.\r\n\
    \r\ni believe the poor sexual morals of humanity throughout history are a testament\
    \ to man's fallen nature and mutiny against god's law. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n what\
    \ makes you appreciate the perspective? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n actually, i hold\
    \ to an old earth creationist view. i believe the world is millions of years old.\r\
    \n\r\ndon't make assumptions about my belief system. christianity is a broad and\
    \ diverse religion with a ton of nuance. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i am totally serious.\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i believe humans were committed for committed relationships.\r\
    \n\r\ni am a christian, and so obviosuly my worldview is rooted in the christian\
    \ narrative. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n god has given us stewardship of the earth. we\
    \ are responsible for its welbeing. \r\n \r\nultimately i do believe he is in\
    \ control, and will not let his creation be utterly destroyed. this does not negste\
    \ human responsibility though.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n hey y'all. i am about a year\
    \ out from ets, and i am trying to prepare myself for the transition. i am curious\
    \ to know how it went for y'all?\r\n\r\n1. did you have a hard time transitioning\
    \ into a good career?\r\n\r\n2. do you enjoy your career?\r\n\r\n3. what things\
    \ might i struggle with after transition?\r\n\r\n4. in what ways has your military\
    \ experience stuck with you?\r\n\r\ni gotta be honest, i am pretty scared of the\
    \ unknown. scared about finding a good job, and dealing with it all \r\n\r\n\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n i am sorry, images are covered in the westminster larger catechism.\
    \ i accidently directed you to the wrong part of our church standards.\r\n\r\n\
    it is covered in [questions 109 and 110 of the westminster larger catechism](http://opc.org/lc.html)\r\
    \n\r\n\r\nwe do not ban all images, only images of any person of the godhead.\
    \ we ban the use of any images in worship, but as far as art goes we are permitted\
    \ to make images of animals, nature, humans, etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i believe\
    \ the proper and moral place of sex is within a committed relationship.\r\n\r\n\
    so yes, i do think visiting prostitutes is shameful. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n [the\
    \ westminster confession of faith](http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/)\r\
    \n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i believe the second commandment is clear. \r\n\r\nmy\
    \ confession condemns any representation of any member of the godhead. \r\n\r\n\
    \r\n\r\n\r\n each a violation of the second commandment. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \ no.\r\n\r\ni am married. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n it is heresy. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \r\n i agree with you \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n have you ever considered selling them\
    \ as mail order brides for isis? they look just their type. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
    \n sure, \r\n\r\ni grew up in the church, my parents raised me in the faith. i\
    \ never had a \"see jesus moment\", it was a progressive and gradual thing. i\
    \ began to understand my sin-debt, and at some point it all clicked. christ arrested\
    \ my heart, and drew me to himself. it was gradual, over many months, my understanding\
    \ of salvation. i cannot point you to a definite conversion experience, but rather\
    \ a gradual understanding of the implications of his sacrifice as my substitute.\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n historically, i believe constantine was the beginning of\
    \ the church losing its way. for a long time i believe the true church existed\
    \ within the catholic church, until barely a remnant remained. there were many\
    \ quasi-reformers before the reformers. there was much ebb and flow, but the remnant\
    \ of orthodoxy was nearly snuffed out leading up to the reformation.\r\n\r\ni\
    \ believe the reformation was the great recovery of the true church, and the exodus\
    \ of the true church from a corrupt institution. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n first, i\
    \ would kill a human if put in the right scenario. in fact, i have been put in\
    \ that scenario on more than one occasion. i am totally comfortable with violence.\r\
    \n\r\nsecond, no, i do not believe a fetus is committing an act of aggression\
    \ against the mother. *the fetus is not the initiate*, the act of sex was the\
    \ initiate. if you want to use your homeless man scenario, pregnancy/abortion\
    \ would be like me going out and finding a homeless man, bringing him into my\
    \ home (initiating the act) and then murdering him because he is in my home...\
    \ the fetus does not choose or initiate the act of pregnancy. therefore, the fetus\
    \ could never be the aggresor. if violence is taken against the fetus, the mother\
    \ is the aggressor because she initiated the entrance of the fetus into her womb,\
    \ and then killed the fetus for being there.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n by all means,\
    \ ask away.\r\n\r\nno, neither. i believe the trinity is a fundamental doctrine\
    \ of the faith. by the same token i do not believe modalist thought is orthodox\
    \ either. these are all heresies condemned explicitly by the ancient church councils.\r\
    \n\r\ni (and my denomination) would place unitarians and mormons even farther\
    \ in the unorthodox spectrum than rc's. we believe they are heretics outright.\
    \ (i am not using that as a slanderous term, just a descriptor to explain that\
    \ we do not believe these groups to be christian at all). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \ the key word here is *aggression*. are you familiar with the non-aggression\
    \ principle?\r\n\r\n\r\nif someone is trying to kill me, then any violence on\
    \ my part is not *aggression*, but *self-defense*. \r\n\r\nif someone breaks into\
    \ my home, they have commited the act of aggression, both by aggressing against\
    \ my private property, and presenting reasonable threat to my family's wellbeing.\r\
    \n\r\ni am not a pacifist by any means. i am a non-aggressionist. there is a colossal\
    \ difference between the two.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n most of protestantism. obviously\
    \ there is a spectrum of orthodoxy. i will not be exhaustive here, but painting\
    \ with a broad brush, the core issues of orthodoxy in my opinion are the five\
    \ solas. they must be held to for a church to be considered remotely orthodox\
    \ in my realm of thought.\r\n\r\nas a reformed presbyterian i obviously share\
    \ little common ground with rc's theologically.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i believe\
    \ there are christians in the catholic church.\r\n\r\ni do not accept the catholic\
    \ church as a valid representation of orthodox christian thought though. \r\n\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n\r\n not inconsistent with the christian faith in the sense that believing\
    \ it makes you a nonchristian. you can, of course believe mary was a perpetual\
    \ virgin and still be saved.\r\n\r\n\r\nit is totally inconsistent with reformed\
    \ christianity though. luther and zwingli believed a lot of things that fall outside\
    \ the boundaries of reformed thought. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i believe if you create\
    \ life, you are responsible for that life. no matter the circumstances, once life\
    \ has been created it should *never* be taken in aggression.\r\n\r\nthat is the\
    \ fundamental principle. aggression. if a fetus is a human, then abortion is aggression.\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\nif there were, somehow, another way to create human life (cloning\
    \ for example) i would just as adamantly oppose aggression against that created\
    \ life.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n just because something is poor taste does\
    \ not mean it should be illegal.\r\n\r\n\r\nmost of us who support free speech\
    \ also think discriminatory jokes are tasteless. i for one do not support magazines\
    \ or organizations that do such things. \r\n\r\nthat does not mean they should\
    \ not be allowed to do them. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n most profitable blue collar\
    \ trades require some skill traini g first. do not think you are just going to\
    \ transition from an office job with no trade skills into a profitable and fullfilling\
    \ blue collar job easily.\r\n\r\nthat being said, there are a ton of great opportunities\
    \ out there for guys willing to learn. welding, pipefitting, electrical work,\
    \ plumbing.. all of these jobs can be very profitable. \r\n\r\nmy suggestion would\
    \ be as follows\r\n\r\n1. do not quit your job until you are ready to transition\
    \ into your new career.\r\n\r\n2. look up labor statistics for your area. get\
    \ in contact with local labor unions. figure out what blue collar jobs are in\
    \ demand in your area. sometimes the profitability of a blue collar career can\
    \ change dramatically from city to city.\r\n\r\n3. once you figure out some options,\
    \ figure out how to get certified in that trade. most trade unions have trade\
    \ school type programs. votech schools also are a viable option. these things\
    \ are not always very expensive.\r\n\r\nthere is a huge market for skilled blue\
    \ collar labor out there, but do not let your desire for another kind of career\
    \ drive you to jump ahead of yourself. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n if the mother does\
    \ not want a baby, she should not have unprotected sex.\r\n\r\nwe all know that\
    \ pregnancy is the natural consequence of unprotected sex. nobody is confused\
    \ about what happens. once you participate in unprotected sex, and a child is\
    \ concieved, you cannot blaim the child for natural consequence. \r\n\r\nsex is\
    \ an act that is by definition, the creation of life. once you create an individual,\
    \ you do not have the right tk aggress against that individual.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
    \n\r\n thank you! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n yes, if you are a pregnant woman you own\
    \ your body. but you do not own the fetus's body. the fetus has every amount of\
    \ self ownership you do. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n last week. i eat bologna on wonder\
    \ bread often. i take them to work, alternating between bologna on white bread\
    \ and salami on rye. i am a simple man. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n not quite that cut\
    \ and dry. he introduced the sanctity of life act 2005, 2007, 2009, and 2011which\
    \ would have defined a fetus as a human being with full rights at the federal\
    \ level.\r\n\r\nhe has commented that he believes such matters are best handled\
    \ at a statr level, but he is adamantly pro-life, supporting pro-life legislation.\
    \ in 2000 and 2003 he supported a federal ban on partial birth abortions. \r\n\
    \r\nhe is a huge voice against abortion, showing no support for an individual's\
    \ \"right\" to abortion. he just thinks the matter should be handled on the state\
    \ level \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i would say i dress in a way that works for me.\r\
    \n\r\ni keep my hair short, and combed. i wear mostly button up shirts and pearl\
    \ snaps. i always tuck my shirts in. i make sure everything is well ironed. i\
    \ never wear tennis shoes, typically i wear either my cowboy boots or brown leather\
    \ wingtips.. i wear a lot of seersucker, cardigans, and bow ties.\r\n\r\nmy style\
    \ is mostly affected by the culture i grew up in (deep south) and the military\
    \ culture i spent most of my young man days in (well ironed, tucked in shirts,\
    \ combed short hair, etc) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n no. because i own my body. that\
    \ is the fundamental premise of libertarianism. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n how do you\
    \ deal with feeling burnt out?.. i am getting real jaded about being in, i am\
    \ tired of the bullshit, and honestly just do not wanna do it anymore..\r\n\r\n\
    \r\ni am about 12 months out from ets, and i do not think i am gonna do it again.\
    \ how do i adjust my attitude in the meantime? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n because those\
    \ of us who are pro-life libertarians believe a fetus is a human, and therefore\
    \ abortion violates the non-aggression principle. the moment a fetus is concieved,\
    \ we believe he has the right to life, like any other human. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
    \n i am looking for anyone who is or has been involved with prison librarianship.\
    \  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n **my 5 questions:**\r\n\r\n1. in what ways have you seen\
    \ the library program improve prison conditions?\r\n\r\n2.  what made you want\
    \ to work in your prison's library? tell your story.\r\n\r\n3.  how big of a percentage\
    \ of your prison reads regularly?\r\n\r\n4.  what are some things you wish outsiders\
    \ knew about prison libraries?\r\n\r\n5. tell me any stories/experiences of your\
    \ prison library enriching or bettering someone's life? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n granted,\
    \ it is not high on my list of important government reform. it would be a future\
    \ goal, to keep the state totally out of speech laws. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n first,\
    \ i am not naive enough to assume that a world of total liberty will be perfect.\
    \ there will be injustice. but there is injustice now! i believe there would be\
    \ less injustice if people were more free. \r\n\r\n\r\nlibertarianism is not a\
    \ solution, it is an alternative. an alternative which i believe to be the best\
    \ alternative with the least amount of oppression. there is no possible way to\
    \ eliminate all badness in the world. \r\n\r\ni think people have generally done\
    \ a good job in the past looking to outside sources to make informed consumer\
    \ decisions. sure, there are dumb consumers who just buy things for their logo,\
    \ but there are a lot more people to use information to become a knowledgeable\
    \ consumer. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n fight terrorist morons. \r\n\r\n\r\ni also volunteer\
    \ at my local library.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i think in the absence\
    \ of such laws, we would see consumer watchdog agencies spring up which can effectually\
    \ combat such a thing. the business owner who felt slandered could ask the watchdog\
    \ group look into the matter, the watchdogs would then release info stating that\
    \ the product was actually quite legal and the owner of the other business was\
    \ lying. at which point the other business would lose profit because of their\
    \ dishonesty and dirty marketing. and the slandered business would likeley gain\
    \ more business.\r\n\r\n\r\ni still do not see such a scenario as terribly realistic.\
    \ businesses are not able to steal tons of business from competitors by spewing\
    \ ungrounded claims. such claims are easily researched, and tend to be horrible\
    \ for business once the truth comes out.\r\n\r\nit is not as if we do not have\
    \ businesses lying about other businesses today. and watchdog groups generally\
    \ do a pretty good job exposing slanderous claims.\r\n\r\n\r\nthe reason i am\
    \ against slander/libel laws is because speech is terribly subjective. there is\
    \ not an objective standard. you could claim any number of things were scandalous.\
    \ i could be telling the truth about your product, and you cover it up so well\
    \ that i end up getting sued and lose all credibility while you continue with\
    \ your harmful product. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n if i am not on your property, you\
    \ have no say on my actions. ideally there would be no public roads, they would\
    \ be privatozed, and such matters could be settled through the market. you could\
    \ buy shares in the road you live on, and establish conditions for the use of\
    \ that road. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n if i am on your property, you can decide what\
    \ i say.\r\n\r\nif i am on my property, i can say what i want when i want. \r\n\
    \r\nin a truly ancap society, there would be no public property. in our current\
    \ society, i would advocate for zero regulation of speech on public property.\
    \ if you do not want me speaking on your private property, ban me from your property\
    \  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n my answer would be that it is not the state's responsibility\
    \ to regulate these things. so no.\r\n\r\nif you slander or commit libel, there\
    \ will arise a counterbalance to your speech. an example of this is the internet.\
    \ the internet is unregulated generally, and there are many false internet myths,\
    \ and slanderous statements about people. organizations like snopes have arisen\
    \ to prove these myths false. that is how libertarians would like to see society\
    \ function.\r\n\r\njust because speech is free from government intervention, does\
    \ not mean it is free from blowback. for examlle, if i owned a theatre, i would\
    \ likely make it a rule that false claims  of fire or disaster are punishable\
    \ by a permanent ban from the premises. i do not think the \"crying fire in a\
    \ theatre\" example is really valid, because it is so unlikely. such a thing would\
    \ never happen. and of someone did yell fire, i do not believe people would go\
    \ screaming for the door with no proof. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntl;dr;  we want no regulation\
    \ of speech at all. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n as a libertarian, i disagree. i do not\
    \ believe in any regulation of speech. \r\n\r\n\r\nlibertarianism is radical like\
    \ that. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n what is not true? i explained ot depends on whose\
    \ perspective the answer is coming from.\r\n\r\nas a libertarian, my answer is\
    \ totally correct. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n it refers to being able to say, write,\
    \ or communicate anything you want without censorship or blowback from the government.\
    \ it does not mean people have to listen to you, or accept your ideas. ultimately\
    \ it depends on whose perspective you are coming from.\r\n\r\nas a libertarian\
    \ i believe all speech should be totay free from government regulation. you should\
    \ be able to say anything and everything you want, whenever you want, without\
    \ the government stopping you.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 1. this american life -an\

    obviously we cannot discuss this further, because i believe all of scripture is\
    \ inspired and the absolute word of god.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i believe the words\
    \ of paul in scripture are the word of god (the orthodox explanation of inspiration).\
    \ i place equal weight behind the words of paul in scripture and the words of\
    \ christ.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i almost missed it. it is reay vague \r\n\r\n\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n and paul explained quite clearly that all israel is not israel. that\
    \ circumcision is of no avail in christ. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n yeah, she says it\
    \ near the end. she does not explain it well. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i think you\

    \ the chuch, spanning many denominations.\r\n\r\n\r\nthey have no presbyterian\
    \ flair, or i would choose it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n because little one, if i explained\
    \ every answer like you were actually five, it would be condescending (which means\
    \ answering you like i am much more important than you). you would probably feel\
    \ a little looked down upon.\r\n\r\nsometimes people use figures of speech to\
    \ get their point across better. in this subreddit, when someone asks us to explain\
    \ like they are five, we take it to mean explain in a very simple and easy to\
    \ understand way.\r\n\r\ndoes that explain it little one, or do i need to explain\
    \ it better? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n a girl coming of age in the 80's. her uncle\
    \ (who she has a childish crush on) is gay, and has aids, and she struggles to\

    \n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n what did you think? \r\n\r\ni absolutely loved finn.\
    \ i loved every second of it! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n it is possible, but not likely\

    \ his actions were indicative of regret, but not necessarily repentance. anything\
    \ is possible though. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n again, modern judaism and ot judaism\
    \ are radically different. \r\n\r\nby rejecting the messiah, jews are equally\
    \ as lost as muslims.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n yes, but we *are* israel. i (along\
    \ with historic christianity) believe all of the promises to israel were for the\
    \ church, not ethnic israel. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n this.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \ this is true. this was pretty shocking to me when i heard about it. \r\n\r\n\
    as a confessional presbyterian, we are pretty adament about believing the covenant\
    \ promises belong to the church. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n no. everyone has their thing.\
    \ as long as i was comfortable with her, committed, and had already created a\
    \ safe environment between us, i would be ok. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n several. my\
    \ two most notable are;\r\n\r\n1. my grandfather- a welder at a shipyard. hard\
    \ working, never complains, gentle and quiet.\r\n\r\n2. my old english professor\
    \ - now semiretired on his sheep ranch. allowed me to work on his ranch while\
    \ i was in college and payed me 9 dollars an hour. taught me hard work, gentleness,\
    \ patience, and gave me an example to emulate.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n have\
    \ you seen any wars?\r\n\r\ni have. and i would dispute this. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \r\n just op trying to take a political cheap shot through an unrelated sub. \r\
    \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i already said we should stick up for all humans in my op.\
    \ we should defend and support all himans whether they are buddist, jewish, muslims\
    \ or anything else.\r\n\r\n\r\nmy point was that it seem some christians (especially\
    \ in america) have an elevated regard for judaism, and a disrespectful attitude\
    \ towards muslims. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n christianity depends on ot judaism for\
    \ its legitimacy, not modern judaism. there is no theological kinship between\
    \ modern judaism and christianity imho. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n perhaps.. i have\
    \ noticed it tends to be the american right wing evangelicals who fit into the\
    \ mold i described. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n so war against palestine (resulting in\
    \ the deaths of many civilians) is somehow different? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n keep\
    \ your head down. do not stand out. do not be an individual.\r\n\r\nyou will be\
    \ fine.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n especially in light of the charlie hebdo tragedy,\
    \ a ton of christians i know are showing solidarity with the jews of france, while\
    \ saying nothing (or saying derogatory things) about the muslims of france...\
    \ \r\n\r\nin my opinion, both religions are equally false. **but from a human\
    \ standpoint, we should stand against all injustice and demographically oriented\
    \ oppression.** i agree with neither muslims or jews on theological points. neither\
    \ religion carries more weight in my book...but many christians seem to blindly\
    \ accept all jews as brothers, and label all muslims as bloodthirsty heretics..\r\
    \n\r\nanyone else wanna weigh in on this?\r\n\r\n(edit; emphasis added, because\
    \ apparantly my point was not clear.) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n they were saying if\
    \ ralph nader had been elected 9/11 never would have happened. \r\n\r\nthe joke\
    \ was that the terrorists would have been too busy watching pigs fly to attack\
    \ on 9/11. (joke about the improbability of nader's election).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
    \n\r\n this. if you have a good tobacconist in your area, they would be more than\
    \ happy to introduce you to the world of tobacco. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n my favorite\
    \ artist is jamey johnson. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n his word has resonated in my soul\
    \ as truth, for one. nature also declares his glory. i believe faith is a gift\
    \ from god, therefore i would ultimately answer your question by saying i believe\
    \ in him because he has enabled me to. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n because i believe\
    \ i deserve the death penalty for my sin, but christ died as a substitute in my\
    \ place, and has allowed me to claim his righteousness while claiming my sinfulness.\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n just tell them thanks for their support. no need to be\
    \ an asshat about it, let them feel like they are doing something.\r\n\r\ni go\

    \ while simultaneously putting speech in shackles.\r\n\r\nah the parodoxy of statism.\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n as a christian i will explain the orthodox christian response.\r\
    \n\r\nno one made god. he has always been. he exists outside our concepts of beginning\
    \ and end. he is seperate from our world and how our world operates. he is without\
    \ beginning or end. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n they are not always.\r\n\r\nfor example,\
    \ many haitian-americans are adamantly opposed to being called african-americans\
    \ because doing so trivializes the distinction of their culture. they are not\
    \ african. \r\n\r\nbasically it comes down to ignorance. we do not put enough\
    \ thought into the titlea we use for other people, forgetting that titles carry\
    \ meaning.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n for one, paris is a developed peaceful society.\
    \ pakistan is by no means a peaceful society. pakistan is a haven for radicals,\
    \ so it really is not that surprising when those radicals act like radicals. mix\
    \ a whole bunch of corrupt and bloodthirsty extremists into a society, and you\
    \ are bound to have massacre. paris is not a haven for radicals. it is surprising\
    \ when attacks fall on free soil. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i really want to join a\
    \ local bookclub. i do not really have any real life bookish friends. that being\
    \ said, i have only found one in my area. i had some questions about book club.\r\
    \n\r\n1. the book club, as far as i know, is 100 percent female. that is not a\
    \ problem. i am just curious, would it be kind of awkward for one married man\
    \ to join a book club full of married ladies?\r\n\r\n2. for those of you in book\
    \ clubs; how has actively participating in the book club enhanced your reading\
    \ experience?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ah, i was just curious \r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \r\n\r\n ntc is no big deal. not really a factor in whether i would stay in or\
    \ not. it's not like it's a deployment...\r\n\r\ni have gone to either jrtc or\
    \ ntc every year i have been in.\r\n\r\nalso, if you are a 15e why do you have\
    \ lt flair? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n always a bad idea. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i think\
    \ this question is best answered by question one of the westminster larger catechism;\r\
    \n\r\n**q. what is the chief and highest end of man?**\r\n   *a. man's chief and\
    \ highest end is to glorify god, and fully to enjoy him forever.*\r\n\r\nour purpose\
    \ now after sin, is the same as adam's was before sin. to glorify our creator\
    \ and king. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i use a poncho. i like the minimalist thing.\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i do not believe that a noncelibate homosexual lifestyle\
    \ is ok. no member of my denomination would perform a same sex union.\r\n\r\n\
    that being said, i think the state should stay out of it, so i am all for legalizing\
    \ it. just because it violates my moral code does not mean others cannot live\
    \ it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n well, i am a libertarian. i am all for libraries, but\
    \ do not think they should be funded by the state. they can (and have) been effectively\
    \ funded privately. \r\n\r\nbut i agree about your assessment of our education\
    \ system. i was unschooled as a kid, kind of a montessori homeschool, and it worked\
    \ very well for me. i do not think one size fits all education helpa anyone. \r\
    \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n yeah, i have a hard time wrestling with a bit of jadedness\
    \ about the war. i am sure any vet has experienced that stuff. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \r\n right now snapchat had been building it's user base. they are about to expand,\
    \ something called \"snapchat discovery\", which will feature videos, articles,\
    \ etc in the same format as the current peer to peer sharing is.\r\n\r\nbasically,\
    \ up to this point they have just been investing to get snapchat big enough and\
    \ popular enough, that when they do start using it to make money, the user base\
    \ is big enough. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n no i have not.\r\n\r\nif i did, i am quite\
    \ sure i would regret it.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n duly noted and revised. \r\n\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n\r\n exactly. i know a lot of folks who are so conflicted because they\
    \ haven't \"seen\" god, or had some kind of experience.\r\n\r\ni am just here\
    \ to say, i have never had an experience. i just believe. just like i believe\
    \ mars exists because of the photographs i have seen. i have never been on mars.\
    \ i do not know anyone who has been on mars, but i believe it to be just as the\
    \ photographs depict it. i believe god to be true because his word has resonated\
    \ in my heart as truth (his word is after all a photograph of himself). it does\
    \ not make sense, it just is. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\
    \n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n through the scriptures. they resonated with me\
    \ in a way that was only explainable as divine. their truth grappled with my heart\
    \ and left my walls of excuse broken. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n because he has enabled\
    \ me to. salvation was all his work, i had no part in it. he awakened my heart\
    \ and drew me to himself. i could never have been \"convinced\", it was all his\
    \ doing.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n yes, absolutely brilliant.\r\n\r\nblood\

    \n\r\n\r\n\r\n 1. more time with my family. i am ready to plant roots in the north\

    \ by sondre lerche. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n obviously this is a subjective question.\r\
    \n\r\ni don't believe the point of religion is \"getting back to god\" or \"helping\
    \ your fellow man\", though those are two admirable things.\r\n\r\ni believe the\
    \ point of religion is to properly serve our creator according to his holy law.\
    \ it is not about a unification of consciousness or altruism, it is about complete\
    \ obedience to our sovereign king. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i meant to say\
    \ state action in the marketplace. my mistake.\r\n\r\nbecause i believe i should\
    \ be allowed to work for however much or little i want. if i choose to accept\
    \ conditions below minimum wage, that is my business. i have in the past worked\
    \ for low wages, and would again. i don't like the state telling me what i must\
    \ work for. i also don't like the state pretending to be my nanny. i believe as\
    \ an individual i have the right to agree to any contract i want. it is not the\
    \ state's business what i choose to work for. \r\n\r\nif a union wants to argue\
    \ with an employer about wages, that is their business. i don't care what they\
    \ do. everyone in that union has the right to free association, and if they can\
    \ strike or whatever to get the employer to agfee to their contract that is all\
    \ fine. i don't believe it is ever the state's job to intervene though. the state\
    \ should enforce contracts, not make contract demands. it is the individual's\
    \ (or group of individuals') responsibility and right to make any contract they\
    \ are willing to agree to.\r\n\r\nsince i believe life begins af conception, i\
    \ believe abortion is an act of aggression against a human life, which i would\
    \ never support under any circumstance. violence should only be used in defense\
    \ and never aggression.\r\n\r\ni am a libertarian laissez faire capitalist. i\
    \ believe the markets should be free from state control. i did not come here to\
    \ egg on a political discussion though, that was not the intent of my op. \r\n\
    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n well i am not a union member, and won't ever be.\r\n\r\nmy question\
    \ was not about a personal curcumstance though.\r\n\r\nin some states it is nearly\
    \ impossible to work in the blue-collar career you are skilled in without joining\
    \ a union.\r\n\r\ni have nothing against the idea of unions, i think everyone\
    \ should be allowed to associate with whomever he or she chooses. i just do not\
    \ know of any unions that operate from my perspective, and i would not want to\
    \ join an organization that runs counter to my ethos. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n well\
    \ thanks for your explanation, i appreciate your perspective. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \r\n for example, if a union decided to strike for employers to provide birth\
    \ control coverage to employees, including abortion, i would be against the morality\
    \ of those benefits.\r\n\r\nsince i am also against minimum wage laws, i would\
    \ not strike to raise minimum wage. \r\n\r\nsince i believe state action is immoral,\
    \ i would not strike to enact state change. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n hmmm, we didn't.\

    \ your reasoning. i am not in a union job, but i am in a job that requires me\
    \ to be in an organization where we actively lay our lives down for the guy to\
    \ our left and right. i understand being a part of an organization that is equatable\
    \ to family, the reason for the op is just me trying to get my head around one\
    \ thing ( i am honestly not trying to say this like a jerk)\r\n\r\nmy brothers\
    \ woukd never ask me to stop working under threat of eviction from the organization,\
    \ even though our benefits and workplace can be crappy as well. i just cannot\
    \ understand being forced to participate in that because an organization has a\
    \ monopoly on that trade. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i agree with what you are saying.\
    \ unions are important, and i am all for people joining unions. the area about\
    \ this issue i am curious about is what does one do if they are in a state where\
    \ they have to join a union to work a specific job? they cannot leave the union\
    \ unless they want to lose their job, move, or face legal action, yet they disagree\
    \ with the strike issues?\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *lone survivor* and\
    \ *american sniper* are the only two i have read. they were ok. i have been to\
    \ afghanistan, and approaching them with firsthand experience gave me a bit more\
    \ appreciation than i might have before.\r\n\r\ni would not place it on a top\
    \ ten military books list.\r\n\r\n\r\nmy personal favorite is *we were soldiers\
    \ once, and young* by hal moore. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n what if i disagree with\
    \ the union about the morality of the benefits rhey represent? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \r\n but in a non-right to work state, would i have to quit my job? \r\n\r\n\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n what happens if my union is on strike, and i disagree and refuse to\
    \ strike, and instead go to work? i am especially curious how this works in a\
    \ job where union membership is mandatory? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n what happens if\

    2. because it is impossible for finite men to draw one person with two natures\
    \ ... the picture will be heretical.\r\n\r\n3. because jesus christ has ascended\
    \ with a glorified body. we have no way of picturing the risen christ.\r\n\r\n\
    4. any picture of jesus we make will be a fashioning of his appearance by us,\
    \ not as god revealed, for we don't know what jesus looked like.\r\n\r\n5. you\
    \ need to contemplate god to draw him, and we can't contemplate without owing\
    \ worship. so, we either fail to revere god or we worship him by image.\r\n\r\n\
    6. because god is spirit, and this cannot be captured by a picture. \r\n\r\n\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n there is no wiggle room. in relation to your first quote, we consider\
    \ the standards *goodband necessarily deduced from scripture.*.\r\n\r\nyour second\
    \ quote proves my point. it says that the circumstances regarding the worship\
    \ and order of god's church *according to the general rules of the word, which\
    \ are always to be observed*\r\n\r\nread section xxi. that is where the rpw is\
    \ explicitly stated thusly\r\n\r\nt*he acceptable way of worshipping the true\
    \ god is instituted by himself, and so limited by his own revealed will, that\
    \ he may not be worshipped according to the imaginations and devices of men, or\
    \ the suggestions of satan, under any visible representation, or any other way\
    \ not prescribed in the holy scripture.*\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i did not mean\
    \ we don't need any recruits. \r\n\r\ni meant it in the sense thst we are not\
    \ lacking in possible recruits. there are a thousand others who will join anyways,\
    \ without tattoos, and the army is still cutting.\r\n\r\nmy point; this is a garrison\
    \ army. we aren't fighting oef and oif anymore. they have no interest in loosening\
    \ up the rules. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i would not say more... or less.. i like\
    \ spending time with people based on many attributes, whether they are gay or\
    \ straight has no relevence on how relaxed i would be.\r\n\r\ni know gay people\
    \ who are obnoxious as hell.\r\n\r\ni know straight people who are obnoxious as\
    \ hell.\r\n\r\ni know gay people who are mature andi enjoy being around.\r\n\r\
    \ni know straight people who are mature and i enjoy being around. \r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \r\n\r\n it doesn't matter if it is religious patriotic etc. if your tattoo below\
    \ your elbow is larger than your hand, you are out.\r\n\r\ndo you think the military\
    \ really needa recruits? they are cutting our numbers all the time. we don't need\
    \ recruits badly. so no, they are not going to be lax on tattoos. if anything,\
    \ they are only going to get stricter. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n sometimes we have\
    \ stained glass as an aesthetic thing, but they never have images of christ. usually\
    \ they are landscapes or some other artistic design. \r\n\r\nwe sing only psalms\
    \ in worship, our ministers usually wear black geneva gowns \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
    \n because i believe there is no biblical precedent for seeking god through images.\
    \ also i believe the law still demands us to refrain from any images in our worship.\r\
    \n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n morality is determined by obedience to god. my fsith\
    \ defines morality by god's law.\r\n\r\nit is very human to define morality by\
    \ how we relate to other humans. god demands us to judge our morality by our relationship\
    \ with him. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n both.\r\n\r\ni believe it is a mockery and is\
    \ disrespectful to christ. the example of portraying christ as a white man is\
    \ one example. it is also blatant disrespect to assume that sinful man can even\
    \ come close to depicting a perfect god.\r\n\r\nit is also morally wrong in the\
    \ sense that god, in holy scripture, directly forbids it. therefore it is a direct\
    \ act of mutiny against his holy law.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n both. it saddens me\
    \ to see him disrespected in a way that he specifically forbid us to do. it also\
    \ saddens me to see folks overlook the seriousness of this action, and saddens\
    \ me for their wellbeing.\r\n\r\ni don't think this is a \"heaven or hell\" issue.\
    \ one can be a christian and still break the second commandment, but that does\
    \ not mean it carries no rebuke. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n yes, we do take a sola scriptura\
    \ view of scripture. \r\n\r\ni understand the theological justification behind\
    \ iconography, but we reject it.\r\n\r\nno, i do not think you are going to hell.\
    \ i imagine we disagree on a good many things though. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n it\
    \ upsets me at all times, i believe it to be very wrong.\r\n\r\nif you are asking\
    \ if it angers me in a way similar to the charlie hebdo incident angered some\
    \ extremists... absolutely not. i would never take aggresive violent action because\
    \ of such a thing.\r\n\r\ni do believe it is morally wrong, and folks who participate\
    \ in it will have to answer to god for it. if it happened within my denomination\
    \ i would bring the issue before our leadership and expect disciplinary action.\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n some of us do.\r\n\r\ni am a reformed presbyterian. it\
    \ is **strictly** forbidden in our denomination. we do not allow images of any\
    \ person of the godhead in any scenario, ever. \r\n\r\nnot in our homes, not in\
    \ our church, not on our facebook page, never  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n exactly.\r\
    \n\r\nhaving a contract forced upon you without the option to determine your own\
    \ contract rules is slavery. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n it also violates the concept\
    \ of free association.\r\n\r\nfree individuals choose their contracts, servants\
    \ have their contracts forced upon them \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n our church name is\
    \ a decriptor that refers to our form of government.\r\n\r\nwe do not believe\
    \ the westminster standards are extrabiblical. they introduce no new doctrine.\
    \ every point of the standards is from scripture. they are simply a concise and\
    \ homogenous guide to explain scripture.\r\n\r\nwe are so strict on them to prevent\
    \ division. if you want to have your own varied views on scripturex go ahead,\
    \ but to be a presbyterian you have to agree with our standards totally. if a\
    \ church or elder in our presbytery wants to stop being calvinists, or refute\
    \ paedobaptism, or teach something different than the standards, we have grounds\
    \ for discipline. it is easy and simple.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n yes. we are strictly\
    \ bound by the book of church order with regards to those things. the bco operates\
    \ with the regulative principle as it's foundation. we do not operate congregationally,\
    \ we have a plurality of elders because we believe that is the example of scripture,\
    \ there is no other option. there is only one way we do things. we have a presbytery\
    \ with authority to exercise oversight over local churches because we see that\
    \ in scripture.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n it is a revolving line of funding\
    \ from congress given to veterans as repayment for their service. i am not getting\
    \ benefits just because i am a human and \"deserve\" it. i am getting those benefits\
    \ because i am contractually entitled to those benefits.\r\n\r\nif i agree to\
    \ exchange my service for \"x\" product, and itbis included in a contract, after\
    \ my service is completed i am entitled to that product. that is the premises\
    \ of free trade. \r\n\r\ni defend freedom. i do not defend anyone being \"owed\"\
    \ anything just because they are human.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n that applies specifically\
    \ to worship. the sabbath is the lord's day and we believe in only worshipping\
    \ him his way on the lord's day.\r\n\r\nwe do believe there are many areas left\
    \ to christian liberty in private life (alcohol, smoking, etc) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \r\n by we, i mean all ep reformed presbyterians. i can speak for all exlusive\
    \ psalmody presbyterians because we have very strict confessions which we subscribe\
    \ to. we do not allow deviation from the westminster standards. \r\n\r\nall of\
    \ us believe exactly the same on everything in the confession. we do not believe\
    \ in individual interpretation. \r\n\r\nsome confessional presbyterians deviate\
    \ very slightly from exclusive psalmody and allow hymns as well. nonetheless,\
    \ even they would be *very* strict about what is allowed in worship.\r\n\r\nwe\
    \ do not use instruments in worship. there is some debate about the use of instruments\
    \ within the rp camp, but my particular group does not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n\r\n yes.\r\n\r\nwe believe the state has no say in marriage.\r\n\r\n\
    your religion is free to define marriage however they like, but they cannot force\
    \ those beliefs on others.\r\n\r\nso we believe the catholic church has the right\
    \ to not define same sex marriages as valid in their religion, but they cannot\
    \ stop unitarians from marrying the same sex. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n we\
    \ believe that verse us referring to various *kinds* of psalms (i.e. psalms, psalms\
    \ of adoration, and spiritual psalms.)\r\n\r\nthe fundamental issue that guides\
    \ our view of worship is the regulative principle of worship. we believe if scripture\
    \ does not command something in worship, it is forbidden. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \ libertaran here.\r\n\r\ni would not say pres. obama is a socialist, he is a\
    \ progressive democrat. \r\n\r\nwe disagree on the role of the state. we believe\
    \ the markets should be free, and nobody should be forced to pay for other's welfare.\
    \ we believe welfare should be accomplished through voluntary association (i.e.\
    \ charity, relgious organizations, and non-profits.) we believe the state should\
    \ not force contracts on people. it is up to each individual to negotiate and\
    \ decide what contract he is willing to work for (or join a union voluntarily\
    \ to band together to bargain collectively). \r\n\r\nthere are some things i do\
    \ agree with progressives on. for example, open borders, drug legalization, marriage\
    \ equality etc.\r\n\r\nlibertarians and republicans are *nowhere* near alike.\
    \  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i never once said homosexuality was worse than other sins.\r\
    \n\r\ni did say that living in blatant sin (in any area) is not a mark of a true\
    \ christian. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i earned my college and my paycheck because\
    \ they were both part of the wages in the contract i agreed to. it was not given\
    \ to me. i gave services in exchange for thst g.i. bill, as it was stated in my\
    \ contract. in my contract it specifically said i would give my services in exchange\
    \ for both a monetary wage and other benefits, including a g.i. bill, \r\n\r\n\
    it was not a gift, it was income for my services.\r\n\r\nyou paid for my college\
    \ because i worked a job to defend you. your tax money did not give me anything\
    \ that i did not earn. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n there is no such thing as a free lunch.\
    \ the money will come from taxpayer pockets. \r\n\r\nas a veteran, i worked hard\
    \ to *earn* my college benefits. i put blood, sweat, and tears into my job so\
    \ that i could go to college on the government's dime. now we just wanna give\
    \ that to every kid on the street... it devalues what i worked so hard for. \r\
    \n\r\nif you want to go to college, you have to earn it. through the military,\
    \ through academic application, through employment programs, through any way you\
    \ can. i am not of the breed of folks who believes you deserve free college just\
    \ because you can eat, sleep, and piss. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i am not a republican\
    \ so i can not attest to every motive of theirs.\r\n\r\ni disagree with them on\
    \ a good many things, including immigration, drugs, gay marriage, etc. \r\n\r\n\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n that has nothing to do with it. \r\n\r\nthe point is that\
    \ i, and many others like me, just want to be left alone. we do not want anyone\
    \ making our decisions for us (good or bad). i own myself. i work for what i choose.\r\
    \n\r\ni would argue that viewing the government as a benevolent organization that\
    \ only wishes you good is a very uninformed and foolish way to view the world.\
    \ \r\n\r\nit has nothing to do with the government being out to get me. it is\
    \ the fact that they will not allow me to make my own decisions. they won't let\
    \ me decide what is best for me. the state is not my mommy. i can choose for myself.\
    \  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i believe in bettering the world we live in through voluntary\
    \ action and free choice, not through the government trying to do it through force.\r\
    \n\r\nwhat kind of world would it be if the government told me what i was allowed\
    \ to work for? am i not an individual? why should they force me to accept their\
    \ conditions? i want nothing to do with them, yet they are going to force me to\
    \ work for 7 paid sick days, thus removing yet one more thing that might distiguish\
    \ me from other job applicants.\r\n\r\ni say leave me the hell alone. what benefits\
    \ i choose to work for is none of their damn business. if someone else wants 7\
    \ paid sick days, 15 dollars an hour, etc, they can go find that job. if i am\
    \ willing to work for less, with no sick days, why shouldn't i be allowed to?\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n the point is we do not believe it is the state's job to\
    \ demand what an employer and employee agree to in a contract. \r\n\r\nwe like\
    \ the government out of our business. i don't want them making my employer give\
    \ me days ofd, i don't want them telling me what benefits i have to work for.\
    \ it is my business and my business alone what contract i choose to accept.\r\n\
    \r\nperhaps agreeing to work for less sick days makes me more marketable to employers?\
    \ i am willing to work for zero paid sick days if it makes me more competetive\
    \ in the job market. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n they are against the government forcing\
    \ businesses to give folks sick 7 days of leave.\r\n\r\nas a libertarian, i am\
    \ against this too.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n he is speaking to the combined\
    \ houses of senate and congress.\r\n\r\nhe is basically giving them an assessment\
    \ of the current \"state\" of the \"union\" (united states).\r\n\r\ntraditionally\
    \ it was a way for the president to report to the legislative branch ow the nation\
    \ was doing.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n more psalms.\r\n\r\nwe only use psalms in corporate\
    \ worship. so in a corporate worship context, all other types of music are irrelevent\
    \ to me.\r\n\r\nother types of christian music are nice for the car though.  take\
    \ notes from red mountain music and the gatsbys. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n neither.\r\
    \n\r\nit leans communistic still, but the markets are not totslly stste controlled.\
    \ there is some competition and freedom allowed.\r\n\r\nthey are a mixed system,\
    \ just like pretty much every other nation's economic system in one way or another.\

    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n if you are celibate, then yes.\r\n\r\nif you are engaging\
    \ in sexual relations with the same sex... maybe. let me explain. \r\n\r\nchristians\
    \ can sin. if you are a christian, and are attracted to the same sex, and slip\
    \ and have sexual relations, you do not lose your salvaion or anything. \r\n\r\
    \nif you are living a life of outright noncelibate same sex relations, that is\
    \ not an indicator of discipleship. true disciples do not live in blatant sin\
    \ for extended periods of time.\r\n\r\ni take the traditional and orthodox stance\
    \ that same sex relations are a sexual sin, just like adultery, lust, sex outside\
    \ of marriage etc. a christian can slip and be involved in any of those sins.\
    \ a christian cannot live a life of blatant disobedience in any of those areas\
    \ for an extended period of time. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i have seen the term thrown\
    \ around a bit, but i have no clue what it means. can someone break it down for\
    \ me? also, is there any divide between traditional libertarian thought and paleolibertarian\
    \ thought? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ah. i would venture to say they fit into the latter\
    \ category. \r\n\r\nprobably not, as long as you don't challege their prosperity\
    \ gospel. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i would like to see myself owning several acres\
    \ of property, operating a little farm. i would love to be surrounded by children\
    \ and grandchildren. i cannot wait to see how much more i love my wife the older\
    \ i get. i am gonna be a cardigan wearing, pipe-smoking, scotch drinking old veteran.\
    \ (i know this because i am a cardigan wearing, pipe-smoking, scotch drinking\

    \ yourself as an old man? just curious if any of y'all ever think about this?\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n depends. \r\n\r\nin a few pentecostal type churches they\
    \ have bishops in the traditional diocesian sense.\r\n\r\noftentimes they see\
    \ the word bishop as interchangable with elder or pastor. many times they are\
    \ ordained by their denomination.\r\n\r\nothers are ordained by no one. oftentimes\
    \ these are the ones who open up their own \"worldwide ministries\" operating\
    \ as entrepreneurs peddling christendom to whoever they can. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
    \n neither, i am a libertarian. \r\n\r\nbecause i believe in social *and* economic\
    \ liberty. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n you are right about that! those days are over\
    \ too. i just picked up my 5. now i am the private of thr nco corps. \r\n\r\n\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n absolutely. i took full advantage of my private status. \r\n\r\nnow\
    \ those days are gone and when i get in trouble, i can no longer say \"i'm a private\"\
    \ as an explanation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n in 1 cor. 7 verse 12 and on paul says\
    \ that a husband/wife who is married to a non-believer should not seperate from\
    \ them. \r\n\r\nthe fundamental principle would apply in your scenario as well.\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n for example russian orthodox, antiochian orthodox, oriental\
    \ orthodox, greek orthdox etc. from what i understand they are merely cultural\

    \ i believe in a literal six day creation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n good. not lhbc\

    \ the same view calvin adhered to about sola scriptura. it has historical precedent.\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n again, we are not participating in any worship. we are\
    \ enjoying a cultural holiday with neutered cultural symbols. culture determines\
    \ what symbols relate to false gods. nobody in our culture associates anything\
    \ on these holidays with pagan gods (except fringe groups)\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \r\n reformed presbyterian here.\r\n\r\nwe don't believe you can come to god any\
    \ way exceot through the word revealed in scriptures. the scriptures are the only\
    \ revealed word of god. the scriptures are the complete word of god. there is\
    \ no other revelation at all. since we are staunch adherents to the rpw, we allow\
    \ nothing j  worship that is not commanded in scripture. no outside traditions.\
    \ no images, no human written songs (i am exclusive psalmody), no church calender\
    \ etc. \r\n\r\nthat is what we mean by sola scriptura. it is not that the scruptures\
    \ are the highest revelation of god among many, we beleieve the scriptures are\
    \ the **only** revelation of god at all. (in an immanent sense). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\

    \n\r\npaul was very schooled in the pagan greek poets, and greek philosophy and\
    \ rhetoric. he was familiar with the olympic sports (hardly a christian institution).\
    \ there is value to culture and cultural identity. we do not allow that cultural\
    \ heritage to influence our worship. \r\n\r\nsee paul's argument for food offered\
    \ to idols in 1 cor 8. i would place cultural celebrations in this category. \
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n reformed presbyterian here.\r\n\r\nwe acknowledge the paganistic\
    \ core of these holidays, and therefore do not acknowledge them as christian.\
    \ if you go to our churches on easter sunday or the sunday after christmas, it\
    \ will be no different than any other sunday.\r\n\r\nusually we celebrate them\
    \ as fun cultural holidays, but we place *zero* religious significance in them.\r\
    \n\r\ni cannot speak for the rest of christendom.\r\n\r\n\r\n**edit;** also, we\

    \ good introductory (but not dumbed down) books to the eo world? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
    \n\r\n i listened to that article on npr, and i think it is one of the best standalone\
    \ stories supporting prison libraries. that is actually wht got me searching for\
    \ information on prison libraries (which led me to the nyt article). \r\n\r\n\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n i am sorry, it was my misunderstanding. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n my wife\
    \ and i are set on homeschooling our children. can y'all recommend some books\
    \ about homeschooling? i am looking for anything about why you should homeschool,\
    \ how to start homeschooling, any of your favorite books dealing with the subject.\r\
    \n\r\ni would also appreciate some memoirs of folks who did homeschooling/were\
    \ homeschooled. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n yes, the pca holds to the canons of dordt.\
    \ (tulip).\r\n\r\nthey are staunchly calvinists. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n depends\
    \ on which presbyterian church. \r\n\r\nthe pcusa is pretty liberal. there are\
    \ a few conservatives left. \r\n\r\nthe pca and opc are the largest confessional\
    \ denominations. they are strict calvinists. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n cool, i was\
    \ there too\r\n\r\nmarch 2011- march 2012\r\n\r\nnovember 2013- july 2014 \r\n\
    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n yeah, not a sports guy either. i have better things to do with\
    \ my time. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n which conflict? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i am gonna\
    \ have a glass after dinner. it was recommended by my (very knowledgable) local\
    \ beer guy. i am a *huge* fan of stouts. so far left-handed milk stout nitro is\
    \ my very favorite beer. \r\n\r\nwhat do y'all think of bell's? where does it\
    \ fit on the stout spectrum? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n yup. i think there is a big\
    \ difference between healthy assertiveness/confidence and alpha-male overcompensation.\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n for myself, i would say yes. \r\n\r\ni work a manual job\
    \ (the military), keep my hair short, dress very old school, enjoy mostly masculine\
    \ type hobbies (wood working, hunting, fishing etc). i tend to be *very* conservative\
    \ in my behavior (not exactly in my politics though).\r\n\r\ni also like cooking,\
    \ and do my share of the cleaning, but i don't see those as feminine exlusive\
    \ activities. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n basically, would you say your definition of\
    \ masculinity/male roles is traditional or not? do you fit into the traditional\
    \ parameters of masculinity or not?\r\n\r\ni am *not* asking whether you think\
    \ all men should be restricted to traditional gender roles, i am just curious\
    \ in what ways you personally fit into traditional masculinity, and what ways\
    \ you do not. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i dunno. i have never been that kind of guy.\
    \ i don't put my hands on other dudes, don't hug other dudes, and don't pretend\
    \ flirt with other dudes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n they tear you down as a human being.\
    \ the point is to root out all individuality. you no longer own yourself. you\
    \ are not unique. you do not do what you want. your life belongs to your brothers.\
    \ \r\n\r\nthen they build you back up. they give you a new identity as a team\
    \ member, a uniformed person who has voluntarily surrendered all selfexpression\
    \ in order to live a lifestyle of absolute conformity. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i\
    \ am definitely not opposed to reading it. i enjoy reading many things outside\
    \ my perspective. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n so you support the release of the guantanamo\
    \ bay inmates but oppose free exchange of ideas for them? interesting. how do\
    \ you reconcile those two things?\r\n\r\n\r\ni also support the closing of gitmo,\
    \ but i was just curious if in the meantime, y'all found the library important?\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n not just my congregation. this issue is fundamental to\
    \ reformes presbyterians throughout history. calvin, knox, the westminster divines,\
    \ the covenanters, all saw this as a first tier issue. \r\n\r\nmy entire historical\
    \ line is one if penal substitutionary atonement advocates.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
    \n\r\n mead is closer to wine than beer. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n my church would\
    \ disagree. this is an issue we see as fundamental to christian fellowship. a\
    \ first tier issue. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n yes, it is changing. i was just explaining\
    \ why such a divide has existed in the past. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n a lot of it\
    \ is culture. in american culture, beer has been associated with masculinity,\
    \ especially blue collar masculinity. in the past it was frowned upon for women\
    \ to drink beer. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i don't think they are heretics.\
    \ that is a strong word. it refers to the denial of some fundamental doctrine\
    \ of the christian faith (i.e. the trinity, divinity of christ, substitutionary\
    \ atonement etc)\r\n\r\ni don't approve of many of their songs being used in worship,\
    \ since i am a staunch advocate of the rpw. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n for example,\
    \ why is pluto a typical dog, while goofy is an anthropomorphic dog? \r\n\r\n\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n the war is no longer active, for one. it is officially\
    \ over. oef is over.\r\n\r\nof course you might have to do hard things. that's\
    \ life. there is no free lunch. vets sometimes understand that better.\r\n\r\n\
    the payoff is better than any other option though. no debt, a good resume, attractive\
    \ employment qualities..  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n not to mention you will actually\
    \ be headed to college with an extensive resume and real world skills. your chances\
    \ of employment after college will be way above your peers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
    \n join the army. that is what i did. post 9/11 gi bill benefits are phenomenal.\
    \ they will literally pay for all your college.\r\n\r\nor you could get an rotc\
    \ scholarship, and they will pay for all of your college and you will join as\
    \ an officer. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n get another cut. i cut my high and tight every\
    \ two weeks to keep it looking fresh  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n mostly they just do\
    \ paperwork. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 92y, unit supply specialist.\r\n\r\nyou spend\
    \ most of your time outdoors. oftentimes they get called away on special missions\
    \ to help others. sometimes they have to prepare short speeches to give in the\
    \ local \"soldiers only\" forums, and they win special medals for properly explaining\
    \ themselves.  they are always on the front lines, truly the tip of the spear.\
    \ everyone in the military calls them \"the seals of the army\". not everyone\
    \ can make it, but if you think you are up for it, go for it! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n in the denominatin i grew up in, ss was always the packaged\
    \ lifeway spiel. i got nothing out of it. i was always way more advanced, and\
    \ comparing biblical principles to pop culture always annoyed the crap out of\
    \ me.\r\n\r\nsince i have made my journey to reformed presbyterianism i have loved\
    \ ss. we always have very beneficial discussions at my church, our teachers write\
    \ their own material, i love it. now i teach our young adult ss class, and it\
    \ has been wonderful.\r\n\r\ni think it depends what circles you run in. super\
    \ grounded/confessional churches tend to take their theology way serious, this\
    \ carries over into small group. this is what i look for in ss.. my experience\
    \ with more broad evangelical circles has been very different. i am not a fan\
    \ of the super chill social club ss ideal. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i recently read\
    \ [this article in the times](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/books/review/prison-library-at-guantanamo.html?_r=0)\
    \ (which i know is a little old) and i was struck by a few thoughts, that i thought\
    \ i would extend to y'all.\r\n\r\n1. what do you think about the censorship going\
    \ on at the gitmo library? librarians and library supporters tend to be very anti-censorship,\
    \ but i am curious if circumstances determine our vehemence? should we strictly\
    \ regulate what a society of extremist affiliates are allowed to read?\r\n\r\n\
    2. how important is it to have a library in a place like gitmo?\r\n\r\ni would\
    \ love to hear any other thought's y'all have \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i would go\
    \ for old rasputin. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n first, i would make a distinction between\
    \ \"will\" and \"pleasure\". i believe it is the will of god to ordain all things\
    \ (including the judgement of the wicked) for his glory. this does not mean he\
    \ takes pleasure in their demise.\r\n\r\nin regards to ezekiel 33:11, i believe\
    \ this is god using human language to describe divine thought. the point ot this\
    \ text is the individual responsibility of every man for his sin. the point of\
    \ this text is not an explanation of the redemptive plan of god, but rather a\
    \ plea for repentance aimed at an ungodly nation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \ i am too, but it is pretty much the default explanation from every pc advocate\
    \ i have ever spoken to. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n your disconnect is that you see\
    \ baptism explicitly tied to profession of faith, and we do not. i do not believe\
    \ any of those references explicitly refer to baptism being predicated by belief.\
    \ baptism is tied to the death, burial, and ressurection of christ in the sense\
    \ that it identifies the baptized one as a member of the covenant which christ's\
    \ sacrifice paid for.\r\n\r\nthe issue is, fundamentally, we do not interpret\
    \ a single scirpture about baptism as referring to it being predicated by faith.\
    \ 1 cor 11:28-29 are quite obviously referring to believers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
    \n i love stouts. they are truly the beer-lover's beer. i love oatmeal stouts,\
    \ imperial stouts, pretty much anythubg but guinness \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n [ideomotor\
    \ effect](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ideomotor_effect) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \ left handing brewing' milk stout nitro.\r\n\r\nstout's are my favorite styles\
    \ of beer. the nitrogen bottling makes the beer smooth and velvety. it is full\
    \ bodied ans bitter in the best possible way.\r\n\r\nalso, i am a man. and stouts\
    \ are manly.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i was just using the example of the passover\
    \ in passing.\r\n\r\nthe main reason is the aforementioned, 1 cor. 11:28-29 make\
    \ it clear that the recipient of the supper must be able to **examine themselves**\
    \ and **discern the broken body of the lord**. \r\n\r\nthose who support pc often\
    \ claim this verse is referring to being able to discern the supper belonging\
    \ to the body (i.e. the church) as opposed to being able to discern/understand\
    \ that the supper *is* the body of christ. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n first, it\
    \ was not his time. he had a plan, and it was one of gradual revelation.\r\n\r\
    \nsecond, christ often veils his words in the gospels. he reveals himself to those\
    \ he chooses, but veils himself to others. he fully intends for the pharisees\
    \ and jewish leaders to think he is lying, so he can be crucified. he *wants*\
    \ to be convicted and sent to die. \r\n\r\ni believe it works the same way today.\
    \ god reveals his gospel to those he chooses, and hardens the reprobate's heart.\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n because infants are not capable of examining themselves\
    \ so as not to partake of the lord's supper in an unworthy manner (1 cor. 11).\
    \ that is the simple answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nbaptism is a continuation of circumcision.\
    \ obviously infants in the ot were circumcised. \r\n\r\nthe eucharist is a continuation\
    \ of the passover supper. do you think infants partook of the paschal lamb? they\
    \ were present, of course, just as our infant children are present at the eucharist,\
    \ but i doubt they partook.\r\n\r\nwe believe baptism is a sacrament which does\
    \ not require anything of the recipient. the eucharist requires the ability to\
    \ cognitively examine oneself, as per 1 cor 11. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n in regards\
    \ to my comment about the regenerate man having free will, i agree with your assessment.\
    \ i was using \"free will\" in the same way the op likely meant (i.e. freedom\
    \ to choose right from wrong) not in the sense that our will is totally free.\
    \ the idea of free will is so subjective that it is hard to get across the point.\
    \  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n you don't choose god.\r\n\r\nas a calvinist i affirm the\
    \ doctrine of predestination. gid chose his elect before the beginning of the\
    \ world, died specifically for his elect, and he regenerates his elect. once a\
    \ man is regenerate, his will becomes unbound, but unregenerate man has a will\
    \ that only acts according to his nature.\r\n\r\nas a monergist i do not believe\
    \ man has any part in salvation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n we don't have free will.\
    \ our wills are utterly bound and distorted by sin. we are totally corrupted from\
    \ birth.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\

    \ summarized briefly in [the nicene creed](http://www.reformed.org/documents/index.html)\
    \ and more in depth in [the westminster confession of faith](http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/)\r\
    \n\r\nthe differences between denominations are very nuanced and hard to explain\
    \ in summary. it really depends on which denominations you are asking about. basically\
    \ there are three broad divisions\r\n\r\n1. roman catholic - believe in the authority\
    \ of the pope, and the various vatican counsels as authoritative.\r\n\r\n2. orthodox\
    \ christian - recognizes a different patriarch than the pope. they have their\
    \ own cultural heritage and body of teaching seperate from the rc church.\r\n\r\
    \n3. protestant - products of the protestant reformation. there is extreme diversity\
    \ within this broad heading. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n my wife and i went into our\
    \ relationship agreeing that she would be a housewife and i would be the breadwinner.\
    \ we established the boundaries of our roles early on, so it has never been a\
    \ problem. she works a littlw business on the side, and volunteers at the uso\
    \ as a shift manager. \r\n\r\n\r\ni think the important thing is to establish\
    \ your opinions on what role you each will take before your relationship gets\
    \ serious and there will be no problem. i don't expect every couple to have the\
    \ same dynamic my wife and i do, but if you are the kind of guy who cannot marry\
    \ a career woman, don't. if you are the kind of guy who believes your wife needs\
    \ to have a career, then don't marry someone who does not. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \ i keep a high and tight. (i am in the army, and old habits die hard. it will\
    \ probably be the only hairstyle i have for the rest of my life).\r\n\r\ni get\
    \ my hair cut every weekend. i think every man should have a great barber. i love\
    \ my barber shop, its a man's retreat. i actually look forward to my weekly cut.\
    \ my barber gives my high and tight, shaves the sides of my head with a straight\
    \ razor, and gives me a hot towel massage. all for 11 bucks.\r\n\r\nday to day\
    \ i use brylcreem to keep my hair parted and combed.\r\n\r\nwith regards to the\
    \ ladies, i am married so i don't gove a second thought to what the ladies think.\
    \ my wife loves my hair. she loves right after i get a cut and the sides of my\
    \ head are smooth. she also digs the smell of brylcreem.\r\n\r\n[i will throw\
    \ in a photo.](http://imgur.com/0aaorqi) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n nah, i am like that.\
    \ i don't  get crazy when i drink a lot, just chill out. i do get more social\
    \ confidence, but that is about all. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n nothing but circlejerks.\
    \ bush this, hillary that.. oh my gosh did you hear about romney??? \r\n\r\n\r\
    \nand lil' old me just waiting for someone to say something about ron paul. \r\
    \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i call my wife \"bookend\". she likes it.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \r\n \"objective\" means impartial, unbiased, not dependent upon the mind for\
    \ existence, factual, etc according to the oed. \r\n\r\nso actually that is what\
    \ \"objective\" means. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n because i belive morality\
    \ is clear cut black and white. objective. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n sometimes\
    \ what is pleasurable is not what is moral. there can be conflict.\r\n\r\ni believe\
    \ our desires are not to be trusted. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n because i believe adamantly\
    \ in objective morality, i would prefer if more folks pursued moral excellence.\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i keep three; a book journal (green rite in the rain notebook),\
    \ a personal journal (a nice piccadilly), and a pocket notebook which is an integral\
    \ part of my edc (an army memorandum book).\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat about y'all? \r\n\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n\r\n no. books are about content not aesthetic. \r\n\r\ni mark my books\
    \ up, they get battered from traveling around with me around the world (literally).\
    \ i think worn books are well loved books. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n what general info?\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n not full seriousness.\r\n\r\nit is a word i made up because\
    \ i am a man. its definition should be clear, and my genius irrefutable. \r\n\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n\r\n ron? is that you??\r\n\r\n\r\ncan you believe some people don't\
    \ like breakfast food? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n hell yeah. i love sushi. that shit\
    \ is addictive, and it will fill you up faster than you think! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \r\n it was asked in half-seriousness. chill out. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i love\
    \ steak and eggs. it is my annual birthday breakfast. one seasoned t-bone medium\
    \ rare, three hard fried eggs, potatoes o'brien, and strong black coffee. \r\n\
    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n what hearty meal is your go-to for celebration or merriment of\
    \ the soul? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n nope. just a sheepdog. \r\n\r\nwhen you spend\
    \ as much time as i have in violent situations, you just get wired different.\r\
    \n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n some points to relay\r\n\r\n\r\n1. i disagree with thomas\
    \ paine on a good many things, he was not a classical liberal but way more progressive\
    \ with his statist ideas.\r\n\r\n2. my issue with food stamps was not how they\
    \ were carried out, it lies with the fact that i find them fundamentally immoral.\r\
    \n\r\n3. i despise the idea of a fiat currency. i am not a keynsian. i suppory\
    \ austrian economics. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n its not that i am not for unions. i\
    \ fully support the right of voluntary association.\r\n\r\ni just don't know of\
    \ a single union i could support, because they support things i disagree with.\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n no. because i would not ha e sex with a girl i am not already\
    \ in a monogomous relationship with. \r\n\r\ni would never seriously date a girl\
    \ i am not attracted to. i would never have sex with a girl i am not seriously\
    \ dating. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n depends on the scenario. \r\n\r\nif there was a\
    \ reasonable threat i would step in physically. i am fully able to handle any\
    \ physical situation that presents itself.\r\n\r\nif she was just uncomfortable,\
    \ i would ask her if she wanted help. i would not want to make her more uncomfortable\
    \ though. \r\n\r\nbasically, if she was getting verbally harassed it would bleep\
    \ my radar to keep an eye on her (i have a wife and sisters after all). if things\
    \ escalated i would physically step in, take charge, and diffuse the scenario\
    \ with whatever force was needed. \r\n\r\nif she is drunk, she cannot consent.\
    \ women are equal in value, but usually not in physical strength, build, and demeanor\
    \ as men. as a soldier, and a southerner i would feel obligated by my code of\
    \ honor to watch out for any female (or male) in a possibly dangerous situation.\
    \ this is the life of a sheepdog. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n my family recieved food\
    \ stamps and is still on them.\r\n\r\ni rejected any government assistance on\
    \ moral grounds. i will not take government assistance, because i believe using\
    \ the coercion of the state to take one person's money and give it to the needy\
    \ is not compassion but robbery. \r\n\r\ni am all for charity. i have in the past\
    \ accepted charity from my church, and would have no moral issue. that money was\
    \ given to the church freely. i would *never* accept govt. assistance though.\r\
    \n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n this is exactly the problem. \r\n\r\nif an uber driver\
    \ rapes a customer, the company should not be responsible. the company did not\
    \ rape the customer, the individual driver did. the state should punish him for\
    \ his act of aggression, and hin alone.\r\n\r\n\r\ni believe in individual, not\
    \ collective responsibility. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i have skipped way more than\
    \ seven meals before. that is why i am a capitalist. growing up in extreme poverty,\
    \ in a state that had huge subsidies, and government intervention, i oppose that\
    \ philosophy with every ounce of my belief.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n mt. doom. \r\
    \n\r\n\r\nmy nemesis would be frodo baggins. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n he is establishment\
    \ in the sense that he has no original ideas. i believe both parties are equally\
    \ big government, equally militaristic, and equally power hungry. anyone who supports\
    \ those ideals is establishment. folks who actually want a smaller government\
    \ (like ron paul was) are antiestablishment. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n it is the biggest\
    \ thrill of my life for sure. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i remember our ds riding with\
    \ us.. quiet, not smiling. when we pulled in, the kraken was released.  \r\n\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n\r\n nope. \r\n\r\nhere is a [link](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/laissez-faire)\
    \ that explains laissez faire capitalism.\r\n\r\nwe believe there are free market\
    \ solutions to your problems. monopolies are nearly impossible to achieve without\
    \ government help. many monopolies pop up because the state excessively regulates\
    \ the industry so that new guys can't get in (think about the uber controversy).\
    \  labor and consumer protections would come from the private sector. you would\
    \ have consumer watchdog organizations offering analysis of products. you will\
    \ also have stupid consumers who buy without doibg theor research, and they woukd\
    \ have to live with the consequences of buying without research. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
    \n\r\n when bombs started hitting around me and i was responsible for the lives\
    \ of two other soldiers besides myself. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n yes, i understand\
    \ that is how it works now.\r\n\r\nthat is not how laissez faire capitalists believe\
    \ it should work. \r\n\r\nthat is why romney is not a capitalist. he is a mixed\
    \ market corporatist. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n a market with no government intervention.\
    \ no federal reserve, no minimum wage, no government regulation of the market.\r\
    \n\r\n\r\nwe believe the government should only punish and prevent acts of aggression.\
    \ nothing else. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n thank you for your wonderful answer.\r\n\r\
    \nhow exactly do you see your stream of libertarianism as different from ancaps?\
    \ i think i can agree with everything you said. i believe workers should be allowed\
    \ (not forced) to unionize, i don't see much difference between coop's selling\
    \ products in a free market and individuals selling products in a free market.\r\
    \nunder your system, would individuals not be allowed to own business unless they\
    \ were cooperative? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n no, the individuala in that corporation\
    \ have those rights and liabilities. \r\n\r\ncorporations would not exist as they\
    \ currently do in a free market system. they get their power from tax breaks and\
    \ preferential legislation. \r\n\r\ni am not against shareholder protection. i\
    \ am against **all** government involvement in the free market. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
    \n\r\n no i wouldn't. i did not vote for romney, or mccain. i voted for ron paul\
    \ in both of those elections.\r\n\r\ni will repeat myself. fuck voting along party\
    \ lines, i vote for individuals. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n corporations are groups\
    \ of people.\r\n\r\nthe point is that corporations don't have rights. individuals\
    \ have rights. as capitalists, we do not view the world collectively, but individually.\
    \  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n thank you! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n capitalists\
    \ would totally oppose the idea that \"corporations are people\". in a free market,\
    \ corporations get no government treatment. we embrace the concepts of individualism.\r\
    \n\r\nwe (capitalists) would never support bailouts, or any other state intervention.\
    \ romney does not think like this. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n because state run healthcare\
    \ is capitalism?\r\n\r\nromney is as far away from capitalism as fdr or mr. obama.\
    \ romney supports corporatism.\r\n\r\nin a true free market, without legislation\
    \ benifiting corporations, i doubt romney would have the status and wealth he\
    \ does. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i think romney had a real chance of winning.\
    \ the reason i am happy to have him out, is because i think he was the biggest\
    \ threat.\r\n\r\ni don't think bush or christie has anywhere near that kind of\
    \ pull. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n probably. empty heads usually get the nod.\r\n\r\n\
    \r\nthat does not mean i will vote for him. screw voting on party lines, i vote\
    \ for individuals. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i am ecstatic. as a libertarian-republican,\
    \ i adamantly oppose his pseudo-conservatism. he is an establishment republican\
    \ who would just prolong the current big state republicanism that dominates the\
    \ gop. \r\n\r\nnow if we could only get jeb bush out of the race...\r\n\r\n \r\
    \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n reuters and bbc are my main news sources. i also listen to\
    \ npr pretty regularly. i think the quality of american television news is abysmal.\
    \ jake tapper is pretty good. fareed zakaria is decent. i also enjoy john stossel's\
    \ show on fox. \r\n\r\ni like getting news from opposing perspectives (which is\
    \ pretty much everyone, since i am a libertarian). i do *not* like news folks\
    \ who just use their show to stir up bullshit. i am talking about guys like o'reilly,\
    \ hannity, maher, morgon etc... \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n what do you think about their\
    \ insistence on the reality of class warfare? is class warfare true? is it necessary?\
    \ is it good? are there free market solutions to worker exploitation?\r\nwhere\
    \ exsctly does socialist theory go wrong? i realize there are many flavors of\
    \ socialist thought, but what are some fundamental ways they err?\r\nwhat are\
    \ your opinions about a socialist society existing within a larger free market?\
    \ a voluntary association of individuals who buy a large amount of land and establish\

    \ good books and articles that would give me a cursory overview of dreaming? i\
    \ am curious to learn more about what actually happens when we dream, where the\
    \ content of our dreams comes from, theories about significance of dreams, etc?\r\
    \n\r\ncan y'all help. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n not sure where to ask this...\r\n\r\
    \ni am looking for repectable books and articles about the psychology of dreams.\
    \ most of the stuff i find on google search is hardly respectable.. i am curious\
    \ to learn about the various theories about the causes and effects of dreams on\
    \ our psyche...  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n combat vet as well. i agree with everything\
    \ you said. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n which branch launched the largest amphibious\
    \ assault in u.s. military history? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n find an nco and relay\
    \ that the airmen can't salute properly. i would say that's about the best you\
    \ can do besides making on the spot corrections. \r\n\r\ni would probably just\
    \ tell their nco that they have not been saluting properly. give it time to see\
    \ if that clears it up.\r\n\r\nthey are still recruits, so expect some ignorance\
    \ about customs and courtesies.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n sure,\r\n\r\npeter explains\
    \ how christ took our sin upon himself in 1 pet. 2:24, and 3:18. this is the idea\
    \ him taking our unrighteousness and sin-wages, and giving us his right standing\
    \ in return.\r\n\r\njohn echoes this idea in 1 john 1:5 (where he explains that\
    \ there can be no darkness in god the light, thus explaining our separation from\
    \ god) through 2:3. he explains exactly what paul said, that christ is the propitiation\
    \ for our sins, and that those sins are forgiven through confession.\r\n\r\n\r\
    \n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n the reason we apply the rpw (which you will fins explicitly\
    \ in the last statement of wcf xxi vs 1, that we are forbidden from worshipping\
    \ any way not prescribed by holy scripture\") to worship is because we believe\
    \ sunday is the lord's day, the sabbath, and we are obligated to keep it in accordance\
    \ with the explicit way he instituted, lest we dishonor the sabbath. \r\n\r\n\
    we don't apply the same principles to the business aspects of the church, because\
    \ there is nothing holy, no obligations commanded in regards to budgets, interior\
    \ designs, etc. \r\n\r\nour church government is not centralized, but very decentralized.\
    \ it is not independent though. the scriptural precedent for oversight above the\
    \ local church is found in acts 15, qhere the jerusalem council exercised oversight\
    \ on the matter of greekness vs jewishness. \r\n\r\nwe believe there is nothing\
    \ holy or significant about a name. our name is simply another necessary business\
    \ aspect of church organization.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n sure, \r\n\r\nromans 3:10-20\
    \ outlines that none of us are righteous (or in right standing with god). \r\n\
    \r\nromans 3:21-26 paul explains the idea of christ giving us right standing through\
    \ his sacrifice ( what paul calls \"propitiation through his blood\").\r\n\r\n\
    romans 10:9 explaina the way to eternal life as confessing our sins, aknowledgement\
    \ of christ's lordship, and belief hid death and subsequent resurrection. \r\n\
    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n by virtue of who we are (the original sin that defines us) we\
    \ face a twofold death. first, a literal death (which is inescapable), and second\
    \ a death beyond that death. the second death is eternal death, separation from\
    \ god (who is the essence of life) forever, and banishment to hell. \r\n\r\nthe\
    \ path to life is the confession of our sin, and surrender of ourselves to christ's\
    \ sovereignty, aknowledging belief in his death on the cross as a substitutionary\
    \ sacrifice that bore the weight of our second death and his resurrection as a\
    \ victory over both deaths.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i don't know. i don't care about\
    \ any sport, none of them add value to my life, so my opinion probably is not\
    \ too helpful. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n a know a lot of vets have trouble transitioning\
    \ into civilian life for this very reason.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n yes. shit rolls\
    \ down hill. if they are yelling at me, it is because they got yelled at. \r\n\
    \r\neven if it is not my fault, a little ass chewin never hurt anybody. like i\
    \ said before, the army is no place for someone with thin skin, or someone who\
    \ thinks so much of himself that he can't take someone else's ass chewin. \r\n\
    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i am looking for books about labor unions, especially labor unions\
    \ pre-ww2. \r\n\r\ni am interested in non-fiction, biographies, fiction, or anything\
    \ else dealing with the subject. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n well, it is a part of a\
    \ larger effort to impose composting on the residents.\r\n\r\nthey are trying\
    \ to force folks to compost, and fine them for not doing so. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
    \n oh we can take care of that. a few motivational runs, and drill sergeant watching\
    \ every bite you eat, ready to pounce on your ass for even looking at cake proves\
    \ to be an effective weight loss solution. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n which is why folks\
    \ with significant sleep issues are subject to discharge. if you have bad sleep\
    \ issues, they likely won't let you enlist in the first place. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i agree. as long as my supervisor does not try to fire\
    \ me or take admin action against me unjustly, it would not bother me. they can\
    \ say what they want, i just listen, agree, and move on. they will forget about\
    \ the whole thing in fove minutes and so will i. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \"i am sorry\

    \r\n nope. i have very specific reading goals, to-read lists spanning years out\
    \ from now. for a book to even get on my reading list it needs to be recommended\
    \ from a respected source.\r\n\r\ni get most of my books from the library. i only\
    \ buy books i know would add value and dimension to my personal library, i have\
    \ specific qualifications.\r\n\r\ni also don't like the idea of subscription boxes.\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n many writers, atwood, asimov, chomsky, umberto eco and\
    \ t. s. eliot included have found essays to be a very profitable way to deal with\
    \ ideas.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n let's talk about essays. who are some of your favorite\
    \ essayists and why?\r\n\r\nalso, which essays have had an impact on you? \r\n\
    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n quiet and pensive. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n nope. \r\n\r\nbut i was\
    \ homeschooled, with ample freedom. my mom let me choose my own education route\
    \ with few exceptions. i think this very experience solidified a love for reading\
    \ in me. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i never said there were successful current markets.\
    \ it has never been tried properly. there has always been government overreach.\
    \ \r\n\r\nnew hampshire's free state project is moving slowly towards something\
    \ close. no income tax, no sales tax, no tobacco tax, no taxi regulations etc.\r\
    \n\r\nthe internet is a somewhat applicable example of a free market that works\
    \ pretty well. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n we believe acts of aggression to be issues\
    \ unrelated to regulating the market. sure, they have an effect on the market,\
    \ but making slavery illegal does not make the market unfree. \r\n\r\nwe believe\
    \ humans have three basic rights, life, liberty, and property. those rights cannot\
    \ be infringed upon. you cannot take someone's life in aggression, cannot take\
    \ their liberty, and cannot take their property. this is not regulating the market,\
    \ this is protecting liberty. \r\n\r\nif i murder the ceo of a large company,\
    \ would that have some effect on the market? sure. does that make murder a free\
    \ market issue? no. just because the market is free, does not mean our other rights\
    \ are nonexistent. each individual owns himself. you should be allowed to work\
    \ and sell and buy without state intervention, but you are never allowed to commit\
    \ acts of aggression. that is the fundamental premise of right libertarianism.\
    \ the market is free, and you are free, you are simply not allowed to hurt people,\
    \ own people, or take their stuff. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n slave labor is a violation\
    \ of the nonaggression principle. it has nothing to do with being a labor issue,\
    \ it is a basic liberty issue. a libertarian society would operate under the assumption\
    \ that everything being legal except acts of aggression.\r\n\r\nif a child comprehends\
    \ a contract, and is willing to trade his services in exchange for wages, i am\
    \ fine with that. we would have to have lawyers that ensure the child understands\
    \ the contract fully. if he is in any way being coerced into working, it is an\
    \ act of aggression and therefore illegal. again, nothing to do with regulating\
    \ the market. the child must be able to comprehend what the contract means, and\
    \ left free to quit that association whenever he/she wants. otherwise, i see no\
    \ problem with letting them decide if they want to work.\r\n\r\nbtw, you will\
    \ note in my original comment i never said i was a full ancap. i lean ancap. i\
    \ believe the existence of night watch state is necessary. i believe the state\
    \ should only intervene to prevent/punish acts of aggression. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \r\n i agree with that \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n laissez faire capitalism is incompatible\
    \ with socialism. we believe it *totally* free markets, socialism believes in\
    \ a planned market. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n first, i don't like identifying as an\
    \ anarchist. i agree that anarchism is a leftist ideal. i prefer the term voluntaryist.\r\
    \n\r\n\r\nin a totally free market, money would not equal power. you would be\
    \ free to exchange anything you have for anything another has so long as they\
    \ agree. you could exchange time, produce, gold, cloth, anything that you can\
    \ use to barter for another item you want.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i would not classify\
    \ myself as anarchist, that is a title applied to us by outsiders. i prefer the\
    \ term voluntaryist.\r\n\r\ni am a true capitalist. the market should be totally\
    \ free. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n no, because parents are not holy. they are finite\
    \ and sinful people just like everyone else. i am not obligated to obey them if\
    \ their demands are sinful.\r\n\r\ngod is perfectly holy, so he would never demand\
    \ anything that was not perfectly holy.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i do not, but i\
    \ would also like to see such statistics. \r\n\r\ni think a lot more people are\
    \ sympatetic to our cause even if they don't totally identify as ancap (as long\
    \ as we use words other than \"anarchist\") \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n because he demands\
    \ it, and as my sovereign lord who bought me with his blood, i am obliged to obey.\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n as a libertarian..\r\n\r\nnot even remotely. i do in fact\
    \ believe the government should have no role in infrastructure. i lean anarcho-capitalistic.\
    \ i am an absolute laissez-faire capitalist. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n vienna sausages\
    \ on ritz crackers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i have a to-read list. \r\n\r\nif i am\
    \ headed to my bookshop i will make a shorter list, choosing the books i would\
    \ like to read most and i give that list to my bookseller. she crosses off the\
    \ items she does not have in stock, and i pick up the rest.\r\n\r\ni usually ask\
    \ my bookseller if she had recommendations since i last saw her. i take her recommendations\
    \ into consideration. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n u.s.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i understand\
    \ there is a lot of controversy about the possibility of this leftist party winning.\
    \ \r\n\r\nwho exactly are they? i understand they are leftists, are they democratic\
    \ socialists or more communistic?\r\n\r\nwhat is their platform?\r\n\r\nif they\
    \ gained power how would greece change? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n either tommy lee\
    \ jones or clint eastwood. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n yeah, the railroad has some wonderful\
    \ benefits i have heard.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i am assuming they are gonna\
    \ make him finish basic now and finish his enlistment obligation without getting\
    \ out.\r\n\r\nthwt is what return to duty means. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i have read\
    \ others, the q'uran and bits and pieces of buddhavacana. \r\n\r\nit was not quantifiable.\
    \ i do believe faith is a gift of god. all men are dead in soul until he brings\
    \ them to life. so it is nothing a man can do on his own to instill faith within\
    \ himself.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n rand paul is the best option right now imo.\r\
    \n\r\nhe is not perfect, but he is certainly not a neocon. i think definitely\
    \ a step in the right direction, though i wish his father had won more than anything.\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n he is a religious neocon. \r\n\r\nhe is a social conservative,\
    \ outspoken against libertarianism.\r\n\r\nagainst legalization of cannibis, for\
    \ affirmative action, vague on foreign policy (by his associates i assume typical\
    \ neocon).\r\n\r\ni am not a huge fan. i am hoping for rand to run, he is the\
    \ best option in my book.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i love nonfiction books that explore\
    \ blue collar work.\r\n\r\ni would also like to read novels with blue-collar characters,\
    \ focused on the struggles of working class life. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\
    \r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n when has ron paul ever supported\
    \ corporatism?\r\n\r\nwe have always been around, the establishment guys are just\
    \ way more powerful than we are. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n the dems. support none of\
    \ my political beliefs. as a libertarian there is literally no room in the democratic\
    \ party for me.\r\n\r\ni support the abolishment of the federal reserve, welfare\
    \ state, the irs, ending the drug war, opening the borders, and introducong a\
    \ flat tax. the dems don't support decentralization. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n thats\
    \ because most of us young republicans are actually old school republicans (as\
    \ in pre-prohibition republicans).\r\n\r\nthe new identity of conservatives is\
    \ remarkably unconservative. the whole point of conservatism is less government\
    \ involvement. state regulation of marriage, the drig war, an aggressive foreign\
    \ policy, strict border control; none of these things are truly conservative at\
    \ all. there is a new wave of liberty loving republicans though. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
    \n\r\n because they don't have that kind of power yet. they are a loosely organized\
    \ band of hyped up hadjis, no way they could stand a chance against the disciplined,\
    \ organized, well funded, and battle tested israeli military. they understand\
    \ that they would get slaughtered. same reason they don't commit an open attack\
    \ against the us. there are grossly outgunned. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n the same reason\
    \ duck dynasty is popular. just because it is scripted does not mean it is entertaining.\
    \ wrestling is not about the competetion aspect like other sports, it is about\
    \ the flash and pizazz. the gimmicks, the quirkiness, and the trash talking. \r\
    \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n uh.. shoes don't really factor into the sexy equation for me.\
    \ as long as they aren't ass-ugly i probably won't even notice them. \r\n\r\n\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n this is not a question with an objective answer. you are in the wrong\
    \ sub. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n its kinda subjective. \r\n\r\ntechnically it would\
    \ encompass everyone whose roots lie in the reformation. \r\n\r\n\r\nnow it mostly\
    \ identifies groups who are confessional in the calvinist tradition. a lot of\
    \ us get labeled \"tr\" or \"truly reformed\" when we are super strict confessionalists.\
    \  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n these stories about vets claiming ptsd without an actual\
    \ event are very prevalent, but i have never ever met anyone who actually claimed\
    \ those things.\r\n\r\n\r\nmost vets i know would never claim ptsd if they never\
    \ saw it.\r\n\r\n\r\nalso, while a little good natured rib poking at the \"fobbits\"\
    \ (myself included) is all well and good, but you seem genuinely venomous about\
    \ it. shit happens on fobs too. if you doubt it you can talk to my good buddy's\
    \ widow. shank got hit all the time, and not 1000m away. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \ it has nothing to do with ww2. that is the logo of the sons of union veterans\
    \ of the civil war. \r\n\r\n[here](http://www.suvcw.org) is their website. perhaps\
    \ if you contact them they can give you more info on what exactly that badge represents.\
    \ \r\n\r\nit looks like there were a bunch made in the 30s, 40s, and 50s. i would\
    \ assume that they are affiliation badges of some sort. was it possible your grandfather\
    \ was the son/grandson of a union veteran of the civil war? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
    \n i never said he was. \r\n\r\n\r\nmy point was just i don't see any reason to\
    \ boycott.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n no we should not fund it. it is not our business.\
    \ \r\n\r\nboth sides have committed acts of injustice. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 1.\
    \ reading - i read around 5 books a month. i love to learn. i am active in a local\
    \ book club, and jump at the chance to attend literary themed events in my area.\
    \ i am a huge library patron. \r\n\r\n2. gardening - i love trying to be more\
    \ self sufficient, and enjoy working with my hands. \r\n\r\n3. fishing -nothing\
    \ more relaxing than a day on the river/lake with a cold sixpack and a few sandwiches.\r\
    \n\r\n4. hunting - again, i love being self sufficient. i love the thrill of taking\
    \ down game, i love preparing fresh game. \r\n\r\n5. camping - i like being out\
    \ in nature, retreating from the modern world. i am not a big technology buff,\
    \ and like the simplicity of being alone in the woods.\r\n\r\ni don't really watch\
    \ tv or play videogames. i do enjoy interacting with people via the internet,\
    \ but otherwise i am a pretty unplugged guy. i like nature, working with my hands,\
    \ and doing things for myself. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n the tears of your enemies.\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i like when my wifr cooks my favorite breakfast (steak\
    \ and eggs for me), and picks up some beer for me. i am not a fussy guy either,\
    \ i don't like parties, big to-do's or anything, just a nice day relaxing at home\
    \ with some good homemade food \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n we fence the table through\
    \ invite. the pastor makes it clear the supper is for baptized believers who are\
    \ not living in unrepentant sin.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n as for the opc;\r\
    \n\r\nno intinction. \r\n\r\nyes, they recognize your baptism and would allow\
    \ you to take communion.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n oh come on.. patriotism, love for\
    \ america etc are subjective things... stick to policies. vote based on policies.\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i can see how the prohibition of closed shops would be\
    \ unlibertarian. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n no. it would violate my convictions. \r\n\
    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n what does team lead do exactly? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n from what\
    \ i understand, if a union and employer cannot reach an agreement, the federal\
    \ govt can come in and force them to adopt closed shop practices. wouldn't rtw\
    \ protect against this?\r\n\r\n\r\ni don't know why an employer would ever *voluntarily*\
    \ adopt closed shop practices. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n please explain further \r\n\
    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n it was more a symbolic thing than an expectation that extraterrestrials\
    \ would actually find it.\r\n\r\nthat being said, any intelligent lifeforms probably\
    \ have already discovered sound/recording and will be able to figure out the gist\
    \ of it  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n what exactly does a logistics specialist do in the\
    \ civilian world? what does a typical day look like? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n\r\n good. workers should be allowed to associate with whomever they\
    \ choose and also refuse to associate with whomever they choose. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
    \n\r\n 710th is a unit we were both in.\r\n\r\n\r\nnot really, i haven't had it\
    \ as bad as other guys. there are some dudes with serious psycological scars though,\
    \ and some of them have a hard time relating to civilians.\r\n\r\n\r\nstolen valor\
    \ is a real thing, and it is illegal. i have the same opinon thst most vets do,\
    \ trying to steal valor is morally reprehensible. if i ever saw it i would call\
    \ them out on it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n yeah, its doggone freezing here now, snow\
    \ everywhere. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n don't make assumptions about what i did or\
    \ didn't do. i saw my share of shit. \r\n\r\n\r\nshank got hit all the time for\
    \ one thing, and my support unit had our share of tragedy.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
    \n this was in july.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i was referring to how we are wired\
    \ differently once we have done tours, thats why we prefer our own language to\
    \ the civilian world. it is familiar. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n its a few\
    \ months old. we came back in july of 2014. i just found it yesterday. \r\n\r\n\
    \r\n\r\n\r\n all of it, kind of. we were in a valley near the mountains. \r\n\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n\r\n 2014, right after we left. 82nd deactivated it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \r\n this was literally the moment i got out of the car. my wife opened the door\
    \ and he met me in the yard. relax bro \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n he might be. he was\
    \ a shelter puppy so i just went off what they told me. i just googled schiller\
    \ hound though and he looks exactly like that. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 3rd \r\n\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n\r\n no, a lot of the animals over there have rabies etc. they try to\
    \ discourage that practice now. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n they did when we first arrived,\
    \ but we closed everything down. shank has been deactivated. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
    \n i don't know why the heck i got downvoted. i was just pointing out that spartan\
    \ brigade has cased their colors. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n fuck you. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
    \n\r\n yeah. dude who did it was in my unit too. he was a moron. worst way to\
    \ go, that was a super fucked up situation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n we don't remember\
    \ how to civilian. we have fucked up brains and fucked up souls and the military\
    \ is all we know. thats why we get so excited to talk to other vets in military\
    \ talk, its about connecting with folks who get us. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n oh shit.\
    \ yeah, terry hurne. we were in the same unit, and i was at that range.  \r\n\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n\r\n if you are serious about meeting girls the bar scene is not the\
    \ place. literally every dude in there is trying to hit on the girls in there,\
    \ and they all know that. i am not saying you will never ever meet a girl at a\
    \ bar, but there are other places to really connect with someone. volunteering\
    \ with local organizations, social groups, book clubs (this one especially. hardly\
    \ any straight dudes are involved with book clubs. tons of single girls are involved\
    \ with book clubs) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njust my two cents. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n where\
    \ was 1-32? rushmore?\r\n\r\nwe were at shank. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 92a. logistician.\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n aw man that sucks bro.. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n yup, spartans\
    \ are all gone now. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n a whole ton of culture, good food, deep\
    \ roots, hospitality, manners, work ethic, and pride.\r\n\r\ni was raised in south\
    \ alabama. my mom whooped my butt if i didn't say yes sir and yes ma'am. we were\
    \ poor but had blue collar pride. the \"poor folk\" food we ate is still my comfort\
    \ food (redeye gravy and cathead biscuits, fried baloney, and rice and red gravy.)\
    \ i will never ever foget my roots or my family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n sweet, i\
    \ am over in cab now. i was with 710th. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 1. the onus is not\
    \ on me to cite something not happening. the onus is on you to give an example\
    \ of a monopoly occuring naturally in the free market.\r\n\r\n2. businesses coukd\
    \ not use coercive force because that would be illegal. this is the one thing\
    \ i believe government is responsible for, protecting against/prosecuting acts\
    \ of aggression. if a corporation vandalized, threatened, attacked, stole from\
    \ etc another business they would be arrested for those acts of aggrssion. tmit\
    \ has nothing to do with market regulation it has to do with government defending\
    \ against acts of aggression. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n yup. i deployed with 3rd bct\
    \ before they deactivated. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n monopolization is extremely rare\
    \ in the free market without big businesses using force. since we (right libertarians)\
    \ oppose all acts of aggression that would be nullified. monopolies are usually\
    \ created by the government through corporation friendly legislation. there is\
    \ no evidence for a natural monopoly occuring in the free market. if you are so\
    \ adamantly against monopolies, why do you support the government's monopoly of\
    \ force?\r\n\r\n\r\nthe government did \"technically\" invent the internet. but\
    \ in keeping with my previous statement, it did so shittily. it created aparnet,\
    \ a network which only communicated between 37 computers. only when the internet\
    \ was privatized in 1995 did it flourish and become usable for the average person.\
    \ even while the government was \"inventing the internet\" it was done through\
    \ private sector research. why didm't the free market create the internet on their\
    \ own? because the government heavily regulated the research though the fcc and\
    \ blocked out private sector attempts.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n regulating\
    \ it would give the government control over the maryjane market. the government\
    \ screws everything up.  \r\n\r\ni believe in free markets, with zero government\
    \ presence. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i would not. i would legalize it totally and\
    \ leave the government out of it.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i have seen the question\
    \ asked for officers, but not for us enlisted guys. i am a 92a, logistics specialist.\
    \ i haved worked as a warehouseman, ordering and recieving parts, managing a motorpool\
    \ etc. \r\n\r\n\r\nwhat civilian jobs would fit my experience? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \r\n hey y'all,\r\n\r\ni am originally from baldwin county, but i have been in\
    \ the army for the past few years. i am nearing my transition date and preparing\
    \ to move to birmingham to attend uab. i had some questions about the city.\r\n\
    \r\n1. what is the city vibe like? i enjoy artsy stuff, indie bookstores, theatre,\
    \ live music, etc. \r\n\r\n2. what is the job market like? i will be looking for\
    \ a blue collar job while i attend school. i have experience in logistics, plan\
    \ on looking for work with either the railroad, ups, fedex, manufacturing, or\
    \ anything else i can do to support my family. i am really open to anything with\
    \ decent pay. \r\n\r\n3. anything else you wanna tell me about bham? get me excited\
    \ to move there? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n he was not. this is him seeing me after\
    \ i came back from afghanistan. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n for anyone curious he is\
    \ a two year old bloodhound/labrador mix, with a big sensitive heart! \r\n\r\n\
    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i am from baldwin county and i have been in the\
    \ army for the past few years and i am getting ready to transition out and plan\
    \ to attend uab, majoring in english secondary education. i would be coming in\
    \ as a junior.\r\n\r\ni am just looking for some student insider perspective.\
    \ \r\n\r\n1. do you enjoy uab? why or why not?\r\n\r\n2. what is birmingham like?\
    \ job market, things to do, etc.\r\n\r\n3. do you know of any student veteran\
    \ organizations on campus?\r\n\r\n4. what is the uab english/education program\
    \ like?\r\n\r\n5. any other things you wanna share? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i don't\
    \ carry a knife for self-defense i carry a gun for self-defense.\r\n\r\n\r\na\
    \ knife is one of the handiest tools you can carry regularly. opening stubborn\
    \ packages, makeshift screwdriver, reaching into small places to unclog them,\
    \ cutting gasket cloth etc. i use mine on a daily basis. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \ he said he had a biology degree, but he was referring to his m. d. was he puffing\
    \ up his credentials a lottle? sure. does that mean he is a bad choice for president?\
    \ no. nobody is perfect, and all of thise guys fib to make themselves look better.\
    \ there is no denying the fact that he is an actual doctor with an actual m. d.\
    \  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n fortunately i can turn my telescreen off. winston wasn't\
    \ so lucky. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n basic was not that hard. i wouldn't say it was\
    \ a cakewalk, but it was way easier than deployment.\r\n\r\nbasic has a lot of\
    \ stress and anxiety, but is pretty idiotproof. i was not terribly rattled, i\
    \ kept my head down and didn't get singled out. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n actually,\
    \ i do have the same attitude about focusing on democrats namecalling. as a libertarian-republican\
    \ i agree with democrats on a good many issues, and don't buy into the two party\
    \ hostilities. i have no respect or support for establishment politicians at all\
    \ regardless of their party. i think giuliani's comments were pointless, but just\
    \ about everything he says is. i just think it is a waste of time to cover this\
    \ as actual news, other than a passing reference. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n kind of.\
    \ \r\n\r\ntechnically it does, but there are proper avenues through which he relays\
    \ those commands. there is a huge system in place for the command of our armed\
    \ forces. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n if my post commander randomly ordered no contact\
    \ with the outside world we would all agree he was fuckin nuts. he would probably\
    \ be reported to the inspector general and would not be in charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    if there was a war, some valid reason reinforced by his higher ups then we would\
    \ lock down base i guess. but there are very very specific rules for when and\
    \ how to put a base on lockdown. like i said, there is a shit ton of oversight\
    \ in the military. nobody has totalitarian power. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n yes. there\
    \ is a shit ton of oversight in the military. it would be pretty much impossible\
    \ for an immoral order to be ordered on a large scale. there have been instances\
    \ of immoral orders of course, but usually they happen at low levels (platoons).\
    \  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n they both are. ron was in the pregnancy ward.\r\n\r\n\
    rand is an eye doctor. still an m. d. he has done a medical missions trip in guatemala\
    \ last year. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n he obeys his original orders. this specific\
    \ instance is covered in our three general orders. summed up these say that when\
    \ we are given a post to guard, we guard it to the best of our ability in exactly\
    \ the way we were told.\r\n\r\na crypto safe always has a list of specific people\
    \ who are allowed access to it, so that would be the standard the guard will follow.\r\
    \n\r\n\r\nto answer youe larger question, an order can be disobeyed if it violates\
    \ human rights, or basic military values. basically if an officer tells me to\
    \ do something morally wrong like rape or shoot a baby, i can and will refuse\
    \ it. on murkier issues if you refuse an order, you will have to present a case\
    \ before court marshall and they will judge whether it was moral or not. \r\n\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n\r\n rand paul said that vaccines are wise, as a doctor he fully supports\
    \ them and that is extremely unwise to refuse them. but he does not think they\
    \ should be state mandated. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i think even if you disagree\
    \ with his positions, his statesmanship was remarkable. if only all candidates\
    \ approached campaigns with his humility and respect for opponents. \r\n\r\n\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n he was asked how old the earth is at one point and i believe he passed\
    \ on the question. he may have been pandering the political game or he may very\
    \ well believe that. i don't think his religious beliefs discredit him though.\r\
    \n\r\ni preferred his father, he was one of my personal heroes. but rand still\
    \ has a high regard for liberty and common sense approach to government. \r\n\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n\r\n nope. it was blaring at work, kind of hard to ignore. \r\n\r\n\
    i tend to get my news from reuters or bbc. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i think justin\
    \ amash and rand paul are some of the best current gop'ers. \r\n\r\nthe rest of\
    \ those guys are still harping on the drug war, homophobia, and oppressive immigration\
    \ laws. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n no, the fact that they are focusing on absolutely\
    \ pointless issues as valid news is proof that it is more than bias.  \r\n\r\n\
    \r\n\r\n\r\n its more than bias. this same story is on cnn and fox. \r\n\r\n\r\
    \nit is vapidness, idiocy. american journalism is absolutely retarded. \r\n\r\n\
    \r\n\r\n\r\n i use one for work. i jot down phone numbers, part numbers, important\
    \ bits of info.\r\n\r\ni carry another when i am in civvies. i use it for library\
    \ lists, topics to research later, quick fleeting thoughts, etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
    \n\r\n i don't see the big deal. as long as you aren't wearing the whole uniform,\
    \ patches, claiming to have served etc.\r\n\r\nthere is a common sense line between\
    \ wearing military surplus (i am from alabama, everybody wears military surplus\
    \ in my trailer park) and disrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nif you wear a camo jacket, that\
    \ is cool with me.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i am complaining about both things. \r\
    \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i am a republican and i adamantly oppose such philosophy. you\
    \ are stereotyping now. \r\n\r\nron paul is a good example of a republican who\
    \ did not behave like those establishment quacks. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i agree.\
    \ i usually stay away from the nonsense, but it is on endless repeat at work.\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i agree that he is trying to change america. that does\
    \ not mean he is unpatriotic or \"hates america\".  so why don't we respectfully\
    \ speak about the issues, not subjective emotions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n that was\
    \ not my point. my point is thst not only were the comments not useful, but also\
    \ our media focuses on absolutely pointless things (by the way this was msnbc).\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n so you agree with his opinion. \r\n\r\nmy point\
    \ is that this has no bearing on any real issues. we are focusing on silly feelings\
    \ and emotions instead of concrete issues. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n yeah.. that dude\
    \ gives the gop a bad name. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n no, i am a republican. this is\
    \ not respectable statesmanship though, its just namecalling. instead of thoughtfully\
    \ debating the issues we are spending all our time wondering whether the president\
    \ \"loves america?\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i have been watching the news blabber\
    \ about rudy giuliani's comments about the president, and it has reinforced how\
    \ awful the american media is. come on guys, is this what counts as \"meaningful\
    \ political analysis\" now? one guy says someone else \"doesn't love america\"\
    \ and we have to discuss it for an hour and a half, with panels of experts commenting\
    \ on the implications of such comments on the gop's 2016 race? \r\n\r\nwhy does\
    \ this remind me of an analysis of an argument between toddlers?\r\n\r\n\"up next\
    \ on the news, little joey said adam did not love his mommy. adam says he does\
    \ in fact love his mommy. who is right? we are gonna debate it for an hour and\
    \ a half to find out!\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n let me put it this way, you will\
    \ get what you put in. \r\n\r\nbasic and ait will give you some very basic foundational\
    \ concepts of discipline, but if you are not willing to continue down the path\
    \ of self discipline you will lose it all when you get in the real army.\r\n\r\
    \n\r\nthe army will give you a good foundatiom, but you have to have strong self\
    \ motivation to develop yourself. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n no. only you can get your\
    \ shit together. \r\n\r\nno organization can change your bad habits, you have\
    \ to do it yourself. the army can put you in an environment that promotes hard\
    \ work and discipline, but you are going to have to make some personal choices\
    \ to develop your own character.\r\n\r\n\r\nthere are lazy dirtbags in the army\
    \ too. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i am not very well read on the spanish revolution\
    \ and would like to correct that. what is some essential reading on the subject?\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i am looking to understand what the lives of working class\
    \ folks were actually like in the heydays of the various communist systems throughout\
    \ history (the ussr, cuba, maoism etc).\r\nalong with responses, articles, books,\
    \ or other media related to this subject would be greatly appreciated.\r\n \r\n\
    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i understand that according to most communists the marxist ideal\
    \ has never been realized. but there were periods in which parties based (even\
    \ loosely) on communist ideals had control. i am curious what worker's living\
    \ conditions were like under those parties. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n is the association\
    \ voluntary?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i am looking to understand what the lives of\

    \ (something to look forward to.) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i get a weekly haircut.\
    \  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n a society in which i am free to make any choices i want\

    \r\n\r\n\r\n thank you! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i don't believe the 1000 year number\

    \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n can anyone recommend good homesteading podcasts? \r\n\r\n\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n well, strictly speaking yes. the internet is a valuable resource for\
    \ selfdevelopment and autododactic learning.\r\n\r\nalso, as a soldier i am required\

    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n what exactly about the self sufficient aspects of agorism\

    \r\n\r\n\r\n robert pirsig's alter ego. pirsig suffered from paranoid schizophrenia.\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n it is more difficult to wean the public from the teat of\
    \ the state. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i don't hear this very often. most decent guys\
    \ don't care about your past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ni hold both genders to the same standard.\
    \ i don't approve of sex outside a committed relationship for either men or women.\
    \  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i browsed their website, and it looks really interesting.\
    \ are any of y'all familiar with the organization? any personal stories about\
    \ them? i love motorcycles, and a vets club might just be the right kind of community\
    \ for me. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n basically i am curious to know what form of transition\
    \ you support from our current statism to a voluntary society?\r\n\r\n\r\ni tend\
    \ to support a more gradual transition. i have never been a revolutionary. i think\
    \ the gradual deregulation of the markets, and drawdown of government. it seems\
    \ to me that a revolutionary transition would wage havok on the markets for a\
    \ while, and we would need a longee buffer time for recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    how can we transition from our current state to one of liberty?\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n i am a soldier myself. i understand the struggle. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
    \n it seems like a *huge* paradox to me that progressives tend to support an individualist\
    \ social perspective (subjective morality, freedom from religious oppression,\
    \ marriage equality, equality of all choices etc) but insist on a collectivist/classist\
    \ economic outlook (activism against class warfare, white privilege, affirmitive\
    \ action, etc).\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat are y'alls opinions about this paradox? have you\
    \ ever heard any of them try to address it?\r\n\r\n\r\ni feel i am not responsible\
    \ for the actions of other members of my gender, my race, my tax bracket, or my\
    \ region... \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n its not just feminists.. it is common sense that\
    \ a man controlling a woman as portrayed in that book is total abuse. \r\n\r\n\
    \r\n\r\n\r\n *to kill a mockingbird* or *forrest gump* \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i\
    \ don't. \r\n\r\n\r\npicking up hookups at the club is childish. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
    \n\r\n we have a different approach to worship. we believe worship is obedience\
    \ driven, not emotion driven, and that probably has a big effect on our external\
    \ reactions.\r\n\r\n\r\nwe tend to prefer a more reserved and less flamboyant\
    \ type of worship than our nondenominational brethren. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n by\
    \ having sex with him without his consent.\r\n\r\n\r\nphysical reactions to external\
    \ stimuli (e.g. an erection) do not always mean consent. women can orgasm during\

    \ out. \r\n\r\nbasic is easy, don't volunteer for shit, keep your head down. when\
    \ you get to your first unit nobody is gonna give a shit how good you did in basic,\

    \r\nthe army is nothing like the movies, it is boring bullshit 99% of the time,\

    \ came true. have you read his short story about the [2014 world fair](http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/03/23/lifetimes/asi-v-fair.html)\
    \ (written in 1964)?\r\n\r\ndriverless cars, coffee makers, robots, videophone\
    \ technology etc...\r\n\r\n\r\ni think asimov's principles of robotics and the\
    \ way he applies them in his stories is remarkable. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n either\
    \ isaac asimov or arthur c. clarke. \r\n\r\nasimov was a genius, well rounded,\
    \ and incredibly perceptive. i would place him slightly above clarke as the king.\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n voluntaryism. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 1. yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\

    \ are the same kids watching rape scenes in game of thrones and killing hookers\
    \ on grand theft auto.\r\nabrasive ideas must be encountered. issues like violence,\
    \ sex, rape etc must be encountered at some point for an accurate grasp of our\
    \ world. literature is the perfect medium through which to encounter such ideas.\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n no, i don't rank women on the basis of their physical attributes.\
    \  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n marx has no clue what laissez faire capitalism resukts\
    \ in because there has never been a laissez faire capitalist system. there has\
    \ never yet been a society founded totally on voluntary association and totally\
    \ free markets. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i have read *das kapital* and of course his\

    \ try to be a thoughtful eater. many folks who criticize hunting partake in supermarket\
    \ bought meat products farmed on industrial farms where the animals are treated\
    \ horribly, pumped full of hormones, and killed. i prefer eating humanely raised\
    \ meat, and hunting wild game when i can. it connects you to your food, and makes\
    \ the consumption process a more mindful one. i also grew up on a small family\
    \ farm. we slaughtered our own sheep, hogs, and beef cows. i appreciate the meat\
    \ on my table, and respect the animal who gave it to me.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \ because i sure as hell plan on making higher wages when i am 60 than i do now\
    \ at 22. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n the military. you will learn a trade, learn valuable\

    \n\r\n\r\nbefore you start investing though, you need to secure a savings account\
    \ with approx. 6 months of emergency savings. major debts first, savings second,\
    \ investment third.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n because our culture is more concerned\

    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n try your local vfw or american legion. those\
    \ organizations are usually good at helping out with these kinds of details. \r\
    \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n because most hospitals were affiliated with universities or\

    \ never talked to anyone about them.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \ \"no, no, no, this is not a suit made out of my mother's skin, it is a visible\
    \ representation of my ability to get in touch with my feminine side.\" \r\n\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n\r\n i keep a book journal. i write the book name, author, isbn #, and\
    \ two paragraphs. the first paragraph is a summary of the book, the second is\
    \ my reaction to the book.\r\n\r\n\r\ni have found this has been a useful discipline\
    \ that keeps me from passively reading. it gives me an avenue to mull over the\
    \ book as a whole. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i need some advice guys. i was driving\
    \ my 2014 corolla last night, and it was very dark as i prepared to pull onto\
    \ the interstate ramp. there was a very deep pothole which i hit at about 35-40\
    \ mph and blew my right front tire out. when i removed the tire to replace it\
    \ with my spare i noticed that the control arm appeared to be bent. on the drive\
    \ home there were no real issues other than the car pulling noticably to the right.\
    \ the rim appears to be undented on the old tire.\r\n\r\n\r\ncan someone give\
    \ me some advice before i get tge mechanics to look at it on monday? i am taking\
    \ it to a dealership mechanic because i do not want to fuck up my warranty. what\
    \ kinda wallet damage am i looking at? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n it is based on being\
    \ a consistently good soldier, but that entails a lot of self development. \r\n\
    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n not anymore.\r\n\r\nthe only \"stripes\" that can be given at\
    \ the unit level are those of corporal, which is only an appointment not a promotion.\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n an officer is a leader of soldiers a warrant officer is\
    \ a technical expert. \r\n\r\nfor example, officers in my motorpool unit plan\
    \ our field exercises, set the standards, oversee the administration of our company\
    \ etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nwarrant officers are technical subject matter experts in logistics,\
    \ mechanical stuff, etc.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n it depends on which branch,\
    \ and whether you are an officer, enlisted, or warrant officer.\r\n\r\ni can only\
    \ speak to the army's way of doing things because i am in the army.\r\n\r\n**enlisted**\
    \ \r\n\r\ne-1 to e-4 is automatic, based on time in service. if you don't fuck\
    \ up (get a dui, drugs, punctual etc) you will get promoted.\r\n\r\ne-5 to e-6\
    \ is points based. each mos (job) in the army has a certain amount of points one\
    \ needs to make e-5 or e-6. a soldier has to go to a promotion board, meet certain\
    \ standards (attend nco school, certain self development classes), and have the\
    \ correct number of points (points are awarded for various things, awards, pt,\
    \ how well you fire a weapon, civilian education etc.)\r\n\r\ne-7 and above is\
    \ board selected. each mos has a specific amount of allotted slots for each of\
    \ these ranks. a board meets every year and looks over all the e-6's and aboves\
    \ qualifications and determines whether to promote them to one of those slots.\r\
    \n\r\n**officer**\r\n\r\no-1 to o-2 is a pretty much automatic promotion, based\
    \ on time in service.\r\n\r\no-3 and above is based on board selection, similar\
    \ to e-7 and above on the enlisted side.\r\n\r\n**warrant**\r\n\r\nwo-1 to wo-2\
    \ is pretty much automatic based on time in grade/service. the rest are determined\
    \ by board selection.\r\n\r\n**two closing thoughts**\r\n\r\n1. you still have\
    \ many chances in peacetime to win awards. catching attention for hard work during\
    \ a field exercice, winning soldier/nco of the month boards, all kinds of things.\r\
    \n\r\n2. we (the u.s.) are not at peace and probably never will be in our lifetime.\
    \ there is always somewhere to deploy to.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n as a southerner\
    \ i always shake hands with folks i know at the store. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n just\
    \ keep it up man. running is all about practice. i am in the army and we run all\
    \ the damn time, so i have had lots of practice. but don't overdo it. here is\
    \ my personal running schedule for speed improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n**mon**- 2-4\
    \ miles at a pace that hurts. (the 7 min mile for me right now)\r\n\r\n\r\n**wed**-\
    \ sprintd, 61-20's, suicides, and other sprint excercises for 45 mins. followed\
    \ by lengthy streching.\r\n\r\n\r\n**fri**- run for 45 mins at a pace you can\
    \ carry on a conversation in. this is all about building lung capacity, learning\
    \ to pace yourself well, and correct your form. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ha! \r\n\r\
    \ndo you know what the difference is between a presbyterian and a southern baptist\
    \ is?\r\n\r\npresbyterians shake each others hands in the liquor store. \r\n\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n\r\n he never said he was suffering from depression. he said he fell\
    \ into a pit of depression early on in his academic career.\r\n\r\n\r\nfor many\
    \ folks the military would not be good if they suffered from real depression.\
    \ if you are easily emotionally affected by the world around you, the military\
    \ sure as hell is not for you.\r\n\r\nothers suffer depression stemming from low\
    \ self esteem and feelings of low worth. the military instills you with a high\
    \ level of self confidence and puts you in places of high responsibility. accomplishing\
    \ your job well only increases your worth and self confidence. this could be just\
    \ the challenge they need.\r\n\r\n\r\nthe military is not for everyone. it is\
    \ a rough, stressful, mucky life that not everyone can handle.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
    \n\r\n like most big army programs. \r\n\r\n\r\nhandling things at the big army\
    \ level never works like they hope (sharp, eo, etc) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n really\
    \ funny, coming from someone who doesn't know how to use a definite article (**the**\
    \ military not \"military\").\r\n\r\n\r\njust because you can graduate college\
    \ does not mean you are smart. i am responsible for millions of dollars of equipment\
    \ and the lives of my soldiers every single day. i am held to a higher standard\
    \ than all of my civilian peers. i have real world skills and marketability, leadership\
    \ skills, knowledge in my field (logistics), and more experience than all your\
    \ degrees. \r\n\r\n\r\nwho is the dumbass? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ran my four mile\
    \ in 28:25 yesterday. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n grandpa did. things from vietnam, awards\
    \ from his time in cargill, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\ni have a tuffbox that i keep important\
    \ things in. i have a flag that flew over our base in afghanistan, military coins,\

    \ warthog that a jtac gave me and a few other knick knacks.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
    \n i cannot speak to the specifics of your questions because i am in the u.s.\
    \ army. i am sure the british army does things a little differently than we do.\
    \ your local army recruiter would be the subject matter expert for your questions.\
    \ just because you sit down and have a conversation with them does not mean you\
    \ have to join.\r\n\r\n\r\nfor me, i signed my papers and was in basic training\
    \ four months later.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n if you have a degree you should have\
    \ no problem joining as an officer. i have a limited amount of knowledge on the\
    \ subject because i am enlisted. i would recommend talking to an army officer\
    \ recruiter, they would have all the answers you need.\r\n\r\n\r\na lot of guys\
    \ do enlist with degrees. you come in as an e-4 so pay will be better than your\
    \ peers for the first two years or so until they catch up to you.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \r\n\r\n join the military. \r\n\r\ni was in the same place. failing out of college\
    \ because i was a dumbass. now i have a steady and fulfilling job, real world\
    \ skills, and a future. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n you will be fine. have fun. \r\n\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n\r\n with whipped cream on top. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n well now i can\

    \ politely explains \"whenever a pretty woman walks near me i whisper in her ear,\

    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nits up to the politicians to decide whether we go to war, it\
    \ is up to the soldiers to fight those wars honorably. we voice our opinions about\

    \ our brains by inserting a common reference/relatable shared knowledge in a surprising\
    \ way (for example when they make a pop culture reference at a time we did not\
    \ expect a pop culture reference).\r\n\r\n\r\nit all boils down to brain stimulation\

    \ as i think i do. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i do support the existence of unions.\
    \ i said that in my first post. i am all for folks *voluntarily* joining together\
    \ to bargain for healthcare or anything else. i just do not support using the\
    \ state to achieve those goals. i also stated i would not join a union because\
    \ as of yet there are none who want to further my goals.\r\n\r\n\r\ni oppose abortion\
    \ because i believe it to be a violation of the nonaggression principle, and therefore\
    \ the lawful domain of state intervention. i believe the state should punish/prevent\
    \ acts of aggression, since i believe a fetus to be a human entitled to full human\
    \ rights, extinguishing their life is an act of aggression. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
    \n you are right, my bad. corrected. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n my goals are\r\n\r\n\
    1. deregulation of the markets. unions advocate for *more* market regulation.\
    \ i do not support welfare, federal organizations like osha, or any other federal\
    \ market legislation.\r\n\r\n2. total freedom of association. if a business owner\
    \ does not want to serve or hire someone based on race, religion, or bias, he\
    \ has that right. although it is apalling, i believe each individual owns the\
    \ products of their labor, and can refuse to give those products to anyone for\
    \ any reason.\r\n\r\n3. many unions support abortion coverage in an employment\
    \ contract. i do not believe abortions are moral and therefore oppose this.\r\n\
    \r\n4. i oppose the state forcing employers to provide healthcare for their employees.\
    \ while it is moral, and good business practice, the details of an employment\
    \ contract are for the employee and employer to decide through bargaining the\
    \ state has no place in the matter.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n unions are fine, but\
    \ should remain voluntary. individuals must be free to join and leave a union\
    \ at will. forced unionization is an infrigement on the right of voluntary association.\
    \ there should be no penalty for refusal to join a union. \r\n\r\n\r\ni would\
    \ not join a union because there are none whose goals match my own, but if others\
    \ want to join one it does not bother me.\r\n\r\n\r\none important distinction.\
    \ progressives and liberals (in the modern sense) tendto view the world collectively.\
    \ we view the world through an individualists perspective. my class, race, and\
    \ cuture do not represent me and i do not represent them. i am my own person,\

    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i am 22, afghanistan vet, and active vfw member. i love the vfw.\
    \ they are one of the oldest vsos around, and do tons for vets. many young guys\
    \ have an image of the vfw/legion as a smoky, shitty bar full of drunk old farts.\
    \ while some vfws are like this, blanketing the whole organization as such is\
    \ totally off base. let me make some points.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. joining a vso is about\
    \ what you can give to the organization not what you get out of it. many vets\
    \ our age (and millenials in general) act pretty entitled. there has been an influx\
    \ of new veterans organizations all about giving shit to vets, meanwhile these\
    \ old vets and old vsos are operating on a totally different premise. if you aren't\
    \ looking for free shit or a pat on the back, but are looking to give back and\
    \ continue your life of service, the vfw is a great place to be. the vfw offers\
    \ many ways to get involved, showing up en masse to lonely vets funerals who die\
    \ in nursing homes, getting involved with local organizations like habitat for\
    \ humanity, getting involved with local politics to fight for vets, scholarship\
    \ funds for vets kids, and even a home for orphans of war. \r\n\r\n\r\n2. many\
    \ guys discount these old vsos because of the large number of korea/vietnam/old\
    \ crusty vets. doing so overlooks a huge resource. these guys have been there,\
    \ done that, and seen most of the issues we are now facing. they make phenomenal\
    \ (and willing) mentors. sometimes the reason vfw bars are full of crusty old\
    \ vets is because they have nowhere else to go where folks understand them. \r\
    \n\r\n3. i have been very enriched by my experience with the vfw. the old guys\
    \ in my post have given me solid (and sometimes blunt) advice, i have been able\
    \ to continue civic service by volunteering with habitat for humanity and attending\
    \ old vets funerals when they have nobody else. if your local post isn't perfect,\
    \ none of us are so give them a break, join and make a difference. \r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i first learned about the oath keepers because many of\
    \ the porta-johns in afghanistan have graffiti advertising their organization.\
    \ on occasion i have seen their name pop up in libertarian circles (ron paul rallys,\
    \ libertarian republican caucus meetings, etc). upon googling them, i understand\
    \ their purpose and the gist of who they are, but i am curious if anyone can tell\
    \ me more specific details. are they a libertarian organization? are they tea\
    \ party conspiros? what exactly do they do?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n there are so\
    \ many charities out there. which nonprofit is the one closest to your heart,\
    \ and why should others support it? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 1. scott walker and rand\
    \ are two very different politicians. walker is a traditional conservative. paul\
    \ is a libertarian-republican\r\n\r\n\r\n2. the president does not have a ton\
    \ of power. presidents cannot totally change the nation on their own.\r\n\r\n\r\
    \n3. paul would likely support marajuanna legalization, same sex marriage, a reduction\
    \ in us military intervention, abolishment of the nsa spying program, and a reduction\

    \ her out somewhere, think ahead and choose something, make a tentative plan.\
    \ don't just make decisions to make decisions, but use what you know she likes,\
    \ and other info to make an informed decision. at the same time, you need to listen\
    \ to her opinions, take them to heart, and add those to your internal database\
    \ for future decisions. she does not want to be shut out of the decision making\

    \n\r\n jefferson thought that the american revolution was a spark that would ignite\
    \ liberty around the world. he advocated a worldwide awakening to \"the spirit\
    \ of `76\". this belief coupled with his natural francophilia explain his ardent\
    \ (sometimes radical) support for the french revolution even after it turned chaotic.\
    \ other founders were not so enthusiastic. france went a different direction than\
    \ the us, excluding moderate voices like lafayette in favor of truly radical revolutionaries.\
    \ \r\n\r\nall in all, i think the colonies proved that liberty could win, and\
    \ that big empires could be defeated and in so doing acted as a touchstone for\
    \ the french (who consequently used much of jefferson's advice in their early\
    \ assembly of notables) but ultimately each event had their own causes and sparking\
    \ moments. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n buy some cigars, grill some good cuts of red meat,\

    \ unattractive folks, everyone gets along just fine. we have mechanics, retirees,\
    \ a hooker, and a charter fishermen (among other trades). we are diverse ethnically,\
    \ we listen to different types of music, we have different religions but we all\
    \ get along. in my trailer park everyone is poor, but not ashamed of our poverty.\
    \ so we don't make much, we get by through brow sweat and elbow grease. \r\n\r\

    \r\n i do not think english as a major was a mistake. college was a mistake. i\
    \ have tons of debt, no job, and i am only now getting trained in a trade that\
    \ can actually profit me. many college grads are unemployed, while certified and\
    \ unionized allied trade workers have phenomenal jobs. college is not for everyone,\
    \ and do not let anyone tell you that you need to go to college to be successful.\
    \ you need to have skills to be successful. there are other ways to procure those\
    \ skills than college. trade school, apprenticeship, the military etc can all\
    \ make you *way* more successful than college and are way cheaper.. \r\n\r\n\r\
    \nit is something to think about. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n yup. american high school\
    \ kids are pretty much told that success= college. blue collar jobs are seen as\
    \ last resorts  by many. the truth is certified, unionized blue collar jobs make\
    \ phenomenal money. trade school is cheaper than college. employment is way steadier\
    \ and almost guaranteed in many areas. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i took all the basics,\
    \ focused on tons of english and lit courses. i went to college (worst mistake\
    \ of my life) for english, and i have been in the army for the past four years...\
    \ finally paying off debt. i wish i would have pursued trade school or an apprenticeship\
    \ after highschool, college only gave me debt. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\

    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i think it is significant that nearly every post 9/11 vet\
    \ in the house and senate is a democrat. nearly every veteran caucus is a democrat\
    \ majority caucus. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmost vets benefits were initiated by democrats;\
    \ the montgomery g.i. bill, post 9/11 g.i. bill.... and then uou have the so called\

    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nyou made some really\
    \ great points. i had never thought about how lower income people spend more money\
    \ on things that actually benefit the economy, while higher income people are\
    \ more likely to spend their tax cut on luxuries.. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ni am not entirely\
    \ sold on the idea of progressive taxes, but you certainly gave me some food for\
    \ thought to chew on.. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n politics are not allowed in /r/military\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n veterans overwhelmingly support republicans. it has been\
    \ this way pretty much since fdr.. as a veteran myself, i see many of my brothers\
    \ vehemently opposed to the democratic party because of assumptions about our\
    \ patriotism etc.. what message should our party extend to vets to let them know\
    \ we are looking out for them? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n the growth of a language as\
    \ an international language is an organic thing, not something socially engineered\
    \ by a board or anything. i am a native english speaker, and i agree that it is\
    \ not the best language for international business use, but it is not something\
    \ we can just change. it rose to power when the us spearheaded the growth of global\
    \ economy. the organic nature of things like the languages people choose make\
    \ it difficult to change. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i believe in a flat tax system,\
    \ where everyone pays the same percentage of their earnings in income tax. i do\
    \ not believe in a progressive tax system where richer people pay a higher percentage\
    \ than poor people. i am a working class democrat, but i do not see a progressive\
    \ system stimulating economic growth. it seems to me that it is punishing somebody\
    \ for making more money, making it more desirable to stay in the middle class\
    \ instead of encouraging people to work their way up into a higher class.. on\
    \ the other hand, i believe a flat tax based would be fairer. rich people would\
    \ pay more (because 15% of a million is higher than 15% of 35'000) but would still\
    \ be encouraged to leave their capital in the us economy instead of finding ways\
    \ around the tax code... can someone make a solid case for a progressive tax system\
    \ directed at a working class guy like me?\r\n_____\r\n\r\n *hello, users of cmv!\

    \n\r\n\r\n 1. when has he ever voted against his declared opinion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    2. which specific socialist policies?\r\n\r\n\r\n3. he is a social democrat not\
    \ a communist \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n if you think bernie is a communist you are\
    \ an idiot.\r\n\r\n\r\nhe is a social democrat. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n what about\
    \ sanders?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 1. would you vote for bernie sanders over hillary?\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n2. would you vote for bernie over rand?\r\n\r\n\r\nwhy or why not? \r\
    \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i named that legislation because you wanted\
    \ proof that he supported worker control of means of production.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
    \nit is more than a label, it is a perspective he actively embraces and one i\
    \ reject. if he really is the socialist he says he is, i worry about his end state\
    \ goals because i do not support the economic end state goals of socialism or\
    \ social democratism in the slightest. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ni would prefer a candidate\
    \ more in line with clinton's third way approach. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n it does\
    \ not boil down to this specific legislation, it is the outlook of socialist economic\
    \ policy. i just don't think i am comfortable supporting someone whose economic\
    \ outlook is that far left. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n first, that is the very definition\
    \ of a socialist, which he identifies as.\r\n\r\n\r\nsecond, [here is where he\
    \ actually presented legislation supporting it.](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/worker-owned-businesses-2014)\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n mostly socialist insistence on worker control of means\
    \ of production. my outlook on economic issues varies from his, i support a freer\
    \ economy with a strong federal infrastructure. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat being said,\
    \ i don't hate sanders. i totally support his stance on civil liberty, marriage\
    \ equality, foreign policy etc. i will also add that vermont has some of the most\
    \ lax gun laws in the nation, which i support as a second amendment loving democrat\
    \ (who said deep blue states have to hate guns?) \r\n\r\n\r\ni just don't know\
    \ if i would support him over rand, who has pretty identical views on civil liberty,\
    \ foreign policy, and the like but an economic outlook i am more comfortable with.\
    \  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n socialism's main goal is worker control of the means of\
    \ production.\r\n\r\n\r\nprogressivism is a philosophy pursuing a mixed market\
    \  \"third way\" economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere are some pretty strong differences\
    \ between the two. i am neither a socialist or progressive though. \r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \r\n\r\n registered democrat. i align more with blue dogs/new democrats.  \r\n\
    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n rand is not ron. i don't believe he would destroy welfare, state\
    \ education, the irs etc. his goals are more geared towards dismantling the nsa's\
    \ power, hopefully supporting marijuana legalization, and other civil liberties.\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n yes, i would vote for rand over hillary.\r\n\r\
    \n\r\n\r\ni would not vote for any other republicans, they are all gop establishment\
    \  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n [yes](http://nypost.com/2015/04/28/bernie-sanders-to-run-for-president-as-democrat/)\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n so in your opinion the only true populism is one in which\
    \ the party \"for the people\" remains exclusively revolutionary?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \r\n\r\n yes, i would vote for rand paul. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n in what way? what\
    \ information? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n depends which republican.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \r\n because i am not that far left. i am a moderate/centrist democrat. believe\
    \ it or not [less than half of democrats identify as \"liberal\"](http://www.gallup.com/poll/180452/liberals-record-trail-conservatives.aspx).\r\
    \n\r\n\r\nnot all of us are as progressive as sanders. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n do\
    \ you view the rise of syriza in greece as a good thing, or negative thing for\
    \ socialism?\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat about the rise of left wing populism of parties like\
    \ the citizens movement in mexico, and even candidates like bernie sanders running\
    \ for the u.s. presidency as an open left wing populist? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n i am an alabama resident currently stationed\
    \ in ny. so much for republicans sticking up for servicemembers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
    \n\r\n mine would be jim webb, though i know it is next to impossible. as a veteran,\
    \ i respect his service immensely, his centrism aligns with mine, his proven record\
    \ as senator  and secretary of the navy. i think he would make a phenomenal president.\
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n no, i did not \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \ 80% democrat, 37% republican \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n a government that does not\
    \ spy on me, start useless wars, and does not infringe on my civil liberties \r\
    \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n are the blue dogs still around? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ok.. i\
    \ didn't come here to argue about gun control. i do not mind background checks,\
    \ but i oppose legislation that tries to ban guns and magazine size. \r\n\r\n\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n yes, i am a sanders fan myself. but isn't he an independent? \r\n\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n\r\n i used to be a moderate republican with some libertarian leanings.\
    \ i have just gotten to the point where they have totally ran away from me. i\
    \ have voted democrat in the past, and am thinking about becoming a registered\
    \ democrat. i thought i would ask for advice finding a place in this party.\r\n\
    \r\n\r\n\r\ni support civil liberties totally. i support drug decriminalization,\
    \ marajuana legalization, and marriage equality. i support drastic immigration\
    \  reform. i consider myself a square deal democrat. i advocate for total transparency\
    \  in government, demilitarization of police forces, prison reform, and an end\
    \ to mandatory minimum sentencing. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non the other hand, there are\
    \ a few issues i worry would put me at odds with the democratic party. i do not\
    \ support gun control. i generally prefer the state to stay out of the markets\
    \ (though i am a not a rabid welfare hater or anything). \r\n\r\n\r\nwhat do you\
    \ say? am i at odds with the party? are there any factions/caucuses or anything\
    \ that i might be able to connect with? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n has anyone heard\
    \ of other vets joining americorps? i know many volunteers are fresh out of college.\
    \ i have been in war, been shot at, done army stuff, but i am looking for a new\
    \ way to connect with the world and serve. would i be out of place amongst other\
    \ volunteers? would my services put me at an advantage? i would really prefer\
    \ volunteering in urban areas affected by heavy gang violence, or something that\
    \ can really use my skills is there something like that? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\

    \ a 1984 media conspiracy, but i believe most of the media is bent way beyond\
    \ any hope of objectivity. the media is controlled by vapid and sensationalist\
    \ western culture. this is why guys like hannity, bill o'reilly, the reid report\
