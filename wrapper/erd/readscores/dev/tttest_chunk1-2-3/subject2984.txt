 Thank you for your reply, and no, unfortunately  I don't have any professional programming experience, I was thinking in starting to work on opensource projects to add to my resume but I don't know how valuable it would be, by any chance do you know any resources to strengthen my data structures/algorithms knowledge? I didn't really cover much about this at the university.

Thanks again for your time. 




 I have a Computer Systems Engineer degree in Mexico and I'm going to the US in 5 months, what can I do? 














 Hello everyone and thank you for taking time to read my question, so here is how it goes.

I graduated as a Computer Systems Engineer from a local university in my hometown in Mexico about a year ago, I'll be going to the US (most likely Houston) in a couple of months with my wife, my questions are:

1. Is my degree as a Computer Systems Engineer valid in the US? or do I have to redo the career?

2. What are the chances of getting hired by a company even though my degree is from Mexico?

3. What technologies do you recommend I go more in depth in order to land a job as quickly as possible when I go to the US(I would like webdev, but anything in the programming area is good enough, I have some knowledge in HTML5, CSS3, Python,C++, Visual Studio, and a little bit of Java)? 

4. At the moment I run a local business on computer repair, what can I do to add something valuable to my resume, since there aren't many programming jobs in my local town? 

Thank you again for your time.
