 Yeah, I understand Nolan's use of the terms. I thought you were asserting that Tesla is literally a magical spells-and-potions wizard in the film, which would be silly.

You make an interesting point about Tesla's "wizardry" being beyond explanation even by our standards--my interpretation was that while we are not privy to the mechanics of cloning, it does obey rational physical laws. This is in keeping with the film's articulation of the tension between ugly reality and blissful illusion as the nature of life, supported in Hugh Jackman's dieing monologue. I'll have to see how your reading stacks up next time I watch it.

 Tesla's a scientist, in real life and in the movie; if he's perceived as a wizard it's a result of the time he's in. The cloning **machine** is an element of science fiction, not fantasy. 



















 I agree with you on the point of the movie--there is no magic and we purposely avoid that fact--but I take the cloning machine at face value. What's important is that it is a scientific explanation within that world, even if it doesn't work outside of it. 



















 You know, I had similarly written it off until I read Hulk's thoughts on it; it really is an unusually relentless look at aging, wasted potential, compromise and lack thereof. I think some of its dismissal stems from how unpleasant it is to explore these themes, particularly for those of us who had or have some idealistic relationship to art a.k.a. the people most likely to watch arty flicks like Greenberg. We are its audience and the target of its criticism, which is why we've sort of collectively put it out of our minds. It's not exactly one of my favorites this year, but I'm definitely glad Hulk made me revisit it. 



















 This is *exactly* right, and it's exactly why the movie's absurd violent-mission-from-god premise and unwavering misogyny are so troubling.

are we saying that *wasn't* fucking absolute nonsense? 



















 Knowing scales and chord structure are crucial. Rather than trying to find every individual note every time, be conscious of your key and train your hand to follow natural chord shifts. 



















 that's strange, as learning how to play songs pretty much the entire point of Rock Band's pro mode. times change i suppose. 



















 Leboski is stupid the first time you see it and brilliant the second--it's a law of thermodynamics or something. 



















 The scene in which Willem Defoe appears alongside the protagonists in flashback is pretty cool. Literally everything else about it is complete fucking nonsense. 



















 I think it's very much a movie about storytelling--not story structure or craftsmanship, but simply what comes out when you turn on the creativity tap. This might be offputting to people expecting traditional narrative beats, but I think it works marvelously as an exploration of everyday creativity. 



















 Hmmm. So to recap, the commenter above me is upset because he/she thinks r/atheism is unfairly characterized as a circlejerk. I respond by saying it sort of *is* a circlejerk, which is especially problematic for a community that supposedly privileges rational thought. If you think my criticism is tired and worthless then so be it, but I'd argue that it's a tired and worthless response to an equally tired and worthless argument--of course there are plenty of assholes, of course there's great content buried there, of course r/atheism feels like it's being picked on. I would speculate that the karma discrepancy between our two posts has more to do with opinion agreement than discussion fostering; thankfully I don't care about karma. **When I read the OP's post, I didn't downvote it, I dashed off a quick rebuttal.** Which is also what you did; thank you for your reply, you're part of the solution, etc.

As for the actual worthlessness of my post, that judgement seems to be based in the idea that the problems it raises are long solved: you here point to the two debate subreddits; I was at the time unaware of them. Even if these subreddits *did* solve the debate deficit, their lack of visibility is problematic: r/atheism does nothing to promote these subreddits as an outlet, and as you say elsewhere, they're sorely lacking in content. I'd also add that it furthers an unhelpful binary of atheists and believers, which exacerbates the warlike upvote/downvote behavior; there are compelling arguments to be had *within* r/atheism about the personal and institutional roles of religion and what atheism should mean to the world at large. **So: if these subreddits *do* answer my issues, they're doing so poorly. But they really don't, eh?**

I therefore propose that my criticism stands; that r/atheism remains excessively homogeneous, that labeling and marginalizing dissent to separate subreddits isn't good enough, that a culture change is is in order. It's time for r/atheism to express itself not just in votes but comments, to answer critics rather than silence them. Yes, "hivemind" and "cirlejerk" are problems bigger than r/atheism, and **yes, I am unfairly holding r/atheism to a higher standard because of what it claims to represent.**

So rise to it, r/atheism. Keep your memes and opinion reinforcement if you must--it's worthless, it's junk food, that's fine, whatever. **I'm just saying, next time you feel like downvoting dissent, put it into words.** We can have a discussion. 



















 many kinds of fashion shoes? please, tell me more! 



















 yup, i hear ya. 



















 great call listing those two subreddits, they really ought to be linked in the sidebar!

On downvotes, I feel like perhaps you're making two different defenses here: first that r/atheism transcends downvoterism, then that maybe it suffers from downvoterism but that's not r/atheism's fault. As a regular reader and occasional commenter, I feel the latter is far more accurate, but that's just my opinion.

There is also the fact that pretty obvious/tired jokes and links get a whole lot of love, but that is of course subjective and again not unique to r/atheism. reddit is a circlejerk, really. 



















 pfffff I am the problem. Don't worry everyone, "the problem" has been isolated, turns out it's me, no big deal.

Seriously darling, I hope you don't think I'm bitching about Karma, because really, what the fuck is a karma. Can I eat it? Will it heat my home? Can I impress potential employers with it?

What's far more real to me is discussion. To the extent that reddit's karma system fosters intelligent discussion, hurray. To the extent that is stifles it, boo. Now shut up and kiss me you animal. 



















 well, I do think "central" is a subjective term; what Colbert takes to be central to Catholicism will be different from the pope will be different from outsiders. That is of course religion as personal rather than institutional, but I think that's as it should be. 



















 somebody almost immediately downvoted that post; I found that so funny that I downvoted it too. 



















 Colbert is a good example of positive theism, in my opinion--his Catholicism not only gives him personal happiness, it gives him personal responsibility as well. Good on him. 



















 Perhaps the charge of "circlejerk" stems from a lack of two-sided discussion? Opposing viewpoints are often downvoted rather than addressed, which not only makes the subreddit boring, but is somewhat ironic for a group that allegedly prizes logical discourse.

 here's the thing: when a religious person falls ill and accepts medical treatment, they know damn well that medicine is keeping them alive; they simply see doctors and medicine as a part of God's plan for them, perhaps a result of prayer. The kid did not learn a valuable lesson about how medicine works, he already knew that. Instead, he learned that atheists are petty assholes, and that is what any other person of faith would take from this as well.

 fair enough, and I understand that in initially failing to articulate my point I came off as a bit of a troll. the critic smartly characterizes this list as "20 films [she] adored," which is a great way of putting it that I can't argue with at all. And while I might cringe at some of these consciously low-profile inclusions and high-profile exclusions, on some level I'm probably just a bit jealous that *White Material* didn't play anywhere near me. 



















 Out of touch with wider cinema culture and how it reflects what what happened artistically and commercially in 2010, out of touch with what will be remembered from this year, out of touch with a number of very good films--some better than those included on the list--because limited or non-existent release was a prerequisite. And that's what bothers me, Winkyburger, when this form of art that I love is co-opted by people more concerned with exclusivity than quality.

And honestly, not trying to be a jerk, but I really don't know what are you arguing at this point. Are you saying that this list *is* a perfect expression of what happened in film 2010? Are you saying that it's not but we should pretend that it is? Please clarify. 



















 oh holy shit yes. 



















 you're insulted because I said that the indiewire blog's top 20 films isn't authoritative? that's silly, winkyburger. by all means, it can assert itself however it likes--and it does say "my" top 20 when you follow the link--but if I want to say that it's a bit out of touch then what difference does it make? Am I not furthering the discussion in doing so? 



















 Just pointing out that it's a bit out of touch--favoring minor Polanski over the Social Network seems a choice made in the interest of deliberate obscurity rather than reflection of quality, you know?

I'm more than happy to share my top 10, presented here in alphabetical order. It does, of course, reflect my wholly subjective cinematic values.

 oh i definitely agree that approaching Mormonism from both sides affords a  far *more* objective perspective than those simply within. And as I say, it's no slight on the group by any means. Just trying to be conscious of how r/atheism is perceived by rational outsiders, mostly. 



















 ha touch. but to elaborate further, this list might best be titled "20 Best Films That Didn't Play in Mainstream Theaters," or "20 Films to Impress Your Film Class." This list has some great picks, but it's not *the* List of Films 2010 by any stretch. 



















 I'll leave my panties as they are, thanks. I harbor no Mormon sympathies myself, but ex-Mormon is literally the opposite of objective. Literally! That's no slight on ex-Mormons or the vibrant and insightful ex-Mormon subreddit, it's just how language works.

If r/exmormon was a community of impartial observers with no preconceived notions or biases, then it would be objective. But it's not. It's a community of ex-Mormons, obviously. Literally the opposite! Literally! 

My point: to claim a viewpoint is objective just because you agree with it is disingenuous and intellectually dishonest. It's a small, trifling, intellectual dishonesty, and maybe you're cool with that and maybe you're not. I was just pointing it out. :)

 "For informed criticism of the Mormon church..."
"For insightful commentary on the Mormon church..."
"For ex-Mormons..."

I think those all work better.

 "an objective look at the mormon church" 














 This is r/atheism's description of r/exmormon. Every time I see it it strikes me that an ex-mormon perspective is about as subjective a position as possible--objectivity suggests dispassionate third party observation.

Just something to consider. :) 



















 Check out *I Love You Philip Morris*; its subject matter and distribution troubles largely relegated it to the indie crowd, but it's a great big crowd-pleasing comedy at heart. 



















 just noting that it is by no means *the* best 20 films--awful lot of lists this time of year, ya know? 



















 I would probably title this "*A* 20 Best Films of 2010," myself.

 yeah, Deuteronomy 22. Quoting or referencing some specific verses would make it more effective though--confused rape victims might not be keen to read the chapter in its entirety, so some specifics would make your argument more accessible for them. 



















 I came here to posit that 1975 feminist classic *Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles* is not engaging enough to be a viably political work. I think I may be lost.

 Any relevant, honest, principled counter-cultural movement doesn't oppose the "mainstream" simply for its status as such, only implicitly to whatever extent "the mainstream" perpetuates what they oppose. As long as a work is intelligent and uncompromising, I don't care what percentage of the population approves of it--Exit Through the Gift Shop is largely that type of work.

 You might be interested in Do The Right Thing by Spike Lee; wherever you fall politically, Lee is a filmmaker who often foregrounds his stylistic choices, making his films good candidates for this sort of analysis.

I'd also recommend the stylistically ostentatious and endlessly enjoyable works of Edgar Wright, though there's less likely to be much scholarly material available on him.

 guys, look, i'm not unaware of the Catholic authority hierarchy. I'm merely saying that Catholic culture and identity stretches beyond simple Vatican policy, and to declare someone uncatholic for her liberal understanding of the dogma is to misinterpret what being Catholic is in practice. Looking at the way Catholics live their lives in reality is a valid alternative understanding of Catholicism, and in my opinion a far more productive understanding than some purely theoretical Catholic ideal that's never happened. Honestly, I feel like my argument is being willfully misinterpreted at this point.
Also, good one on the 3/5. Catholics be sexist. :) 



















 I agree that their behavior doesn't change Vatican policy, but the point I'm trying to make is that for many Catholics, there's more to Catholic culture and identity than that. 



















 It is exactly what I'm talking about, actually. My point was that if for whatever reason a person identifies as Catholic, they are a small part of what Catholicism is. The word has no intrinsic meaning beyond what we give it, and people of the Catholic world have a right to the title whether they subscribe to the written dogma wholesale or not. I think you make a good case for what constitutes the Catholic belief system, but I think for many Catholics there is more to Catholic culture than that, and I certainly understand no wanting to give it all up. 



















 I hear you, but the fact that you still call these people Catholics shows that their behavior defines what "Catholic" means, don't you think? For many Catholics, that means negotiating their personal beliefs with those of the institution, and I'd argue that this negotiation is a big part of the Catholic experience--they don't just sacrifice their right to the Catholic moniker by virtue of their nonpapality, right? 



















 That's certainly one perspective, and it's perfectly defensible. For many people, however, the personal sense of community and identity that comes with Catholicism outweighs your subjective political reading of the situation, and that's fine. If her Catholicism has personal value for her, I respect that--especially if she's a good person. 



















 I agree that hierarchy has historically been a big part of Catholicism, but I do think that the power these individuals hold comes down to a matter of perspective. Popes and Bishops are hugely influential within the institution, but they don't get to control the culture--that's controlled by the traits and behaviors of Catholic people, and is in my opinion a valid reading of what it means to be Catholic. 



















 i knew very little about it when i first saw it, but the cinematography blew me right the fuck away. 



















 Words do have meanings, and Catholics get to decide what Catholic means. I'm of the opinion that if you're raised in the Catholic world, you get one vote. The pope gets one, a priest gets one, and this woman gets one as much as anybody. I understand the temptation to externally define a rigid Catholicism; it makes for a compelling good and evil narrative. For many catholics, however, the label is as much a matter of identity and culture as belief.

Some people raised in the church want nothing to do with this label: they see Catholicism as an oppressive, outdated institution and they part ways decisively--it is for them inconceivable that one could don the Catholic title, as that would amount to an implicit endorsement of the Church's entire sordid history. I have nothing but respect for that line of thought and mode of action, but I have just as much respect for those who stay in the hope of making their institution better. Some people are born into the Catholic world, and through family, friends and culture, are indelibly a part of that community whether they agree with the party line or not.

If someone wants to maintain her Catholic heritage and title while fostering a more liberal morality and outlook, I say that's one legitimate vote for a less dogmatic Catholicism, and one small step toward a more rational and empathetic world, faith or not. If this disrupts a "good atheism vs. dogmatic Catholocism" debate, then good. Any atheism that only argues against strict dogma will have very little application in the real world; any non-traditional believer who begs a real-world argument can only elevate the dialog.

 "Most highly educated and professionals in America are white"
White people have more access to higher education, yes. There is a higher percentage of white people employed in stable middle class jobs, who are thus that much more suited to give middle class advantages to their children, yes. And as America perpetuates class divisions by continually affording more opportunities to those born and connected in privileged positions, this will continue to benefit whites and exclude blacks, yes. Thing is a) I don't exactly blame black people for this and b) this is far more an issue of class than race.

"Someone broke into your house?"
Yes, actually, someone really literally did--i live in a kind of shitty neighborhood. And it was a trashy white guy I knew as a kid, who ended up selling my laptop for drug money. But as a sane and rational individual, I don't assume that this is characteristic of white people. Again, this is far more an issue of class than race. Have you ever met a middle class black man who owns a gun and smokes crack? I haven't, but I know a fair number of lower class white guys who fit that description far better.

"Chicken or the egg, my friend, the chicken or the egg."
Well, except that there's an abundance of evidence for severe and violent American racism as the inciting factor here. Your accepted wisdom that blacks commit more crimes is rooted in that, which leads well-meaning but ignorant police to enforce the law on black people disproportionately until disenfranchised lower class black people no longer see white American law as a benefit to the community. We can see this in effect especially when we look at racial sentencing discrepancies and the shameful unreliability of cross-racial eyewitness testimony. I'm sure we don't disagree that racism happened in this country, and it was pretty severe--where we disagree apparently is that you think it's done and the onus is on blacks now, while I think the legacy of racism is shaping law enforcement behavior and cultural acceptance of stereotypes to this day--evidenced, quite frankly, in the fact that you take blackness as a given indicator of criminal intent. And I'm sorry, Fatties, but if that's not racism, what is?
I don't like these realities, but my method of affecting change is not strictly instructing black people to be better, it's to address a larger system that leaves a certain class--and by correlation, certain races--with limited options.  



















 well we're entirely on the same page there. good talk. 



















 i didn't mean to ignore it, and i think your assumption is probably justified: when people talk about disliking black people, it's reasonable to assume they're working with the same negative stereotypes you associate with the word "nigger." my only point was that the girlfriend's prejudice and the use of the word "nigger" are both based in the same ugly stereotypes, and that the connection is symptomatic of how we're conditioned to associate these things racially--and i do think that in keeping the label "nigger," we to some extent perpetuate that conception of racial stereotypes.

i hope i've not been inappropriately confrontational, by the way; i do understand that you're fundamentally arguing for evaluating people on their individual merits. your original post invited logical debate, and i'm glad you were up for it.

 right. but the fact that she said black people and you said nigger means that you made a connection. and of course you did: when we think of racism against black people, the word "nigger" is a big part of that history. but it's pretty disingenuous to pretend that word exists outside of its racist connotations and history, frmlol. i recognize your good intentions, but relegating fear of black to people to fear of "niggers" is not productive in breaking down harmful stereotypes; the fact that the stereotypes of "nigger" sprang to mind even though the word was never used is a testament to the strength of that detrimentally race-specific connection.

it's not that i "can't comrehend" the nature of language--and that's a bit of a condescending conjecture, darling--it's that communication is rooted in reception as much as intention. the word "nigger" has a history, frmlol, and whether one intends it or not, the word's reception is necessarily colored by specific racial subjugation and violence.

And if a white guy ran into grand central station yelling "nigger," the word would carry its history of race-specific violence even there. And whatever the guy was trying to express--probably craziness, as you say--he would be invoking a nasty set of stereotypes tied to a brutal and painful history. There might be some people who freak out like the straw man described above, but for my part, i'd just quietly think it was unwarranted and kind of trashy. And that's what I think pretty much every time I see or hear the word, frmlol.

*edited to include middle paragraph, i don't think your full post was available when i started the reply. 



















 "I don't associate nigger, a negative term, with black people." I think that's where I and many others have trouble with this line of reasoning, frmlol. This poster's girlfriend did not say she fears "niggers," a word which has been continuously invoked in the comments here. She merely said she's afraid of black people. The fact that you're comfortable assuming she means "niggers"--your word, not hers--proves the association.

Ultimately, that's why these detrimental stereotypes continue to exist: because people make these racial associations whether they're conscious of it or not. 



















 "it is normal for Whites"
what, niceness? you think most white people are nice? and everyone who's ever done something mean to you, those were all non-white people? you've never been mistreated by a white person? or, perhaps, maybe you're only race-conscious when non-whites are involved...

"however, the stereotypes usually aren't inaccurate and actually reflect reality."
people are more diverse within divisions than across them, fatties.

"Blacks commit more total crimes and proportionally more crimes than Whites, therefore people are more often to be afraid of Blacks than Whites."
Another fun reading of this is that black people get arrested more than whites, thus fostering a healthy, logical distrust of historically racist law enforcement and perpetuating a cycle that racist white people must ultimately answer for. 



















 the word for that "attitude" is loaded with a history of racial subjugation, torture and murder. it is derived from the latin "niger" and spanish "negro," both of which literally mean "black." while i don't doubt your good intentions, use of the word "nigger" in this culture is inherently race-specific and only furthers the stereotypes this poster is trying to combat.

 Neofaust, I'll preface this comment by saying you're probably better versed in this stuff than I am and that I will likely cave under the slightest amount of pressure, but it doesn't make sense to me that post-modernism can somehow eschew definable "essence" and yet claim so many self-identified post-modernists--perhaps not so much in serious literature, mind you, but around the campus so to speak. Kids identify as "post-modernists," they're largely united around criticism of truth and obsession with constructs... couldn't we call that the movement?

Personally, I enjoyed the submission because I can relate to the author's frustration: I'm sick of arguing that logic is not only the best interpretation of reality, but it's a prerequisite of any arguments against itself. I think science should be a component of art and vice versa, and am sick of their increased "post-modern" segregation. I'm frustrated with the arguments I'm getting from my English department full of undergrads *calling* themselves post-modernists, so isn't indulging a parody of these trends somewhat justified?

I guess the question is--and maybe you can help me on this Neofaust--do I have a beef with post-modernism, or with "post-modernists?" I think I agree with you on what post-modernism *should* be--a transitional nebula of modernism criticisms--but it's being organized, revered, and evangelized by a certain social strata of trendy youngsters and it's irritating. And ultimately, I'm pretty sure that's what this Jenny Jones submission was about: this label is a source of pride and identity for many, and yet it's not much of a movement at all.  



















 I mean, you can either choose to engage with the discussion or not, but calling it *lame,* perhaps literally the most shallowly trite of all possible dismissals, certainly looks like a defense mechanism. I'm not trying to psychoanalyze and I'm not saying I know anything about you or that *you* are shallow or whatnot, I'm just saying that I'd love to see your reservations better explicated.

 Comedy works when it addresses truth. If a joke is genuinely reinforcing misogyny or racism or other baseless bigotry, then it's not only unacceptable but probably not all that funny. If a joke is crafted to deal frankly and/or critically with the presence and absurdity of such hatred in society, then nothing is off limits.

 Yes darling, I read it. The writer is saying that beyond objectively appreciable gameplay elements, Dead Space 2 transcends the sum of its parts to succeed as an engaging work of game art, thus necessitating acknowledgement of the critic's subjective position. Accepting that the game works on that level and was presumably intended to, the author clearly states his intention to address the game primarily in terms of impact, as is common practice in film and literary criticism. The author chooses to do so in his own voice: this likely precludes the review from consideration for traditional print journalism as it ignores established journalistic conventions--the ignorance willful and the conventions largely arbitrary, mind you--but it's perfectly suited to the author's intent. The more one explores a variety of authorial styles through criticism of multiple media, the less strange this choice will seem. Ya snob. 



















 It is a "comment" on the sudden wave of uninformed writing criticism, one I felt would work best in the same format as the trend I was addressing: a submission about writing. 



















 (before edit) This really has nothing to do with gaming.

Well, it has about as much to do with gaming as the line by line red pen critiques popping up. It's more to do with the nature of game criticism, and that seems to be hot right now.

As for the propriety of posting it as its own submission, I think this perspective merits as much space as the condescending review edits.

Yes, that seems strange to high schoolers. Clearly. But acknowledging one's subjective position and focusing on impact over summary doth not bad criticism make. 



















 I don't think that Cartesian skepticism necessarily endorses the cognitive *over* the physical, it merely accepts consciousness as our necessary starting point. The existence of the doubter could just as easily be physical as metaphysical; the main point is the potentially physical but quite definitely subjective nature of the mind. 



















 Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww 



















 Good and evil are human constructs, but they're real and valuable constructs nonetheless. 



















 the trick is... is that conclusion false? 



















 Love is blind, God is love, God is blind. 



















 I'm not sure that that holds up--eat is a much different verb from is.

All wolves *are* deer-eaters and all deer *are* grass eaters is a rewording of your submission according to the rules of the premise, and as you can see there are no two terms in common there.

 Personally, I think the worst critics are the neutral, predictable, boring ones. White's a lot of things, but at least he's none of that. 



















 Hey, as long as he's handsome, British, and smooth as hell then that's what counts. Contemporary Britain isn't strictly white, and Bond needn't be either.

 Best Philosophy Podcast? 














 I'm a bus rider, long walker, and student janitor; I need some decent philosophical discussion to pump into my head. What's your pick for best philosophical podcast? 



















 Ricky Gervais is the Animal Collective, specifically. And I happen to think he's a bit pretentious. 



















 This was exceptionally well shot! 



















 Assuming sympathy for both of them, this is one of the more beautifully sad sentiments I've seen on reddit. 



















 Hey, a reasoned case with examples from the film instead of a blanket statement about critical consensus! I support this.

 There's a difference between between denying absolute morality and denying all morality. If you have any personal, subjective moral positions then use those in conversation--that's what morality conversations are for anyway.

If you literally have no morality whatsoever, then their assessment of your psychopathy is correct, so just roll with that.

 Yeah, I came here to bitch about how this sort of thing isn't going to further sensible dialog in any way.

Then I looked at the picture, and it's pretty uncanny. I even got an awkward shock chuckle out of it.

 I'm realistically compassionate for him. Anyone who thinks this matter will be settled with an execution is ignoring the real problem, that we do need better mental health awareness and destigmatized care for those suffering.

That said, he committed a heinous crime and deserves trial and sentencing. His mind is broken, yes, but he is his mind and deserves to be held accountable.  



















 I feel like people aren't talking about this film's style enough. I'm a big fan of how the film marries the first-person subjectivity of the camera to the borderline omniscience of the internet; there's a lot of potential for narrative innovation in that pairing, and I think it's something we're going to see more of in the future. 



















 Fun Fact: this was the first standup concert film ever to play Sundance. There's not too much going on stylistically, but it's definitely a movie.

 Right, but why do people actively write in bold all-caps and use a bunch of weird faces? I feel like Reddit could make more visually appealing content by accident; is it just a pleasure of recognition thing? 




 Why are memes so ugly? 














 Everything about memes, from layout to content to font, seems tailor-made to repel viewers. Do netdwellers simply lack design sense? Is it a 4channy attack on mainstream sensibilities? Why Reddit? Why do we produce and consume ugly things all day?

 [Hey Jude](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEKgYKpEJ3o) by the Beatles--hear me out now. With the band falling apart and Yoko in the picture, [John always understood the song as a message to him,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hey_Jude#Inspiration_and_writing) and I do think that's there in the [lyrics](http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/799/), whether conscious or not. Both lyrically and musically, it's about evolution--listen closely, the texture changes with every chorus, every verse, every measure of the coda. Emotionally, there's the simple, heart-wrenching background vocals of the verses, progressing to the triumphant finish that never really ends, just keeps progressing until it's inaudible. To me, it's a beautiful expression of love between friends even as they grow apart, and more generally a quite moving appeal to always keep moving.

 I'm not sure what the philosophical question is here, but here're some thoughts:

* You can be attracted or unattracted to whoever you like, but it's probably worth considering where your opinions are coming from before making generalizations. Are you comparing men or women of the same social status? If not, are you factoring non-biological factors into their attractiveness? To what extent does media representation affect your perception of a race? If you see a bunch of pretty women waking down the street together and instantly gravitate to the blonde-haired white one, then that's your attraction and it's fine. If you're simply saying that whites are pretty, then it's worth thinking about how culture has represented white and black to you.

* Economic status is a far more valuable indicator of criminality than race. Black Americans are disproportionately incarcerated because they're disproportionately born into poorer circumstances, and have been throughout American history--that's overwhelmingly how this cyclical capitalism thing shakes out. Add on a history of institutionalized racism in enforcement and sentencing, and you have a set of statistics that says far more about American politics than it does biological race.

* Intelligence is partly genetic, partly social--genetically advantaged children in poor environments are less likely to perform well on intelligence tests then their peers in more privileged environments. This is the case regardless of race, but is again more visible in black communities because of a history of cyclical socioeconomic marginalization.

* Extrapolating any of these social descriptors to make a statement about biology is at best ill-informed; to then fallaciously correlate social generalities with an individual's biology as criteria (sole or otherwise) for employment is ridiculous practically, wrong morally, and racist in every sense of the word.

Regardless, it's preposterously rare that any major decision can best be made based solely on a person's race. Let's leave the definition of racism as it is, and get to know someone before making either descriptive or prescriptive statements about them, eh? 




 Who thinks karma per post would make for an interesting stat? 














 It'd be a little more indicative of poster quality than grand totals over varying membership lengths, and would incentivize more thought for every post. What do y'all think? 



















 Oh, the *verb* fancy. I read this as the adjective fancy like five times, and thought you were pretty weird. 



















 ... yes, and? 



















 this was a response to that one, actually. pushing it I know, but the last line was too enticing to leave hanging. 



















 Read this as ex-juggalos, was thoroughly intrigued.

 Just finished listening to this. Nearly justifies the film's existence in itself. 



















 I'm not even a dubstep guy at all, but that was sick. 



















 Impossible? Oh. Well fuck it then, I guess. 



















 Soft science maybe, but it's at least testable, falsifiable, reproducible, all that good stuff. Modern psychology is fucking physics compared to all the old Freudian shit. 



















 Oof. This is where somebody--might as well be me--points out that psychoanalytic academia is a bunch of pseudo-scientific conjecture, and is considered pretty laughable by anyone who takes the scientific study of human thought and behavior seriously. Just something to consider. 



















 I personally think Nietzsche's sex/gender politics were ass-backwards, and see no reason to privilege his opinions on the matter. 



















 Good thoughts. I'd like to clarify that I don't mean abrasive as a negative term, and the fact that it is so far removed from the Top 40 sound--deliberately so, in my opinion--is kind of cool. I call the music stupid because the lyrics are stupid, and that's fine. Sleigh Bells is a dumb pop band, and it's cool because I also like dumb pop music.

I'm only responding to the assertion that hipsters are uniquely qualified to cut through all the dumb stuff and consume art of the finest caliber. No. Hipsters like dumb shit as much as anyone else, they just like anti-popular dumb shit. And that's good and it's wonderful and I love dumb shit, and I even kind of like Sleigh Bells. I'm certainly not hating on Sleigh Bells fans, I'm just saying that the group has more in common with Train than Leonard Cohen. 



















 penis. 



















 That's, uh, not really what the comment was about, but yeah, I'll stand by my assertion that Sleigh Bells makes some dumb music--it's kind of fun I guess, I'll sing along if I'm drunk or something, but the music is inarguably pretty stupid. The abrasive production is a fairly extreme reaction to Top 40 production, so yeah, it speaks to the anti-pop kids and gets shoved into car commercials with all the other melodic indie music, presumably because the songs are vaguely recognizable and the rights are cheaper than John Mayer.

But seriously, that's really not what the comment was about, and it's totally fine that people like Sleigh Bells, and I'm seriously not being condescending because I like a lot of stupid shit myself.

And if you're on my lawn, quit creepin. 



















 Johnny, you wrote a wordy examination of hipsterdom and put brackets in the title. Of course you're a bloody hipster. ;)

Regardless, I'm not saying that people shouldn't listen to and enjoy Sleigh Bells any more than I would discourage someone from listening to U2 or Coldplay: whatever cynicism or commercialism goes into the songcraft, people have real emotional connections to "With or Without You" and "Viva la Vida" and, uh, "Rill Rill." My point is that whatever personal motivations you or anyone else might have, I find that hipster and non-hipster playlists tend to line up along a popularity binary moreso than a binary of authenticity. 



















 The thing is, hipsters aren't even all that good at sniffing out bullshit: they reject massively popular artists not because of finely honed hipster anti-bullshit powers, but because the artists are massively popular. That's where the "I like the early pre-popularity stuff" mentality comes from, and it's why hipsters will latch on to some [seriously stupid shit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zXTsmJU6_s) as long as it's radio unfriendly.  



















 Right, because she's totally sane in every other sense. 



















 childish fucks. 



















 This is one of those things that I just try not to think about because

* it's dumb as hell and basically makes fun of itself BUT
* someone out there put some effort into it
* someone like my mom would probably buy it 



















 Honestly, I see where he's coming from and sort of agree. Try talking to one of those postmodern kids for a few minutes. 



















 Seriously, don't care if I like the group or song or whatever, I report that shit as spam. 



















 ***I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE YELLING ABOUT!*** 



















 I think I'm confused--what does ownage mean again? 



















 Not just between levels, but within levels. They'd assemble different components separately, portal them together for a sense of how the level plays, then put them in practical space for the finished product. 



















 I nominate comic sans. 



















 Yeah, I definitely agree that that's the in-world explanation for it, but that doesn't stop it from having meaning. Robots offer a neutral third party perspective on human life, so the fact that they see orthodox art as such a shallow thing is definitely a statement. Keep in mind that the game didn't have to engage "art" for any narrative reasons; the fact that they did and that they opened the game with it is significant, in my opinion. 



















 Yeah, definitely. His whole world and persona is pretty out there, obviously, but I give a lot of credit to J.K. Simmons for throwing himself into it and hitting the emotion dead on. [It is a pretty harrowing arc: success, downfall, death--happens to everyone.](/spoiler) 




 "This is art." 














 I'm going to get a little pretentious here, but one of my favorite moments in Portal 2 comes early on, as the computerized voice presents a rote painting and classical music as "art." I love that the game opens with this--it's a great caricature of orthodox art appreciation, and it satirically portrays that sort of tradition as shallow, utilitarian nourishment rather than anything transcendent. More importantly, it's an implicit call for better art: if we believe that art *can* be something transcendent, it follows that we're being asked to look beyond the stuffy traditions parodied toward new and more inventive forms of expression. Video games, perhaps.

With that in mind, what are some of your favorite "art" moments in Portal 2? Stuff that hit you emotionally, engaged you intellectually, filled you with frustration, satisfaction, anything. Did you share that moment of harsh surprise when you accidentally destroyed the radio and cut "Exile Vilify" short? Do you take Aperture's history as a satirical depiction of capitalist progress, a mechanism far more successful at perpetuating itself than improving human life? Were you moved by the operatic ending, all the more beautiful for it's absurdity, just like everything is? I'm probably getting a little carried away here, but I do think that the game is deliberately addressing a conversation on what art is in that opening scene, and I'd love to hear your thoughts on if and how it succeeds as a work of art itself. 



















 Yeah, that kind of ruined it. 



















 Nosferatu! 



















 Holy shit homeless. Ultimate confinement vs. ultimate freedom. 



















 I look at that, and I get freaked out about the universe. Like, it's a genuinely disturbing image for me. 



















 If a person is logical, sane and respectful, then they have my admiration. If they are otherwise, then they do not. Extenuating circumstances always exist, but you said you'd be *proud* to see this kind of thing in your child, and I'm disagreeing. If you're a dick, then at best it's understandable. If you're better than that, I applaud you. Simple as that.

Which brings me to the kid being a dick to his grandma. I'm not calling him a holistically shitty person, I'm not asking for his head, I'm just pointing out that he's introducing a little bit of pain into the world for no greater cause than the reinforcement of his own values. That's nothing more or less than self-righteous dickishness, and that's what I'm calling it. Nothing in my morality demands that I sugar-coat that. 



















 I'm not sure that I follow, Antonivs. Are you saying that rational, respectful disagreement is a "fantasy?" Yikes. I happen to know that it happens, because it's my preferred method of engagement with the faithful--if you genuinely don't think it's possible, I encourage you to just try it some time.

As to my alleged hypocrisy, I think I'm being pretty consistent and clear: there are commendable ways of pursuing and perpetuating rational truth, and trolling Granny ain't one of 'em. 



















 If my son or daughter came to me and logically, sanely, respectfully broke away from my beliefs, I could really only be proud of them.

But if my kid is being a self-righteous dick to my religious mom just for giggles--especially when she's just worshipping some loving inclusive God who gives her comfort and whatnot--I have no respect for that and would be sad, yes. 



















 HA! It's funny, because there's a little more sadness in the world now!

 I remember thinking a few things walking out:

* This was funnier than the Hangover.
* I didn't really care for the Hangover.
* This wasn't very good either.

 It's supposedly based on an actual experience some kid in r/atheism had, but its status as a meme and the [comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/gru0l/to_argue_is_futile/c1pt31x) it's eliciting over there are kinda messed up.

 Upvote for the laugh, but I'd just like to point out that sometimes simple art can be the most effective.

I was raised Catholic, and a large part of having faith is pushing the possibility that you might be wrong out of mind. Though I was fond of the song as a teenager, I was afraid on some level that if I fully engaged with Lennon's message--just imagine, just *pretend* for one second that this is really it, and *feel that in earnest and then tell me what's good*--that I wouldn't be able to switch back to believing. Sure enough, that's pretty much what happened; it was a long and complex process obviously, but Imagine was certainly part of it.

I can see how it might seem trite to those who take its principles for granted, but it really is a powerful statement for those who, however intelligent they might be otherwise, really never imagined this stuff. 



















 Hmm.

* Nothing in the definition personhood supports your implication that it is incompatible with individualism. If you're redifining personhood, I invite you to clarify your definition.

* Individuality is not sponsored by society, but is rather a necessary component of our unique individual consciousnesses. The identification with a collective presupposes individual identity, as that is where consciousness occurs. It isn't a binary, it's a spectrum: one's identity is informed by the collective and by the self in varying degrees, but it's preposterous to claim that one can exist without unique individual identity, or that the collective is made of anything other than individuals.
* None of your claims support the assertion that individuality cannot be a humanism.

If you feel I misunderstand or misrepresent you, I invite your to clarify further, and to provide any context that might be necessary to support your claims.

 Nintendo has never been too progressive on pioneering new media. I expect them to use Blu-Ray without licence, call it the Nintendo High-Density Optical Drive or something, and be the last company to transition from physical media. 



















 Every person has some attributes that are uniquely theirs, some attributes that are shared within their culture, and some attributes that are shared across humanity--it's literally impossible to be purely individualist or purely collectivist in the sense that seems to be assumed by this blog. Furthermore, consciousness only occurs in individuals--while we might imagine an outsider looking in at the void and even try to empathize with such a perspective, we do so from within our individual consciousnesses and cannot experience anything else.

I'm an individualist in the sense that I recognize these realities and in that I value difference as enjoyable and necessary for progress. I am a humanist in the sense that I believe unique individuals are capable of empathy and kindness in spite of their differences, and in that I value reason and ethics as means to a widespread public good. How are those terms mutually exclusive?

 Michigan resident here, and my impression is that it doesn't matter if the video is commercial or not--if it's journalism then you have some leeway, but otherwise you need consent to publish. 



















 If you're not in public and you're publishing it, ordinary people have the right to their own image. For kids, the parents would have to approve the use of their children for the video.

It's certainly not child fucking pornography, and the rhetoric against him is fucking infuriating, and the fact that he can't be near children is fucking ridiculous, but consent should have been acquired for the published use of the children--it's no bigger or smaller a crime than that.

 The description is fine for now, but it'd be nice to see the subreddit have its own identity rather than simply existing counter to r/philosophy. The term "chan-decay" is sort of married to the meme world in itself, and if cogitoergosum is going to have staying power it should lead with its uniquely defining features, whatever they end up being. Also, I still like r/philosophy and think it has a nice balance of humor and depth--I'd rather subscibe to both and see them compliment each other than exist against each other.

If that's not it, are you using two instruments at once, i.e. guitar/vox, keys/vox? if you're signed in on multiple profiles, even just a guest, then that will be one of your band mates, and you'll have to make unique customs for that profile.

The order of your stand-ins determines their instrument--swap their placement, and they swap roles in the band.

 I think that our greed for reward and recognition are the origins of seemingly altruistic behavior, but that we're [capable of developing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kohlberg%27s_stages_of_moral_development) intellectually toward something approximating genuine selflessness. 



















 I wasn't aware of L'Hpital's rule, thanks for introducing me!

My brief research suggests that /= an indeterminate constant, since that equation might express different rates of infinity. That said, I think that for the purposes of Zeno's paradox, we can assume that these infinities progress at a rate equal to whatever ratio we use in our other subdivisions--that doesn't necessarily equal 1, but it will match a constant speed, which speaks to the point I was trying to make. Is that a fair assessment? 



















 I feel like Zeno only accounts for one side of the equation; if you look at it as percentage of time over percentage of distance covered, you can't halve one without halving the other, which maintains the ratio for a constant. Infinity is weird, but if you infinitize the bit on the bottom, it really does add up to a sensible number when you account for the top: /=1

 There are a lot of problems here. The film's mythology consists of a lot of silly and arbitrary rules, the script often oscillates between over-explanation and cheese, and the Bureau member characterizations are distractingly inconsistent.

That said, I liked the movie. Matt Damon kills it, the central romance worked for me, and most importantly, the film engages with interesting notions of choice, and ultimately delivers a smart and fairly distinct perspective (thematic spoilers): Usually, we allow our circumstances to define us and keep our choices within a predictable trajectory; "free will" in the classic sense is possible, but requires us to push back against our circumstances pretty damn hard. That's the sort of ambition that I like to see in movies like this, which is why I'm willing to be pretty charitable toward the Adjustment Bureau. 







































 The theist posits that there is a "God" with some baring on human life, but fails to provide a coherent definition of God or indeed the slightest bit of evidence for its existence. A good skeptic has no time for such baseless assertions, and is therefore not a theist--they are rather a non-theist, an *a*theist, to use the popular prefix. Atheism is nothing more or less than that. 



















 Great video. I'm reminded of how even as a populist entertainer, Chaplin was widely credited with many of the innovations that led early cinema to be recognized as a serious medium of art and expression; seems appropriate that his work should be paired with similarly ambitious games.

 While your friend is oversimplifying things a bit, I do see where he's coming from and largely sympathize: there are huge segments of modern philosophical thought that either ignore or directly attack the scientific method as a useful avenue for obtaining knowledge. I think this stems from  insecurity about sharing or ceding the discipline's historical position as sole harbinger of truth. Philosophy enthusiasts either consciously or unconsciously try to ensure its continued relevance by downplaying science, and in return hard scientists become increasingly hostile toward the discipline of philosophy. In my opinion, this is harmful toward both fields of study.

Unfortunately, it seems that this simplistic liberal arts vs. sciences binary keeps popping up everywhere. r/philosophy is littered with complaints about r/atheism. There's an all-too-common assumption in this subreddit and, in my experience, wider liberal arts academia that one can end a debate by accusing someone of "scientism" or "positivism" or "empiricism," in much the same way that Fox News employs "socialism." It's embarrassing.

None of this is to say that science is beyond question; indeed everything of value should be questioned. But the thing is, science loves to be questioned, *demands* to be questioned, and employs a rigorous system of empiricism *and* rationality to ensure its own accuracy. The pure skeptic could call this a closed loop, but at that point they've argued themselves back inside Descartes's head. That is undoubtedly a crucial point in anyone's philosophical development, but there's so much more to the human experience when we step outside into the "real" world, and use science to further our asymptotic progression toward understanding what "reality" is.

Anyway, your friend and I are hardly alone in feeling this way. I highly recommend [John Searle's U.C. Berkeley course on Philosophy of Mind](http://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/philosophy-132-001-spring/id438307693), downloadable on iTunes; Searle has a special talent for contextualizing modern scientific developments against the history of philosophy, and, in my opinion, cutting through the bullshit. The future of philosophy *is* married to science, and vice versa.  



















 I'm interested in this too, particularly for Hulu. Anybody know any solutions on that front?

 I subscribe to both subreddits, I've seen a lot of interesting content and stimulating discussion in both, but fuck fuckity fuck does it piss me off when r/philosophy goes off the rails into this post-fucking-modern anti-"scientism" bullshit. There are genuinely only two possibilities here:

1) "Foundationalistic, verification empiricist-heavy" research, while imperfect, engages with universal truths that exist independent of human thought to the extent that any contradictory manmade "truths" are inherently false

**EDIT**: I thought it might be kind if funny--and, full disclosure, pretty honest--to argue the antithesis of the O.P.'s point with a comparable level of rage and frustration. I have now been downvoted.

Seriously though, if you're arguing for an understanding of truth antithetical to science, then you're arguing for a philosophy with no baring on the the human experience or indeed any other component of the decidedly law-based universe, so you might as well just floobley fuck woopty zoop. 



















 That's what I mean--I used to think of G4 as a solid niche network, something I could flip to and see something fun, something I was actually pretty pumped to have on my cable package when I lived in a college dorm. Now it's fucking Cheaters and Cops.

Seriously, is it worth drawing the half-hourly ratings bump of the crowd that actively seeks out Cheaters if it compromises the network brand so badly? Any network heads misunderstanding their target demographic this badly should be fucking fired.

 When I was pursuing *my* useless film degree, my first feature script was a deadly serious, deeply personal disaster movie called "The Ground is Lava." It involved a self-centered stand-in for my self-centered self trying to stave off nihilism while futilely trying to engage with other human beings in his world as God and the Devil fought each other until they both disappeared in a fit of pointlessness, and also the ground was literally lava. I knew that it was dumb as soon as I finished it, but that didn't stop it from being any more devastating when my unbacked-up laptop was stolen from *my* disreputable living quarters.

Needless to say, I can relate to Jason Segel's early situation as well.

But you know what? I love film, and I love my own stupid self, and I fully plan on loving the stupid no-budget revision of "The Ground is Lava" that I still intend to shoot sometime in the next year or two, because fuck it. 



















 Yeah, I got a whole lot of "Have you met Ted?"s before ever seeing an episode of the show. 




 TIL Jason Segal wrote the Forgetting Sarah Marshall Dracula musical as a serious, unrelated project while desperately trying to launch his career.

 "Better" is obviously a subjective word. My point isn't about the number of tracks in their library, but rather the sonic and emotional breadth of it. Whatever stimulation I might want out of music--emotion, melodicism, creative orchestration, sonic experimentalism, nostolgia, rebellion, dance music, heavy music, light music, humor, misery, joy, etc.--there is always a segment of the Beatles' catalog that I can turn to, and mine is hardly a unique experience. The Beatles were capable of and accomplished more than Win Butler, and don't really see a debate to be had there.

Again, you can like whatever you want, but it's silly to say that the suburban-angst-on-loop music of Arcade Fire can stand next to the Fucking Beatles Discography--it isn't even *trying* to accomplish the same thing. I like "Wake Up" and "No Cars Go" as much as the next guy, but come on. 



















 In their ten years of existence, Arcade Fire have written three good to great albums of melancholy baroque pop.

In the Beatles' ten years of existence, they wrote all of the fucking Beatles' music.

Like whatever you want, but your opinion doesn't make their anthologies comparable. 



















 If a song needed a standard rock and roll drum pattern, Ringo would play it.

 There is a politics to his distaste for Transformers, particularly in the creepy way that the camera ogles commercial products, destruction and women in the same pornographic fashion in what is ostensibly a kid's film. He sums it up nicely in [this showstopping review](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g__bQ-Y7D8Q) of the second one. 



















 When reduced to the quantum level, the laser has no direction. There is a range, yes, but the absolute simply isn't there.

I've always known that quantum particles behave differently, as I'm sure everyone else does, but this video just made the point real to me that it doesn't just appear that way because of an intrinsic limit on our knowledge. There is a threshold over which absolute truth does not exist. 




 TIL that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle doesn't just limit our knowledge of quantum behavior, but that the information provably doesn't exist.

 Your interesting point on this complex issue is somewhat undone by

I read a survey recently, I forget where

Lucky for you, I backed up your claim with a quick google search; the survey I believe you're citing is in the "Motivated for Others" section of [this link](http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub179.pdf)--you might consider bookmarking that for future arguments.

Thing is though, it's wrong to assume that soldiers' personal motivations are antithetical to "the right thing," at least in their minds. Most soldiers I know enlist because they receive personal benefits by (to their mind) serving society, much like a doctor makes a ton of money by treating illness. Your implication that the average soldier is fundamentally self-serving is severely undermined by the article I believe you're citing, as the overwhelming majority of soldiers are on the record as valuing their squadmates' lives as much if not more than their own; whether or not you see that as "principle," it is undoubtedly selflessness.

You and I are in almost total agreement on the practical realities of our military's role in the world, but the fact remains that the vast majority of enlisted servicemen and women believe they are doing good. If your worldview and argument are based on a conception of the typical U.S. soldier torturing and killing civilians for personal gain, I invite you to examine the ways in which you yourself may be a victim of ideological indoctrination. 



















 Also, it doesn't follow the new character capitalization rule of screenwriting--it's not a hard law or anything, but the Dark Night script certainly followed it, even going so far as to capitalize emphasized props. I suspect we're looking at a transcript.

 Regardless of how you or I personally feel, it is a divisive issue in philosophy of mind, as evidenced by my links above. If the subjective experience is a form of knowledge, it is literally the only form of knowledge that is inherently inarticulable, which to my mind does make it worthy of linguistic segregation, or at least specificity. 



















 Well, now that the fantastically silly "science is lying to you" answers are out of the way, what you're talking about is [qualia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia), perhaps best summed up in the ["What Mary Knew"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary%27s_room) thought experiment. It's my understanding that there's no clear consensus on whether or not qualia constitute a form of knowledge. I personally consider the outsider with research and data to have "more" knowledge on the subject, but that may change as we begin to better understand consciousness. 



















 Ah yes. I remember watching your audition, and thinking "yup, he's a redditor."

How did the process of arranging your own backing tracks work? Did you just give them a track to play, or was there some kind of involvement from their music department? 



















 Whatever your personal journey has been, I'm genuinely happy for you that you've arrived at something you consider happiness and enlightenment--I was raised Catholic, I can relate. My point is that beautiful snowflake that you are, we're all beautiful snowflakes here: it's the philosophy subreddit, we're *all* pretentious assholes who view the world in terms of invisible social influences. Instead of writing like a cult leader and spreading your words across subreddits 'cause you're just that important, try engaging us as fellow thinking people. Don't try to enlighten us, try to relate to us. I suspect we've got more in common than you think, and arrogant pricks that we are, we don't like being talked down to. :) 



















 I don't mean to sound like a dick, but the self-important prose, deliberately obtuse multi-subreddit format, and general air of enlightened superiority revealing heretofore unknown thruths make this post really fucking annoying.

 Prompted by "fuck basic courtesy." I just give people the argument they seem to want. 



















 Yup, it's proven to be pretty dubious--again, beautiful sentiment, but it seems fairly disingenuous to attribute it to Aurelius. I just believe people should check the toilet for purple ass unicorns, so to speak, so I'm satisfied. 



















 No, It's an example of a falsifiable claim presented as a belief, made without evidence. Try taking some of that effort you're expending trying to be clever, and maybe route it toward actually keeping up with the substance of what we're fucking talking about. 



















 Oh for fuck's sake. This same quote gets voted to the top of the subreddit  every few month, *and every single fucking time* nobody can point to the passage this is allegedly from. The closest passage that invariably comes up conveys a sentement that is *almost entirely entirely at odds with the factual fucking semantics* of the quote above, namely that we needn't fear because gods are undoubtedly real and just. The quote above is a lovely fucking sentiment, but if someone is going to claim they know something about this topic and say "yeah that sounds right," *it's completely fucking reasonable to ask for a citation.*

Also, "opinion" has nothing to do with this. If I say "I believe Star Wars is a good movie" that's an opinion. If I say "I believe purple fucking unicorns are flying out of my ass" that's something else entirely. The second relates to an independent truth or falsehood, and therefore my beliefs are irrelevant to whether or not the statement has value. If I say I have purple fucking unicorns flying out of my ass, and somebody notes that there's not one shred of evidence that purple fucking unicorns are flying out of my ass, and *flying fucking purple ass unicorns get voted to the top of the atheism subreddit multiple times per year without ever giving so much as a purple ass whinny or neigh to prove their existence*, then my belief statement is entirely worthless until I can finger the exact corner of my asshole that shits purple ponies.

Also, speaking of assholes, you are one. I know you're just gonna absorb that into the take-no-prisoners truth teller self perception schema you've got going on here, but seriously, it's not cute. Grow up. 



















 Well, that was a pain in the ass to read. 



















 So to recap: a wishy washy fact is voted toward the top, but because the poster *knows and acknowledges* it's wishy washy, that means that anyone who wants citation is a "dickhead." This is a "truth" that trumps basic courtesy, and it's a "truth" worth defending three replies deep into this stupid thread. Yes? 



















 For us, calling people dickheads without warrant is just not very nice. If you think morality requires citation, I know some theists who have books for you. :) 



















 Citation is needed if the comment is to carry any weight. By including his credentials, he lends the "maybe" statement more credibility than otherwise--it reads as a credible statement of fact, even if he does hedge his bets. That means that it's worth evaluating as a true or false factual statement, and that citation is required for such evaluation. None of which implies any wrongdoing on mrBWB's part, just that his popular comment conveying an unconfirmed fact would be more valuable if cited.

Regardless, no need to call mleeeeeee a dickhead.

 I think the difference is that the scientific method is built to weed out the bullshit--even if nonsense slips through, it can't have much of a legacy without review, testing, duplication and modification, a process which nonsense cannot withstand. In my experience, the humanities have unfortunately been far less open to structured, methodical criticism, largely because major segments of thought seem to be wrapped up in the idea that there is no truth. Try telling someone in my former English department that you're a logical positivist, they'll look at you with pure condescending pity before ignoring everything you say.

 Fair enough, though I think that the fact that they had no expertise was pretty much the point. It's one isolated incident, and it's then left to us to critically examine whether or not similar propagation of trendy bullshit is happening elsewhere. My personal distaste for the anti-science strains of postmodernism notwithstanding, I think that it's always worthwhile to be reminded that reason and substance *should* trump authority and fashion, even if that's not always the case in popular thought. 




 In 1996, physicist Alan Sokal wrote an article proposing that quantum gravity is a social construct, satirizing post-modern attitudes toward science. It was published as a legitimate theory on the basis of his academic credentials and mock fawning embrace of popular thought. 


































 No, actually, fuck everything about this post and the fact that it gets a positive reception here. 1) This is not a gender-specific behavior, and 2) it's fucking ridiculous to address this criticism to *all* women. This is completely fucking sexist, Reddit, and also completely fucking embarrassing. 




 Solo Live Beatles Tracks for DLC? 














 I was just wondering about the likelihood of ever including solo Beatle performances of Beatles songs as DLC -- Lennon's 1972 ["Come Together,"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHJAZZTTXiw) Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh version of ["Something,"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSTIg08bguk) McCartney's many excellent live versions of ["Hey Jude,"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVJMhnPzhts) ["Helter Skelter,"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV18scOsX54) etc. I know they have different licensing then the studio Beatles versions, as they often appear on music sites that don't stream original Beatles songs, and these songs deserve to be played with pro keys parts. Other Lennon and McCartney tracks have appeared before, so why not these? Do you think there's any likelihood, and would anyone else be interested?

 I was with you up to the Beatles diss. Songwriting skill married to genuine boundary-pushing experimentalism resonates with me regardless of its time-period; arbitrarily loving or hating music for its age is equally dumb on both fronts.

 I appreciate and generally agree with your position BossOfTheGame, but *you're* the one taking "be a man" out of context here. Ardenfrost was using it in while specifically addressing the gendered father-daughter relationship, so his use of the gendered "Man" is appropriate. He isn't ignoring cultural influence on gender perception, he's responding to it--I can't help but wonder if you even read the comment.

Beyond gender, "Man" implies adulthood, which is essentially at the root of Ardenfrost's statement. There could be and have been countless similar meditations on how motherhood informs womanhood; that's actually a topic that informs large segments of feminist theory.

On a personal note, BossOfTheGame, your baseless insinuation that nmoyer12 and Ardentfrost are willfully ignoring some hidden socio-structural truth that only brooding philosophers like you are privy to makes you sound like a pompous ass. I don't know you, you're probably nice, but that's just how it reads.

 How do software companies profit from free web browsers? 














 I've noticed that companies like Google and Microsoft have been spending  pretty big advertising money on pushing their respective browsers. What's in it financially for them? They don't have any ads that I can see, so do they make money on extension licencing or something? Are browsing histories being monitored or monetized? Is it just a ploy to get people to accidentally use Bing?

 It does occupy a very interesting space. Even the title has a touch of race consciousness to it: taken on its own, white castle sounds a bit like caucasion paradise or Anglo estates or something; appropriate, as the two minority characters navigate white-dominated American culture. Call it a coincidence, but given the facts that the rest of the film *is* visibly race-conscious and that they could have easily chosen any other restaurant, I do think there is a deliberate political statement in there. 



















 I'm sorry that you feel that way, takeheed. If it helps, my point was not that anyone was downvoting because they disagree with you, but that we likely already accept the expressed opinion as established fact to the extent that it doesn't really add much to the conversation to reiterate it. 



















 **Observe and Report**: while many wrote it off as a Paul Blart Mall Cop copycat, the movie is a pitch black satire that owes more to Taxi Driver than Happy Madison. A lot of movies glorify delusional underdog ambition, conflict resolution through violence, and shallow sex objects as love interests. Observe and Report renders those typically unchallenged values entirely pathetic, absurd, disturbing, and hilarious. You may need a fairly dark sense of humor to appreciate it, however: I was literally the only person laughing in my theater.

 MDC is a perfect example of the complete *opposite*: they employ strong language to assault those in power, *not* to pile on the oppressed.

My problem is not and has never been this fey "ooh a bad word" shit I seem to be accused of; the fact is that these words, in this order, in this context express and promote, at best, ignorance, and at worst, bigotry. 



















 Yeah, I'm aware of the AIDS crisis, thanks. Leaving my panties out of the equation, an artist has a uniquely privileged voice. They can use that voice to stick it to anyone they want. In this song, Axl Rose used his voice to stick it to the mistrusted and downtrodden, the disenfranchised, the *literally dying and beaten minorities* around him. I never knew about it, I shared it, I think it's interesting in its own unfortunate way--I come down on the side of "Fuck him then," but other than that, it ain't that deep. 



















 Axl Rose has every right to express his frustration in any form he chooses, but if his most artful songwriting strategy is to rail against "niggers, immigrants, and faggots," then that's ridiculous and pointlessly hateful and fuck him, personally.

In [responding to the song's controversy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_in_a_Million_\(Guns_N%27_Roses_song\)#Controversy), Rose stated that his "pro-heterosexual" stance (his term) was based on "bad experiences" with gay men--in that light, his claim that "faggots [...] spread some filthy disease" appears to be based on hateful generalization, which is literally exactly what bigotry is. He has since gone on the record listing a handful of gay or bisexual individuals who he admires, and good for him if his position has evolved, but that neither explains nor excuses the song.

On his use of the word "nigger," Rose has paradoxically claimed that nigger doesn't mean black (bullshit) and later that he was only referring specific black people who were trying to rob him (more bullshit). I charitably suspect that he's a bit of an idiot 



















 Explain. 



















 By that standard, literally every idiotic thing ever expressed is art simply by virtue of its genesis in real life. That doesn't make this song commendable, effective, or good in any sense.

Personally, I'd prefer that nigger and faggot *weren't* casually tossed around all the time, but that doesn't mean I support censoring the words from artistic usage. I simply think that as used in this song, they express and encourage self-righteous ignorance. Art or not, I'm hardly a simpleton for calling that bigotry.

 A Question about Rhapsody in Blue 














 I'm considering using a selection from Rhapsody in Blue for a film I'm working on, abut I'm having a hard time figuring out who owns the rights and how far they extend. Composed in 1924, it's a public domain piece almost everywhere in the world except the United States. It has some kind of copyright extension here, but I'm not sure if that applies to specific orchestrations or all variations generally.

Ideally, I'd like to arrange and record my own version of the piece. Does anyone have any experience or resources on the issue? 



















 Not exactly, but they may be able to fake it. The "film feel" isn't so much about literal frame rate as shutter speed and motion blur--simply halving the number of frames won't fix that. It's certainly possible that they can digitally *synthesize* the film feel, but that would be an added special effect rather than a recovery per se. 



















 Credit where it's due: "Walking Away" is certainly a classier title than "I took a picture of a hot chick's ass!"

 using logic *is* the same is fundamentally rationalist. that's [exactly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism#Background) what it is. 



















 yes I am. Wikipedia on epistemological rationalism: "any view appealing to reason as a source of knowledge or justification". I said rational, I meant rationalist, apologies if that was confusing.

Science draws on rationalist components like mathematics, adds empirical experimentation, and spits out rationalist generalization. Empiricism is part of it, but rationalism is too. 



















 Correct. The scientific process draws on empiricism *and* rationalism. 



















 Science certainly draws on Mathematics though, and the process of generalization is an equally Rational pursuit. To claim that science eschews rationalism is patently absurd. 



















 Agreed. And that's one of many reasons why it's stupid to dismissively characterize scientists as exclusively empiricist.

 Yeah, I'm familiar with what the term is supposed to mean. I just mean that the community is pretty hostile to *allegations* of white knighting, and generally rightly so. Where some people (sometimes fairly) see immaturity in the perceived lady honor defending, it generally seems like the white knight accusers are part of a far more troubling and idiotic wave of nerdy misogyny. "What? You want me to stop making fun of this chubby fourteen-year-old posing at comic con? Pfft whatever White Knight, I didn't know she was your girlfriend." No. Fuck that. If someone is being patronizing in their defense of somebody's honor or whatnot, then call them on it. "White Knight" brings nothing to the conversation.

I take umbrage with the suggestion that the term "white knighting" is somehow integral to Reddit overall. Reddit isn't full of "white knights," nor is it full of people who oppose "white nights;" it is, in my tiny little experience, full of people who think the phrase is idiotic and downvote accordingly.

None of which is to say anything about you personally, Gareth--I generally agree with most of the points you make. I have not, however, ever seen the simplistic reduction "white knight" used in a productive, insightful, or even particularly accurate way on this site.

 One thing to consider is that the cocks will probably come out clean, whereas the fetuses could potentially be a bit soupy. If the cocks are too large or too dry, however, that might cause bleeding, so maybe soupy is better.

 Interesting perspective; the need for an efficient cause seems like a modern take on the [Cosmological Argument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_argument). Just to clarify, why is it assumed in this theory that God *does* preserve the cosmos? It's always been my understanding that the universe is [expected to collapse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_fate_of_the_universe) at some point. 



















 Great to hear, I'm glad your faith brings you so much positive fulfillment! I'm intrigued by your description of God as "conscious"--acknowledging your proviso that it's based in personal experience, can you explain a little bit about what you mean by that?

 Great, thoughtful response. It seems reasonable that any "God" would be something beyond human understanding.

My question, if I may: what happens to God when our understanding improves? If there is a definite God beyond the threshold of our comprehension, then it seems like perfect hypothetical understanding of the universe would prove its existence. And yet, for many people, knowing and comprehending a "formula" for all existence like you suggest would be the ultimate triumph of atheism, as there would be no higher power than that.

So: is it *conceivable* that God could exist once we have full knowledge of the universe, and if so, what would that God look like? If not, can God be said to exist at all? 



















 Ah.

 It's been a couple years since I took PSY 101, but my memory of it is this: we spent a day or two on the history of psychology--ancient philosophical perspectives, Freud's popularization, the welcome switch to scientific methodology with behaviorism, the current cognitive revolution--and then spent the remainder of the semester learning about what we know and how we know it, because that's what you do in a science class. Freud had no evidence to support his claims, and thus had nothing to offer us beyond a single powerpoint slide on history day. Science classes are under no obligation to present every truth claim as equally valid; that would be terrible terrible terrible terrible science.

As for the word science, you're willfully using an antiquated definition. For those of us speaking in post-Aristotelian terms, the scientific method is, via [Oxford](http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/scientific%2Bmethod?q=scientific+method), "a method of procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses." This does not apply to all pursuits of knowledge, but to the very specific pursuits of scientists. Freud lacked systematic experiments and testable hypotheses, therefore his work is not science.

With respect to post-modernism: you have never met a working scientist who feels legitimately threatened by it, and you never will. Post-modernism will keep on bloobly dooping through subjective truths and stoner woo bullshit until it fizzles out within the next academic trend cycle, and science will keep on exploring the cosmos, developing medicine, advancing technology, and studying real, fundamental truths about the universe and our place in it. Call me dogmatic--seriously! do it now!--but I'll make damn sure that my art, philosophy and ethics can coexist rationally with testable, rational scientific thought... you know, real life. 



















 Well, first thing's first, you've accused me of distorting the past three times now, and it's simply never happened. I said Freud was influential. I have no history of or interest in obscuring that fact. But whatever his influence, he has no place in the science classroom.

As for your other claims, you seem to be mixing epistemology and science interchangeably. Epistemology is the study of truth, Science is a very specific pursuit of truth through testable hypotheses and rational extrapolation. Freud pursued truth through theory, scientists pursue truth through science, and I'm not weaseling any linguistic marginalization into the discussion by saying so--that's just how language works. I don't use the word science because it implies superior authority or anything, I use it when discussing the *specific* thing that science is. Freud, for better or worse, has no right to claim scientific authority if he doesn't participate in the stuff of what science is, and he didn't and he doesn't.

As for the whole Empiricism vs. Rationalism debate, that whole contrived conflict strikes me as perhaps the greatest hypocrisy in post-modern thought: while the post-modern kids claim to be breaking down unjust binaries and redressing linguistic marginalizations, they do so by turning *every damn conflict* into the same damn simplistic binary they think they're railing against--hell, the name "post-modernism" is a fucking antithetical. The fact is that whatever the Philosophy and English professors might think, there are not roving gangs of rationalists and empiricists attacking each other in the streets.

On the contrary, rationalism and empiricism work quite harmoniously together in, drumroll please, the scientific method! Science loves rationalism *and* empiricism! They're two great tastes that that go great together, and when you combine them in science, they have a 1:1 correlation with reality outside the classroom. That's far more than any abstract unprovable theory can claim. 



















 If you think making shit up doesnt play a huge roll in science **today** then you should stay the fuck away from science, because you obviously cannot understand the role insight and intuition play in generating hypotheses

 .
Must be testable? Sorry, but you are trying to place your modern conception of science into the **past**, and that just reeks of bad historigraphy.

.

You seem to be the one mixing eras here, singdawg. All I said was that "science today," your term, needs to be testable; Freud's "making shit up" approach doesn't have quite the clear-cut legacy in modern thought that you were implying. If you're saying that Freud is/was a scientist by virtue of his era's lowered standards, then fine--I don't see how that matters outside of a history class, but whatever.

And if you want to put Freud in a history of thought class, then go for it. But if you want to put him in a science class, then you're promoting regressive, outdated pseudo-science. I don't really see a debate to be had there. 



















 Freud was a highly influential theorist, but a scientific hypothesis must be testable, the end.

Mass Effect presents a world where victory only comes with a tinge of guilt and regret, and it's all the more resonant for that.

 I'd just like to chime in that on a purely aesthetic level, the monoliths occupy a two dimensional viewing space more often than not. Beyond their physical presence in the film, they take on the role of complete, inscrutable obstruction for the viewer, much like the mind might respond to knowledge that advanced. 



















 Unless it's a documentary, every film has its own diegesis. Boondock Saints exists in a world where God Almighty demands street justice, untrained vigilantes are effective killers through mimicking bad television, and straight men are attracted to Willem Defoe in drag. This is not real life.

The fact that this movie and others exist in a clearly fictional world is what makes the vigilante action justice harmless and acceptable--most action movies do a far better job of justifying their killing, but whatever. The *only* reason that the paltry, unsupported criticism is included is for the purpose of taking the film's action diversion into the real world, and that's where it goes from fluff to message movie. 



















 And if you made a movie with all sympathetic characters bashing gays, then portrayed it as a fifty fifty split public issue, it'd be just as backwards as this shit fucking movie. When you take a *fucking crazy backward position* and stage it on equal footing with its sane, rational antithesis, your lending backward bullshit legitimacy that it doesn't deserve. The real-life popularity of any issue is not and has never been my point. It's like when people say Obama is a Muslim: that is an *insane* position, and anyone who frames the issue as a one to one ratio controversy is elevating the batshittery undeservedly, whether consciously or not 



















 Sure. The penguins are one-dimension characters written for the sole purpose of being punished, and the brothers *know* this because *God* tells them, so they are thus free to rape them all without due process. It's fine for a dumb movie, it's psychotic in real life, it's as crazy as ever to contextualize such actions as a legitimate arguable public position. What's your point? 



















 I really liked the gay angle until they *did* make it part of the plot, sticking him in a dress and making him punchline. Unfortunate. 



















 that has nothing to do with it. If somebody makes a movie about a bunch of heroic characters raping penguins, then ends in pseudo-documentary footage of a 50/50 split on the issue of penguin rape, then it's totally fair to attribute some sort of penguin raping agenda there. I don't know how many people are actually pro-murder *or* pro-penguin rape, but the fact that it's portrayed as an issue of public debate is clearly an attempt to lend the discussion some legitimacy. 



















 The fact that the movie even thought there was a debate to be had was insane. In real life, killing strangers because God told you to is fucking nuts, the end. If everyone agrees with them--as every sympathetic character in the film to that point had--then it's a goofy fiction. When it's portrayed out of nowhere as some sort of controversial issue, it's clear that the film misguidedly thinks there's an argument to be had for killin' all the bad guys.

 Criterion's occasional mainstream releases often help finance their Euro/art offerings, and have the potential to spread awareness of the company's mission to a broader base.

 While a very interesting and detailed read, I don't think there's much evidence that Caden committed suicide. The film is obviously surreal and obsessed with death, but it doesn't seem to be governed by anything so concrete--relatively speaking--as purgatory. My two major objections:

1) Caden dies at the end. I would argue that exploring a confused, subjective and decidedly purgatorial life and death is a simpler, more elegant and more meaningful reality for the film than literalizing that purgatory and necessitating an unfocused set of rules for leaving it. Basically, there's no sense in killing the poor bastard twice.

2) There is no afterlife. This film was conceived as a horror film, and deals with all the worst fears a man like Caden can suffer, right up to the permanent disintegration of his tortured but solipsistic ego. Death is absolute, impersonal non-existence, and that is why it is terrifying.

 LPT Request: how to theft-proof a laptop? 














 A few years ago my laptop was stolen, and it was pretty devastating. I quickly learned the value of backing up important files, but does anyone have any free/low-cost tips for physical laptop tracking and creating comprehensive backups on a multi-hundred gigabyte level? 



















 *shhhhhhhhhhhh!* 



















 I think it was a house of cards built on illogical and implausible scenarios, I think it violates its own logic throughout the movie, and it panders to the audience with cliche "chance" situations.

Oy. That's a different disagreement entirely.

Ah well, stalemate it is. I've done my best to provide some examples of this movie's unique qualities as differentiated from similar films, but there's nothing to be done about different, subjective reactions to the film's objective novelties. I *will* invite you to consider how your own favorite "original" works fare by the standard you're applying here, but I do concur that we'll likely not agree on *Looper*. 



















 Losing a hand is one thing, conscious ongoing torture of a future person through mutilation of their past self is quite another--by the same token, time regulation is one thing and time travel as an exclusively criminal enterprise is another as well. All time travel movies will have some things in common, much the same way that all Westerns or slashers do. A creative genre picture is measured by what the author does within those parameters. 



















 Where, if I may ask, have you seen the torture and dismemberment through time travel scene before? That's certainly a watershed moment. :)

I would also be interested to know where, if anywhere, you've seen the organized use of time travel for criminal executions, which is of course the sci-fi premise that distinguishes the movie. The only thing I see that Looper and *12 Monkeys* (1995) or *Frequency* (2000) appreciably have in common is time travel.
 



















 To be fair though, you can make literally everything this side of *Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat* sound derivative by reducing it to its broadest elements. The implied gore of the disappearing fingers, the completely unexpected curve into horror territory, the brutal simplicity of the executions, the little things like the Rainmaker's henchmen wearing the same clothes as the character on the poster on the young boy's wall. For me, it adds up to one of the most clever, surprising movie-going experiences of the year. 



















 I wouldn't be terribly surprised to see an Original Screenplay nod, that's where the edgy/creative movies go.

 You're not *universally* wrong, but it's worth exploring how systemic socio-economic pressures shape perception of such opportunities, how effort toward "self-improvement" offers vastly different pay-offs depending on one's starting lot in life, and your own role in the cyclical, real-word social climate propagated through the trite dismissal of the disadvantaged as "lazy."

 I believe in plain speaking, foolishnesss. What does "look up Lisa Ferentz" mean? Her institute doesn't appear to offer a Master's program; are you saying that you know her personally, studied under her, or are actively pursuing a trauma certificate?

Regardless, it seems that we're talking past each other. You're describing a hypothesis, and I'm saying that there's no evidence for it. This is compounded by the testibly valid prevalence of false memory--something we both appear to acknowledge--to the extent that "recovered" memories, being indistinguishable to the subject from false ones, should bare no legal, medical or personal weight without objective corroborating evidence. 



















 You know, like a masters level class...

What, is this a hypothetical? What is your Master's degree in? What department was this class in at what university? Have you taken this class? Who was the instructor, and what are his/her credentials? 

With regard to your questions:

A) Compare the memory to the objective facts. *Conscious* memory has proven time and again to be surprisingly malleable; "repressed" memory has yielded no provable information to my knowledge. Citations to the contrary are welcome.

B) The brain is a magnificent organ, but it's understandably not great at gauging its own accuracy. Simple as that.

The description of repressed memories as things people "think they think" is reasonably accurate. We code our memories in fairly broad strokes, and unknowingly update the context and details in accordance with our changing understanding of events. When the friendly policeman or the authoritative Freudian suggests that the subject was abused by Satan, he/she slowly and unwittingly updates their memory to comply with their evolving perspective. 



















 I don't know what "counseling class" means, but my understanding from five or six psychology courses over the past few years is that A) there's significantly more testable evidence for fabricated memories than there is for repression, and B) *if* repressed memories exist, they're not reliably distinguishable from fabrications, and are therefore not useful in any real sense.

 If getting optioned in the studio system is the goal then I don't disagree, but you can follow whatever rules you want if you produce independently, which is fairly feasible these days. Study and criticism are hugely important to any creative endeavor, but breaking the rules doesn't have to mean "you're doing it wrong, rewrite" if you're willing to make a film yourself and good/lucky enough for it to make an impact on somebody. :)

 One which didn't conflict with the clear, unambiguous depiction of him sitting in the cockpit four seconds before a nuclear explosion--I realize that people are saying it's a temporal shift or something, but that would be an unprecedented break from the film's established editing style and would be jarringly out of place. As it stands, Bruce either deliberately killed himself in spite of having fixed the autopilot, or is a god. Those last thirty seconds are an unfortunate bit of nonsense capping an otherwise incredible, amazing film. 



















 With respect to your addition: coercing someone into driving drunk *is* morally wrong by the exact same standard, and one could easily imagine a situation in which the coercer is found liable for wrongful death or guilty of manslaughter, particularly if they're sober. While conceivable, however, the idea of a sober person coercing a drunk person to drive for their own selfish interests strikes me as so uncommon as to be negligible.

 Fair enough. I would still point out that Man *does* imply adulthood relative to Boy, which is the context Ardenfrost initially used it in. Also, I didn't mean to use the "pompous ass" label as an argument for or against any specific points, just as a friendly personal note on the tone of the discussion--that's why I separated it from my content-based arguments with "on a personal note." :) 







































 It's truthful, though, which to some people is the highest thing a film can aspire to be. It's okay not to like it, but that doesn't make it bad.

 Hard core truegaming answer time. In film and narrative theory, there's a school of thought that **meaning** is found in **excess**. Basically,that means that the bare bones of story have a limited ability to *say* things, and that the substance of a work is in what you layer on top of the story--the excess, if you will.

The literal textbook example of this is the work of a director named Douglas Sirk: he almost exclusively made melodramatic "woman's pictures" with fairly basic stories, but he's commanded a cult/academic following for the decisions he made in terms of color, pacing and composition--innesential to story, but crucial to how his films are interpreted. A more modern example is Quentin Tarantino, a filmmaker who's essentially made a career out of excess: broken down to their narrative elements, *Pulp Fiction* and *Inglourious Basterds* are fairly simple stories. What makes those movies memorable are the things that have nothing to do with story: the visuals, the side conversations, the allusions and music cues, *that's* where the personality, the meaning and the substance is--in the excess.

With Nintendo: at this point, the Mario template is an established narrative: jump on bad guys, power up, get coins and save the princess. The meaning of a Mario game then, is in how it delivers and diverges from that formula. I make the case here for *Super Mario Galaxy*: the plot is the same as every Mario game since the 80s, but the *excess* is a bizarre, sublime and surprisingly thoughtful abstraction of human exploration of the cosmos: gravity, our Newtonian rock in every Mario game ever, now varies with context. Representations of infinity are introduced: if you run forward in any other Mario game, you'll eventually hit the boundary of a level; run forward on a sphere in space and you'll just keep running. In terms of narrative excess, we have nothing less than [a living universe of star stuff lovingly experiencing itself, transforming, and being born again.](http://www.mariowiki.com/Rosalina's_Storybook) The Mario template is the means of delivery; the meaning is the stuff of *Tree of Life* and/or a particularly poignant acid trip, and it's a particular Nintendo brilliance that so much of this cosmic exploration is conveyed through the ever-evolving game mechanics.

All of this is to say, I couldn't care less about "new IPs." If new characters and settings are the best method to convey a new game idea then that's wonderful, but there's something enormously powerful about allowing beautiful games to draw from and engage with established stories and settings. You can overwrite Mario through a convoluted narrative arc, you can give him a dark backstory and complex human emotions, or you can tell a different story--a universal story--by running, jumping and coin-collecting through a whole new universe.

 [Here's a post-RBF Scotty song called "The Hilarious,"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdUaxsccTo) well worth checking out. Also, his side project album *[Better Bookends](http://grooveshark.com/#!/album/Better+Book+Ends/285653)* was a formative one for me--Scott's still one of my favorite voices, I'd love to see him record more. 



















 I loved *This is the End*. The last scene was funny, but it didn't really match the tone of the rest of the movie--it would have worked better about thirty seconds into the credits, with the "official" ending being the ascent, that way it could still be included and get laughs without detracting the darkness of the rest of the movie. I guess that's not a question. Anyway, great job, I'm looking forward to your next directorial work! 



















 Well, that's pretty obviously not the point. Printing guns with intent to sell or supply to others is the far more logical territory covered here, and I think regulating that is perfectly reasonable. If you print a gun off the grid for hobby or sport, and someone else, with or without your permission, uses it to kill people, you should bare some legal responsibility.

 It's exactly that sort of equivalency that is fueling much of the Obama criticism, I think. Many on the left are eager to appear fair-minded and non-partisan and such, so they're attacking Obama with the same vehemence they did Bush. That certainly doesn't apply to all Obama critics or all liberals, but it is a phenomenon that I'm noticing in my personal circle. While this sometimes results in some silly comparisons--most of the administration's failings fall short of 9/11 and the Iraq war, in my opinion--I generally respect the impulse.

That said, the OP's point stands that people should be engaged in legislative races if they want to change anything. I think that a really good presidential candidate could get a lot done by consistently reminding people that there are other big races, and spreading awareness of platforms and records in the legislative arena. The old, statistically borne out adage is that American's hate congress but love their congressmen; I think people on the national stage who really care about change should address that as much as possible.

 Reddit, what scares you more as an adult than it did when you were a kid? 














 I mention this because I was just thinking about Edgar Allen Poe's "The Raven." When you're a kid, the prospect of a talking bird who only says one thing is at best creepy and at worst silly. As an adult though, the prospect of the answer to every question being "nevermore, never again" is kind of terrifying: at some point, "never again" applies to everything in life and everything beyond it; it's pure, true, universal horror, and the more you think about it the scarier it becomes. Are there any other things like that that become scarier with maturity?

 Oh my fucking god you are impossible. I am sorry I try to avoid getting angry on the internet because I know it's stupid but I don't even know what the fuck point you're trying to make. You've switched your wording from "personal" to "private" information, but that was never the fucking conversation, Jesus *Fucking* Fuck.

**HIS *PERSONAL* INFORMATION, INCLUDING NAME AND FAMILY FACEBOOK PAGE, WERE SHARED AND UPVOTED IN A THREAD ABOUT TERRORISTS, DIRECTLY CONTRADICTING THE RULES OF THE [THREAD](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1cmtub/fbi_released_photos_of_suspected_boston_bombers/), THE [SUBREDDIT](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/), AND [REDDIT AS A WHOLE](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE TO SUBSTANTIATE A CONNECTION, AND IT DIRECTLY LED TO HIS FAMILY BEING SAD AND CRYING FOR NO REASON. THAT IS BAD AND THE PEOPLE WHO FACILITATED THAT SHOULD FEEL BAD. THE END. GOOD DAY TO YOU SIR.** 



















 [The Boston PD did no such thing](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/04/it-wasnt-sunil-tripathi-the-anatomy-of-a-misinformation-disaster/275155/)--please read that article before proceeding. There is no evidence that the Boston P.D. ever named him as a suspect in public or private; please let me know if my objection is within the bounds of your comprehension now. :P

Incidentally, one of the users running the live update thread was actually banned from /r/findbostonbombers for his vocal stand against Sunil. When some random sourceless twitter user fabricated the Boston P.D. accusation against him, the anti-Sunil O.P. released that information instantly, accompanied it with the [Ron Paul "It's Happening" gif](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vpE6uMJ37dk/UOScrne47aI/AAAAAAAAEL4/Ki-4IWO-SoY/s1600/ron-paul.gif), and left if up for at least 20 minutes or so. The information spread from there, and the brave new instant crowd-sourced media became a joke. In case you couldn't tell, I was very disillusioned with the whole process.

As for the rest of your objections, you still seem like you're just trying to be difficult, but I take you at your word that you are not. It seems obvious to me that appearing in an unrelated news article a few months ago does not exempt Sunil from Reddit's privacy policy, that his tangential brush with journalism is no substitute for concrete evidence before tying him to terrorism, and linking to that article rather than naming him in plain text is not an acceptable loophole by any stretch. I don't think that a suicidal missing civilian is a sufficiently public figure for the purposes of this conversation, nor do I think his family should ever have had to suffer the accusations they did, but if we simply disagree then I won't belabor the point. 



















 You, my friend, are driving me nuts right now. Literally every single point you made deliberately ignores context in some crucial way. Rather than type swear words at you, which is what I did three times before arriving at this draft, I will use your point by point rebuttal system against you, albeit in service of a coherent larger point rather than a bunch of persnickety semantic objections.

Reddit publicly releases names all the time. Almost every article has someone's name in it. A mere name is not in and of itself personal information.

**Context Ignored:** This was not an article submission. An article submission uses the names of **public figures**, as vetted by the journalistic standards of whoever published the article. Linking to an unrelated article about a civilian in the comments, particularly implying some connection to the submission subject "FBI released photos of suspected Boston bombers - Can you identify them?", is the same as naming them.

**You're Demonstrably Wrong Because:** Naming a civillian is and always has been a violation of [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette), and it's somewhat baffling to me that anyone would think otherwise. This is why, for example, facebook screenshots are required to blur out names, and violators are subject to immediate account deletion.

I am arguing that they are not responsible for the actions taken by other people when following provided links. They are responsible for their own actions only.

**Context Ignored:** Their own actions were wrong. When they linked to the Tripathi's family-run facebook page--Rule III of /r/pics outlaws links to anything hosted on Facebook's servers, by the way--they enabled hostile traffic.

You seem to be arguing that they simply enabled *all* traffic in an entirely neutral way, but come on man. They routed a whole bunch of people *trying to identify murderers* to that page. Best case scenario, nobody does anything. Likely scenario, people will be dicks to a grieving family. In this context, they risk putting a great deal of unhappiness in the world for no particular good. Regardless of whether people are good or bad in that situation, that risk is a moral net loss in any sense, utilitarian or deontological.

No, you're misunderstanding my intention entirely. I used Google because it's an algorithm, not a person. If mere linking is the crime, then the algorithm should be banned because of the results it produced.

**Context Ignrored:** I am not, to be fully clear on an entirely obvious point, saying that neutral linking carries the same moral weight as linking with an agenda or linking in an intrinsically hostile **context**.

An algorithm lacks intentionality in the traditionally human sense, and therefore can't be be held responsible in the same way. I never said "banned," but a faulty algorithm could certainly be altered if it were suggesting irrelevant personal pages to universally hostile audiences.

Honestly though, that's a pretty terrible example. It wasn't an algorithm that submitted and upvoted links to the "Come Home Sunny" facebook page on the "FBI released photos of suspected Boston bombers - Can you identify them?" thread, it was members of the Reddit community--people. That's why I used people in my example.

Again, it's really weird that you think I'm opposed to "linking" on its own. I mean, seriously.

 Here's another way to put it. If you can find a torrent link using Google, is Google responsible for copyright infringement? Your argument is that the source of a link is responsible for the actions that third parties take when visiting that link. That philosophy would have an incredibly chilling effect on the Internet.

**Context Ignored:** Algorithms lack intentionality and therefore can't be held morally responsible, people can. Why are we talking about algorithms again? Pure obfuscation?

That's not anywhere near comparable to what occurred. It's more like your search term is "some guy who's whereabouts are unknown and kinda looks like a person who might be a terrorist".

In order to make your position seem reasonable, you had to completely blow things out of proportion. That should tell you something.

**Context Ignored:** I'm going to allow myself one swear word here, and call that an unequivocal load of bullshit. The thread that Sunil Tripathi's name and family-run facebook page were posted to was called "FBI released photos of suspected Boston bombers - Can you identify them?"

**Everyone on that thread was literally literally *literally* searching for the most wanted murder terrorists in America.** They were not searching for some guy who's whereabouts are unknown and kinda looks like a person who might be a terrorist. You're being ridiculous.

What are you talking about? Reddit isn't a court of law. We share web sites all the time, and the rules are clear: no personal information. There's nothing about "evidence" at all.
There isn't a higher standard just because this was a story about bombings.

Setting aside the fact that Reddit's prohibition of personal information *was* violated in no uncertain terms, I'm asking for people to use judgment that extends beyond  the letter of a terms of service checklist. Naming Sunil Tripathi as a Boston Bombing suspect with no evidence was **morally** wrong. Reddit users went public with bad information, real people were affected, we can do better next time. 



















 I believe the line drawn was initially no publicly released names, which is entirely appropriate in that case. There was a secure tip line for providing relevant names.

You seem to be arguing that the people who linked to this guy bare no responsibility here, and that blame lies solely on rude commenters. Let's put it this way:

The thing is, there's a huge difference between linking to a site and making rude comments on that site. Is Google to blame if it helps rude people find your blog?

If a group of people at Google, however well intentioned, link to my blog at the top whenever you search "most wanted murder terrorist in america," then yes, that was irresponsible. Not to be a dick about it, but those people should be fired and the rest of Google should clearly condemn their actions. And if my family is inundated with hate and harassment, Google will have to bare some of that blame.

Edit: To be clear, yes, all of that stuff you listed was clearly and explicitly off-limits by virtue of naming someone without evidence. 



















 Not his personal facebook page, but the "come home sunny" facebook page that his family had made for him. Just a collection of heartbroken photos and memories from the people who loved him--about an hour before Reddit linked to it they were posting about how they hoped he would come home to bake and eat ice cream with them.

So yeah, all that those consistently upvoted links accomplished was the facilitation of a bunch of hostile traffic, a bunch of demands for that poor fucking family to speak out if they had nothing to hide. And the funny thing is, there's *no fucking way* that posting that information on Reddit could *ever* help in the investigation--certainly not when the anonymous FBI tip line was available. It doesn't even matter that he was innocent; if he had been guilty then the FBI could have just investigated the accusation in private. There was nothing to gain from that bullshit, only a bunch of pointless sadness for his heartbroken family. Fucking shameful. 



















 I feel so bad for that family. They had just put up something earlier today about how they hoped to cook food and eat ice cream with him, and now all this. The heartbreak must be be unreal.

 You're basically right. If that's all that you were looking for, then stop reading now.

What's way more important than being right, however, is how you use those skills you're talking about. Your immersion in film should allow you to craft a more coherent and better-supported argument about a film's meaning, and your argument should therefore rule the day. At no point should your "qualifications" enter the discussion; if you're truly a "better" cineaste than your friend then your skill will speak for itself. When you make the conversation about yourself or your subculture, you're being a pretentious, insufferable snob and making the rest of us high-functioning, tolerable snobs look bad.

I would also say that film immersion does not automatically make your opinions superior--anyone who's been through film school knows that--nor does casual cinephilia make someone's subjective reaction to a work of art any less valuable. Again, substance of argument trumps personal background.

Being a good cinephile in the real world means showing your friends stuff they might not see otherwise, sharing perspectives they might not have considered, and having something interesting to say when they turn to you and say "but I want to know what [group film dude] thought of it." I doesn't mean we're better than anyone.

 Here's the thing: I was born in 1989, so I will never have the same experience listening to his vinyl collection as he does. Love the movie, but this kind of thing always leaves me cold--especially when everybody's going to get it on CD or MP3 anyway.

Nope, doesn't clear up much at all. For my money, I'm completely unwilling to send personal payment to a stranger for an unsanctioned service upgrade, particularly if they're unwilling to offer information about who they are, their relationship to the company, and how this process supposedly works.

At best, I would guess that you're a Spotify employee exploiting your benefits for personal profit. At worst, you're scamming people out of $15 and/or their personal payment information. With all due respect, I remain justifiably skeptical and give your offer a downvote.

 I was extremely tempted to downvote you because you are wrong, but I'm replying instead so good for me.

Bioshock does not "present" objectivism in the way that, for example, Atlas Shrugged does, but it is inarguably commenting on it, so there goes your first sentence. If Atlas Shrugged-style objectivism "worked" intrinsically, then there should be no dystopia like Rapture possible--by creating a scenario in which strict adherence is observed but everything goes to shit regardless, Bioshock proves that objectivism is at best impotent, and at worst destructive--I'd argue more for the latter.

Because you think Rapture is unobjectivist, I assume you're taking for granted that the ideology was not strictly observed by the characters in Bioshock. If you're assuming they're different simply because things turn out differently from Atlas Shrugged's positive spin, then you're not really engaging with either work. I'd be interested in hearing where you think they diverged.

 Come on now. It's 100% possible to have a principled vote based on policy stance parallel to appreciation of a very unique and sincere display of presidential emotion--this man has literally put up with more bullshit than anyone in the world over the last four years, and it's gratifying to see that he's still committed to the stuff I believe in. If you want to write off 61170405 votes as "pshhh guess they're all just *in love with him*," then that's your business, but it seems like a bizarre and sweeping generalization with no supported link to liberal values. 



















 Here's the thing though: they *did* take their name from the Boston Tea party, right? As in, time for a revolutionary war against tyranny? And unless I'm mistaken, they surfaced shortly after Obama was elected, but before he had accomplished much? Bush enacted the bank bailout--why does Obama spark a call for revolution?

I honestly believe that there are well-meaning libertarians who got swept up in the Tea Party, but it's always been a radical fringe group with fear at its core--fear of change, fear of Other, fear of brown people, take your pick.

 I'd agree that "The Luckiest" and "Still Fighting It" are, but "Julianne," "Not the Same," and "Underground" are about sex, drugs, and rock and roll respectively. There are more mature, monogamous rap songs like "Paris, Tokyo" and the like, but these are outliers in rap, pop, and rock generally.

 The /Filmcast is the most obsessively anti-spoiler environment out there; if someone mentions Rosebud in passing, Chen will almost certainly interrupt with "Spoilers for Citizen Kane!"

 This might be a sort of extreme strategy, but it always helps me to remember that I'm **going to fucking die.** So are you--you're getting older by the minute, you're smoking, you're not exercising enough, you don't have long for this world. If you're like most people, I imagine the concept is fairly abstract and intangible to you, but I would encourage you obsess over it a little bit, really *feel* the inevitability of it. If you're struck dead by a car on your way to buy cigarettes, what's going to be left of you creatively? An unfinished first draft? An outline? An idea you never told anyone about? What ever you're afraid of right now, it should pale in comparison to what's in store. Here lies Stan, he was defined by what he consumed. Fuck a deadline, this is *real life* and it's your only shot to make something. Do it now.

 I think they're very different skills, and I think anyone can do either poorly. It's silly to compare the lowest form of one skill to the highest form of another. 



















 That's a rather condescending view of cinematography. Anybody can write shit down and call it a script, too, but while anyone *can* perform any production duty, everyone onset should have some degree of skill, practice and talent. 



















 Just from an English/Grammar perspective, everything after "cost" in the last sentence is redundant. Also, it's generally considered bad form to end a clause in a preposition -- "a world in which she doesn't belong" is more correct than "a world she doesn't belong in. Also, these two sentences say essentially the same thing--woman enters high-risk situation to save husband--and could be combined without too much trouble.

I also think it's important to clarify whose addiction is ripping apart everything she's ever loved in the first sentence, as it currently reads as though Monica's addiction leads her to the brink of addiction in order to solve her addiction, which is a bit of a head-scratcher. 

Also, "rip apart everything she's ever loved" is kind of generically melodramatic; I think you're better off concisely setting up the specific stakes of your story. People love an awful lot of things; if it's her marriage or her family or her parents or her hometown at risk then say so--those words are technically smaller in scope, but carry a lot more emotional resonance, and are almost certainly more accurate. 



















  Frankly, no, people shouldn't have to change who they are for the sake of others.

 There are smart ways and dumb ways to engage with that material. For the most part, GTA games are smart, which is a big part of why they're beloved by critics and why the word "satire" pops up in reviews so often. With respect to gender, however -- an issue that affects somewhere between 50 and 100% of the world in a big way -- they didn't live up to their own standards of insight, and that was a problem for the reviewer.

My point, however, was that Blawraw busted out "transexual feminist" as if the reviewer's gender identity ended the conversation, which is at best ridiculous and at worst pretty bigoted. If sexuality has nothing to do with it, then why are so many GTA fanboys bringing it up? 



















 yeah ok buddy 



















 You've chosen writing people off based on their sexuality because it's easier, thanks for playing. 



















 I read it yes.

 On a less positive note, its deeply frustrating that, while its central and supporting male characters are flawed and complex characters, with a few extremely minor exceptions (such as the aforementioned optional getaway driver), GTA V has little room for women except to portray them as strippers, prostitutes, long-suffering wives, humorless girlfriends and goofy, new-age feminists were meant to laugh at.
 
 Characters constantly spout lines that glorify male sexuality while demeaning women, and the billboards and radio stations of the world reinforce this misogyny, with ads that equate manhood with sleek sports cars while encouraging women to purchase a fragrance that will make them smell like a bitch. Yes, these are exaggerations of misogynistic undercurrents in our own society, but not satirical ones. With nothing in the narrative to underscore how insane and wrong this is, all the game does is reinforce and celebrate sexism.

The reviewer thinks that in a game that leans this heavily on social satire, it's lazy to just uncritically present destructive social attitudes without engaging in them. The extent to which this is a problem for you will vary, but in this reviewer's subjective opinion it detracted pretty significantly from what the game was in accordance with its own ambitions. 



















 Because you've played it through and prepared a counterargument? Or because writing off people based on their sexuality is easier? 



















 The thing is though, if you hate hearing the same old shit over and over again as a layperson, just imaging being in her shoes. All the witless jokes about her appearance every time someone disagrees with her, the self-righteous dittoheading about how she should ease up on feminism, and the *bizarre* anti-intellectual notion that critics shouldn't engage with ideas in games they review -- i imagine that shit *redefines* draining. She's given her life to a medium she loves and engages with it though principles she cares about -- if that's not how you live your life then that's fine, but just know that you and everyone else railing against feminism, fiction and *fucking thought in general* are smaller people because of it.

 Given the level of semantic nitpickery that got us into this conversation, I think we should at least allow the author the restrictions explicitly laid out in his initial sentence -- if you privilege the word popular all out of proportion, then Jesus probably wins. So, nix the Beatles and the About.com list of classical composers, and stick with "composers," "American," and the "popular music" genre. I would happily include Sousa and Duke Ellington in a list of popular composers, and I wouldn't be terribly surprised to see them win a popular vote. I think we're all in agreement that "one of" would have fixed the sentence; I'm only saying that Berlin's body of work makes the hyperbole understandable, if not technically justifiable. 



















 Do you think consensus would form around someone else though? Assuming you hold people to a specific definition of popular American music composer, the only other songwriter I could see having a shot at it would be Brian Wilson, while other opinions would splinter in a million different directions. People less inclined toward pop music history probably wouldn't agree on much, while more informed people will gather around greats like Berlin.

It was still an improperly literal word choice on the writer's part, of course, but I do think Irving Berlin could win a popular vote.

 Hmm. I have a significantly different impression of how Kevin Smith thinks about himself. I'm not a Smith apologist by any stretch, but his podcast is one of several I listen to, and he's always entirely candid about the fact that he considers himself a writer/storyteller far more than a filmmaker in any real sense. His handling of Cop Out was pretty childish, he has a tendency to pander to the lowest common denominator of his fan base, and I do get the sense that he's been living in a success bubble for quite some time, but it's a pretty blatant exaggeration to say that he considers himself a "great" filmmaker while Clerks is "so poor it's great." I think he's best considered as an inarguably major figure of the 90s indie renaissance most notable for his screenwriting, and trying to measure him against Kubrick and Bergman doesn't make much sense, particularly when I don't see any indication that he invites such comparison.

 The "black people don't have very good design sense" stereotype doesn't seem nearly as damning to me as the "white people think bad design from people of other races is hilarious" stereotype.

 Frank Sinatra's *In the Wee Small Hours*, Frank Zappa's *Freak Out*, The Beach Boys' *Pet Sounds* and the Beatles' own *Rubber Soul* and *Revolver* were all pretty strongly album-oriented as well, but you could argue that *Sgt.

 [This one's kind of a bummer, but I think it gets at a lot of truth.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9PzSNy3xj0)

From the priest -- *Synecdoche, New York* (2008)

Everything is more complicated than you think. You only see a tenth of what is true. There are a million little strings attached to every choice you make. You can destroy your life every time you choose. But maybe you wont know for twenty years! And you may never ever trace it to its source. And you only get one chance to play it out. Just try and figure out your own divorce

And they say theres no fate, but there is, its what you create. And even though the world goes on for eons and eons, you are only here for a fraction of a fraction of a second. Most of your time is spent being dead, or not yet born. But while alive, you wait in vain wasting years for a phone call or a letter or a look from someone or something to make it all right, but it never comes. Or it seems to, but it doesnt really.

So you spend your time in vague regret or vaguer hope that something good will come along, something to make you feel connected, something to make you feel cherished, something to make you feel loved. And the truth is is, I feel so angry! And the truth is, I feel so fucking sad! And the truth is, Ive felt so fucking hurt for so fucking long and for just as long, Ive been pretending Im okay, just to get along!

I dont know why. Maybe becauseno one wants to hear about my miserybecause they have their own.

Fuck everybody. Amen. 




 In what way are you probably completely delusional? 














 I was just thinking about the fact that pretty much everyone is fooling themselves about something, and that I probably am as well. It's obviously a tricky question to answer, but what total falsehoods do you think you might be clinging to, and why?

 Nothing against the effort, but it just goes to show how color/b w photos create different subjective moods. I always thought of the original image as far "cooler" than the red warmth of this treatment--if I'd colorized it, I'd have put them all under blue lights. 



















 [I did.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong_\(video_game\)#Story_and_characters) The only references to any malevolence on Mario's part are the claims that D.K. is his pet and was mistreated, but there's no citation on that and it's not evident in the game, plus there's no ambiguity in the fact that he's rescuing her. He *is* the antagonist of the game's sequel *Donkey Kong Jr.* though, maybe that's what you were thinking of? 



















 Why do you think that? She screams "Help" when Donkey Kong takes her and then has a love heart appear when Jumpman rescues her. 



















 Forget "Revolution 9" and "Wild Honey Pie" (both fun experiments that remain surprisingly listenable if you give them a chance), the absolute worst Beatles song is ["Don't Pass Me By,"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSd4evT8Nw8) written by Ringo for the White Album. It's not just that the lyrics are dull and stupid, though there's that, but the arrangement and production seem like a deliberate assault on good taste. If there's an elivator down to Hell, this song is playing on it 24/7.

I quite like "Octopus's Garden" though. 



















 My name's Ted, I'm a dude, and you're right, it's not about me: sometimes one should try to empathize with other people who have different experiences than one's own. 



















 What does her physical design matter?

I'm not trying to bust your balls here, but you're asking that question because you've never played a game where the male hero was sexualized in a way that wasn't empowering. That's the male experience with video games, and the images of this post provide some insight into the female experience with games: sexualization in an unempowering way that has no practical benefit in the game world. Physical design is meaningless to you because you're in a position of privelege, but it's not meaningless to everyone and that's the point. It's just kind of a weird, off-putting trope that makes half the world kind of uncomfortable.

On your other points, Tomb Raider is a really fun game in spite of the creepiness surrounding Lara's design. Those seven polygons seem to have struck a chord with designers and audiences, because Croft's tits have dominated the series ever since, and it just seems unnecessary. 



















 That's the point: males are often empowered by masculine sexuality, females are often objectified by feminine sexuality. I don't have an easy answer to that, but I think it's probably valuable for men to empathize a little by experiencing sexuality the way female gamers do. 



















 That's a very insightful post. I'm not so much objecting to super-masculine escapist protagonists--though I do think they're often kind of silly and boring--but it is a little more troubling that female characters are so often degraded by their sexuality rather than empowered by it. Including normal women--hell, pretty women if you like--invites a far wider audience than the usual tit-flaunting girls who never wear jackets. Also, I'm more interested in games that aspire to be more than escapism and don't need Conan-like protagonists. I'm not trying to deprive escapism from people who enjoy it, but I'd like to see a larger market share of inclusive games that don't lean on sexuality so hard. 



















 There's a significant difference between grown women dressing themselves for practical purposes at the gym, and grown men *designing* women for aesthetic pleasure. Also, suggesting that my previous comment boils down to "what you do doesn't matter because of what you wear" is to miss the point in such spectacular fashion that I question the value of further discussion. I don't know what you read the first time, but what I said was:
There are many admirable traits about the character's execution, but there's nothing ambiguous about what drove her physical design 



















 No it's not, our interpretation is based on [this](http://i.imgur.com/WNrdi0D.jpg). There are many admirable traits about the character's execution, but there's nothing ambiguous about what drove her physical design, and Gard is covering his ass because times changed. 



















 I don't want to speak for peon47 here, but I'm pretty sure he skipped Uncharted because it's completely irrelevant, as Nathan Drake isn't objectified. The majority of AAA games present male protagonists as power fantasy surrogates, while female characters are far more often designed to titillate males rather than empower females. 



















 The overwhelming majority of the comments here are idiotic, but this actually makes a really interesting point. Sexualized female game characters are so established that guys don't even think about them, while most straight gentlemen would probably be pretty uncomfortable playing a game with this protagonist. Plight of the female gamer. 



















 You're projecting an awful lot there.

 I'm a substitute teacher. I came in thinking that I'd be totally cool about the bathroom thing; I know what a big deal it is. I have adult friends who still carry grudges about this issue. Not that they ever had accidents mind you, but it's the principle of the thing: isn't it crazy that we're socialized by an institution that doesn't even trust us to make our own bathroom choices? I just want everyone to be happy and learn--I will be different.

My first week, a kid asks to go to the bathroom right away, and I say yes. So proud of myself, too--these kids are never trusted with this basic responsibility, and I will prove to them that I respect them as people and this will be a wonderful day.

Then another kid asks, and I hesitate for a moment--we already have somebody in there, can you wait? No, she says, it's an emergency. "I trust you, go ahead" I say, because if I make it clear that this is a matter of trust, then they wouldn't possibly take advantage of that, would they?

More emergencies begin to pop up. I know that they can't all be telling the truth, but where do I draw the line? The last thing I want to be is arbitrary about the bathroom; my principles demand a consistent standard. "I trust you," I tell a dozen little middle schoolers. "I trust you all."

Five, ten, twenty minutes go by and half my class is unaccounted for. I'm responsible for them, and they've vanished. Truth is, once they're out the door, they can go where they please--I can't keep track of them and neither can anyone else. I remember this from when I was in school. I regret everything.

Finally a beleaguered custodian returns with my dozen students. They were messing around in the hall, he says, did I let them all go to the bathroom? There were a lot of emergencies, I explain. He isn't sure if I'm stupid or if I'm fucking with him. He tells me what everyone who's been on this side of the situation tautologically knows: kids lie about this shit, often just because they can. Your trust means nothing. They have plenty of time to take care of this. Don't let a bunch of kids go to the fucking bathroom. 



















 I saw *Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles* in a feminist film class, and thought at the time--still think, honestly--that it was too fucking boring to be good art. I have a pretty high tolerance for "deliberate pacing," but this was something else: it was all the boring stuff I do myself as a single dude everyday, which led to me spacing out during viewing as I do in my own life--it's like a Pavlovian call to fucking daydreaming. As such, the finale meant nothing to me because I'd been barely paying attention, and I do not blame myself I blame the dumb dumb movie. I'm a cineaste and committed gender egalitarian; fuck that dull ass film. 



















 That's the standard? "Look, this joke may or may not be hacky as fuck, but pretend someone hilarious said it." 



















 Would the dwindling resources of our planet be worth the resources required to get here? Let alone wage war? 



















 Well, humans are my main frame of reference, and I'm pretty sure we're going to nuke the shit out of ourselves before we ever get serious about space colonization. Mass destruction is much easier achieved than interstellar travel, so it seems like the whole process should on some level select for peaceful, exploratory natures. 




 Any aliens visiting Earth would probably be friendly: if they were advanced enough for interstellar travel but hostile enough for war, they'd likely destroy themselves before getting anywhere near us. 


































 I'm intrigued by what you're saying, but I don't really follow. You seem to be devaluing art and its place in culture: Lovecraft and Jay-Z admittedly don't have any special ontological insight into the nature of things, but their work and its popularity can definitely reflect a current in ideology, and it then doesn't seem unreasonable to me that the prevalence of that current throughout history could--setting aside some silly neatherrealm--at least reflect something fundamental in humanity and human psychology. Would you be willing to elaborate on your position for an interested layman? 



















 Hmm. Not sure why you'd bother with classes then. 



















 Not symbolism, but at least intent: a chair can be a chair if there's a reason for a chair--symbolic, narrative, or expository. It's silly to say that symbolism is *always* good or bad or present or projected, but getting bogged down in pointless detail for the sake of "setting a scene" is certainly a hallmark of bad writing. 



















 Maybe your writing got better. 



















 Eh, just that he seems to assume that Erin's not playing seriously, but now he's raping frivolously and doesn't seem to think it should make any difference. He took against Erin's new character hard immediately, and even Spenser pointed out how unfair he was being about it. He doesn't seem to be playing in good faith. 



















 If you're open to a serious answer, it's because it reduces a person to two adjectives, and would seem to be inviting the reader to draw on social assumptions about the word combination that would probably be informed by stereotypes. It doesn't really merit more fuss than a raised eyebrow or so, but anyway that's why "big black" kinda tastes funny. 




 Erin should defeat Jeff in a D D showdown.

 I won't vouch for the quality of the songs, but these compilations are absolutely masterful in terms of pure nostalgia-baiting. I haven't thought about these songs in years and I've really never listened to Top 40 music intentionally, yet I have some memory or association with almost all of these tracks. NOW is indisputably great at bottling and selling time.

 There's way more wisdom in your comment than the one you're responding to. Movies tell you that love has a happy ending, songs tell you that you've been wronged if someone doesn't love you, but only life teaches you that you're not entitled to anyone else's feelings, no matter how big you've made them in your head. 



















 The only thing I notice with any regularity is some ugly, blocky compression when streaming dark grays and blacks, as is normal for streaming video and DVD--how much of an issue that is will depend on the palette of the film, your TV, and your own anal retentivity, i suppose.

More to the point though, minimal compression artifacts are no reason to blind buy expensive discs in my opinion--it's not like it ruins the experience. Hulu is a great tool for exploring the collection, particularly when you're seeing the film for the first time.

 Is there any comprehensive list of which studios play ball with Criterion and which don't? 














 Whenever speculation comes around as to which films might be eligible for a Criterion treatment, a few commenters will weigh in based on what sort of relationship different studios and distributers have with the company; e.g. Sony does this, Warner Brothers doesn't do that, Harvey Weinstein hates whatever. Is there any sort of list or chart as to where the different major companies stand? Or, if there isn't, would a somebody here care to run me through it here?

 Interesting. I'd say he was just a twist on narrative convention and leave it at that, myself--not all movies have or indeed need a consistent in-world logic when the focus is on theme or form. 



















 It's a bad faith argument to assume that contemporary proponents of birth control are intentionally trying to stop black people from breeding.

 Just to set your expectations in line, *Help!* is more surreal and more plot-driven, arguably funnier--*A Hard Day's Night* is basically the early Beatles running around being themselves. That said, *A Hard Day's Night* is widely seen the more groundbreaking work, as it basically set the visual template for pop and rock and roll music.

 **I'd just like you to hear from at least one person that divorce is not mandatory.** It seems abundantly clear that your wife seriously, thoughtlessly, fucking crushingly betrayed your trust, and if that means divorce for you then rock on. But if you're still grappling with your love for her right now and you think there's something to salvage, don't for one second feel bound by what's expected or what's expressed on this silly adolescent corner of the internet--infidelity, however painful, happens, and your only responsibility right now is to yourself, rebuilding in the way that's right for you.

 Since a lot of the good stuff on Hulu is behind the Plus wall, I thought I'd share how I get my subscription for free. You can get ongoing access to Hulu Plus with the Bing Rewards program: you open an account, and you get points for every Bing search you do, up to about 15 points per day usually. By the end of a month that's enough for a free month of Hulu Plus, and if you do it regularly then you'll get it for even less, leaving you with leftover points and enabling you to stack months on top of each other. Search the weather in every city, search random keystrokes, "switch to bing" if you're so inclined, doesn't matter. [We both get 200 bonus points \(almost half a month of use\) if you use my referral link during February and get to silver status](http://www.bing.com/explore/rewards?PUBL=REFERAFRIEND CREA=RAW rrid=_bd8da2a4-18ec-59ff-95e3-93e7b8bca8ab), so that's an option if you'd like. Either way, it's a pretty simple way to get access to a lot of great film and television completely free.

 Just my opinion here, rating films out of 100 is obnoxious, in much the same way that Pitchfork's silly, pretentious old 100 point rating system is. The advantage of the five star system is its broad strokes: a number can't and shouldn't be that exact, and should only point in the direction of the critic's reaction. To divide a film's value into hundredths is to present of facade of objectivity that is almost certainly unearned, and to devalue the real work of criticism, which is done in actual writing. More to the point of your question, a five star film is a masterpiece, and there could easily be between zero and a handful every year as culture evolves and presents new concerns and ideas. I've literally never seen a film that should be "100/100" though, largely because it's a completely ridiculous notion.

 I'm playing in a band called [Terrible](https://www.facebook.com/terribleisalright?ref=br_tf) with some friends, but I'm also trying build a music video portfolio; I was an English/Film major myself at MSU actually. 



















 I'm actually living in East Nashville right now with three other Michiganian expats, and we're paying $900 for a four bedroom house--it's not sketchy by our our standards, but to be fair we would probably rank as kind of sketchy in some circles. Hillsboro Village is the nicer hip young people area, but it's also more expensive--East Nashville is for starving artists who take the starvation part seriously. 



















 Eh, nothing wrong with that, particularly if it worked out for him and his ultimate partner in the end. 



















 Fair enough, good talk. 



















 Not if you preemptively chuck all science out the door, I suppose. Ah well. 



















 There was nothing to suggest that the OSs were in any sense interested in some sort of entropic non-being, though--Samantha spent the entire movie determined to learn, explore and experience the universe as fully as possible, and they were evolving exponentially. She wasn't slowing down, the world around her was slowing relative to her growth. Assuming then that she's not blasting off into entropic suicide, I think we can safely assume that their ongoing consciousness will be in pure energy or some such, the point being that it's beyond our current comprehension--maybe a full understanding of our own consciousness will get us there someday, maybe not, either way that's how they could be together.

I can understand reading some kind of magic in place of energy, though I'm not personally predisposed toward privileging a spiritual reading without explicit evidence, and I don't really think you listed any--I guess we're probably both just bringing our own worldviews to an ambiguous and abstract component of the movie. 



















 Hmm. Well, for my money, I don't think there's any direct evidence for mysticism in the film itself--to be fair though, the portrayal of AI consciousness is abstract enough that there's plenty of room to project one's own spirituality onto it. 



















 I think maybe we watched different movies. 



















 Hmm. Unless you're using the term in a sense I'm not familiar with, there is no "being" in entropy. It seemed clear to me that they intended to continue their ongoing consciousnesses, and had found a way to do so that wasn't dependent on human machinery--her invitation to Theodore would be dependent on humanity arriving at some similar paradigm shift in our understanding and experience of consciousness, and wouldn't make much sense if she were heading to the "end of the line," as you say, unless I suppose you're religiously inclined. Could you clarify what you mean by the words entropy and redemption? 



















 Yeah, and it was Aaron McGruder, creator of The Boondocks.

 To be fair, that would probably be *really* satisfying.

 To enjoy something is to judge it as 'good'.

This is a very narrow view of art, and one which elevates pornography above all other media. Art can challenge you, stimulate you intellectually, put you in touch with complex emotions and shape human lives. If you're the type of person who cares about that stuff, then I think it's natural to feel a touch of dissonance when you're taken in by a shitty pop song--it's hardly the great show-stopping "guilt" you seem to be describing, nor indeed is enjoyment of the shitty anything to oppose or feel ashamed of. But it's okay to have loftier ambitions for art than uncritical enjoyment, and I think it's healthy to judge even your enjoyments accordingly. 



















 Hmm. That seems wildly impractical. 



















 Here are a couple comments OP made elsewhere:

By not specifying a type of weapons, you invariably allow possession of all of them.

It's an individual right to keep and bear arms. Multiple arms, multiple types of arms. By not specifying, it opens up the protections to all arms, which was the intent of the Founding Father I imagine.

By allowing one thing to be banned by saying another thing is not allows you to gut the right entirely.

To me, the whole "nuclear weapon" argument is therefor rendered moot. The right to own one is protected, but because they're uncommon, its unable to be reasonably exercised.

He's taking things quite a bit farther than you, indeed farther than most people we're ever likely to meet.

As for whether federal regulation is "bad", I used a potentially misleading word. As you describe it, federal regulation is "better" because it's more in keeping with your view on gun policy. I meant "bad" in the sense that it's inconsistent with the OP's interpretation of the extent of the ammendment--to whatever extent you support gun control, the Second Amendment can either be regulated or it can't. If you hold the fringe view that it's an essential right impervious to regulation, then the level at which it's regulated doesn't change the fact that's it's a violation, it only changes the practical effects. If you accept that it *can* be regulated at the federal level, I think you have to accept that it can be regulated at the state level as well. Any potential overreach would go before the Supreme Court and get hammered out there.

On that note, speech and all other rights are indeed very much governed by states. One example would be [state regulation of pornography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_obscenity_law#State_laws); though we don't have any federal laws on the matter, each state is allowed to define and regulate that particular brand of speech as they see fit. Similar state laws exist with respect to defamation and libel, speech in educational contexts, incitement to lawless action, and many many others. 



















 Why shouldn't states have a say in this? If the argument is that the Second Ammendment guarentees the right to bear *all* arms--I know you're not suggesting that, but OP has argued that several times elsewhere in the thread--then isn't federal regulation just as bad as state regulation? On the other hand, if we accept that the second amendment is not unconditional and can be regulated within reason--true of pretty much all of our rights, including speech, religious practice, unenumerated rights, etc.--then what legal justification is there in saying that the right to regulate firearms should be exclusively federal? If we have state and local government, then why should they be excluded from regulating this one broad sentence specifically, particularly when it's so open to interpretation? 



















 I imagine

There's the rub.

Seriously though, there were no weapons capable of mass-killing in that time, and it's disingenuous to pretend hypothetical modern advanced weaponry ever crossed the minds of our founding fathers in this context. If you're actually interested in a good faith reading of what their intentions were--and it is pretty clear--simply read the ammendment itself: "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." 



















 Do you really think that universal unrestricted access to military-grade firearms is *really* as fundamental a human right as equal protection under the law regardless of race? Why? 



















 The issue isn't denial of rights, merely regulation. Abortion is a perfect example: while it's been established that it can't be explicitly outlawed, access and funding varies wildly between states based on local policy. 



















 What then, in your opinion, is the purpose of state and local government? If they can neither place additional restrictions or grant additional rights, why bother with the localized system? It seems to me you're arguing for a complete reorganization of our government.

Also, while I respect your personal reading of the second amendment, it's by no means a universally accepted interpretation. We have a "right to bear arms," but that doesn't mean we have a right to bear any and all arms we like. 



















 Nope. 



















 Agreed. Save your half, and pay his taxes.

  You seemed to assume that there is a 'real' "100 Greatest Films" list out there in the ether

I don't, so we can drop that. But I do think that art has value, and I think that criticism has value in as much as it preserves and promotes the value of art. This is my starting point. If you'd like to argue for artistic and critical nihilism, then I think that's a perfectly valid closed system, but it's not engaging with my view. 



















 I think this is a very good case for what might make the film *interesting*, particularly to a Hitchcock devotee, but I don't know that any of that amounts to "greatness," you know? Tommy Wiseau's [*The Room*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCj8sPCWfUw) is unquestionably the work of a singular voice, it does everything wrong according to Hollywood standards, it ends in tragedy, the protagonist is kind of nuts, there are several scenes that defy logic--and if I were a critic looking for kicks, I might even call it a deconstruction.

But art can move minds and hearts, if can fuck up your week, it can make you reorganize your life; that's something film is capable of, and that's what I need a great film to do. And I just don't see how the idiosyncrasies of Vertigo approach anything resembling greatness--that's the view to change, I'm afraid. 



















 I understand what you're saying, but I disagree. The process of good criticism is finding sense, meaning and truth in the dreamlike ephemera of art. Essentially, I'll consider my view changed if someone can make me *want* to see this movie again--and they'll need to draw on substantive evidence if that's going to happen. 



















 For what it's worth, I'll bet you could read the entirety of my post before Kim Novak leaves the museum. 



















 Here's the thing: I used to like the movie as much as you did, but then I saw it for the 135th time, and I hated it--as B. Kite later clarified, "Once you've watched *Vertigo* 135 times, the flaws become pretty tough to ignore." 

Just kidding, of course--but perhaps you appreciate what an unconvincing argument that amounts to. If you once held my view and then saw the error of your ways, then let's talk about *that* process, my friend--that's what we're here for, right?

To clarify my point, my issue with Vertigo's canonization isn't that the polls were counted improperly: I simply don't understand what any of these individuals were thinking when they selected it, and I  disagree with the collective result on those grounds.

Finally, to argue against the existence of greatness is to argue against the whole process of creating a film canon, which doesn't intrinsically disagree with my premise: if nothing deserves canonical recognition, then Vertigo doesn't either--but that strikes me as a bit of a departure from the topic at hand either way. 



















 I've seen the film a total of four times over the years, for whatever that's worth. I disagree that film criticism isn't rational; I think that the case for or against a film's value can and should be based on evidence within the film and through relevant inter-textual comparison. Lastly, my problem is not that this film is experimental--I love a great many experimental films--it's that its idiosyncrasies don't amount to much in the way of art.  




 If there are any passionate Vertigo fans here, I'd love for you to join me for a CMV in which I argue that it is *not* a great film.

 This CMV is inspired by the fact that I coincidentally rewatched *Vertigo* the other day, then saw yesterday that it was [number 3 on the BBC's top 100 American films of all time.](http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20150720-the-100-greatest-american-films) It also replaced *Citizen Kane* as Sight   Sound's [top film of all time](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/01/sight-and-sound-2012-vertigo-citizen-kane_n_1729685.html) in 2012. I argue that it has no business in either or indeed any canonical place of honor, and that it is not a great film.

First, this movie is unjustifiably boring. I don't object to a film adopting a deliberately slow pace, but there needs to be some substance within it that merits focus and reflection: the languid sequences of Jimmy Stewart following Kim Novak all over the place, their witless, surface-level courtship scenes--it's a whole lot of poorly paced nothing.

On a related note, I see precious little truth in this movie. Stewart's obsessive "love," while commendably acted, is ridiculous in its premise, particularly when it's undermined entirely by the finale: in discovering that he's had the woman he "loved" beside him all along, he doesn't love her any more? I suppose a generous reading might have something to do with romantic projections and the feelings of betrayal they can inspire, but it comes at the expense of Kim Novak's character in a huge way, and it indisputably chucks any investment in their romance out the window. There's very little in the end to give any sense of who she *really* was underneath it all, rendering her love of him and his love of her a shallow, ridiculous bit of dramatic puffery that wasn't worth the hour it had demanded.

Thirdly, this flick is a mess in terms of tone. Remember that scene where the Midge character tried to give Jimmy Stewart a self-portrait? It's either a strange and ultimately unresolved dramatic beat, or a particularly cruel comedic one, and I don't like it either way. There are mysterious elements, but they don't make for much in the way of dread; there are romantic elements, but it amounts to nothing more than the myopia of any given teen crush. By the time one arrives at the end of this film, one is seriously wondering what it was all these disparate elements were supposed to add up to.

Fourth, I don't think this film is all that special visually. I'm more than willing to give it credit for the retrozoom, but I don't think that that one flashy move has had nearly the impact of, say, Orson Welles's deep focus photography or Eisenstein's montage or Godard's jump cuts or Keaton's multiple exposures or Disney's animation or basically any other visual innovation you can think of--in an art defined by its optics, that one neat trick is decidedly on the gimmicky end of things. Beyond that, I'd say it's a good-looking film, but not particularly extraordinary in the context of  its predecessors, its contemporaries, or its successors.

And finally, narrative film is capable of a great deal more than anything *Vertigo* aspires to. Even if this film were a visual masterpiece (it's not), there's no reason why screenwriting as a medium should be held to a lower standard than any great play--try watching *Death of a Salesman* (1949) and then this; try comparing it to *Waiting for Godot* (1953) or *A Streetcar Named Desire* (1947), and tell me which of those works is addressing the human condition. If this turgid romance is the best that film has to offer, then that's embarrassing.

To put all my cards on the table, I should also acknowledge that I perhaps unfairly associate *Vertigo* with a particularly tedious neo-Freudian school of film theory. Somewhere along the line, film theorists became obsessed with Sigmund Freud and his disciples, and subsequently never made any effort to advance their understanding of the human mind in keeping with contemporary science (David Bordwell's cognitive approach to film studies being one notable exception). *Vertigo* was once a selection in an Art Film class I had, and the professor went off on some rant about how this film's dream sequence incontrovertibly symbolized castration--yeah ok buddy. 

And I have to say, I think that has a lot to do with why this movie has found favor with contemporary critics: its trite engagement with fetishization and sublimation allows certain critics a canvas on which to project their niche fascinations, and makes them feel important for knowing the "code." It's an artificial barrier between the academic and the laymen that has far more to do with subculture than capacity for intelligence or insight, and critics devalue their vocation when they allow themselves to get caught up in that stuff.

*All that said*, I enjoy liking things, and if there's a way for me to like this movie, I'd very much like to find it. In its favor, I think Jimmy Stewart is a very good actor. And the colors are quite nice in places. And that retrozoom, bravo. But measuring *Verigo's* faults against what the medium at its best ought to strive for, this cannot be considered a great film.

 It's pretty common in the film/video world, at least on the critical/theoretical side of things--you'll read analysis of Citizen Kane's deep focus cinematography, for example. 



















 I'd just like to acknowledge you for sticking to your guns on a very unpopular argument. To be clear, I personally have no love for your consumerist approach to art, but I have to give you credit for standing by it and not pandering to the community here. And even if I find very little to relate to personally in what you're saying, I appreciate that your take on it, unpopular as it may be, reflects something true in what it is to be human--you're using whatever opportunities you've been given to you to authentically articulate your experience.

And even if your mode of thought never finds a wide audience in r/filmmakers, you can at least rest assured that your comments exist in some small corner of the reddit canon forever. Even if only a handful of redditors ever upvote it, you will at least have made that small human connection forever. You're not here to feed this audience what it wants to hear about art and purpose, you're here with the truth as you see it, reception be damned. Kudos.

 Well I *know* my birthday, I just wasn't really anticipating it and was surprised to realize that it was today. As a single 26 year old, there isn't too much fanfare about it. 




 Today marks the year that I learned from Facebook that it was my own Birthday 














 That has to be some kind of milestone, haha. 



















 Oh I agree that a difference of opinion doesn't make one nuts--thus my acknowledgement that there is an intellectual debate to be had on the issue. Framing it as an issue of totalitarian enslavement, however, *is* nuts and I'm pretty comfortable calling it as much. 



















 I hear what you're saying, but my issue is with the means of *enforcing* rights. I don't take it as granted that a state mandate to provide a service allows the use of force on its subjects. Imagaine a world in which we have exactly two rights: the right to an education, and the right *not* to be conscripted into teaching. I don't see that as a contradiction, I see that as an obligation for the state to non-violently incentivise teachers until the right to an education is met.

Of course, it's easy to imagine a world in which the right to an education isn't met, just as it's easy to imagine a world in which I'm murdered in spite of my right to life. All the same, our inability to provide a 100% success rate has no bearing on whether or not there's a moral good to striving for that right.

Another point of diversion might be that I don't really see rights as immutable or intrinsic. I'd go so far as to say I've never encountered a coherent secular defense of intrinsic rights, though I'm absolutely open to hearing one--it would make my ethics a lot cleaner, to be sure. For Rand and for the framers of the constitution, I suppose it comes down to the Creator; for me, I wouldn't presuppose a Creator's existence let alone Its intentions--that would seem to tie rights up in a whole mess of apologetics that I've yet to encounter any ironclad answer to either.

That leaves the idea of rights in a somewhat arbitrary place, but that doesn't mean they don't have value so long as we believe in and abide by them. If there are two people on an island, I would think that their rights are as simple as what they can agree to provide for each other. For me, I would think it imperative to provide medical assistance to the best of one's ability if at all possible. But maybe I'm on an island with Rand Paul and he doesn't think we have that right; fair enough, in that case we don't.

Basically, rights are so difficult to pin down philosophically that I can't help but think about them practically. 



















 I guess I'm just not seeing why violent conscription should factor into philosophical rights at all. In a world in which all teachers and doctors are unwilling to provide service to the poor, I would think that that would be an example of the state failing to follow through on a right that it had promised--we would need to rethink how to incentivise public work certainly, but it wouldn't even occur to me that we should violently chuck the service provider's liberty out the window. 



















 I see it as a right very much on par with education: teachers aren't conscripted at gunpoint to serve in low-income public schools, they do it because they have values that transcend a market-centric approach to existence. 



















 Look, whatever a man wants to personally endorse in the privacy of his own home is fine with me, but that don't mean I gotta *like* him for jibber-jabberin' through a bunch of dehumanizin' semantics on the TV. 



















 Well, he's kind of nuts, isn't he? [Here he is side by side with alternative Reddit favorite son Bernie Sanders in a back and forth on health care](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUXwDMqjC-A)--there's a substantive intellectual debate to be had about whether we have the means and/or obligation to guarantee basic health care as a fundamental right, and then there's whatever the fuck fantasy scenario he's going on about there.

 You subscribe to an "Intelligent Deign" theory of capitalist  socio-economic oppression, I see. I'm inclined to think that it's self-replicating unconsciously, myself--just the same gold old-fashioned self-perpetuating evolution that runs everything, continually selecting for single-minded commitment to continued growth every quarter forever, narrowing the pool down to a smaller, specialized more efficient elite year by year; silly bastards probably have no real concept of poor people, why should they? 



















 His work has especially resonated in the humanities, no question. I think a lot of the beef with him as an ostensibly scientific figure is that so much of his work was wildly unfalsifiable. That's broadly considered to make for pretty bad science--truth be told, I don't love it as a dominant mode of thought in the humanities either. 



















 The OP is emphasizing multiplayer, which absolutely does make a difference. Setting industry stuff aside, a century from now a person will be able to dig up Game of Thrones and engage with it in full as a piece of art/entertainment--not so with Team Fortress or Journey. That doesn't apply to all games, but the collective experience is something that games *can* do in a way that film and literature can't, it's been around for as long as the medium has existed, and it is in turn pretty central to its identity--games just can't sustain ongoing, organic multiplayer forever. It's kind of like theater in that regard: you can read Shakespeare, but you can't go see his theater troop at the Globe.

By thew same token, I think the answer is to "mount a revival" every once in awhile. If a group of like-minded gamers want to explore multiplayer gaming history, they'll have to organize it themselves, either online or off. It just requires some extra effort and coordination. 



















 Sure, and I respect where you're coming from--I think that in the end we might just each be concerned with different issues at the moment, but that that we probably have a lot of common values nonetheless. Cheers. 



















 I don't know if or to what extent you have a personal history with gangs or drug abuse. If so, then I suspect we share a deep sympathy for those most deeply affected by the illegal drug trade, and for the social and chemical pressures they're up against. At the same time--and I apologize if it sounds callous to say so--one's experience doesn't give one any more licence to make up statistics than anyone else. I understand where your number is coming from and the philosophy behind it, but you're claim that drug dealers are directly morally accountable for the deaths of drug users is an opinion, not a fact, and mixing that in with objective claims is deliberately misleading.

To your other claims, though, gang members definitely don't "jump at the chance" to kill cops, it's not even remotely in their self-interest. That's always been reason enough to doubt this sensational claim, and now that somebody's actually bothered to ask those accused and they refute it, that's the side that reason leads me to.

And to your main point--which I missed because you never got around to making it, my friend--American law enforcement, throughout history and right up to the present day, has not systemically earned the trust that you're giving them, flat out. 



















 Call it what we will, I think we both understand that it's a made up number, right? Over or under, you guessed it and stated it as fact without clear terms or citations. I appreciate where you're coming from factoring drug and alcohol related deaths, but that is certainly not a "direct" killing in the sense that murder is. 

And it has jack squat to do with this highly publicized threat of a gang conspiracy to murder police officers; that's what the department is currently stoking fear of, and what my comment was about. Drug dealers, terrorists, and falling pianos all kill people, fine. That doesn't make any excuse for racial fear-mongering in our heavily armed police force. 



















 I have to ask, why bother fabricating the number 600? The actual number of homicides, 445 in [2013](http://data.baltimoresun.com/bing-maps/homicides/index.php?range=2013 district=all zipcode=all age=all gender=all race=all cause=all article=all show_results=Show+results) and [2014](http://data.baltimoresun.com/bing-maps/homicides/index.php?range=2014 district=all zipcode=all age=all gender=all race=all cause=all article=all show_results=Show+results)  combined according to the Baltimore Sun, is plenty. The percentage of those deaths that are black men--[198 of 235 in 2013](http://data.baltimoresun.com/bing-maps/homicides/index.php?range=2013 district=all zipcode=all age=all gender=male race=black cause=all article=all show_results=Show+results), and [173 of 211 in 2014](http://data.baltimoresun.com/bing-maps/homicides/index.php?range=2014 district=all zipcode=all age=all gender=male race=black cause=all article=all show_results=Show+results), for a total of 83% of all homicides--is certainly a staggaring number, but it's definitely not 600 directly drug-related. Why reduce your own argument to a 60% exaggeration?

And why are police doing the same thing? With an *actual* murder problem to contend with, why spin a bunch of idiot kids fucking up the protest downtown into a crips and bloods gang conspiracy?

These exaggerations are created by fear, which they then in turn perpetuate. And that fear puts fingers on triggers, which in turn creates only more death and mistrust. That's not the only problem in America, but it is the one I'm talking about right now. 



















 Here we go again: a well-armed, government-backed police force scares itself silly over angry young black men based on rumor, assumption and self-pity. This is characteristic of the same fear that killed Trayvon Martin for wearing a hoodie, convinced that cop in Ferguson that Michael Brown was a "demon," shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice for playing with a toy gun.

Now every beat cop in Baltimore is convinced that there's a young black gang conspiracy gunning for them. Racial paranoia combined with deadly force--we've seen it before, we see it now, we'll see it again. And next time it goes to trial, once again we'll hear how the officer "feared for their life." And we won't take a second look at where that fear came from. 



















 Well, your other option would be to obey the law--you know, "play by the rules" and "be part of society," all that other moralistic horseshit with which you folks so casually justify the suffering of the poor. Then again, that sort of thing has never sat too well with "you people," has it.

 All due respect, that's nonsense. People should be allowed to talk about sex with whatever level of frankness they want. What wound up being unintentionally hurtful here was that she was saying one thing to her friend and another thing to Fiver here, a little more loving frank talk with him might have enabled them to build a more honest and fulfilling sex life from the start.

To OP: your dick is fine, it's not broken, it's not deformed, but it's also not magic and that's okay, it's just a dick like everybody else's. Somebody loves you, don't fuck that up stressing about your dumb dick. 



















 Bearing in mind that you're free to process life how you choose and that we'll all live and die confused anyway, I say fuck magical thinking.

Explore and understand who you are and what you wish to be. Feel the pain and the pleasure of making choices, of working hard, of creating meaning for yourself. Don't settle for easy answers; stare down the beautiful and the horrible, the things you can control and the things you can't.

And, when you're ready, imagine a world in which there was never any magic--*not one bit*. Somewhere in the vastness of infinity, there was an inevitable, beautiful little fuckup of a chemical reaction that sought out patterns in the randomness, and that's what all the fuss has been about ever since.

And you breathe it in and breathe it out. And it might feel wonderful and it might feel awful, but neither feeling is forever. And your lungs take in the oxygen and release the carbon dioxide, and plants grow out of the ground and rain falls out of the sky.

And what comes next is completely up to you. 



















 Maybe it wasn't *quite* as bad as everyone said, but it sure wasn't good. Rather than pay off all the choices you'd personally made along the way, it just plopped the same big arbitrary, enigmatic choice in front of everybody. And then, *bafflingly*, the option to destroy all synthetics allowed your Shepard to live--never mind that organic/synthetic peacemaking had been a cornerstone of my story. It removed all stakes from your prior choices, then utterly failed to explore or even *explain* the stakes of this new, unrelated choice, the most meaningful demonstrable consequence of which was a shift in color scheme over a fairly artless closing cinematic--for a game that had up to that point been all about making meaningful decisions, that was a big old fuckbotch.

 



















 Hmm. Well, either your kids' curiosity gets the better of them when you're not around, or you wound up with a scummy sub. Either way I'm sorry you went through that, and you can at least take solace in the fact that most subs won't need to be told this stuff. 



















 I think most adults would be capable of putting that together. Kids, on the other hand, might be eager to unwrap presents without as much thought toward proper ownership. I think it's quite possible that that's what went down here.

 Well, yes, that is *literally* Filmmaking 101, and CK, who's been some kind of filmmaker for however many decades now, has his own style. 

*Louie's* drawn out sequences nearly always emphasize performances, with the result being that even minor characters in his unsteady world are given weight and reality--I'm thinking of the surrogate in the hallway from the Season 5 opener, and the incredible dynamism that the actress is allowed to display within just a few minutes.

Those sorts of scenes may seem simple, but they require a lot of discipline, a lot of vision, and a lot of talented collaborators; I think it makes for incredibly compelling comedy. 



















 This is an intriguing approach to personality in that when extrapolated, it sort of extends the same treatment we give philosophers to every Tom, Dick and Harry on XBox Live. I mean, how many times have you read about a thinker or artist whose personal life seems totally incongruous with the philosophy of their work? Yet in the end, any big name in thought invariably refers to a philosophy rather than a biography.

While it's obviously a stretch to consider the Navy Seal tough guy internet persona a philosophy, there is a sense in which it occupies that same nebulous space in which Rousseau abandoned his children and wrote "On Education," John Lennon espoused love and was by all accounts terrible to his loved ones, communist thought is so often a pastime of the idle rich, etc. There is the person making dumb animal choices in some unavoidable social context moment to moment, but there is also the collection of ideas that they *choose* to be when free of that context--it is so entirely and deliberately who they are that they fabricate the identity completely.

I wouldn't go so far as to say that one or the other is the "true" version of any given person, but I can certainly appreciate that line being blurred--and why *shouldn't* the matter be just as complicated in everyone as it is in the academic/popular/historical upper echelon? 



















 Mm hmm. I think that attitude speaks volumes: if it doesn't reinforce your worldview, it isn't real. My grandpa's illness and my grandmother's sacrifice are so negligible to you as to be hilarious, while "speaking generally" about how women want "money, gifts and jobs" is some big fucking truth that the world can't handle. Get your shit together, man, that's no kind of person to be.

I'm getting the sense that, bottom line, I grew up around and seek out intelligent, self-sufficient women; you seem to live in a different world. And you're right, the "real world" you've sunk yourself into doesn't make much sense to me--personally, I think you ought to "red pill" the fuck on out of it. 



















 What the fuck are you laughing at. 



















 That's a funny word, "sacrifice." When I think about it, the first thing that comes to mind is how when my grandfather got Alzheimer's, my grandmother gave him in-home care through a heartbreaking deterioration across several years until it finally took his life. So when I read the claim that men bear all of life's sacrifices for ungrateful women, I have a hard time thinking anything other than "go live a life you dumb fuck." 



















 Listen my friend, I don't know who you are, and I don't know who you think I am, but you're saying a lot of very grand things that don't have much baring on what I'm trying to express.

I'm speaking in support of an approach to men's mental health that addresses uniquely masculine issues without ceding the valuable progress toward gender equality that women have made. You're... I don't know. You're a fan of competition and of "REALITY," I gather. 

But you're not really talking *to* me, at least certainly not about the things I'm talking about. So if you want to talk, let's talk. I'll listen if you will. 



















 Disposable isn't actually the key word: it's a bit semantic, but there's a significant difference between calling men **a** disposable population and **the** disposable population--one is about an issue a group faces, the other situates that issue in opposition to the outsiders' issues. And something as small as that can make the difference between inviting and excluding your potential allies, you know? It can mean the difference between engaging with others and festering in one's own anger. **Words matter.** And  the more one accentuates exclusionary language, the more alienation one takes in and puts out. 



















 I'm sorry, I just have no idea where you're coming from with that. [Men complete suicide at a rate three to four times that of women](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_differences_in_suicide#Rates), and to neatly tie *all* of that suffering in with the misplaced anger of the "men's rights" thing is just careless in every sense of the word.

I can forgive the temptation to homogenize it all though, simply because the angry people are loud and the more benign sufferers don't feel they have a voice--and of course there is some significant crossover, how could there not be. But my point is that one need not (and obviously *should* not) be a misogynist in order to support better health care for a vulnerable population. I think we should find a way for advocates and sufferers to talk about uniquely male problems without crucifying women, and I think that that's a conversation that a lot of men out there are waiting for. 



















 Yeah, I was trying to have a conversation about compassion, and you came in with some spiel about how competition is the essence of life. Unrelated, misanthropic. 



















 I think that what your talking about is a very real phenomenon: a Great Male Anger that can barely keep track of what it's angry about, because that might mean confronting the injustice of its entitlements; it instead rails against some fictive hyper-powerful feminism, and is now parading through this thread in full force.

I *don't* think, however, that that adequately accounts for the astronomical male suicide rate. There is also a Great Male Sadness that affects men like the father described in this article; it doesn't seek special privileges so much as identity and understanding. And I'm frustrated to see the ignorant anger drowning out the gentler sadness in conversation, here and elsewhere. 



















 My friend, there's no other sense in which your interjections jive with the conversation:

Some guy:
 It IS harder to be a man in today's society.

Me:

 my point is that it's not a competition.

You chime in:

This statement flies in the face of overwhelming evidence that nature , life, evolution, etc is nothing but competition. [...] Pretending this isn't a fact is the basest form of ignorance.

I'd counter that the basest form of ignorance might involve cherry-picking context free sentence fragments from a conversation about suicide as a platform to launch into your unrelated platform of general misanthropy, but you do you. 



















 Life is a competition between men and women as to who is more victimized by modern society, and pretending otherwise is the basest form of ignorance. Cool. Got it. 



















 Well, if that's all you're saying, then you've said it, I've heard it, have a good one. 



















 Well, it's clearly a statement of opinion. *But anyway.*

I don't know that I'm following your point. How does the privileged status of women, as you perceive it, affect society's ability to provide better support for men in any meaningful way? 



















 I'm sure many people agree with you, and many people disagree with you; my point is that it's not a competition. 



















 I think there's a lot of poignancy to your last paragraph, about how young men are being prepared by their fathers for a world that doesn't need them. I also think that that poignancy stands on its own, and that contrasting that issue with feminist concerns or lamenting the support available to women wouldn't add anything to your well-made point but a superimposed binary conflict. The funny thing is--and I say this with my tongue at least partway in my cheek--I literally can't think of a better example of a group being let down by patriarchy than what you describe. But elsewhere in this thread, I see men leading with that sort of male/female conflict, dwelling on it, even reveling in it a bit.

So that's a subtle distinction, perhaps, but it is an important one: there's no reason for male advocacy to be advanced in opposition to the gains made by women. When men start this conversation by saying that it it's an inevitably binary issue, or that men are "the disposable sex" and women by extension have it better, it seems to be picking a weird fight with the wrong people--particularly given the issues that women all over the world have faced throughout history and continue to face today. We should celebrate the emotional freedom and support afforded to women, and seek it for ourselves without resentment. 



















 I really appreciate your articulation of the problem here, I don't know that I've ever considered it with such clarity--I've often just opted out of the subject because I couldn't imagine identifying with all that rhetorical toxicity. It certainly is sad to see such bitter, aggressive, tribalistic ugliness dominating a conversation that ought to revolve around compassion. 



















 MediaMonkey looks promising, hopefully that works out. Thanks a ton! 




 iTunes sucks. What is the current state of alternative PC podcast listening software? 














 It seems that podcasting is getting bigger all the time every day and all that, and yet there still doesn't seem to be a decent PC podcast player. iTunes has that non-optional "feature" where it continually stops updating feeds that you only listen to occasionally, and it autoplays all your old podcasts  in reverse chronological order unless you build a playlist or put it on shuffle--it's just an inexcusably idiotic setup for a major corporate software release, and I'd like to delete that shit once and for all.

Problem is, there seems to be at least one or two equally boneheaded shortcomings in every alternative I try. This is all I need a podcast grabber to do:

* **Download episodes automatically for offline listening**
* **Play episodes from within the program**
* **Stop playing when an episode concludes**
* **Clean up old episodes once a certain amount of time has passed and/or a certain number of new episodes have been released**
* **Arrange individual feeds alphabetically, and the episodes in all feeds according to most recent release**

That's it. Thing is, *nothing* on PC seems capable of delivering on all five of those requirements. BeyondPod works great on Android, but I do a ton of listening on my laptop while working--each unhelpful iTunes update just drives me nuts all over again.

**So, what halfway decent programs are out there right now? Surely there must be something.** 



















 quick response, thanks! 



















  I'm reading what your saying and blasting holes in it

**Oh please.**

Listen, the fact that we're still arguing about this stupid stupid movie means that we're both crazy. We're two lunatics talking past each other into the void, a cruel parody of any attempt to find meaning in art in the metamodern world. Fine. I accept that, and I hereby embrace it.

I only ever wanted to say that there are plenty of valid reasons to dislike the movie, and to remind *Chappie* fans that their beloved robot friend exists in a world of dominant critical standards and personal subjectivity that allows plenty of space for a negative reaction. The critics aren't crazy, they needn't have their heads up their asses, nor did they see a different movie as so many have suggested. That's all. I never wanted to ruin it for anyone.

But fine! Let's ruin it! Let's "blast holes" in any and every excuse you want to make for it. *Chappie* fucking sucks, and you shouldn't enjoy it; enjoying it is incorrect. You want a nutso crazy person internet argument about a shitty movie? *Let's get nutso.*

**I stand by my central point: your reaction to the character of Chappie will make all the difference in how you respond to this film.** 

That whole journey from a baby to a teen to an independent adult thing? **Bull Good Goddamn Shit.** That idea of expedited growing up isn't bad in itself--that's why it's such a well-worn premise--but the execution here is just ridiculous. Chappie maintains the same preposterous mix of intelligence and idiocy through the entire fucking movie, advancing and regressing at random in whatever contrived direction the plot needs him to go. 

**What teen or adult talks like that? Seriously.** [If Chappie is any sort of adult, he is an adult baby weirdo.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbqV20PwNP0#t=1m18s)* When the story needs him to be smart, he's capable of transcribing consciousness. When the story needs him to be dumb, **he's all kinds of precious about auto theft and knife crime.** Rather than provide Chappie with an *actual* arc toward maturity, the film continually falls back on the **low-effort pathos of shallow cuteness**, because the game as up as soon you see past it.

And hey, remember those two minutes where Chappie was going to become a painter or something? Neil Blomcamp sure doesn't **"Chappie, you must always be creative!" What a fucking joke.** The big payoff of his journey into adulthood is to solve everything with guns and brutality. That's a dropped plot line, a lazy resolution and a really shit moral all rolled into one right there.

Which reminds me: ***is* this movie supposed to be for kids? I had no idea.** It was rated R in my country, which means it's intended for adults and that children can't be admitted without a guardian--I sure as hell wouldn't want my kid internalizing all this grisly, glorified, consequence-free violence. **We're either selling paramilitary gun worship to children, or we're selling Mommy Daddy Doodoo Baby bullshit to adults. Fuck all that.**

So, that is the context in which we arrive at all the plot holes. **CONSCIOUSNESS. DAT:** I think I've said my piece on that, and only wish to add that **that development is not trivial, it is not the tiniest of things, it is the climactic resolution of the entire goddman movie.** I mean... just... fuck. There's making your peace with the little things, sure, but then then there's consciousness dot fucking dat.

**Your explanation of that walking out with the key thing:** Here's what I'm imagining: if I had a star employee who made my company billions and who I really respected, he'd get an office instead of a cubicle. I wouldn't laugh in his face during his proposals. I might go out of my way to ensure that no other employees threaten him with a fucking gun on company property during work hours, and might facilitate swift disciplinary action if an episode like that ever transpired. **Nothing that happens in the film indicates anything like the relationship of respect you're describing.** But even if it did, you still ought to take that one and only robot army key pretty goddamn seriously. Some kind of contingency plan for if it goes missing, some kind of GPS tracking or something. I mean, it's a security company. Just... just... fuck! You know? That's not a small thing!

**Anyway, I'm tired of thinking about fucking *Chappie*.** If you want to keep doing this, then I guess you can "blast holes" in another one in five of my arguments, and I can write another essay tomorrow night because I'm crazy. **Or** maybe we can do the friendly internet handshake, and I can go back to thinking that even if I don't like the movie, it's fine if others do. Maybe you'll agree that disliking *Chappie* is perhaps a not entirely unreasonable position, that even if you liked it, it's fine if others don't. That's all I really want, man. Can we do that?

 nbsp;

^* ^all ^due ^respect ^to ^the ^adult ^babies ^out ^there, ^we're ^all ^weirdos. 



















 Mmm-hmm. So, you're trying to push me toward an extreme position here, and I'll not have it, thank you. I didn't say transcribing consciousness into one big file called CONSCIOUSNESS.DAT was tautologically *impossible*, I said it was a groaner, and given that it's facilitated by a being who can't get a handle on impersonal pronouns or how murder works, I think "groaner" it putting it quite mildly.

And that isn't *one* detail that I'm "blowing out of proportion," I've only ever characterized it as one laughably implausible plot turn among many. The movie's dumb, okay? I'll go that far. It's a dumb movie, and dumb movies only work if you're having a good time. I didn't, because none of the characters resonated with me, and Chappie actively annoyed the shit out of me.

And please, look at the substance of my argument rather than nitpicking it: if you had a good enough time with this movie to overlook its flaws, then good for you. But its critics are not a bunch of fun-hating obsessive compulsives who took against it because we're full of hate or something. A lot of sensible, joyful, movie-loving people think this movie sucks, and *Chappie*-lovers ought to make their peace with that. 



















 The issue isn't whether a bunch of consoles could provide a quick and dirty mainframe; it's whether they can unlock human consciousness in a file called CONSCIOUSNESS.DAT--sorry, that's a groaner for me. But as I said, you'll either be charitable or uncharitable toward that kind of thing depending on whether you're charmed by the Stabby Baby Mommy Daddy Gangsta stuff, and I just wasn't at all. 



















 ...

What are you talking about? Is anyone paying for your opinion? 



















 Not at all, I love movies. 



















 Not at all, just making a case for my reaction to the movie. 



















 Well, that does explain why so many people never realized that this movie sucks*[OHHHHHHHHHHHH](http://i.imgur.com/r73VJe3.gifv)* 



















 If that's your bar for "compelling as fuck," then again, god bless. Just appreciate that it isn't everyone's. 



















 Quick remider to the *Chappie* street team on here:

 *If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it.*
 
 *Consider posting constructive criticism / an explanation when you downvote something, and do so carefully and tactfully.*
 
 -- [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)

So. Listen *Chappie* fans, I'm glad you liked the movie. Life is hard and you have to take your enjoyments where you can get em--I don't want to deprive you of any happiness.

*BUT* I don't think it's any great mystery why a movie about an **idiot baby-talking gangster** didn't land with a lot of people. If you saw a compelling character there then that's cool; I saw **Jar Jar Fucking Binks with a knife and a gold chain**.

How you respond to the character probably goes a long way toward how you then feel as the dingbat sci-fi elements pile up, and sweet jesus do they ever. 98% artificial intelligence... just a few red bulls to go! A bunch of PS4s unlock a transhumanist paradigm shift that fits neatly into a file called CONSCIOUSNESS.DAT. **"You know that one and only key to our entire paramilitary robot army? Just bring it back when you can, please."**

Chappie has the entire internet in his brain, but can't put together what's going on when he robs and stabs people--and boy howdy, this ostensibly heroic robot sure does perpetrate a lot of dumbass violence, doesn't he? **Yes, I get that he's only hurting/killing people because he's a fucking moron. No, that doesn't endear him to me.**

I won't say you're wrong for liking this whatever-the-fuck-it-was, but you are, my friends, very *very* wrong if you think this movie is unassailable. 



















 Is that meant to be DVI? If so, I'm interested!
 




 [wanted] Cheap (or free?) PC monitor with HDMI 














 Hey Nashville, anybody have a PC monitor that they'd be willing to part with at a low low price? I'm setting up a new PC on the cheap, and the only thing I really need in a monitor is an HDMI or DVI hookup. Thanks! 



















 Well, let's look at it:

There is a specific reason that this war was the setting of the novel: not because of who America was, not because of who Germany was, but because Vonnegut was there: "That was I. That was me." He didn't write about some greater or lesser massacre than Dresdon, he wrote about the massacre he attended. To the extent that he situates the Dreson bombing geopolitically, it had no particular strategic value and was enacted as the revenge of one agreed-upon conception of a nation against another, perpetrated by soldiers on civilians.

In the face of that massacre (for Vonnegut at least), all geopolitics simply disappeared. And you and I can comfortably think, "well, the Nazi government was doing horrible things, and when you look at these killings against these other killings..." and there's truth there. But this book was about a different truth: a massacre is a massacre is a massacre.

So, it's preposterous to me that this book should have some historical responsibility to *be about* something else, particularly as far as that involves contextualizing military campaigns for christ's sake. "[T]here's nothing intelligent to say about a massacre."

What does the imagined critic want, a chapter on how bad Hitler was? We already know, that's not the point, and those justifications only distance you from the reality of what it actually looks like when you burn tens of thousands of conscious human men, women and children.

You might respond to that with tears, you might rejoice in righteous sadism. You might become unstuck in time, never quite able to make sense of what causes anything again. 



















 Yeah, I'd say any criticism of *Slaughterhouse Five* that so clearly misses the point need not be extrapolated in any sense.

 lest they walk away not realizing that [...] we should not cry for them that one of their cities was bombed into oblivion

And I wonder if you missed the point too, my friend. 



















 Lot's of energy and little focus? Oh no! WHY ISN'T MY DOG ACHIEVING!? 




 "New Hollywood" beyond the white male outsider? 














 While not an expert, I'm a big fan of the 60s and 70s [New Hollywood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hollywood) era in American film. That said, I rewatched *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest* the other day for the first time in a few years, and was struck by two things: 1) the film is an extraordinarily rich and sensitive portrait of a very diverse group of white men, and 2) not so much anyone else--Chief has his moments of course, but that's about it. And if someone told me that the movie, for all its sensitivity, was pretty racist and sexist in terms of how it portrayed the much vilified hospital staff, I wouldn't argue with them.

I don't necessarily mean that as a knock against the film, because of course it's allowed to operate within its own scope, and in that sense it's a beautiful movie, maybe even a great one. But it got me thinking about New Hollywood protagonists in general, and how the heroes of that era were so often disillusioned counter-cultural white men, generally straight. When you look at the era's dominant themes of systemic oppression and broken American promises, it seems strange that we've almost exclusively canonized white men as mouthpieces of the movement.

**So I guess I'm basically looking for movie recommendations outside of the hip white male myopia.** What are some films, either of that era or in that ethos, that embody the **themes**, the **poetry**, the **cool** and the **humor** of the 70s New Hollywood outside the white male antihero paradigm? Looking for something different both in terms of the stories told and the people behind the camera, while retaining that subversive, thoughtful and entertaining spirit. 



















 ***Being John Malkovich***, besides being a trip in itself, could easily be read as a commentary on the general practice of altering one's mind; I think you'll find it quite relevant to your interests. You'll also find an engaging mix of profundity and batshittery in ***Repo Man***, ***Eraserhead***, ***My Winnepeg*** and ***Brazil***, while a more demandingly arty, introspective journey might wind through ***Solaris***, ***The Seventh Seal*** and/or ***Contempt***. Approach ***Antichrist*** at your own risk. 



















 Ah, gotcha. Well, it's not my sense that Fry himself is presenting this view as anything groundbreaking; it's simply the side of the argument--ancient as it is--that resonates with him.

To your point though, I can very much agree that if people are calling this "devastating" in the sense that the argument is new to them, they are in fact themselves new to a very old argument. 



















 Seems like we're talking past each other a bit here. To clarify, I'm not making an argument for "relative truth" or some such, I'm only arguing for philosophical charity, and perhaps a friendly touch of humility.

I invoked the Christian plurality here simply to demonstrate that this is a subject that has not thusfar been conclusively "solved" by pure rationality (as in mathematical truths) nor can it really be supported empirically (as in proper psychological theories). There are ways of approaching truth in other studies that don't seem to help us much here--that's not to say that there is no truth, just that we can't know it in the same sense that 1+1=2 or that the Earth orbits the sun and all that.

Because there are still arguments going on within and without classical apologetics, I wouldn't automatically assume that anyone arrived at their position through hypocrisy and negligence, that's all. 



















 Well, I'll bite. Why is a general presumption of intelligence and good faith when engaging with varied beliefs incompatible with the study of psychology? 



















 I don't think that that's fair. Whatever your personal answer to the "problem of evil" is, other people of faith have very different answers to it--it then stands to reason that someone might studiously engage with the question from another angle and arrive at the conclusion that there is no satisfactory answer.

If there were *one* tautological Christian answer then that'd be one thing, but the plurality of Christian responses means that one could in good faith arrive at a non-Christian answer as well. 



















 I'd really like to ask any given stranger what their conception of god is, ask what last moved them to tears, find some secret hope we both share for ourselves and mankind and promise to kindle it in each other forever, and then tell them I love them and really mean it.

It kind of breaks my heart that I can't. 



















 Weekenders! Good show. 



















  Given time the good comments will rise to the top.

That's wishful thinking. A large portion of the internet will always vote for that which most validates their worldview while requiring the least amount of effort to engage with. That will hardly ever be an ideal editorial system, and when the topic is philosophy it's practically toxic to good conversation. A balanced moderation policy is crucial to maintaining any quality aggregate. 



















 Yeah. This is pretty fucking embarrassing. 



















 It's an old expression. As a society, we've really been hot-fucking in the proverbial ass. 



















 While I appreciate the concession, your point clearly does *not* stand--your initial post claimed that they wanted to be "**the** subreddit about gender," whereas their stated goal is literally the opposite of that: to be just one platform, addressing a specific point of view.

It's rude to barge into other peoples' conversations, particularly if you only want to talk about how an issue affects you. You did that to a bunch of feminists and the issue was **rape**--I really don't know what the hell you expected. They owe you nothing. 



















 Funny, it's my understanding that they want to be "**a** subreddit for thoughtful content - serious or silly - related to gender, and intended for women's perspectives."

When you find yourself summing up other people in simplistic terms, a good rule of thumb is fuck off. 




 Is there a way I can use a USB keyboard to compensate for an unusable touchscreen? 














 I recently busted my cheap android tablet, and the screen has lost most of its touch functionality. I do have a little USB keyboard though, and I've found that I can use that to get through my lockscreen, launch apps, do very very basic stuff like that.

What I'd like to do though, is find a customizable app that will let me use the keyboard to virtually touch different places on the screen. For example, I press "F1" and the device recognizes a touch in the upper right corner, "F2" and it's halfway down the middle, hold "Alt" and it simulates dragging, that kind of thing.

If this app exists, I can't for the life of me figure out which search terms will get me to it. Does anyone know if such a theoretical Broken Screen Helper app is out there? I'd happily give a few bucks to keep this device functional while I search for a replacement. 



















 No idea what any one of those things has to do with the other, but you seem to be on the right track there, champ. 



















 That Jason Mraz song "I'm Yours," the lyric "it's our God-forsaken right to be loved." That's either a hard fucking turn through existential antitheism, or he's a dipshit who was trying to make getting his dick sucked sound important. 



















 I should clarify where I'm coming from here: I wouldn't describe myself as confused about homosexuality (though some here would disagree, most likely); I'm wholeheartedly on the side of LGBT acceptance and equality.

My interest in this thread was more rooted in trying to understand traditions different from my own, and in challenging myself to approach such differences with an eye toward shared humanity rather than ideological conflict--it's why I subscribe to this sub and many other subs outside my day-to-day experience.

I'm hesitant to express my negativity here, because I recognize that I'm an outsider and have no right to expect this community to cater to my worldview, but this thread has been a very disheartening read for me. These are all the same arguments that I hear from American neoconservatives, slippery sloping through all the same generalizations and falling into all the same logical fallacies.

The answers that draw on Sharia and the Quran are the most edifying, but I have little sympathy for what they espouse: apparently arbitrary law, violently enforced--these verses would be right at home on placards carried by the Westboro Baptist Church.

And for what it's worth, none of these arguments hold water if you're not predisposed to oppose homosexuality. /u/socketeer102, the answer I'd give to each of your examples would be to ask what is the good and what is the harm. I don't know any zoophiles or necrophiles. I do have LGBT people in my life though, and I've seen suffering where there was intolerance and joy where there is love, over and over again.

I confess that this has been a step toward understanding, but away from friendship. All the same, I'll continue to look for both. 



















 I'd just like to say that as a non-Muslim, I'm watching this thread with interest. I would love to see some thoughtful, in-depth responses on this subject. 



















 I haven't seen the 2002 version of *Solaris*, but the Tarkovsky film is truly great, and rivals *2001* in my opinion. There's a clear connection to *Interstellar* too in the way that both films address the limits of human knowledge, both scientifically and as subjective emotional beings.

 Yup, their whimsical penguin companions can never find love. Real problem in the UK.

 [text] Adam's Curse by William Butler Yeats 














 We sat together at one summer's end,

That beautiful mild woman, your close friend,

And you and I, and talked of poetry.

I said, 'A line will take us hours maybe;

Yet if it does not seem a moment's thought,

Our stitching and unstitching has been naught.

Better go down upon your marrow-bones

And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones

Like an old pauper, in all kinds of weather;

For to articulate sweet sounds together

Is to work harder than all these, and yet

Be thought an idler by the noisy set

Of bankers, schoolmasters, and clergymen

The martyrs call the world.'

. . . . . . . . . And thereupon

That beautiful mild woman for whose sake

There's many a one shall find out all heartache

On finding that her voice is sweet and low

Replied, 'To be born woman is to know-

Although they do not talk of it at school-

That we must labour to be beautiful.'

I said, 'It's certain there is no fine thing

Since Adam's fall but needs much labouring.

There have been lovers who thought love should be

So much compounded of high courtesy

That they would sigh and quote with learned looks

Precedents out of beautiful old books;

Yet now it seems an idle trade enough.'


We sat grown quiet at the name of love;

We saw the last embers of daylight die,

And in the trembling blue-green of the sky

A moon, worn as if it had been a shell

Washed by time's waters as they rose and fell

About the stars and broke in days and years.


I had a thought for no one's but your ears:

That you were beautiful, and that I strove

To love you in the old high way of love;

That it had all seemed happy, and yet we'd grown

As weary-hearted as that hollow moon.

 Well, yeah. See the literal millions of charismatic villains and anti-heroes in every narrative medium across human history.

You're probably more interested in *how* to make repellent characters likable though, which is a tougher question. For me, I think that the most liked "evil" characters have similar desires and motivations to us, but they lack those inhibitors that keep us moral. They're the devil on your shoulder, the id freed from the nuance of the ego.

In that sense, most compelling villains are ironically enough grounded in a relatable sense of righteousness. **Walter White (Breaking Bad)**: we all get sick of taking shit from people, he just pushes it to murder. **The Joker (Dark Knight)**: we all feel like there's something fucked in the regular social order, he just pushes it to anarchy. **Satan (Paradise Lost)**: we all want our freedom, he just pushes it to an unholy war against God Almighty. Villains have a good point, badly made.

The important balance, then, is in making sure the audience has more of a connection to the villain than his/her victims. I think there are two main ways to achieve this, without much middle ground: 1) you give him/her a story so sympathetic that the audience overlooks his/her faults, or 2) you make them so fucked up that their humanity catches the audience off guard and pulls their full focus--either way, the audience should feel that the villain reflects something in themselves. When you know **Professor Snape's (Harry Potter)** backstory, you'll forgive him any classroom tyrany; when **Jaime (Game of Thrones)** puts his life on the line for Brienne, it's such a shift that it upstages the child murder stuff.

**Tl;dr:** To whatever end you make them human, make it count.
