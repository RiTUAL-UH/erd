 Long time since I've seen one of these self-promoting Minecraft players, who in their head, are better than anyone, and different from everyone else. Sorry, man, this shit's getting old.

 The Norwegian Version seemed much more valuable than the others, so that's nice to know i guess. Thanks ;) 



















 Well, it's a good book so far, so rarity isn't much of an issue. 



















 I thought so until i found out all Nordic versions were printed the same year. Well, if it's not rare, i do not care, the book is really interesting from what i have read already. Well, thank you for wanting to help, Sir and/or madam. 



















 They are in Swedish, Printed in 1957 yes, but after the ones in Norwegian. I was a bit unclear , but yes mine is in Norwegian, sorry about that. 



















 I'm Reading **Aku-Aku The Secrets of Easter Island, By Thor Heyerdahl** when I am at the Cabin, and at home **A Man Called Ove, By Fredrik Backman** 



















 Not in the original language though 




 Purchased a cabin, found a few interesting books 














 Hey here /r/books ! My Family Recently pruchased a cabin here in Norway and we found some books left by the previous owner. There was one book that made me wonder how rare that book was. I love books so i would never sell it, but knowing the rarity of the books i own is nice. The book was Aku-Aku the Secret of Easter Island, First edition 1957, written by Thor Heyerdahl. All other first editions i found online were not Norwegian, so not printed in 1957. It seems to be in a good condition and i already started reading it. i was wondering if any of you guys know how rare it is? My bookshelf is sorted in Year, Rarity, Author. So knowing where to put it is also nice. Thank you on beforehand !

And i also found a bible from 1871 which was quite interesting, made with what seems to be made with a Hectograph. For some reason i put it in the closet where we keep the wine glasses. 

Sadly i cannot provide pictures of the books, as i left the books at the cabin where i keep my books.

EDIT: Took the well used bible home, some photos: http://imgur.com/a/GFBcH 



















 Push space to jump, then push R after releasing space. That works for me atleast
