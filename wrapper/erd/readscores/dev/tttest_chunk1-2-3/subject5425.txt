 Seems like your food budget is extremely high...you could easily cut that in half I would think 



















 I have figured up how much it costs us for mortgage and utilities.  Me and my boyfriend each put $200 in our joint account a week.  Our expenses are about $1200 a month so we have extra in there for home maintenance, a snowblower, lawn mower, etc.  We each pay our own car insurance, cell phones, and 1/2 of the food...keeps things simple, I only write 3 checks a month from the joint account and all the bills are paid.

 Read to your kids alot....as soon as they are 3 or so, start reading chapter books, like just one chapter each night... choose classics like Charlottes Web.  It will give them a love for reading when they learn that  not every story ends in 15-30 minutes...and kids who love to read are smarter, because they learn so much

 No, but I am so glad that I just let go...I got three wonderful kids and thats all I need...my point is that divorcees nowadays don't sit around eating bonbons all day 



















 nope...raised 3 kids for 20 years, and received child support until the youngest turned 8, and a whole whopping $3000 one time payment of alimony...I refused to fight about it in front of the kids and he got nasty so I just signed the papers...oh and since the divorce he has literally had NOTHING to do with the kids, not even a birthday card...and he earns roughly 100k a year, while I made $20,000...but I do know this, I am MUCH happier now

 Im no expert, but it sounds to me like you are watering too often...with my plants I water about once a week, being sure to let the top inch or so of soil dryout before I water again, and yes, remove all dead leaves, this will help the plant....when I water I water until it runs out of the bottom, making sure to let it drain well and not leave any water in the saucer, since many plants do not like their feet wet
Hope this helps

 My charter bill for the same services was about 185 a month, I called a couple of times to see if I could get it lowered, no dice, so I cancelled my cable completely,about 2 months ago which dropped my bill to 95 a month, they called me tonight and offered to give me back my cable for $103 for the next 12 months.  I took it because my bf loves sports and it's only another $8 a month.

 The Fact alone that 4 BILLION DOLLARS was spent on the Mid-term elections should be a wake-up call to everyone.  Just think about what that money could have done to make our country a better place to live!
Public funding only for campaigns really needs to happen.  Our representatives don't spend very much time working for us at all.  They are out fundraising most of the time.  I read somewhere recently that they usually are in Washington 2 days a week tops.

 Point taken.  You are right.
 



















 I'm serious...I wish people would stop judging other people by their skin color, religious beliefs, orientation etc.  I am not proud to be a white american. 



















 I cannot understand why this seems to be a partisan issue at all.  Sexual abuse is the same regardless of your political or religious beliefs.  Why would these politicians speak out in support of sexual abuse?

Do you give money to homeless people with signs?   



















 I never looked at her as a "charity case"  She was a kind, loving woman who did the right thing, as did her husband and healthcare costs made her a charity case 



















 wouldn't you consider a sick person with say cancer needing treatment or someone who needs insulin to treat diabetes as someone who might be desperate?  And where I live anyways if that person does not have a college degree they are probably making $15/hour or less...now if you add health problems, or mental health issues, caring for aging parents, addiction or any other stress, don't ya think we need to help them out?  and collectively we can make sure that those basic needs are met.  I think you are assuming people just don't want to work or pay, they just want a free ride, and sure those people are out there, but they are in the minority
For example we had a family friend when I was young who was 58 and her husband died of brain cancer.  She had health issues herself don't remember what I was young, but I do know she had metal rods in her for something. She had been a stay at home mom and her husband had worked for a place that built big bulldozers and equipment.  Well they weren't rich, but had a nice home and had saved for retirement.  When her husband died they had drained most of the savings on his medical bills then when she got sick and had to have surgery and therapy etc. she had nothing left.  She applied for aid and was denied because she owned a house, so she sold her house and moved into low income housing, had to get rid of her dog because he couldn't be there it was just such a sad story and she was such a nice sweet lady.  And all this time she was so sick too.  I guess that has made an impact on me and I don't want to see that happen to anyone. 



















 I think you see taxes as robbery, and I don't so that is where we disagree...I am all for universal healthcare, because I don't want people whether they are family or strangers to die without healthcare so that I can have a little more money in my 401k 



















 I would hope that my life is more important than anyones money, and if  i was starving, I can't say I wouldn't steal out of someones garden or something to stay alive....do you think that is bad? 



















  I am outraged. I'm outraged that people are insured who should be paying out of pocket or going without treatment. I'm outraged that, to pay for it, the government has to either tax (meaning I lose money), borrow (keeping the interest rate low which means since I'm an investor rather than a borrower I lose money), or inflate the currency (which, again, since I have investments makes them worth less and I lose money

You believe some people who can't afford to pay should go without treatment?  Not everyone can afford it, but everyone is somebody's  
son, daughter, mother, father, brother, sister, or grandparent...if poor people get sick, do you believe that we should leave them to die? Is money more important that a persons life? 



















 Well, I'd be super suspicious of a hello kitty wallet too /s
 



















 Very well said.  I don't agree with you  about the size of government or that it is evil, it is the politics you cannot trust, but your position on vaccines makes sense to me.  I think government should be bigger with lots more us citizens working in and for the government, so that more people benefit and are better represented.  I am pro choice, and completely agree that the government has no business telling you what to do with your body

 My honest guess at this is that the black guy who was carrying the concealed weapon would have been shot by the police when they arrived. 



















 I guess all politics aside, I would feel uncomfortable attending a church where people felt the need to carry a weapon. 



















 I think they also underestimate how Bernie can motivate people to vote.  Hillary is just the same ole same ole...Bernie gives you something to vote FOR not against. 



















 So the solution is.....more guns?

 If a company cannot afford to pay a livable wage, that company is not viable and should close its doors.  Raising wages allows more people to have money to spend into the economy, increasing demand, and therefore creating jobs

 Ex-yooper here...planning to move back within the next three months..I have a sister and a cousin up there who are Bernie supporters.  Jobs are essential to the UP...the economy is complete shit up there...most people up there are pro-union.  The economy is based on mining and logging.

 I don't worry about being scammed if the person isn't really homeless, I figure if I give them money, that's money that isn't going to make a CEO richer, and it will help someone out.

 Bernie has stated that he needs public support on these policies...After he wins, his supporters will need to call and email their reps on these issues to show support.  That's how things can change.  We will need to put public pressure on them. 







































 I agree, and I think Bernie has proven in the past that he will get people out to vote.

 "Sanders is merely the latest version of Howard Dean, another Vermont elected official who surged in early polls by appealing to the liberal base of the Democratic Party and running against the establishments early favorite, who in 2003 was Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry."

Yup...and Kerry couldn't get people out to vote.  Maybe the "Establishment" needs to listen to what the actual voters want.

 Just a little more common sense from Bernie 



















 This is a ploy to keep the anti equal rights crowd happy while the equal rights crowd says, "Well, his wife is for it, so...

 *I'm not talking about personal protection. I'm talking about, for me, the reason why I didn't have a problem with it is I just think it pulls Scouting into a whole larger political and cultural debate, as opposed to just saying Scouting is about camping and citizenship and merit badges and service awards, instead of pulling all these other issues out there. And I was just hoping that they could stay focused on that, that's all," said Walker.*

 Well I match up at 98% with Bernie, but to be honest, if Bernie wasn't running, I have no clue who I would vote for either, or even if I would vote at all 



















 Hmmm...makes you wonder how insane this headline will seem in another 20 years or so 



















 Check out Sanders...you might be surprised

 I agree, but I am glad that it happened, because as a white person who has grown up with white privilege, it really opened my eyes to racism and helped me to understand better where they are coming from...Black lives DO matter, and we need to figure out how to put an end to the racism that threatens minorities everyday of their lives
