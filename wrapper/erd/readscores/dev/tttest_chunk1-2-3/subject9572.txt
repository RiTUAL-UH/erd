 I think the special prices are relative to the monthly prices, not relative to the one year price. You get a savings on the one, two or three year prices if you use any of the monthly prices as your reference.

 Particles from the sun, such as those from a solar flare, travel much slower than light and therefore the delay. 



















 The article loses credibility when the title states "... Should Hit Early Tuesday Morning (2/13/2011)"  Tuesday is not 2/13. 



















 Not really.  The difference between a hard drive and a solid state drive is more than semantics.  They are physically quite different approaches to storage.  I'm betting it's an error in the ad.

 In terms of solar masses, the MW black hole is not 1,000 but 4,000,000.  The article states the M87 black hole 6.6 billion solar masses, while the MW black hole is 4 million solar masses.

6.6 billion / 4 million = 1650 so the M87 black hole is a 1650 times more massive than the MW black hole.

 mr_lightswitch is correct, I should have stated "... over a thousand times more massive that the Milky Way's central black hole"

 Too late, I closed my account with B of A 15 years ago.  The reason? They said my account was overdrawn.  I checked my account balance and had more than $2K in it.  I called them up and they said, oh sorry we made a mistake.  Two weeks later same thing happened so I went into the branch.  They looked up my account and said, now Mr. Sheridan, we've had this conversation with you before and this is becoming a recurring problem.  I said, no shit, this is a recurring problem. Now close my account and give me my balance right now. They finally realized there was a different Mr. Sheridan whose account was overdrawn.  It was disturbing they couldn't even keep the accounts of two people with the same last name straight.

 Good to see we have an active subreddit here and thanks for the advice.  I think I'll steer clear for the time being unless I watch something I must post.  Then I'll post and stay confined to responses to avoid spoilers. 

By the way, just noticed the up/down votes are knives ... nice.

 Well, at least up to a mass of 3.54.5 TeV for a range of theoretical models that postulate extra dimensions. Those were the ones that bothered me most.

 I am shocked ... simply shocked! 



















 Example 2:  The cones on the engine inlets moved in and out to account for the shock wave developed by traveling multiple times the speed of sound. Without this feature the engines' compressors would stall at high mach numbers due to lack of airflow into the engine. 



















 Impressive aircraft in many respects.  Example 1: It was designed to leak fuel while on the ground (ok, maybe they couldn't help this) then seal itself as thermal expansion of joints took effect when the aircraft came up to temperature due to heating from air friction at operational speeds.

 Apparently you don't see the number of down votes you're receiving and recognize you're way off base, at least with respect to leading scientific theories.  

Maybe you're starting your own dark matter theory here on Reddit.  If it blows your dress up, go for it. 



















 Once you create a facility that deep, you get multiple uses since many experiments are corrupted by cosmic rays. The mine is used to detect muons (product of cosmic ray collisions), neutrinos and dark matter.   



















 I've stopped trying to figure out the rationale for up vs down votes. 



















 Not to be argumentative, but dark matter is not the same as a black hole, at least according to the leading theories.  Dark matter appears to be more or less uniformly distributed within each galaxy, not necessarily between the galaxies and not tied up in individual localized black holes.  It is affected by gravity but not other forces such as electromagnetism.  Therefore dark matter is gravitationally attracted to galaxies as is ordinary matter.  

Dark matter is the only explanation scientists have for the orbital velocities of galaxies in clusters and the rotational speed of individual galaxies (spinning on their own axes).  Without the extra unseen mass explained by dark matter, galaxies would not behave as they do as they spin.

The vast majority of the dark matter in the universe is believed to be made up of nonbaryonic particles, and thus not formed out of atoms and not wrapped in the confines of black holes.

 At the rate it is traveling (~17 km/sec) it will take Voyager about 60 billion years to arrive at Andromeda, our nearest galaxy at a distance of about 2 million light years.  Keeping in mind our entire universe is a only ~13 billion years old, it is doubtful the sun and earth, let alone the human race, will even exist if/when it arrives.  Doesn't sound like a practical solution.

 I wouldn't rule out HDTV just yet.  The technology has caught on enough that sales overtook SD in 2008 
http://broadcastengineering.com/news/hdtv-sales-overtake-sd-models-1110/

I may be a bit biased here but unless you're watching an SD YouTube or other web vid or an oldy, HD is clearly better than SD.  Aspect ratio alone makes a statement on the screen, let alone resolution.  And 5.1 rocks!

 By "accepts wind from any direction" I mean from any direction in the horizontal plane, not from above or below.  This is true because the device is circularly symmetric so wind striking it from N, S, E or W will have the same affect on the turbine's rotation. 



















 Yea, would like to see some numbers.  The best we have to go on is "... final costs of about $1.50/watt rated output, which is roughly 2/3 the cost of comparable bladed units."  Not a huge improvement but significant enough to pursue if it can be put to practice. 

I don't think the bladeless turbine needs a swivel base since it accepts wind from any direction unlike a bladed turbine - another advantage for the bladeless design.

 Thank you for that explanation.  Another response from an expert - two for two today.

Follow up question to your statement that we can measure dark energy.  How is that done?  Is the estimate based on the acceleration of the universe's expansion or some other method?   



















 Wow, a response from an expert - thank you.  

Do you think the same is true with dark energy, that is no connection with hidden dimensions?

 Actually if you consider both Northern and Southern hemispheres each have a Vernal and Autumnal equinox, just 180 deg out of phase with each other, the article is correct in saying the Vernal equinox happens twice each year.  



















 Correction, GMT-7 not GMT-8, at least for the next couple weeks until the rest of the world goes onto daylight savings time.  I really hate that the U.S. decided to mess around with the daylight savings time dates. 



















 The article is a bit misleading when it says the Vernal equinox occurs twice a year.  Actually an equinox occurs twice a year but one is the Vernal and the other is the Autumnal.  They sort of clear it up in the last part of the sentence when they mention both. 



















 You are correct but the planned shut down won't be for a while.  In a couple weeks they will start slamming the beams together to achieve 7 TeV collisions and keep that up for 18 - 24 months.  After the 7 TeV tests they plan to shut LHC down for a year or more. They need the break to complete repairs for an electrical failure that occurred in 2008 and to prepare the collider for the maximum 14 TeV collisions.  That'll be when the real sparks fly.

 That is sufficiently close to sunset for the satellite to still be in view of the Sun and then pass into the Earth's shadow. 



















 CliffDropOver is correct.  Eventually the satellite will pass into the Earth's shadow and appear to fade away.  How close in time to sunset/sunrise were you when you saw the satellite fade?

 No one has mentioned security yet. OSX has security vulnerabilities just like any OS, but Apple does not respond to these vulnerabilities as quickly as they should. Microsoft has shown an increased vigilance that Apple could learn from. Because Apple has enjoyed decades of small percentage market penetration theyve lulled themselves into thinking theyre more secure, but its really because they havent been attacked. The numbers are growing dramatically, and in my view it's simply a matter of time before the Mac OS experiences a big time hack. This is from a Mac fan boy. 



















 I believe you are correct.  The sun is much larger with respect to the planet sizes than shown at any of the planet scale slider settings.  Also the planets are much too large in relation to their orbit sizes when the setting is at 1.0.

 I am an electrical engineer and of all the classes I had at the undergraduate level, thermodynamics was the worst.  I could relate entropy to chaos but I couldn't translate the concept to "practical" problems. I'll never forget the problem: "A drop of rain falls from the sky into the ocean.  Does the entropy of the universe increase or decrease?" I had the class for 10 weeks and still couldn't get the answer to make intuitive sense.

 Couldn't agree more.  My wife and I who are both Apple fans bought one.  Weren't satisfied with its restrictions so we hacked it with ATVFlash to get more control and access of media not on iTunes.  Hack was too quirky and unreliable so we sold the AppleTV after a couple months and bought a Mac Mini instead.   We realized we needed a much more open media center, not a device that operates through iTunes like a big iPod (or should I say iPad?)

 Magnetism is a subcomponent of light.  Light is an electromagnetic (electric + magnetic) phenomenon where both are intimately and orthogonally coupled.  So yes, the effect of magnetism travels at (not less than) the speed of light.

The answer to your question is yes, the other magnet would continue to repel for the time it took light (electromagnetism) to travel the distance between the two magnets.

 Thanks for the link.  Aldrin's quote is summarized here:
"There is a monolith there, a very unusual structure on this little potato-shaped object that goes around Mars once every seven hours. When people find out about that, they are going to say 'who put that there?'. Well, the universe put it there, or if you choose, God put it there."

 The angle subtended by the black hole would be minuscule compared to the angle subtended by the massive galaxy, assuming the black hole was about midway between the Milky Way and the other galaxy.  This means the black hole would create a very small area of distortion in the image of the galaxy as viewed by a high power telescope (say Hubble).  Although some of the galaxy's image will be directly blocked (absorbed) by the black hole, much of this dark area will be filled in by light being bent (due to gravitational lensing) around the black hole.   



















 Black holes theorized to be at the center of most galaxies are not good candidates for direct observation.  A black hole in the center of a galaxy is obscured by numerous stars, dust and other galactic debris shrouding the center.  That includes the black hole in the center of our galaxy.  Galactic centers are pretty dense areas. 



















 I believe we can estimate the mass of a black hole pretty well for the case you give (a binary system containing a black hole and a star) for the reason you stated.  The path of the visible star is affected in a measurable way.  Scientists can estimate the mass of most visible stars pretty accurately based on distance and brightness.  Given the mass of the visible star and the diameter of its rotation around the unseen object (black hole) they can measure the mass of the black hole fairly accurately.  

I may not understand what you're getting with your comment on the "extra gravity".   You may be thinking that dark matter is matter that falls into a black hole?  If so, that is not dark matter.  Scientists theorize that dark matter is generally distributed around the galaxy and is not localized within black holes.  Although any matter can fall into a black hole (dark or energetic) and increase its mass accordingly.  It's all the same to the black hole.  Once it falls in, it is no longer defined as dark or anything else, it's just added mass to the black hole.

Yes, the black hole's event horizon will increase in size as it becomes more massive and this extra mass is quite measurable when the black hole is paired up with a star.  Other methods can be used to measure a black hole's mass such as gravitation lensing.

Another example of matter that interacts very weakly with other matter is the neutrino.  Neutrinos have almost negligible mass, no charge, travel nearly at the speed of light and do not interact with matter (almost). The mass and speed of neutrinos are still not certain and are being investigated. 



















 Tyson is using the term "us" loosely.  Dark matter does not interact with us as individuals in a way we can measure directly on Earth.  But it does interact with the rest of our Milky Way galaxy and other galaxies as well as larger structures (galaxy clusters).  Astrophysicists have measured the rotation of these galaxies and stars within the galaxies.  They can't explain how the galaxies' rotations occur when they consider only the visible stars.  Keep in mind the rotation is not just the galaxy as a whole but the rotation rates of stars within the galaxies at varying distance from the galactic center. The only explanation that explains the internal rotations is additional mass distributed in and around the galaxies that cannot be seen (dark) and does not interact with electromagnetic energy.  
 



















 Much better video.  Thank you. 



















 A solar system reference frame is defined by the Sun not the Earth.  The Earth revolves around the Sun at many thousands of miles per hour.  If the helicopter is fixed with respect to the Sun, the Earth will immediately either slam into it or zoom away from at many thousands of miles per hour (depending on which side of the earth the helicopter is located with respect to the Earth's motion around the Sun) as it revolves around the Sun.  The pilot will either be crushed by the collision or be left in space to suffocate and freeze.  This won't take 12 hours but seconds
 
Did you possibly mean the Earth as the reference frame?  That is the only reference frame where fractions of a day (12 or 24 hrs) come into play. 



















 Yes, you can have a point fixed in an expanding universe.   Think of an expanding balloon where the surface of the balloon is the reference frame. As the balloon (universe) expands, the point will expand with it.  Locally it will appear fixed but it will be moving away from other fixed points like points on the balloon's surface.  

You don't need to have a center to have a fixed point.  In this analogy, the balloon's surface has no center (the interior of the balloon is not part of the analogy, just the surface).  The same holds true with the universe. 



















 No 



















 Your scenario about a "fixed point in space" is ambiguous.  Space has many frames of reference: the earth, solar system, galaxy, galaxy cluster, super cluster and universe.  Each of these "space" reference frames moves at a different speed and rotates (and expands) at a different rate.  So first clarify your reference frame ... do you really mean the solar system or the earth or something else as your reference frame?  The answer to your question depends entirely on your reference frame.

When I think of a "fixed point in space", I think of the universe. 



















 When it comes to advancing science at this level we often can't predict what the benefits will be.  Consider when the lasing effect was predicted by Einstein then later confirmed in the 60's through the invention of the laser.  Uses for the laser are almost too many to list but I'm guessing Einstein or the inventor or even the science community at large had no idea what the laser would eventually bring to our world.

 I'd say that's a pretty good estimate.  Imagine a plasma tornado 2 to 3 times the size of the Earth. Kind of makes an F5 Earth bound tornado seem tame.

 I concur with what you're saying, but one point of correction:

 Many particles, such as electrons, are considered "point particles" in that they have zero dimension and take up exactly zero space. They have zero mass as well, and as such, travel at the speed of light.

That is not correct. You may be thinking of a photon. An electron does have mass and does not travel at the speed of light, maybe close but not equal to c.  



















 Agreed.  A great many of the empirical tests they ran in '59 would now be run through simulation on a computer.

 I find it very surprising Apple's graphics chipsets don't support H.264 encoding in Macs as late as early 2011 given 1) how firmly Apple supported this standard and 2) the chipset is in iPads but not Macs.  Does Air Parrot perform the same function in software?

 Good question.  I would guess the overall mass of the proton is the determined by the quarks' direct interactions with the Higgs field plus the mass equivalent of the interaction energy between the quarks interacting with the Higgs field.  Otherwise the proton's mass would just reflect the measly sum of the three quarks' mass.

 I have a V shaped scar on my side just below my ribs. Happened when as an 8 year old I was climbing a tree with a friend.  He was out on the end of a branch and i was near the trunk on the same branch.  He climbed out a bit too far and branch gave way. We both fell.  He fell into a mud puddle and I fell onto a wire fence which impaled me in my side.  Luckily no internal organs were damaged but I received 32 stitches in the shape of a V.  I'm amazed I don't have a fear of heights and still like to climb.

 I know, the name is misleading.  They are actually a fairly reputable and unbiased source of information.

It's confusing because you'd think that you should use the apostrophe for the possessive, but in the case of "it" you shouldn't.  The apostrophe is reserved for the contraction of it is. 



















 Check out the D8 interview. My wife attended and during the Q A at 1:26:35 she asked Jobs a good question about DHCP. 
 



















 Good answer - thanks. 



















 That would make much more sense. 



















 That was a request, not a demand. 



















 Camera settings were: 200 mm, f/40 1.6 sec, ISO 6400.  I used three layers of 5% visible light transmission window tinting film.  I think that means there was only 0.05 * 0.05 * 0.05 = 0.000125 (0.0125%) transmission.  That would explain why I needed such a high ISO setting and exposure time.

 Interesting.  I've tried this with other color balloons and red seems to work best.  Some other colors don't pop at all.  That would imply red absorbs this laser light better than other colors. 



















 Electronista has more info on this http://www.electronista.com/articles/12/05/11/domestic.shipments.ups.fedex.unaffected/.  You could be referring to this statement in the article:

A reveal will take place on May 7th that will aim to provoke conversation on what being in business means to Australians. 



















 My wife noticed it while we were catching up on season 6.  She had just interviewed Robert and he showed us the products he's invented.  I wouldn't be surprised if there are other TV commercials of his products on Dexter episodes. 



















 Good point, I should've posted that.  Robert was very careful about spoilers. 



















 She clearly is a non technical person who should not attempt to convey technical concepts. 



















 They have to shut down the LHC every winter because its high energy requirements are not compatible with the sourrounding population's higher energy needs during the winter (i.e. not enough power to do both).

 Freaking weirdest funeral procession I have ever seen, probably due to North Korean editing. Commentators are over the top with emotion. The background moaning is a bit much and clearly looped.

 The light source in the middle of the Einstein ring is a luminous red galaxy (LRG) as stated in the text, not just a single star.  It looks like a star since it's so far away and all of the stars in the galaxy appear to be collapsed to a single blob. Sniperchild is correct that the galaxy has a black hole in the middle, as almost all galaxies do.   



















 ditto 



















 A single atom does not have sufficient density to form a black hole because an atom is mostly empty space - very small nucleus surrounded by a relatively large cloud of light electrons. You have to get rid of the electron cloud and compress the nuclei of multiple atoms to get a sufficiently high density. 



















 The point of the article is that a mass of 3x the sun is sufficient, but just barely, to form a black hole.  This does not mean that all stars with a mass of 3x that of our sun are or become black holes.  It requires special conditions for a black hole of such a low mass to develop from gravitational collapse of a star.  Also, black holes with a mass much less than our sun are postulated to exist.  These primordial black holes do not form from the gravitational collapse of a star but are remnants from the big bang.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordial_black_hole

 Well stated.  

I'm convinced that in addition to science   technology influencing scifi, the converse is true as well.  I'd like to think people who make decisions that affect society in significant ways are influenced by the type of messages Star Trek delivers.  But even if not, positive change can come in small ways by people like us.

 You're right - we know of no planets within a 100 light years that could support life capable of receiving our broadcasts.

However, SETI isn't about someone else receiving our broadcasts - it's about us receiving someone else's broadcasts.  If some day they are received, those transmissions will likely have been traveling much longer than 100 years.

 Tell him to imagine himself poised precariously on a ledge 20 stories above the street. Then tell him he has the potential to release a lot of energy by simply jumping and plummeting to his death. Lots of blood, broken bones and a high probability of losing his life. Where did it all come from? Potential energy that was turned into kinetic energy then impact.

 Yes, the Very Long Baseline Array is impressive, but it is an interferometer with lots of spatial ambiguity.  This array would yield more of a focused main beam with very low sidelobes.  That is one of the reasons the individual arrays are somewhat randomly rather than periodically placed.  

The toy comparison was a bit charged.  I am completely enthralled by the LHC and can't wait for full power operation.  I was only indicating it is small in size compared to this array. 



















 That's like saying "The pixel on a CCD would fit comfortably in this period."  But that's not the entire sensor.  Sure the central region would fit in the LHC, but the entire collection of arrays spans over 3000 km (see the end of the video).  The LHC at about 9 km in diameter is tiny compared to the entire array.  This array would derive its very fine spatial resolution from its large dimension.  That is what makes it impressive, not the central region by itself.  

Admittedly, this array may never be built.  But the scope would be impressive and the performance unprecedented if it were.

 Yes, but in addition the odd shaped earth shows the strength of gravity varying around the globe with the yellow and red areas being the strongest and the blue areas being the weakest.

 What is dark energy and how does it work? 



















 Granted the "dark side" of the moon is an incorrect term (should be far side or opposing side), but it's a term that is generally accepted and understood ... and it makes a great name for an album. 



















 Gold is inert to all chemicals it encounters inside the human body, which is probably why it is used in this application. 



















 Instead, the [near-infrared laser] light excites the free electrons on the gold nanoparticles and causes them to heat up and generate energy, eventually making the cancer cells to explode.

Your guess is probably correct. The expansion/explosion of the cancer cell is likely caused by liquid within the cell that is heated by the gold particles and turned into vapor.

 It depends a lot on what you want to get out of the meet-up, but yes to all of the items you mentioned for Tom's meet-up.  I think this is one of the many methods Tom uses to build a strong community.  For me its a chance to meet and talk with people who are interested in technology.  Generally I find a connection that I didnt expect to make with a few people, and its not always about technology.  That's what makes these meet-ups interesting.  Tom was a very gracious and engaging host and Jennie was very good at introducing each attendee to the group. 

I asked my wife who also attended for her response to your question and this was her reply: 
 
 Definitely meetups are informal and are what you choose to make of them.  Expect to introduce yourself to people and try to find things you have in common. If you go expecting people to start the conversation for you, you may be disappointed. You dont have to imbibe in alcoholic beverages - some will, some wont but its non-discriminatory. 
 
 The subjects in which we engaged last night included:
 
 * Star Trek
 * Captain America/Agents of Shield
 * A guy walked by with an xkcd shirt on so that made for easy conversation
 * Whether to add an SSD to your computer
 * Whos still using XP (through no fault of their own)
 * The future of journalism (and what does it even mean)
 * Youtube subscriptions vs. Podcast subscriptions (and is it too hard)

 Good point regarding the mass of this body more likely putting it in the rogue planet vs. brown dwarf category. It appears the mass threshold for deuterium fusion is not precise and is more of a rule of thumb.  

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_giant:

 The 13 Jupiter mass (MJ) cutoff is a rule of thumb rather than something of precise physical significance. Larger objects will burn most of their deuterium and smaller ones will burn only a little, and the 13 MJ value is somewhere in between. The amount of deuterium burnt depends not only on mass but also on the composition of the planet, especially on the amount of helium and deuterium present.[5]

 Yes, comets travel at very high speeds, but so do all the other bodies in space.  A comet's trajectory can be accurately projected for a rendezvous with a spacecraft, until/unless it comes close to the sun which may change its trajectory.  After a close encounter with the sun (if the comet survives) the trajectory will stabilize and can be recalculated. In any case, it is an impressive feat to land a probe on a comet.

Comets are significant in a few ways.  They contain information that sheds light on the formation of our solar system.  Many scientists believe that comets colliding with the Earth during its formation brought much of the water we have to our planet. There are also theories that comets may have brought life or the building blocks of life to the Earth since organic molecules have been detected in them.

 Astronomers detected an exploding star in the M82 "Cigar" galaxy. It is most likely a Type Ia supernova, but yet to be confirmed. Type Ia supernovas are created when a white dwarf star collects so much matter from a neighbor that it becomes unstable, collapses upon itself and explodes in very predictable manner.  

Type Ia supernovas are used as "standard candles" to measure distances to very distant galaxies and how fast they are receding from us to determine the rate of acceleration of the universe's expansion.  Since M82 is so close, this is one of the rare Type Ia supernovas that can be observed by amateur astronomers.

 Ooh, that is interesting.  CNET changed the article since my original post but didn't note their edit.  I (and CNET) stand corrected.

 No, it's the other way around. They have stopped selling the kits (to comply with demands made by the FDA) but will continue to provide analysis results.

 Here's a more technical explanation of ISON's fate.  
http://www.isoncampaign.org/potw-dec02

Bottom line is that ISON was sheared into smaller pieces as it passed through the Sun's corona.  Although some of the larger pieces could be seen exiting the corona, those pieces continued to evaporate/disintegrate (still pretty hot there) and nothing sufficiently large to observe as a comet now remains. 



















 Now behind a paywall. Any other sources?

http://earthsky.org/space/big-sun-diving-comet-ison-might-be-spectacular-in-2013

 Is the Doctor moving to the location you've selected?  If not, select a square you want the Doctor to move to.  If there are no blocks, gaps or robots in the way, once a square is selected and outlined in yellow, he will move to it.

 It's implied given that it's not feasible to determine the mobile phone habits of all children in the world.  Of more significance is the sample size and margin of error.  From the report:

 So Phil Schiller is DM'ing the OP?  Really?  I'd like to see the entire direct message thread including the OP's original message.  This is still not convincing, although I'd like it to be true. 



















 Why does this message not show up on Schiller's Twitter feed?  Looks suspicious.  Would be more credible if you posted the link to the tweet rather than an image capture. 



















 You can't direct message someone on Twitter unless they follow you (I doubt Phil Schiller follows you) or they enabled the feature to allow DMs from those who don't follow them (I doubt Phil enabled this feature). The fact that your reply has an error shows he doesn't follow you.  Let's see your original DM to Phil where you called him out for saying Black Knight.

 Ok, I suspected this might not be the F, A, C, E musical notes. Many of your comments motivated me to analyze the notes since I don't have perfect (or even decent) pitch.  See this image for a visual of my analysis: http://i.imgur.com/O8JwHHK.png

Thanks to scottjenson for the Facetime ringtone which I used for this analysis.  

First I copied the ringtone into Garageband to visualize the notes in the time domain.  I suspected the first two notes were different from the rest in timing and pitch (maybe the F and A?).  Garageband showed me the timing of the first two is different, but of course nothing about pitch.  

Now to the frequency domain.  I downloaded a free app called iSpectrum which analyzes sounds played in real time through an audio input to your Mac.  I then played the Facetime ringtone and adjusted iSpectrum to focus on the frequency range from 1.0 kHz to 2.6 kHz.  I used the waterfall display where audio amplitudes (highlighted in magenta) are plotted as a function of frequency in the horizontal axis and time in the vertical axis (similar to what sonar operators use).  You can see I played the ringtone six times.  The magenta highlighted areas on the left are the first two notes (short in duration) and the highlighted areas on the right are the note pairs for the remainder of the ringtone (longer in duration). 

Unfortunately, the frequency resolution is not very good.  However, it's good enough to see that the first two notes are around 1.6 kHz while the trailing pairs of notes are around 2.45 kHz (+/- 100 Hz). 

I then went to the phy.mtu.edu site to see how musical notes map into frequencies.  I could not find any F notes that are close to 1.6 kHz nor could I find any C notes that are close to 2.4 - 2.5 kHz.  

My conclusions are 

* The Facetime ringtone notes do not spell FACE
* I'm spending way too much time on this

I'm out.

 I assume you're referring to the statement: 
 There is a bit of a discrepancy regarding what to call the planet, as some astronomers demand that the definition of planet be considered a mass that is tethered to a sun.

The article is not well written.  I think the author should have stated that being tethered to a sun is one of the requirements some astronomers believe a planet should satisfy.
 



















 Thanks hokie_u2 - that is helpful.  

I don't agree with Tyson's tweet "Mysteries of #Gravity: Why we enjoy a SciFi film set in make-believe space more than we enjoy actual people set in real space."

I've thoroughly enjoyed actual people set in real space over the years including the Moon landing, Felix Baumgartner skydiving from 128 kft (almost space) and Cmdr. Hadfield performing Space Oddity from the ISS, to name a few.  Knowing it's real makes it that much more interesting and enjoyable.

 Why make this comment on this post?  Seems like my post on r/apple might be a more appropriate subreddit.  

But since you commented, I'm a long time Apple consumer and happy with their products but I'm not their PR.  Believe me, I would love Apple to pay me for my comments, but no luck.  

Regarding posting to two threads quickly, I do that all the time.  It has nothing to do with pretending - it is due to the limited time I have to review reddit and make posts.

 I was 12th in line at my local AT T store and had no trouble getting a 32 GB Space Gray, very efficient operation.  They only carried Space Gray (no Gold or White) but they appeared to have many more in stock.

 The DJI Phantom is a good prosumer entry level quadcopter for very light weight cameras (e.g. GoPro).  To get decent arial footage, I recommend you get a gimbal to stabilize the image.  Although it's a bit of a hack, the Zenmuse H3-2D gimbal works well with the Phantom.  Realize that this can get expensive pretty quickly - what is your budget?

 Although not confirmed by Apple, WSJ's AllThingsD has confirmed the Mavericks release.

 I'm not sure, but it may have to do with the presence of water/ice on Mars and the possibility of finding some evidence of life on Mars.  The chances of finding signs of life on Phobos would be much smaller.

 If you're referring to its odd shape, it's not Phobos' fault.  There is something called the "potato radius" above which objects in the universe become sufficiently massive to form a sphere.  That radius is ~200 km for icy objects and ~300 km for rocky ones.  Phobos has a radius of only 11 km, so it has no hope of becoming spherical.

 Airplay is not related to networks so an "Airplay-app" doesn't make sense, unless I'm not getting your question.  Airplay is an Apple app supported by newer Macs and iOS devices that allows you to send whatever you are viewing on the device to your AppleTV and view it on your TV (known as mirroring).  

For older Macs that don't support Airplay, I use AirParrot ($9.99 US) to perform the same function. Doesn't perform quite as well as Airplay (likely due to running on an older Mac) but it gets the job done.

 I hadn't heard about Bluetooth Low Energy technology until this article. As I was reading, it hit me: BLE would be perfect for the iWatch (or whatever Apple chooses to call their wrist-worn personal device).  This revelation assumes that Apple will not stream music from the iWatch or place other high data rate requirements on the device.  

Below are the paragraphs from the article that got me thinking:
The tradeoffs of choosing BLE over standard Bluetooth are that BLE only supports very low data rates, so you wont be streaming audio via BLE any time soon  but you can send small files if youre creative, and it works extremely well for small data packets sent from sensors.

Devices built with energy efficiency in mind can achieve battery lives of several years running off coin-cell batteries like the CR2540. This makes them ideal for wireless devices that stay in one place and would be annoying to recharge.

 Very close to the Newton.  The circular shape on the watch face would suggest the Newton.  But 1) the circle on the face in the ad is proportionally larger than the Newton's, 2) the watch face in the ad is missing the bezel that surrounds the Newton's watch face and 3) the watchband in the ad does not taper outward to match the size of the watch as the Newton's band does.  This looks like a 6th gen square nano with a different watch face applied, possibly for obscuration?

 Yep, that's the problem - your density is way too low.  A neutron star has a density of between 3.710^17 and 5.910^17 kg/m^3, which is about 14 orders of magnitude higher than the density you're using.  The material about to compress into a black hole would have an even higher density than a neutron star. Try the neutron star density and see what radius you get. 



















 Where did you get that density? 



















 I'm not sure what density you assumed, but your radius looks way to large to be the minimum radius required to form a black hole.  You may have used the density of iron that we observe here on Earth.  However in the process of forming a black hole, iron atoms are highly compressed so that the nuclei are nearly in contact with each other.  This is a form of iron that is many orders of magnitude more dense than what we observe on Earth.  The much higher density allows the minimum radius for black hole formation to be much smaller than your estimate.

 That's pretty creative, except it violates one of the main design features of a manhole cover - they are usually circular so they cannot accidentally fall into the hole they're covering.  Any other shape, including this one I think, will allow the cover to fall into the hole if correctly (or incorrectly depending on your point of view) oriented.

 The study found that two long wavelength (infrared) photons with the same wavelength striking the retina about the same time can be perceived as one photon with half that wavelength and therefore in the visible range.  So it would *look* like normal visible light.  The color would depend on the wavelength of the two infrared photons.

 Good work sto-ifics42.  Are you an engineer by chance?
 



















 Your eyes don't see ultraviolet (UV) light and this frequency is most damaging to your retina since there is much higher energy per photon. Yes the visible light (along with UV) from the sun is substantially dimmed by haze and reducing the time looking at the sun lowers the risk, but damage can be done to your eyes before you know it as the haze subtly clears. You might be safe but do you feel lucky?   



















 You're walking a very fine line of safety with your eyesight. 



















 Estes FTW!  I had many enjoyable launches and (more than I would like to admit) crashes using Estes rockets. The real crowd pleaser during my 7th grade rocket club was my Estes Saturn V rocket with 4 engines.  Unfortunately only two engines ignited, and even more unfortunately the ones that ignited were not diagonally opposed but adjacent engines.  The result was a launch that went from vertical to horizontal then started dipping downward, ending with a parachute ejection into the ground.  I will not forget the applause to this day and that was 44 years ago.

 Here's CNET's take on why the auction was terminated: 

http://www.cnet.com/news/alleged-iphone-6-prototype-ebay-auction-ends-with-no-sale/

TL;DR 
CNET speculates Apple asked for or demanded the return of the phone and the seller complied.  



















 The "prototype iPhone 6" reached a peak bid of $100,100.  I revisited the site around 5 pm PDT on Oct 6 and the item was no longer available ... two days before the auction was to have ended. The seller must've pulled the phone off the market.  Sounds pretty suspicious. 



















 Interesting, just went back to the site and the item is no longer available ... two days before the auction was to have ended.  Sounds like the guy pulled it off the market.  Sounds even more suspicious now.

 After a little reading it appears the most currently favored cosmological model for the universe's expansion is the Lambda-CDM model where Cold Dark Matter and Dark Energy dominate the energy-density of our universe (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model). This model appears to support observations that our universe's expansion is accelerating, although I can't determine what the model predicts for the end state of the universe, but it does not support a Big Rip as you indicated.  However, if the acceleration of the universe's expansion is left unchecked, it would appear the Lambda-CDM theory model is inconsistent with the theory proposed by Dr. Padilla and the resulting Big Crunch.  Am I missing something here? 



















 I thought it was an interesting theory, but I'm dubious. The theory Dr. Padilla describes directly contradicts the generally accepted theory that the universe's expansion is accelerating and the end result will be a Big Rip (where even subatomic particles are torn apart due to the expansion of space) rather than a Big Crunch. 



















 Comment by Mr. Rhodes:
 "We've shown time and again that if there's a counterterrorism threat, we'll take direct action against that threat if necessary."

He must've meant terrorism threat.

 This is a result of particle/wave duality.  Quantum theory says that energy carried by a field (or wave) can be broken down no further than its quantum component.  In other words, all fields have a corresponding minimum energy particle and vice versa.  It's like the difference between the electromagnetic field and the photon.  They're the same but exhibit field (wave) behavior or particle behavior depending on how they are observed.

 Question about a plot point in The Imitation Game [includes spoiler] 














 When Turing finally gets his decryption machine to work, he realizes that he cannot use the intelligence it provides without revealing his team's success to the Germans. So he tells his team they cannot reveal their success to anyone, even to his boss Commander Denniston. He then decides to go around his boss to the head of MI6, Stewart Menzies with the information.

How does Turing and the team continue to use the machine to decrypt German messages while keeping this fact secret from Commander Denniston who was intently interested in the team's progress and gave them one month to complete their task?

 Several theories have been proposed but we don't know yet. It's one of the unknowns that keeps astronomers and particle physicists striving for an answer.

 The star passed through the Oort cloud at a distance of about 51,000 astronomical units (A.U.) from our Sun, very far beyond Neptune's orbit. Neptune is only 30 A.U. from the Sun (Earth is 1 A.U. from the Sun).  That huge separation combined with the star's small mass translates to its gravity having a negligible effect on Neptune's orbit.

 Yes, but it is rarely a pristine reflection so the reflected signal does not completely cancel but usually partially cancels the primary signal. Also there are usually many signals from several reflection sources so the cancellation is highly position dependent and it gets complicated very quickly.   

WiFi is usually a 2.4 or 5 GHz RF signal so it bounces off of anything that conducts, like metal used in building materials.  It can also partially reflect off of and be partially absorbed by other surfaces like walls, floors, ceilings and objects in homes.  



















 The low signal areas are generally caused by a combination of 1) blockage of the WiFi signal by materials that attenuate or reflect the signal and 2) partial/full cancellation by the WiFi signal as it destructively interferes with a reflected version of itself or other RF sources. 

Predicting the RF pattern caused by the many attenuation, reflection and interference sources in a home is a very difficult thing to do, which is why measurement is appealing.

 The graphic shows planets (one dot per planet) discovered over time, initially in 5 year increments and later in 1 year increments when the discovery rate picks up.  The vertical axis is the planet's mass relative to the Earth's mass and the horizontal axis is the time it takes the planet to make one orbit around its star (i.e. the planet's year) relative to an Earth year.  The initial discoveries (dark blue dots) are planets within our solar system and the later discoveries are outside of our solar system.

 Thanks for the update. That's a relief, but sure hope we're able to see the video from the 1st stage tomorrow, assuming they launch. 



















 Yeah, they reported an avionics issue earlier and it's not clear it was resolved when the range tracking issue was reported.  But they clearly cited the range tracking issue as the reason for the abort.  Hopefully we'll hear more on this. 




 Todays launch of Falcon 9 rocket carrying DSCOVR spacecraft was scrubbed at T-2:26 due to a range tracking issue.  














 Next opportunities are Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Monday launch would be at 6:07 pm EST.

 Yes, that point is (indirectly) confirmed at NASA's DSCOVR site:

http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/dscovr-offering-a-new-view-of-the-solar-wind/index.html 



















 Summary from Wikipedia: L1, L2 and L3 are normally unstable but semi-stable halo (or Lissajous) orbits around the Lagrangian points do exist.  Since these are not perfectly stable, small amounts of thrust for station keeping are required to maintain these orbits over long periods. For most spacecraft, the preferred amplitude of the Lissajous orbit around Earth-Sun L1 is 62,000 to 124,000 miles.  This keeps the spacecraft off the direct line between the Sun and Earth and reduces solar interference when antennas on Earth are directed at the spacecraft for communication.  

I assume that since since spacecraft near L1 follow fairly sizable orbits around the point, there is plenty of room for many spacecraft to occupy those orbits. 

Answer to bonus question: Either "Lagrange point" or "Lagrangian point" are correct, but Lagrange is directed to Lagrangian in Wikipedia.

 I understand the repetition of an article being a reason for removing a submission. However the first link was to a Scientific American article which references the paper. I thought a valid submission needed to link directly to a peer-reviewed in which the paper is published - Scientific American is not a peer-reviewed journal.  Has that rule changed?  Isn't a link to the original peer-reviewed journal a better reference to the topic?

It presents a strong ecological message and has decent effects for its time (1972).  Loved the personification of and interaction between the drones Huey, Dewey and Louie.

 From JPL's Dawn website: 
 The three principal scientific drivers for the mission are first that it captures the earliest moments in the origin of the solar system enabling us to understand the conditions under which these objects [minor planets] formed. Second, Dawn determines the nature of the building blocks from which the terrestrial planets formed, improving our understanding of this formation. Finally, it contrasts the formation and evolution of two small planets that followed very different evolutionary paths so that we understand what controls that evolution.

 I don't think the mask does any focusing.  At 3:45 into the video, Professor Merrifield says "... by the time you get to the hard x-ray end and gamma ray end of things, nothing you can do will focus the light effectively ... All the mask does is throw a shadow."  So the mask only tells you what direction each x-ray or gamma ray point source is coming from.  They must use some sort of deconvolution algorithm that processes the multiple copies of the overlaid/shifted mask shadows striking the sensor to determine the position of each source.  I imagine without the ability to focus, the telescope's resolution is limited by the sensor's pixel size and is not very high.

 I e-mailed Nomorobo with my question about their business model and they responded quickly:

 Thanks for asking, 
 
 Our business model is based on licensing our blacklist data to carriers. The incoming call data from Nomorobo users powers the detection algorithm.
 
 That being said, your personal data is never shared with anyone else. It's only used to detect when one number is calling LOTS of consumers. Then Nomorobo knows to blacklist it.

Sounds like a credible business model.  I signed up and it was a fairly easy process. 



















 That sounds like a great service (it won the FTC Robocall Challenge).  But I wonder what their business model is.  Are the users the product?

 When you get your watch, open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone, go to Privacy, select Motion   Fitness, then toggle off Heart Rate monitoring.   



















 Apple was very careful about power conservation in designing the Apple Watch.  The Watch activates infra-red LEDs to measure heart rate during normal (non workout) activity which requires additional power and reduces battery life.  Apple probably made a trade-off between battery life and how often heart rate is needed during normal activity and arrived at 10 minutes as the balance.  Still, it would be nice if the user could set the heart rate sample interval.   




 Rosetta team proposes ending mission by landing on comet 67P. 


































 Yeah, it does seem odd.  During workouts the green LEDs stay on continually even though they are sampling heart rate every 10 seconds.  It may be that the sample window is 10 seconds long but every 10 seconds the watch repeats the sample so the entire timeline is filled with sampling, it's just updated every 10 seconds.  

I have found that if I forget to end a workout and accidentally leave the green LEDs on, the battery drain is significant.  The only times I have run out of power in less than a day is when I've forgotten to end a workout. 



















 Regarding your statement
 I agree that if it's inaccurate that this would be a wise move. However, I do not see why this would be the case if we are relying on the heart rate sensor during work out.

Your first sentence makes sense, but the second sentence implies the heart rate sensor used during normal activity is the same as the one used during a workout.  This is not the case.  The heart rate sensor used during normal activity is a pair of infra-red LEDs that sample heart rate every 10 minutes while the sensor for workouts uses green LEDs to measure heart rate every 10 seconds.  The latter method is designed to be more reliable in measuring heart rate than the first at the expense of drawing more power from the battery.

Edit: Correction that the infra-red LEDs are not passive - they emit infra-red energy that is detected by the same photodiodes used to detect the green LED energy. 




 Apple says Watch OS 1.0.1 attempts to record heart rate every ten minutes, but wont if arm is moving.
